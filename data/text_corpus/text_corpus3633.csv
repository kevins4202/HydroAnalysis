enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr process performance by aerobic granular sludge ags with synthetic wastewater process performance granule stability and characteristics as well as microbial community of a seawater adapted ags system were observed in seawater conditions strong and stable granules formed with an svi5 of 20 ml g and a lower abrasion coefficient than freshwater adapted granules complete anaerobic uptake of acetate anaerobic phosphate release of 59 5 4 0 mg l po4 3 p 0 35 mg p mg hac and an aerobic p uptake rate of 3 1 0 2 mg p g vss h were achieved the dominant phosphate accumulating organisms pao were the same as for freshwater based aerobic granular sludge systems with a very high enrichment of ca accumulibacter phosphatis clade i and complete absence of glycogen accumulating organisms the effect of osmotic downshocks was tested by replacing influent seawater based medium by demineralized water based medium a temporary decrease of the salinity in the reactor led to a decreased phosphate removal activity while it also induced a rapid release of cod by the sludge up to 45 5 1 7 mg cod g vss this is most likely attributed to the release of osmolytes by the cells recovery of activity was immediately after restoring the seawater feeding this work shows that functioning of aerobic granular sludge in seawater conditions is as stable as in freshwater

can be removed in a single process step liu and tay 2004 arrojo et al 2004 de kreuk et al 2005 this technology has successfully been introduced at full scale for domestic wastewater which predominantly contains low levels of salinity freshwater pronk et al 2015a municipal wastewater can also contain high fractions of seawater due to intrusion of seawater or saline groundwater in the sewer system industrial activity or use of seawater for toilet flushing lefebvre and moletta 2006 sefelnasr and sherif 2014 liu et al 2016 knowledge about the impact of seawater on the ags process is therefore essential for maintaining good process performance some crucial aspects for a maintaining a stable effluent quality from the ags process are nitrification and enhanced biological phosphate removal ebpr there is already a substantial body of literature on the effect of salinity on nitrogen conversions dinçer and kargi 1999 figueroa et al 2008 corsino et al 2016 gonzalez silva et al 2016 li et al 2017 however literature on the effect of seawater on ebpr is lacking the effect of saline wastewater has been studied in either nacl supplemented wastewater processes or in nacl based enrichment cultures of ca accumulibacter phosphatis intrasungkha et al 1999 welles et al 2015 wang et al 2018 saline conditions due to nacl in ags systems leads to nitrite accumulation which leads to toxicity to polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao bassin et al 2011 suppression of nitrification decreased the effect of nacl salinity but still led to a decrease in pao activity at concentrations of 33 g l nacl which is a similar salinity to seawater pronk et al 2014 studies on ca accumulibacter phosphatis enrichments observed an increase in maintenance requirements and a decrease in anaerobic cod uptake and aerobic phosphate uptake welles et al 2014 2015 ebpr in seawater was unsuccessful in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and also shown to be problematic for ags in high saline domestic wastewater vallet et al 2009 thwaites et al 2018 the reasons for failure were not reported successful ebpr in an ags system in seawater conditions has not been reported yet therefore we focused on the stability and effect of seawater based biological phosphorus removal in aerobic granular sludge salinity levels in full scale wastewater treatment plants are prone to fluctuations due to e g rainfall situations rainwater has low concentrations of chlorides 1 0 mg l and low conductivity 20 30 μs cm which is even in the range of demineralized water thomas and greene 1993 valsecchi et al 1997 the effect of sudden exposure of seawater adapted aerobic granules to salinity variations is therefore of great importance for maintaining a stable process operation in this study we characterized the ebpr process performance stability granule characteristics and microbial community of a seawater adapted ags system the goal of the study is to assess the impact of seawater on ca accumulibacter phosphatis in a seawater based ags system we tested the effect of salinity variations on the biological removal of phosphorus 2 materials methods 2 1 reactor operation a 3 0 l bubble column 5 6 cm diameter was operated as a sequencing batch reactor sbr the inoculation source was nereda sludge from wastewater treatment plant utrecht the netherlands which was fed with municipal wastewater the granules were physically crushed prior to inoculation the temperature was controlled at 20 c ph was controlled at 7 0 0 1 by dosing either 1 m naoh or 1 m hcl dissolved oxygen do was controlled at 3 7 mg l o2 50 saturation the average sludge retention time srt was 20 days which was controlled by non selective sludge removal the reactor was operated over a period of 700 days reactor cycles had a length of 240 min consisting of 60 min anaerobic plug flow feeding 170 min aeration 5 min settling and 5 min effluent withdrawal the feed of 1500 ml consisted of 1200 ml artificial seawater instant ocean final concentration 35 g l an overview of its concentrations is given in atkinson and bingman 1997 150 ml of medium a and 150 ml of medium b medium a contained 57 2 mm sodium acetate trihydrate medium b contained 42 8 mm nh4cl 4 2 mm k2hpo4 2 1 mm kh2po4 and 10 ml l trace elements solution similar to vishniac and santer 1957 but using 2 2 mg l znso4 7h2o instead of 22 mg l pronk et al 2015b 2017 the combination of these feed streams led to influent concentrations of 366 mg l cod 60 mg l nh4 n and 9 3 mg l po4 3 p electrical conductivity of the influent was equal to 40 ms cm 2 2 osmotic shocks in reactor osmotic shocks were introduced into the reactor by replacing the 1200 ml of influent artificial seawater by demineralized water after one cycle the influent demineralized water was replaced again by artificial seawater the 150 ml of medium a and medium b remained the same during each cycle giving the same concentrations of nutrients in the influent due to the anaerobic plug flow feeding followed by aerobic mixing there was a difference in the salinity that was experienced by the aerobic granules this led to the following cycles of conductivity as experienced by the granules table 1 the differences in conductivity are rather high which is due to the batch wise feeding of the reactor system 2 3 acetate uptake rate batch test granules were taken from the reactor at the end of the aeration phase day 675 and 676 of operation equal amounts of granules were divided over flasks with 200 ml working volume filled with either filtered effluent or demineralized water all of the flasks were buffered at ph 7 0 0 1 with a 4 0 mm hepes 4 2 hydroxyethyl 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer and sparged with n2 gas prior to adding the granular sludge a spike of acetate was added up to a final concentration of 200 mg l after which samples were taken for a period of 60 min all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride filter their respective masses were registered to compensate for mass decrease in calculations the amount of biomass was determined by filtering the granules at the end of the test washing with demineralized water to remove salts drying for 24 h at 105 c and incinerating for 2 h at 550 c all tests were done in duplicate 2 4 cod release batch test granules were taken from the reactor at the start of the aeration phase day 680 of operation equal amounts of granules were divided over four flasks with 100 ml working volume filled with either filtered effluent or demineralized water all of these flasks were sparged with compressed air prior to adding the granular sludge samples were taken for a period of 60 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm pvdf filter their respective masses were registered to compensate for mass decrease in calculations the amount of biomass was determined by filtering the granules at the end of the test washing with demineralized water to remove salts drying for 24 h at 105 c and incinerating for 2 h at 550 c all tests were done in duplicate 2 5 analytical methods concentrations of phosphate were measured on a thermo fisher gallery discrete analyzer thermo fisher scientific waltham usa chemical oxygen demand cod was measured using hach lange cod 1414 kits on a dr2800 spectrophotometer samples were diluted accordingly prior to measurement to prevent chlorine interference acetate was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc with an aminex hpx 87h column from biorad coupled to an ri and uv detector using 0 01m phosphoric acid as eluent strength characterization was carried out as described in de graaff et al 2018 2 6 granule morphology pictures of whole granules were taken with a stereo zoom microscope leica microsystems ltd m205 fa germany and processed with leica microsystems qwin v3 5 1 image analysis software 2 7 fluorescent in situ hybridization fish the handling fixation and staining of fish samples was performed as described in bassin et al 2011 a mixture of pao462 pao651 and pao846 probes paomix was used for visualizing polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao crocetti et al 2000 a mixture of gaoq431 and gaoq989 probes gaomix was used for visualizing glycogen accumulating organisms gao crocetti et al 2002 ca accumulibacter clade i was visualized by acc i 444 and ca accumulibacter clade ii was visualized by acc ii 444 flowers et al 2009 a mixture of eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii probes was used for staining all bacteria amann et al 1990 daims et al 1999 images were taken with a zeiss axioplan 2

reactor operation seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in a 3 0 l lab scale sequencing batch operated bubble column reactor at 20 days srt and 20 c under the same conditions as usually applied in our laboratory pronk et al 2014 complete anaerobic acetate consumption was achieved along with an average anaerobic release of 59 5 4 0 mg l po4 3 p 0 35 mg p mg hac and effluent concentrations of 5 9 3 0 mg l po4 3 p fig 1 over a period of 12 months this equals a net removal of 36 5 from the influent and 91 8 removal of phosphate after anaerobic release a typical reactor cycle is shown in fig 2 from which an average biomass specific phosphorus removal rate of 3 1 0 2 mg p g vss h was measured an average concentration of 11 5 1 3 g tss l or 8 1 0 8 g vss l was present in the reactor during stable operation i e 28 ash content the effluent tss was equal to 20 3 mg l neither nitrite nor nitrate production was detected in the reactor ammonium was consumed for biomass production with a low consumption rate of 0 6 0 1 mg n g vss h 3 2 granule characteristics successful granulation from non granular inoculating sludge was achieved in seawater conditions fig 3 no filamentous outgrowth was observed and dense well settling granules were formed the average sludge volume index after 5 min svi5 equalled 20 ml g for these seawater adapted granules between days 635 680 of operation the average granule size was 1 4 mm an abrasion coefficient of 1 17 0 01 10 5 s 1 was measured for these granules compared to a value of 1 78 0 20 10 5 s 1 for granules grown in the same system on freshwater de graaff et al 2018 3 3 microbial community fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis showed the presence of polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and the absence of glycogen accumulating organisms gao in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge fig 4 a and b a high fraction of pao was observed from all bacteria that were stained with the general eubacteria probe eub338 ca accumulibacter phosphatis clade i was observed in the seawater adapted granules whereas clade ii was not observed fig 4c and d 3 4 osmotic shock the effect of an osmotic downshock on the reactor performance was assessed by replacing the influent seawater by demineralized water this resulted in a salinity decrease from 40 ms cm to 1 1 ms cm for the granular sludge during plug flow feeding and a conductivity of approximately 20 ms cm during the aerated mixed reactor period due to the 50 volume exchange ratio recovery after an osmotic shock was studied by reconnecting influent seawater after the cycle at low saline content this resulted in a salinity of 40 ms cm for the granular sludge during plug flow feeding and approximately 30 ms cm during the mixed reactor period concentrations of acetate and phosphate were measured during a regular cycle the osmotic downshock cycle and the subsequent recovery cycle these cycles of salinity shocks were performed in duplicate a representative graph is shown in fig 5 during plug flow feeding in a regular cycle at 100 salinity 40 ms cm acetate was completely consumed anaerobically after an osmotic downshock 1 1 ms cm in feed anaerobic acetate consumption was incomplete and acetate became available at the start of the aeration phase during the mixed reactor phase approx 50 salinity approx 20 ms cm the remaining acetate was completely consumed aerobically while simultaneously a limited amount of phosphate was released during the exact same time the maximal aerobic phosphate uptake decreased to 72 0 1 2 of the preceding regular cycle during the subsequent recovery cycle 100 salinity during feeding 40 ms cm acetate was completely anaerobically consumed again during the mixed reactor phase approx 75 salinity approx 30 ms cm the maximal aerobic phosphate uptake rate increased to 114 1 9 4 of the preceding regular cycle 3 5 uncoupling biological effect from hydrodynamic effect during anaerobic plug flow feeding during feeding of freshwater in a seawater based reactor there are two effects occurring simultaneously a biological effect and a hydrodynamic effect due to introduction of influent with a lower density channelling occurred resulting in a fraction of the influent bypassing the sludge blanket this was visually observed by streams of influent water appearing on top of the sludge bed fig 6 in order to separate the biological effect from this hydrodynamic effect batch tests were performed to specifically measure the change in biological performance 3 5 1 acetate uptake rate after osmotic downshock granules were taken from the reactor at the end of aeration and transferred to an anaerobic flask containing acetate in either saline reactor effluent or demineralized water samples were taken during 60 min and analysed for acetate and phosphate concentrations over time results are shown in fig 7 the biomass specific acetate uptake rates in reactor effluent and demineralized water were similar 18 9 2 3 and 17 7 1 8 mg acetate g vss h respectively the anaerobic phosphate release rate increased by 12 3 0 6 in demineralized water the total release of phosphate after 60 min increased by 32 1 0 8 in freshwater compared to seawater based effluent this equals a p mol c mol ratio of 0 47 0 01 in saline reactor effluent and a p mol c mol ratio of 0 72 0 02 after an osmotic downshock in demineralized water 3 6 cod release during osmotic downshock anaerobic incubation of seawater adapted granules in demineralized water without addition of acetate led to release of cod fig 8 concentration increase of 45 5 1 7 mg cod g vss was measured after only 5 min in demineralized water and this decreased slightly over time down to 34 3 4 4 mg cod g vss after 60 min incubation in reactor effluent led to much lower release up to a low concentration of 12 1 9 4 mg cod g vss after 60 min no release of suspended solids was observed during this batch test 4 discussion 4 1 successful biological phosphorus removal in seawater this study shows that biological phosphorus removal and granulation can occur successfully under seawater conditions neither granular sludge nor conventional activated sludge have previously been reported to give stable biological removal of phosphorus from seawater based wastewater streams the results from this study demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of ca accumulibacter phosphatis to adapt to a wide range of salinities it shows its exceptional resistance to osmotic shocks and thereby also greatly contributes to increasing its range of full scale applications stable phosphate removal was measured with an aerobic removal rate of 3 1 0 2 mg p g vss h and a phosphate release of 59 5 4 0 mg p l these values are similar to freshwater based ags systems de kreuk et al 2005 the amount of phosphate release is higher than ags in an nacl based influent in which a deterioration of p release was observed at 20 g l cl with the same ca accumulibacter phosphatis clade i as present in this study pronk et al 2014 similarly in a ca accumulibacter enrichment nacl caused a decrease in phosphate uptake at 1 8 g l salinity until a complete inhibition at already 3 5 g l welles et al 2015 complete anaerobic acetate uptake was achieved in our system with the stable presence of a pao culture in absence of gao as determined by fish in ags with pure nacl acetate was still completely consumed up to 33 g l nacl but this occurred simultaneously with a shift in microbial community from pao to gao bassin et al 2011 pao enrichment studies have also shown that pao continues to anaerobically consume acetate while having a near zero p release at 2 salinity welles et al 2014 one of the differences between the latter study and our study is the choice of organic substrate acetate propionate mixture and only acetate respectively the choice for acetate instead of a mixture with propionate is commonly shown to lead to a shift towards gao lopez vazquez et al 2009 these results indicate that ca accumulibacter phosphatis is more adaptable to seawater salinity than nacl based salinity 4 2 physical properties of seawater adapted granules stable granulation was achieved in seawater based conditions resulting in low svi5 of 20 ml g and the absence of filamentous outgrowth fig 3 an essential factor was the complete anaerobic uptake of acetate the cause of filamentous outgrowth has frequently been discussed in literature moy et al 2002 mcswain et al 2004 liu and liu 2006 a major reason for their proliferation is the availability of easily degradable cod under aerobic conditions de kreuk et al 2004 val de río et al 2012 our system does not contain these aerobic feast conditions due to complete anaerobic consumption of acetate which is the reason that filamentous outgrowth is absent strength characterization indicated that seawater adapted granules have a lower abrasion coefficient than freshwater adapted granules 1 17 0 01 10 5 s 1 and 1 78 0 20 10 5 s 1 respectively de graaff et al 2018 these results are supported by li et al 2017 who observed that a high shear cohesion test led to less abrasion in granules that were grown in seawater based wastewater than those that were grown in less saline wastewater moreover they reported an increased concentration of ca2 and mg2 cations in the sludge which could help bridging of negatively charged functional groups in the polysaccharide fraction of the biofilm matrix interestingly changes in the composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps can also be the result of adaptation to seawater increases in protein content hydrophobicity and eps concentration have been reported when ags was cultivated in higher salinity wastewater which could be linked to the increase in biofilm strength wang et al 2015 corsino et al 2017 campo et al 2018 adaptation of sugar residues in the eps was also reported in response to higher salinity in both anaerobic and aerobic granular sludge gagliano et al 2018 de graaff et al 2019 using improved eps analysis techniques the interaction between salinity and eps composition could be clarified in the future seviour at al 2019 4 3 difference between nacl and seawater the results from this study signify the importance of distinguishing salinity from nacl and from seawater this distinction is often not clearly made in literature discussions activated sludge studies on ebpr yielded decreased phosphate uptake rates when nacl was added to the medium abu ghararah and sherrard 1993 intrasungkha et al 1999 welles et al 2015 decrease in phosphate removal was described in aerobic granular sludge at an nacl concentration of 33 g l as well bassin et al 2011 pronk et al 2014 the observed shift in microbial community from pao to gao in nacl salinity was not observed in the seawater based reactor it is clear that the effect of nacl salinity should not be used as predictive for seawater salinity a major reason for good phosphorus removal in seawater systems could be due to the higher na k ratio in seawater millero et al 2008 presence of sufficient amounts of potassium cations is required for the functioning of na k pumps required for osmotic stabilization of the cytoplasm armstrong 2003 moreover availability of potassium plays a crucial role in the metabolism of paos brdjanovic et al 1996 4 4 release of osmolytes during osmotic downshock during osmotic downshock of seawater adapted granules a remarkably high cod concentration 45 5 1 7 mg cod g vss was measured in the liquid phase fig 8 this cod is likely to be ascribed to the release of osmolytes tsapis and kepes 1977 fischel et al 1993 roberts 2005 osmolytes are accumulated intracellularly to overcome high osmotic pressure and protect dna and proteins from denaturation da costa et al 1998 roeβler and müller 2001 during a hypo osmotic shock these organic molecules can be released which has been used as a bioprocess for the production of ectoine sauer and galinski 1998 interestingly ca accumulibacter phosphatis is mainly reported in nature in estuaries which led to the suggestion that they contain osmolytes kunin et al 2008 peterson et al 2008 these environments have a natural change from saline to brackish water due to tidal variations along with a variation in anaerobic nutrient supply and aerobic starvation periods watson et al 2019 however the link between adaptation to variable salinity and type of osmolytes has not yet been made in neither environmental science literature nor wastewater engineering literature the advantages of osmolytes to alleviate osmotic stress have frequently been studied for other technologies such as anaerobic digestion for example addition of glycine betaine α glutamate and β glutamate to anaerobic biomass decreases inhibition of methanogenesis by salinity vyrides and stuckey 2017 it was also found that addition of glutamic acid aspartic acid gelatine and tryptone decreases osmotic stress in anaerobic granular sludge sudmalis et al 2018 however due to the wide variety of osmolytes the positive effect of specific osmolyte dosing in anaerobic sludge cannot directly be copied to ebpr sludge understanding the role of osmolytes in the ebpr process is of greatest importance for improving this technology basis has been laid in this study but further research is required to completely comprehend the fascinating flexibility of ca accumulibacter phosphatis metabolism to variations in salinity 5 conclusions stable granulation and biological phosphorus removal can occur in seawater based aerobic granular sludge with an aerobic p uptake rate of 3 1 0 2 mg p g vss h ca accumulibacter clade i is adaptable to both freshwater and seawater seawater adapted ags releases 45 5 1 7 mg cod g vss during a salinity downshock which is likely ascribed to release of osmolytes salinity impact due to nacl or seawater is very different on

reactor operation seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge was cultivated in a 3 0 l lab scale sequencing batch operated bubble column reactor at 20 days srt and 20 c under the same conditions as usually applied in our laboratory pronk et al 2014 complete anaerobic acetate consumption was achieved along with an average anaerobic release of 59 5 4 0 mg l po4 3 p 0 35 mg p mg hac and effluent concentrations of 5 9 3 0 mg l po4 3 p fig 1 over a period of 12 months this equals a net removal of 36 5 from the influent and 91 8 removal of phosphate after anaerobic release a typical reactor cycle is shown in fig 2 from which an average biomass specific phosphorus removal rate of 3 1 0 2 mg p g vss h was measured an average concentration of 11 5 1 3 g tss l or 8 1 0 8 g vss l was present in the reactor during stable operation i e 28 ash content the effluent tss was equal to 20 3 mg l neither nitrite nor nitrate production was detected in the reactor ammonium was consumed for biomass production with a low consumption rate of 0 6 0 1 mg n g vss h 3 2 granule characteristics successful granulation from non granular inoculating sludge was achieved in seawater conditions fig 3 no filamentous outgrowth was observed and dense well settling granules were formed the average sludge volume index after 5 min svi5 equalled 20 ml g for these seawater adapted granules between days 635 680 of operation the average granule size was 1 4 mm an abrasion coefficient of 1 17 0 01 10 5 s 1 was measured for these granules compared to a value of 1 78 0 20 10 5 s 1 for granules grown in the same system on freshwater de graaff et al 2018 3 3 microbial community fluorescence in situ hybridization fish analysis showed the presence of polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao and the absence of glycogen accumulating organisms gao in seawater adapted aerobic granular sludge fig 4 a and b a high fraction of pao was observed from all bacteria that were stained with the general eubacteria probe eub338 ca accumulibacter phosphatis clade i was observed in the seawater adapted granules whereas clade ii was not observed fig 4c and d 3 4 osmotic shock the effect of an osmotic downshock on the reactor performance was assessed by replacing the influent seawater by demineralized water this resulted in a salinity decrease from 40 ms cm to 1 1 ms cm for the granular sludge during plug flow feeding and a conductivity of approximately 20 ms cm during the aerated mixed reactor period due to the 50 volume exchange ratio recovery after an osmotic shock was studied by reconnecting influent seawater after the cycle at low saline content this resulted in a salinity of 40 ms cm for the granular sludge during plug flow feeding and approximately 30 ms cm during the mixed reactor period concentrations of acetate and phosphate were measured during a regular cycle the osmotic downshock cycle and the subsequent recovery cycle these cycles of salinity shocks were performed in duplicate a representative graph is shown in fig 5 during plug flow feeding in a regular cycle at 100 salinity 40 ms cm acetate was completely consumed anaerobically after an osmotic downshock 1 1 ms cm in feed anaerobic acetate consumption was incomplete and acetate became available at the start of the aeration phase during the mixed reactor phase approx 50 salinity approx 20 ms cm the remaining acetate was completely consumed aerobically while simultaneously a limited amount of phosphate was released during the exact same time the maximal aerobic phosphate uptake decreased to 72 0 1 2 of the preceding regular cycle during the subsequent recovery cycle 100 salinity during feeding 40 ms cm acetate was completely anaerobically consumed again during the mixed reactor phase approx 75 salinity approx 30 ms cm the maximal aerobic phosphate uptake rate increased to 114 1 9 4 of the preceding regular cycle 3 5 uncoupling biological effect from hydrodynamic effect during anaerobic plug flow feeding during feeding of freshwater in a seawater based reactor there are two effects occurring simultaneously a biological effect and a hydrodynamic effect due to introduction of influent with a lower density channelling occurred resulting in a fraction of the influent bypassing the sludge blanket this was visually observed by streams of influent water appearing on top of the sludge bed fig 6 in order to separate the biological effect from this hydrodynamic effect batch tests were performed to specifically measure the change in biological performance 3 5 1 acetate uptake rate after osmotic downshock granules were taken from the reactor at the end of aeration and transferred to an anaerobic flask containing acetate in either saline reactor effluent or demineralized water samples were taken during 60 min and analysed for acetate and phosphate concentrations over time results are shown in fig 7 the biomass specific acetate uptake rates in reactor effluent and demineralized water were similar 18 9 2 3 and 17 7 1 8 mg acetate g vss h respectively the anaerobic phosphate release rate increased by 12 3 0 6 in demineralized water the total release of phosphate after 60 min increased by 32 1 0 8 in freshwater compared to seawater based effluent this equals a p mol c mol ratio of 0 47 0 01 in saline reactor effluent and a p mol c mol ratio of 0 72 0 02 after an osmotic downshock in demineralized water 3 6 cod release during osmotic downshock anaerobic incubation of seawater adapted granules in demineralized water without addition of acetate led to release of cod fig 8 concentration increase of 45 5 1 7 mg cod g vss was measured after only 5 min in demineralized water and this decreased slightly over time down to 34 3 4 4 mg cod g vss after 60 min incubation in reactor effluent led to much lower release up to a low concentration of 12 1 9 4 mg cod g vss after 60 min no release of suspended solids was observed during this batch test 4 discussion 4 1 successful biological phosphorus removal in seawater this study shows that biological phosphorus removal and granulation can occur successfully under seawater conditions neither granular sludge nor conventional activated sludge have previously been reported to give stable biological removal of phosphorus from seawater based wastewater streams the results from this study demonstrate the remarkable flexibility of ca accumulibacter phosphatis to adapt to a wide range of salinities it shows its exceptional resistance to osmotic shocks and thereby also greatly contributes to increasing its range of full scale applications stable phosphate removal was measured with an aerobic removal rate of 3 1 0 2 mg p g vss h and a phosphate release of 59 5 4 0 mg p l these values are similar to freshwater based ags systems de kreuk et al 2005 the amount of phosphate release is higher than ags in an nacl based influent in which a deterioration of p release was observed at 20 g l cl with the same ca accumulibacter phosphatis clade i as present in this study pronk et al 2014 similarly in a ca accumulibacter enrichment nacl caused a decrease in phosphate uptake at 1 8 g l salinity until a complete inhibition at already 3 5 g l welles et al 2015 complete anaerobic acetate uptake was achieved in our system with the stable presence of a pao culture in absence of gao as determined by fish in ags with pure nacl acetate was still completely consumed up to 33 g l nacl but this occurred simultaneously with a shift in microbial community from pao to gao bassin et al 2011 pao enrichment studies have also shown that pao continues to anaerobically consume acetate while having a near zero p release at 2 salinity welles et al 2014 one of the differences between the latter study and our study is the choice of organic substrate acetate propionate mixture and only acetate respectively the choice for acetate instead of a mixture with propionate is commonly shown to lead to a shift towards gao lopez vazquez et al 2009 these results indicate that ca accumulibacter phosphatis is more adaptable to seawater salinity than nacl based salinity 4 2 physical properties of seawater adapted granules stable granulation was achieved in seawater based conditions resulting in low svi5 of 20 ml g and the absence of filamentous outgrowth fig 3 an essential factor was the complete anaerobic uptake of acetate the cause of filamentous outgrowth has frequently been discussed in literature moy et al 2002 mcswain et al 2004 liu and liu 2006 a major reason for their proliferation is the availability of easily degradable cod under aerobic conditions de kreuk et al 2004 val de río et al 2012 our system does not contain these aerobic feast conditions due to complete anaerobic consumption of acetate which is the reason that filamentous outgrowth is absent strength characterization indicated that seawater adapted granules have a lower abrasion coefficient than freshwater adapted granules 1 17 0 01 10 5 s 1 and 1 78 0 20 10 5 s 1 respectively de graaff et al 2018 these results are supported by li et al 2017 who observed that a high shear cohesion test led to less abrasion in granules that were grown in seawater based wastewater than those that were grown in less saline wastewater moreover they reported an increased concentration of ca2 and mg2 cations in the sludge which could help bridging of negatively charged functional groups in the polysaccharide fraction of the biofilm matrix interestingly changes in the composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps can also be the result of adaptation to seawater increases in protein content hydrophobicity and eps concentration have been reported when ags was cultivated in higher salinity wastewater which could be linked to the increase in biofilm strength wang et al 2015 corsino et al 2017 campo et al 2018 adaptation of sugar residues in the eps was also reported in response to higher salinity in both anaerobic and aerobic granular sludge gagliano et al 2018 de graaff et al 2019 using improved eps analysis techniques the interaction between salinity and eps composition could be clarified in the future seviour at al 2019 4 3 difference between nacl and seawater the results from this study signify the importance of distinguishing salinity from nacl and from seawater this distinction is often not clearly made in literature discussions activated sludge studies on ebpr yielded decreased phosphate uptake rates when nacl was added to the medium abu ghararah and sherrard 1993 intrasungkha et al 1999 welles et al 2015 decrease in phosphate removal was described in aerobic granular sludge at an nacl concentration of 33 g l as well bassin et al 2011 pronk et al 2014 the observed shift in microbial community from pao to gao in nacl salinity was not observed in the seawater based reactor it is clear that the effect of nacl salinity should not be used as predictive for seawater salinity a major reason for good phosphorus removal in seawater systems could be due to the higher na k ratio in seawater millero et al 2008 presence of sufficient amounts of potassium cations is required for the functioning of na k pumps required for osmotic stabilization of the cytoplasm armstrong 2003 moreover availability of potassium plays a crucial role in the metabolism of paos brdjanovic et al 1996 4 4 release of osmolytes during osmotic downshock during osmotic downshock of seawater adapted granules a remarkably high cod concentration 45 5 1 7 mg cod g vss was measured in the liquid phase fig 8 this cod is likely to be ascribed to the release of osmolytes tsapis and kepes 1977 fischel et al 1993 roberts 2005 osmolytes are accumulated intracellularly to overcome high osmotic pressure and protect dna and proteins from denaturation da costa et al 1998 roeβler and müller 2001 during a hypo osmotic shock these organic molecules can be released which has been used as a bioprocess for the production of ectoine sauer and galinski 1998 interestingly ca accumulibacter phosphatis is mainly reported in nature in estuaries which led to the suggestion that they contain osmolytes kunin et al 2008 peterson et al 2008 these environments have a natural change from saline to brackish water due to tidal variations along with a variation in anaerobic nutrient supply and aerobic starvation periods watson et al 2019 however the link between adaptation to variable salinity and type of osmolytes has not yet been made in neither environmental science literature nor wastewater engineering literature the advantages of osmolytes to alleviate osmotic stress have frequently been studied for other technologies such as anaerobic digestion for example addition of glycine betaine α glutamate and β glutamate to anaerobic biomass decreases inhibition of methanogenesis by salinity vyrides and stuckey 2017 it was also found that addition of glutamic acid aspartic acid gelatine and tryptone decreases osmotic stress in anaerobic granular sludge sudmalis et al 2018 however due to the wide variety of osmolytes the positive effect of specific osmolyte dosing in anaerobic sludge cannot directly be copied to ebpr sludge understanding the role of osmolytes in the ebpr process is of greatest importance for improving this technology basis has been laid in this study but further research is required to completely comprehend the fascinating flexibility of ca accumulibacter phosphatis metabolism to variations in salinity 5 conclusions stable granulation and biological phosphorus removal can occur in seawater based aerobic granular sludge with an aerobic p uptake rate of 3 1 0 2 mg p g vss h ca accumulibacter clade i is adaptable to both freshwater and seawater seawater adapted ags releases 45 5 1 7 mg cod g vss during a salinity downshock which is likely ascribed to release of osmolytes salinity impact due to nacl or seawater is very different on

18166,the study demonstrated a novel anammox like process to remove high concentration ammonium using nitrate as terminal electron acceptor under fe iii fe ii cycle compared with no2 in common anammox no3 used here is more available in practice suitable for in situ removal of high concentration nh4 in a single anaerobic system the nox and fe ii produced from feammox fe iii reduction coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation subsequently react together via nox dependent fe ii oxidation to regenerate fe iii that potentially stimulates next round of feammox however these processes couldn t be lasting due to inadequate fe iii regeneration because nox is non dominant product during feammox in this study no3 was added to supplement the insufficient nox to enhance fe iii regeneration and remove nitrogen successively results showed that periodically adding nitrate caused oscillations between fe iii and fe ii in the sludge implying fe iii regeneration and consumption consequently nitrogen removal of the digester with an initial total nitrogen of 1036 7 mg l reached 90 1 after 98 day operation much higher than that of control 41 6 without no3 addition adding no3 in the digester to trigger fe iii fe ii cycle for removing ammonium is just equivalent to an anammox like process using no3 as terminal electron acceptor to oxidize nh4 graphical abstract image 1 keywords feammox no3 dependent fe ii oxidation nitrogen loss fe iii fe ii cycle 1 introduction anaerobic digestion has been widely applied as an efficient method to dispose high strength organic waste solids waters such as waste activated sludge kitchen waste food processing wastewater animal breeding wastewater and landfill leachate feng et al 2014 yang et al 2017 renou et al 2008 the digestate after anaerobic digestion frequently contains high content ammonium 500 2000 mg l which poses a great challenge for current wastewater treatment technologies wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 yang et al 2018a anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox a process confirmed in 1990s to oxidize nh4 with no2 as terminal electron acceptor nh4 no2 n2 2h2o has been applied in more than 100 full scale ammonium wastewater treatment worldwide by 2014 lackner et al 2014 but still encounters a few issues to limit its wider application autotrophic anammox bacteria is a type of slow growing microorganism with a doubling time of 11 days and is sensitive to environmental conditions such as ph salinity and organic carbon van hulle et al 2010 jin et al 2012 especially no2 used in the process is required in advance to be produced from ammonium oxidation performed by ammonium oxidizing bacteria i e partial nitrification thereby the combination of partial nitrification and anammox has been proposed for ammonium removal in two stage or one single reactors such as completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite and oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification denification paredes et al 2007 in these processes it is required to elaborately control the operating conditions to make sure the high efficiency of partial nitrification which however is quite fragile because no2 oxidation proceeds more rapidly than ammonium oxidation so that no2 rarely presents in water sinha and annachhatre 2007 feammox i e fe iii reduction coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation is a potential alternative to ammonium removal in anaerobic digesters eqs 1 3 yang et al 2012 feammox has been reported to play an important role in the nitrogen cycle in natural environments such as riparian zone ding et al 2017 marine rios del toro et al 2018 wetland shrestha et al 2009 clement et al 2005 tropical forest huang et al 2016 and paddy soil zhou et al 2016 iron reducing bacteria irb that is a typical group of dissimilatory fe iii reduction dir microorganisms capable of utilizing various electron donors to extracellularly reduce fe iii hydro oxides was found to be indispensable in feammox yang et al 2012 bao and li 2017 it was previously reported that the feammox efficiency was significantly correlated with the bacterial abundances of irb zhou et al 2016 li et al 2015 it implies that irb is likely to be directly involved in ammonium oxidation shown in fig s1 i e irb accepts electrons from ammonium and then transfers the electrons to fe iii to perform dir coupled to nh4 oxidation recently it was reported that 20 1 of total nitrogen removal was achieved when dosing fe oh 3 once in an anaerobic sludge digester with an original nitrogen content of 1375 mg l yang et al 2018a although the efficiency was not high feammox seemed to hold promise for serving as an alternative to removing high content ammonium from wastes no2 and no3 produced from feammox have reported to be capable of oxidizing fe ii to fe iii anaerobically eqs 4 and 5 termed as nox dependent fe ii oxidation ndfo picardal 2012 klueglein and kappler 2013 oshiki et al 2013 it means that fe iii is likely regenerated through feammox followed by ndfo to proceed the next round of feammox yang et al 2018b actually the fe iii regeneration is not lasting during these two processes because of the majority of nh4 being converted to n2 rather than nox yang et al 2012 which implies that continuously intermittently supplementing fe iii is required to maintain the successive feammox for nitrogen removal this could be a reason for the report of the low efficiency of nitrogen removal in the anaerobic sludge digestion with a single dosage of iron yang et al 2018a nevertheless it is unrealistic to continuously supplement fe iii in the practical application because the sludge with high content fe has been regarded as a hazardous material in some countries like china when adding no3 into the feammox system the added no3 is expected to supply the deficiency of nox produced from feammox to forward the ndfo for fe iii regeneration as a result feammox is possible to successively occur to remove ammonium if the assumption is true adding no3 to trigger ndfo and forward feammox for ammonium removal just equals to the reaction between nh4 and no3 with the condition of fe iii fe ii cycle noteworthily till now anammox is only reported in the reaction between no2 and nh4 dalsgaard et al 2005 and as far as we know only one study has been reported about feammox coupled with nitrate dependent fe ii oxidization to simultaneously convert nh4 and no3 li et al 2018 which however actually was a coupled process of feammox and anammox to further explore whether this novel nitrogen removal pathway could occur in the absence of anammox bacteria and to what extent the digestate after anaerobic digestion of municipal residual activated sludge was used as inoculation due to its high nitrogen content 1 3fe oh 3 5h nh4

electron acceptor to remove high content ammonium anaerobically under fe iii fe ii cycle in the absence of anammox bacteria no3 was supplemented into feammox system containing iron the objectives of this study were to investigate 1 effects of no3 addition on fe ii oxidation i e ndfo process 2 changes of the nitrogen and iron species during ndfo and feammox process 3 microorganisms involved in these processes a new anammox like process using no3 as terminal electron acceptor was expected to be developed for in situ removal of ammonium during anaerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the sludge slurry used as the source of nitrogen and inoculant sludge in this study was the digestate after anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge for 20 days in a municipal sewage treatment plant in dalian china the energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis of the original slurry demonstrated the existence of iron in this sludge fig s2 its content reached 722 86 mg l of which fe ii accounted for 89 5 table 1 the iron was mainly from sludge dewatering process using iron salts as coagulants 2 2 experimental setup the experiments were conducted in 300 ml conical flasks containing 250 ml diluted sludge slurry with a media the composition of media was described by mejia et al 2016 the initial properties of the diluted sludge including cod fe ii and fe iii content are listed in table 1 before the experiment the oxygen of the headspace and sludge in the bottles was removed via aerating using n2 for 30 min afterwards the flasks were sealed by the cap which was drilled two holes to connect with a biogas sampling bag and a liquid sampling pipe respectively to investigate the effect of periodical no3 addition on nh4 removal about 1 ml nano3 stock solution 1 m was added into the flasks on day 0 6 13 20 24 30 37 50 59 68 76 81 and 90 during the digestion respectively i e the final no3 concentration of each addition was 4 mm table s1 as comparison a control experiment was carried out with adding same volume of deionized water in place of nitrate solution in parallel the flasks were placed in an shaker 120 rpm in the dark at 30 c for 100 days the experiments were repeated in triplicate the experiment was operated under anaerobic condition and dissolved oxygen do was undetectable during the entire process 2 3 analysis methods volatile suspended solid vss total suspended solid tss total chemical oxygen demand tcod protein volatile fatty acids vfas including acetate propionate and butyrate methane production no2 n no3 n nh4 n total nitrogen and x ray diffraction xrd were analyzed according to previous report yang et al 2018b 2019 do was determined by a do meter modle 55 12 ysi usa liquid samples were taken in the anoxic glovebox and filtered through 0 22 μm filters fe ii and fe iii in the slurry were analyzed according to the method described by ding et al 2014 in brief 1 ml slurry was extracted immediately with 5 ml 0 5 m hcl for 2 h at room temperature then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min the fe ii and total fe of the supernatant were quantified by the ferrozine assay ding et al 2014 the amount of fe iii was calculated as the difference between total fe and fe ii all iron extractions were conducted in the anaerobic glovebox because the oxidation of fe ii by o2 in the presence of cl was fast even at very low ph value porsch and kappler 2011 microbial analysis on day 50 and 90 was conducted via high throughput 16s rdna pyrosequencing according to our previous report yang et al 2018b and rna based real time quantitative pcr analysis qpcr was further applied to identify the absolute quantity and activity of some functional genes on day 90 huang et al 2018 total bacteria were represented via quantification of the 16s rrna genes using primer set 1055f 1392r the denitrifying functional gene nosz and nitrifying bacterial amoa gene were quantified with primer sets nosz 1f nosz 2r and amoa1f amoa2r for the detection of denitrifiers and nitrifiers respectively anammox bacteria were detected using primer set amx368f amx820r and geobacteraceae acidimicrobiaceae a6 bacteria belonging to the acidimicrobiaceae family that have been considered to participate in the feammox process were targeted using primer set geo494f geo825r and acm342f 439r respectively huang et al 2016 huang and jaffé 2015 yuan et al 2016 specific primer information is shown in table s2 2 4 statistical analyses the one way analysis of variance anova was performed for statistical analyses using origin 9 0 inc originlab northampton ma statistical significance was determined by duncan s multiple range test and denoted at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndfo process during redox cycling from fig 1 a fe ii content of the control without adding nitrate remained unchanged generally during 100 day operation slightly ranging in 617 8 22 3 mg l comparatively fe ii content of the nitrate added group showed dramatic fluctuations especially after day 30 i e each addition of no3 caused a significantly p 0 05 decrease of the fe ii content and then fe ii content significantly p 0 05 increased fig 1a for example when adding 4 mm of nitrate on day 30 fe ii content dramatically decreased from 606 9 mg l to 298 2 mg l accompanied with increase of fe iii from 113 6 mg l to 419 2 mg l on day 31 afterwards fe ii increased to 379 1 mg l on day 34 and 502 7 mg l on day 36 while fe iii accordingly decreased to 340 7 mg l and 219 3 mg l in the same periods respectively fig 1a and b it was reasonably assumed that the increase of fe ii was resulted from dir using organic matters and or ammonium as electron donors thermodynamically organic matters are superior to ammonium as electron donors for the fe iii reduction li et al 2015 ding et al 2014 also found that only 0 8 2 2 of fe iii reduction was associated with feammox in paddy soils containing organic matters the changes of nox content during redox cycles are shown in fig 1c and d the results demonstrated that no3 significantly p 0 05 decreased after the addition and then no2 was detected remarkably the decrease of fe ii content was synchronous with the no3 addition and the fe ii content gradually increased with the depletion of nox for instance the added 56 mg l 4 mm no3 n dropped rapidly to 5 3 mg l after one day i e day 1 accompanied with the decrease of fe ii content from 616 6 mg l to 471 9 mg l and increase of no2 n from 0 to 13 4 mg l afterwards nox was almost depleted on day 3 while fe ii content began to rise and reached 563 mg l on day 4 together with the undetectable do in the process and the changes of nox fig 1c and d the decrease of fe ii and the increase of fe iii implied that the fe iii generation was caused by ndfo due to the no3 addition which provided the possibility for the consecutive feammox and nitrogen removal to explore the effect of no2 on fe ii oxidation in the nitrate added group the no3 n addition increased from 4 mm to 6 5 mm final concentration on day 100 to cause the further accumulation of no2 no3 n content of the nitrate added group quickly dropped from 94 6 mg l to 56 0 mg l on day 102 fig 2 a while the no2 n content increased from 1 6 mg l to 11 4 mg l fig 2b accompanied with a rapid decrease of fe ii content from 524 5 mg l to 179 8 mg l fig 2c in order to exclude the effects of no3 based ndfo and clarify the effects of no2 on fe ii additional glucose 2 mm of final concentration was added on day 102 to reduce the no3 to produce no2 as expected no3 n was almost depleted after day 104 while around 7 3 mg l no2 n was produced theoretically 2 mm glucose equivalent to 48 mm electrons can consume up 6 5 mm nitrate 32 5 mm electrons and also can increase the fe ii content via dir to the initial 524 5 mg l before no3 addition i e day 100 fig 2c however fe ii still remained at a low content after glucose addition in the nitrate added group 271 6 11 5 mg l during day 103 106 fig 2c it just indicated that fe ii oxidation with no2 occurred to consume fe ii and regenerate fe iii when no2 n content was significantly p 0 05 reduced to a quite low level about 1 0 mg l on day 107 in the nitrate added group fe ii content significantly p 0 05 increased about 399 1 mg l this illustrated that the produced no2 e g 2fe ii no3 2h 2fe iii no2 h2o could further oxidize fe ii eq 4 fig s3 which was consistent with the previous report jamieson et al 2018 considering that heterotrophic denitrification takes precedence over fe ii based autotrophic denitrification ndfo in the thermodynamics e g eco2 glucose 0 43 v eco2 acetate 0 28 v efe3 fe2 0 2 v ph 7 stams et al 2006 straub et al 2001 fe ii oxidation in the initial 30 days was restricted by the high content organic matters which was the reason for the slight fe ii fluctuation in the initial 30 days fig 1a with consuming organic matters fig 3 a and b fe ii gradually substituted organic matters to reduce nitrate to produce fe iii fig 1b consistently the vfas including acetate propionate and butyrate were almost undetectable in the nitrate added group from day 30 fig 3b indicating that heterotrophic denitrification was weakened after a period of digestion while fe ii based autotrophic denitrification became prevailing according to the fe ii and fe iii fluctuation fig 1a and b noteworthily though vfas were almost depleted in the initial 30 days tcod were still 12602 5 mg l in the control and 10113 8 mg l in the nitrate added group on day 30 with tcod removal efficiency of 39 6 and 51 6 respectively fig 3c afterwards tcod removal efficiency of the control and nitrate added group from day 30 98 increased by 3 1 3 2 fig 3c but no significant increase was observed p 0 05 the high residual tcod or low tcod removal ratio during the digestion were because the sludge slurry used in this study was digestate of waste activated sludge that had been digested for 20 days and most of easily degradable organic matters had been consumed accordingly methanogenesis of the two groups was weak methane production of the nitrate added group was only 5 1 ml that was lower than 21 3 ml in the control because the competition of nitrate reduction for electron donors decreased methane production 3 2 microbial community analysis as shown in fig s4a and table s3 irb including geobacter and dechloromonas were significantly p 0 05 enriched in the nitrate added group on day 50 particularly the abundance of geobacter and dechloromonas were 0 03 and 0 3 in the control compared to 0 3 and 0 7 in the nitrate added group respectively then the abundance of total irb including geobacter dechloromonas and anaeromyxobacter further increased from 1 on day 50 to 1 4 on day 90 in the nitrate added group fig s5a and table s3 while it was almost unchanged in the control i e about 0 3 on day 50 and 90 besides irb the no3 reducing fe ii oxidizer acidovorax and the family comamonadaceae bao and li 2017 belonging to iron oxidizing bacteria iob were also detected in both groups but more abundant in the nitrate added group table s4 for example the abundance of comamonadaceae was 1 8 in the control compared to 1 9 in the nitrate added group on day 50 fig s4b and increased to 2 8 in the nitrate added group on day 90 fig s5b the detected no3 reducing fe ii oxidizer further demonstrated that ndfo occurred noteworthily irb and no3 reducing fe ii oxidizer were also detected in the control without adding nitrate table s3 and table s4 it indicated that feammox eqs 2 and 3 and ndfo also occurred in the control which was related to 76 3 mg l of indigenous fe iii existing in the sludge table 1 ding et al 2014 putative denitrifiers including acinetobacter rhodoplanes bacillus pseudomonas corynebacterium and pseudoxanthomonas were few 0 1 in the two groups table s5 han et al 2013 li et al 2016 anammox was a possible way to remove nh4 but anammox bacteria belonging to five genera kuenenia brocadia anammoxoglobus jettenia and scalindua huang et al 2016 oshiki et al 2013 were not detected in both two groups implying that anammox could be negligible the qpcr results demonstrated that the copies of total 16s rrna nosz geobacteraceae anammox acidimicrobiaceae a6 and acidimicrobiaceae bacteria on day 90 in the nitrate added group were 1 3 106 4 9 102 2 4 105 8 5 102 1 7 104 and 2 3 105 accounting for 0 04 18 5 0 06 1 3 and 17 7 of total 16srna respectively table 2 noteworthily despite the low abundance of geobacter 0 5 and undetectable acidimicrobiaceae a6 through dna based high throughput sequencing analysis their abundances based on qpcr reached 18 5 and 1 3 respectively it indicated that geobacter and acidimicrobiaceae a6 as functional microorganisms of feammox huang et al 2016 huang and jaffé 2015 yuan et al 2016 were active in this study the abundance of anammox gene 0 07 were extremely low which further suggested that nitrogen removal in this study resulted from anammox could be negligible few denitrifying functional gene nosz 0 04 also showed few organic matters available for heterotrophic denitrification on day 90 and the electron donor for nitrate reduction was mainly fe ii i e ndfo the nitrifying bacteria gene aob amoa was not detected which was consistent with no do involved during the experiment the results indicated that continuous oscillations between reducing and oxidizing conditions by intermittent nitrate addition enriched irb in fact the oscillations between reducing and oxidizing conditions are common at natural interfaces of anaerobic oxic and anaerobic anoxic environments e g paddy soils marine sediments and intertidal wetland li et al 2015 and in iron rich soils and sediments these oscillations might stimulate the growth of both irb and iob and their metabolism could induce the cycling between fe ii and fe iii to realize nitrogen removal via feammox mejia et al 2016 kappler 2005 melton et al 2014 3 3 nitrogen removal as shown in fig 4 a the ammonium of both groups increased in the initial 36 days due to the ammonium generation from protein decomposition ammoniation no3 could accelerate the sludge degradation using organic matter as electron donor which advanced protein decomposition and caused more nh4 n generation in the nitrate added group fig s6 and fig 4a wang et al 2016 after the increase of nh4 n in the initial 36 days the nh4 n content of two groups began to decrease the decrease of nh4 n in the nitrate added group was significantly p 0 05 faster than that in the control the nh4 n in the nitrate added reactor was undetectable after day 94 while it still maintained around 280 mg l in the control fig 4a remarkably the decrease of nh4 n was accompanied with the accumulation of fe ii e g from day 90 to day 98 fe ii content increased from 163 4 mg l to 299 8 mg l while nh4 n content decreased from 85 2 mg l to undetected level in the nitrate group fig s7 the nh4 n content presented a dynamic equilibrium between consumption by feammox and production from protein decomposition especially in the initial digestion depended upon the total amount of nh4 n generation the apparent changes of nh4 n was unnecessarily synchronized with the fe iii reduction therefore the lower nh4 n content in the nitrate added group than that in the control began to be observed from day 45 while the dramatic fluctuations of fe ii began from day 30 fig 1a also the decrease of nh4 n was not matched with the increase of fe ii in the stoichiometric ratio according to feammox i e fe n 3 for example during days 90 98 the nh4 n loss was 88 5 mg l equal to 6 3 mm nitrogen while fe ii only increased by 136 4 mg l from 163 4 mg l to 299 8 mg l equal to 2 5 mm fe fig s7 namely the fe n ratio mole was only about 0 4 much lower than the theoretical ratio 3 which was because fe ii produced from feammox was partly oxidized back to fe iii via ndfo or fe ii fe iii cycle decreased the apparent content of produced fe ii from feammox after 98 days 1036 7 mg l of the initial total nitrogen content decreased to 605 5 mg l in the control and decreased to 103 2 mg l in the nitrate added group namely the nitrogen removal efficiency of the two groups reached 41 6 and 90 1 respectively fig 4b the significantly p 0 05 higher nitrogen removal efficiency and obvious fe ii fluctuation in the nitrate added group meant that feammox successively occurred with supplementing nitrate the self generated fe iii via ndfo eqs 2 5 could be used to proceed the next round of feammox however nh4 n content eventually remained about 280 mg l in the control fig 4a meaning that feammox basically come to a standstill due to less and less fe iii generated from ndfo specifically 6 or 8 mol fe iii were consumed when producing 1 mol no2 or no3 according to eqs 2 and 3 while only 2 mol eq 4 or 5 mol eq 5 fe iii could be produced when even all no3 and no2 were reduced to n2 via ndfo in other words the imbalance of electron transfer between the fe iii reduction and fe ii oxidation caused that the nitrogen removal from these processes deteriorated gradually comparatively nh4 n was undetected since day 94 in the nitrate added group with the total nitrogen removal efficiency up to 90 1 adding nitrate could serve as the oxidant to react with fe ii to regenerate the sufficient fe iii through ndfo fig 1b which brought the next round of feammox for the successive nitrogen removal the results were consistent with the fluctuations of fe ii content in the nitrate added group fig 1a actually the added nitrate served as the terminal electron acceptor to oxidize ammonium with fe ii fe iii as the electron shuttle just like a new anammox reaction 5nh4 3no3 4n2 9h2o 2h it could be confirmed by the stoichiometric relationship between the added nitrate and nitrogen loss during days 90 98 fig s7 specifically 6 3 mm nh4 n loss theoretically required 3 8 mm no3 n as terminal electron acceptor to produce n2 according to this anammox like reaction compared with 4 0 mm no3 n actually added similarly the decrease of nh4 n was 268 3 mg l during days 59 90 from 356 8 mg l to 88 5 mg l fig 4a which theoretically consumed 11 5 mm nitrate compared with added 16 mm nitrate 4 redox cycles 28 of nitrate imbalance during days 59 90 was higher than 5 3 8 vs 4 0 of that during days 90 98 in agreement with the less and less organic matters available for heterotrophic denitrification over the digestion compared with the control additional 502 3 mg l 605 5 103 2 fig 4b nitrogen and 2490 1 mg l 11939 1 9449 fig 3c tcod were removed after 98 days in the nitrate added group with the accumulative addition of 52 mm no3 on days 0 6 13 20 24 30 37 50 59 68 76 81 and 90 respectively theoretically the extra 502 3 mg l nitrogen or ammonium removal in the nitrate added group could reduce 21 5 mm no3 to n2 based on this anammox like reaction the remaining 30 5 mm no3 added 52 21 5 was used for the oxidation of organic matters i e heterotrophic denitrification however the 30 5 mm no3 could stoichiometrically consume 1220 mg l cod in the nitrate added group which was less than actual increased tcod removal 2490 1 mg l compared to control it was likely related that the decomposition of sludge by heterotrophic denitrification and dir was beneficial for the further mineralization of organics

by no2 i e anammox has been confirmed to be a pathway in chemolithoautotrophic oxidation of nh4 however the anaerobic ammonium oxidation by no3 has not been reported no3 cannot replace no2 for anammox

2874 772 and 662 planes corresponding to the standard card of iron hydroxide fe oh 3 jcpds card no 38 0032 indicating that the indigenous fe iii of the original sludge was likely in the form of iron

oxide minerals implied the occurrence of fe ii oxidation which was consistent with the fe ii fluctuation fig 1a similarly iron hydroxide fe oh 3 fig s10a and akaganeite q syn feo oh fig s10b were detected on day 30 in the control while goethite feo oh jcpds card no 29 0713 fig s10c and maghemite q syn fe2o3 fig s10d were detected on day 68 which was consistent with that of previous reports mejia et al 2016 hansel et al 2005 burton et al 2008 it indicated that ferrihydrite similar to iron hydroxide fe oh 3 could be converted into other fe iii species during the processes these detected fe iii species might be directly produced from ndfo such as fe oh 3 10fe ii 2no3 24h2o 10fe oh 3 n2 18h and feo oh 4fe ii 2no2 5h2o 4feo oh n2o 6h melton et al 2014 the generated fe oh 3 and feo oh could participate in feammox again eqs 1 3 and 6feooh nh4 10h 6fe2 no2 10h2o melton et al 2014 noteworthily sulfur and phosphorus had a great influence on fe hydr oxide transformation liptzin and silver 2009 he et al 2019 however the sulfur and phosphorus content in the sludge was few fig s2 and fe s and f p mineral were also not undetected through xrd figs s9 and 10 therefore the effect of sulfur and phosphorus on fe hydr oxide transformation was neglectful in this study 4 implication nox as the product of feammox eqs 2 and 3 could oxidize fe ii to fe iii via ndfo it meant that fe iii might be regenerated to proceed the next round of feammox however the feammox could not be durable only with relying on the self regeneration of nox nevertheless adding no3 into the feammox system could oxidize fe ii to generate sufficient fe iii for removing more ammonium in other words this novel approach for nitrogen removal was just like the reaction between nh4 and no3 under the motivation of the fe iii fe ii cycle meaning that the iron could be acted as the catalyst to trigger the reaction between nh4 and no3 therefore the amount of iron is unnecessarily very high for example the iron used in this study was resulted from the sludge itself because fe coagulant was used in sludge dewatering before the digestion but if the iron content was too low additional iron might have to be added in order to increase the nitrogen removal rate effects of the iron amount on nitrogen removal need to be further studied ndfo followed by feammox was the essence of this approach in which two microorganisms iob and irb were mainly involved to undertake the ammonium removal a big advantage of no3 used as electron acceptor is that no3 is readily available to the practical application while no2 used in common anammox is easily oxidized to no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria wang et al 2019 according to the results of this study adding no3 in anaerobic digesters could trigger this anammox like process to cause an in situ nitrogen removal many industrial wastewaters contain high concentration of no3 such as steel manufacturing military industry chemical fertilizer production etc which however may be not compatible to use as no3 source due to their complexity in components since no3 present in low c n municipal wastewater is frequently hard to treat ji and chen 2010 the effluent of wastewater treatment plants can be considered as a source of no3 fig s11 it can simultaneously remove nitrate and ammonium providing a novel efficient and economical approach to treating high content nitrogen wastes 5 conclusions in this study no3 was added to forward fe iii regeneration through ndfo followed by successive ammonium removal through feammox results showed that each addition of no3 caused the significant p 0 05 decrease of fe ii fig 1 e g fe ii content dramatically decreased from 606 9 mg l on day 30 no3 addition to 298 2 mg l on day 31 it was also found that the produced no2 from no3 reduction could further oxidize fe ii fig 2 consequently the nh4 n in the nitrate added reactor was undetectable after day 94 while it still maintained around 280 mg l in the control fig 4a and total nitrogen removal efficiency reached 90 1 in the nitrate added reactor after 98 day operation much higher than that of control 41 6 without no3 addition the qpcr results further indicated that the abundance of geobacter as functional microorganisms of feammox reached 18 5 and the abundance of anammox gene 0 07 were extremely low which suggested that nitrogen removal in this study resulted from anammox could be negligible this study demonstrated a novel reaction with no3 as a terminal electron acceptor to remove ammonium with fe ii fe iii as the electron shuttle just like a new

18166,the study demonstrated a novel anammox like process to remove high concentration ammonium using nitrate as terminal electron acceptor under fe iii fe ii cycle compared with no2 in common anammox no3 used here is more available in practice suitable for in situ removal of high concentration nh4 in a single anaerobic system the nox and fe ii produced from feammox fe iii reduction coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation subsequently react together via nox dependent fe ii oxidation to regenerate fe iii that potentially stimulates next round of feammox however these processes couldn t be lasting due to inadequate fe iii regeneration because nox is non dominant product during feammox in this study no3 was added to supplement the insufficient nox to enhance fe iii regeneration and remove nitrogen successively results showed that periodically adding nitrate caused oscillations between fe iii and fe ii in the sludge implying fe iii regeneration and consumption consequently nitrogen removal of the digester with an initial total nitrogen of 1036 7 mg l reached 90 1 after 98 day operation much higher than that of control 41 6 without no3 addition adding no3 in the digester to trigger fe iii fe ii cycle for removing ammonium is just equivalent to an anammox like process using no3 as terminal electron acceptor to oxidize nh4 graphical abstract image 1 keywords feammox no3 dependent fe ii oxidation nitrogen loss fe iii fe ii cycle 1 introduction anaerobic digestion has been widely applied as an efficient method to dispose high strength organic waste solids waters such as waste activated sludge kitchen waste food processing wastewater animal breeding wastewater and landfill leachate feng et al 2014 yang et al 2017 renou et al 2008 the digestate after anaerobic digestion frequently contains high content ammonium 500 2000 mg l which poses a great challenge for current wastewater treatment technologies wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 yang et al 2018a anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox a process confirmed in 1990s to oxidize nh4 with no2 as terminal electron acceptor nh4 no2 n2 2h2o has been applied in more than 100 full scale ammonium wastewater treatment worldwide by 2014 lackner et al 2014 but still encounters a few issues to limit its wider application autotrophic anammox bacteria is a type of slow growing microorganism with a doubling time of 11 days and is sensitive to environmental conditions such as ph salinity and organic carbon van hulle et al 2010 jin et al 2012 especially no2 used in the process is required in advance to be produced from ammonium oxidation performed by ammonium oxidizing bacteria i e partial nitrification thereby the combination of partial nitrification and anammox has been proposed for ammonium removal in two stage or one single reactors such as completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite and oxygen limited autotrophic nitrification denification paredes et al 2007 in these processes it is required to elaborately control the operating conditions to make sure the high efficiency of partial nitrification which however is quite fragile because no2 oxidation proceeds more rapidly than ammonium oxidation so that no2 rarely presents in water sinha and annachhatre 2007 feammox i e fe iii reduction coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation is a potential alternative to ammonium removal in anaerobic digesters eqs 1 3 yang et al 2012 feammox has been reported to play an important role in the nitrogen cycle in natural environments such as riparian zone ding et al 2017 marine rios del toro et al 2018 wetland shrestha et al 2009 clement et al 2005 tropical forest huang et al 2016 and paddy soil zhou et al 2016 iron reducing bacteria irb that is a typical group of dissimilatory fe iii reduction dir microorganisms capable of utilizing various electron donors to extracellularly reduce fe iii hydro oxides was found to be indispensable in feammox yang et al 2012 bao and li 2017 it was previously reported that the feammox efficiency was significantly correlated with the bacterial abundances of irb zhou et al 2016 li et al 2015 it implies that irb is likely to be directly involved in ammonium oxidation shown in fig s1 i e irb accepts electrons from ammonium and then transfers the electrons to fe iii to perform dir coupled to nh4 oxidation recently it was reported that 20 1 of total nitrogen removal was achieved when dosing fe oh 3 once in an anaerobic sludge digester with an original nitrogen content of 1375 mg l yang et al 2018a although the efficiency was not high feammox seemed to hold promise for serving as an alternative to removing high content ammonium from wastes no2 and no3 produced from feammox have reported to be capable of oxidizing fe ii to fe iii anaerobically eqs 4 and 5 termed as nox dependent fe ii oxidation ndfo picardal 2012 klueglein and kappler 2013 oshiki et al 2013 it means that fe iii is likely regenerated through feammox followed by ndfo to proceed the next round of feammox yang et al 2018b actually the fe iii regeneration is not lasting during these two processes because of the majority of nh4 being converted to n2 rather than nox yang et al 2012 which implies that continuously intermittently supplementing fe iii is required to maintain the successive feammox for nitrogen removal this could be a reason for the report of the low efficiency of nitrogen removal in the anaerobic sludge digestion with a single dosage of iron yang et al 2018a nevertheless it is unrealistic to continuously supplement fe iii in the practical application because the sludge with high content fe has been regarded as a hazardous material in some countries like china when adding no3 into the feammox system the added no3 is expected to supply the deficiency of nox produced from feammox to forward the ndfo for fe iii regeneration as a result feammox is possible to successively occur to remove ammonium if the assumption is true adding no3 to trigger ndfo and forward feammox for ammonium removal just equals to the reaction between nh4 and no3 with the condition of fe iii fe ii cycle noteworthily till now anammox is only reported in the reaction between no2 and nh4 dalsgaard et al 2005 and as far as we know only one study has been reported about feammox coupled with nitrate dependent fe ii oxidization to simultaneously convert nh4 and no3 li et al 2018 which however actually was a coupled process of feammox and anammox to further explore whether this novel nitrogen removal pathway could occur in the absence of anammox bacteria and to what extent the digestate after anaerobic digestion of municipal residual activated sludge was used as inoculation due to its high nitrogen content 1 3fe oh 3 5h nh4

this study were to investigate 1 effects of no3 addition on fe ii oxidation i e ndfo process 2 changes of the nitrogen and iron species during ndfo and feammox process 3 microorganisms involved in these processes a new anammox like process using no3 as terminal electron acceptor was expected to be developed for in situ removal of ammonium during anaerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the sludge slurry used as the source of nitrogen and inoculant sludge in this study was the digestate after anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge for 20 days in a municipal sewage treatment plant in dalian china the energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis of the original slurry demonstrated the existence of iron in this sludge fig s2 its content reached 722 86 mg l of which fe ii accounted for 89 5 table 1 the iron was mainly from sludge dewatering process using iron salts as coagulants 2 2 experimental setup the experiments were conducted in 300 ml conical flasks containing 250 ml diluted sludge slurry with a media the composition of media was described by mejia et al 2016 the initial properties of the diluted sludge including cod fe ii and fe iii content are listed in table 1 before the experiment the oxygen of the headspace and sludge in the bottles was removed via aerating using n2 for 30 min afterwards the flasks were sealed by the cap which was drilled two holes to connect with a biogas sampling bag and a liquid sampling pipe respectively to investigate the effect of periodical no3 addition on nh4 removal about 1 ml nano3 stock solution 1 m was added into the flasks on day 0 6 13 20 24 30 37 50 59 68 76 81 and 90 during the digestion respectively i e the final no3 concentration of each addition was 4 mm table s1 as comparison a control experiment was carried out with adding same volume of deionized water in place of nitrate solution in parallel the flasks were placed in an shaker 120 rpm in the dark at 30 c for 100 days the experiments were repeated in triplicate the experiment was operated under anaerobic condition and dissolved oxygen do was undetectable during the entire process 2 3 analysis methods

0 5 m hcl for 2 h at room temperature then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min the fe ii and total fe of the supernatant were quantified by the ferrozine assay ding et al 2014 the amount of fe iii was calculated as the difference between total fe and fe ii all iron extractions were conducted in the anaerobic glovebox because the oxidation of fe ii by o2 in the presence of cl was fast even at very low ph value porsch and kappler 2011 microbial analysis on day 50 and 90 was conducted via high throughput 16s rdna pyrosequencing according to our previous report yang et al 2018b and rna based real time quantitative pcr analysis qpcr was further applied to identify the absolute quantity and activity of some functional genes on day 90 huang et al 2018 total bacteria were represented via quantification of the 16s rrna genes using primer set 1055f 1392r the denitrifying functional gene nosz and nitrifying bacterial amoa gene were quantified with primer sets nosz 1f nosz 2r and amoa1f amoa2r for the detection of denitrifiers and nitrifiers respectively anammox bacteria were detected using primer set amx368f amx820r and geobacteraceae acidimicrobiaceae a6 bacteria belonging to the acidimicrobiaceae family that have been considered to participate in the feammox process were targeted using primer set geo494f geo825r and acm342f 439r respectively huang et al 2016 huang and jaffé 2015 yuan et al 2016 specific primer information is shown in table s2 2 4 statistical analyses the one way analysis of variance anova was performed for statistical analyses using origin 9 0 inc originlab northampton ma statistical significance was determined by duncan s multiple range test and denoted at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ndfo process during redox cycling from fig 1 a fe ii content of the control without adding nitrate remained unchanged generally during 100 day operation slightly ranging in 617 8 22 3 mg l comparatively fe ii content of the nitrate added group showed dramatic fluctuations especially after day 30 i e each addition of no3 caused a significantly p 0 05 decrease of the fe ii content and then fe ii content significantly p 0 05 increased fig 1a for example when adding 4 mm of nitrate on day 30 fe ii content dramatically decreased from 606 9 mg l to 298 2 mg l accompanied with increase of fe iii from 113 6 mg l to 419 2 mg l on day 31 afterwards fe ii increased to 379 1 mg l on day 34 and 502 7 mg l on day 36 while fe iii accordingly decreased to 340 7 mg l and 219 3 mg l in the same periods respectively fig 1a and b it was reasonably assumed that the increase of fe ii was resulted from dir using organic matters and or ammonium as electron donors thermodynamically organic matters are superior to ammonium as electron donors for the fe iii reduction li et al 2015 ding et al 2014 also found that only 0 8 2 2 of fe iii reduction was associated with feammox in paddy soils containing organic matters the changes of nox content during redox cycles are shown in fig 1c and d the results demonstrated that no3 significantly p 0 05 decreased after the addition and then no2 was detected remarkably the decrease of fe ii content was synchronous with the no3 addition and the fe ii content gradually increased with the depletion of nox for instance the added 56 mg l 4 mm no3 n dropped rapidly to 5 3 mg l after one day i e day 1 accompanied with the decrease of fe ii content from 616 6 mg l to 471 9 mg l and increase of no2 n from 0 to 13 4 mg l afterwards nox was almost depleted on day 3 while fe ii content began to rise and reached 563 mg l on day 4 together with the undetectable do in the process and the changes of nox fig 1c and d the decrease of fe ii and the increase of fe iii implied that the fe iii generation was caused by ndfo due to the no3 addition which provided the possibility for the consecutive feammox and nitrogen removal to explore the effect of no2 on fe ii oxidation in the nitrate added group the no3 n addition increased from 4 mm to 6 5 mm final concentration on day 100 to cause the further accumulation of no2 no3 n content of the nitrate added group quickly dropped from 94 6 mg l to 56 0 mg l on day 102 fig 2 a while the no2 n content increased from 1 6 mg l to 11 4 mg l fig 2b accompanied with a rapid decrease of fe ii content from 524 5 mg l to 179 8 mg l fig 2c in order to exclude the effects of no3 based ndfo and clarify the effects of no2 on fe ii additional glucose 2 mm of final concentration was added on day 102 to reduce the no3 to produce no2 as expected no3 n was almost depleted after day 104 while around 7 3 mg l no2 n was produced theoretically 2 mm glucose equivalent to 48 mm electrons can consume up 6 5 mm nitrate 32 5 mm electrons and also can increase the fe ii content via dir to the initial 524 5 mg l before no3 addition i e day 100 fig 2c however fe ii still remained at a low content after glucose addition in the nitrate added group 271 6 11 5 mg l during day 103 106 fig 2c it just indicated that fe ii oxidation with no2 occurred to consume fe ii and regenerate fe iii when no2 n content was significantly p 0 05 reduced to a quite low level about 1 0 mg l on day 107 in the nitrate added group fe ii content significantly p 0 05 increased about 399 1 mg l this illustrated that the produced no2 e g 2fe ii no3 2h 2fe iii no2 h2o could further oxidize fe ii eq 4

matters which was the reason for the slight fe ii fluctuation in the initial 30 days fig 1a with consuming organic matters fig 3 a and b fe ii gradually substituted organic matters to reduce nitrate to produce fe iii fig 1b consistently the vfas including acetate propionate and butyrate were almost undetectable in the nitrate added group from day 30 fig 3b indicating that heterotrophic denitrification was weakened after a period of digestion while fe ii based autotrophic denitrification became prevailing according to the fe ii and fe iii fluctuation fig 1a and b noteworthily though vfas were almost depleted in the initial 30 days tcod were still 12602 5 mg l in the control and 10113 8 mg l in the nitrate added group on day 30 with tcod removal efficiency of 39 6 and 51 6 respectively fig 3c afterwards tcod removal efficiency of the control and nitrate added group from day 30 98 increased by 3 1 3 2 fig 3c but no significant increase was observed p 0 05 the high residual tcod or low tcod removal ratio during the digestion were because the sludge slurry used in this study was digestate of waste activated sludge that had been digested for 20 days and most of easily degradable organic matters had been consumed accordingly methanogenesis of the two groups was weak methane production of the nitrate added group was only 5 1 ml that was lower than 21 3 ml in the control because the competition of nitrate reduction for electron donors decreased methane production 3 2 microbial community analysis as shown in fig s4a and table s3 irb including geobacter and dechloromonas were significantly p 0 05 enriched in the nitrate added group on day 50 particularly the abundance of geobacter and dechloromonas were 0 03 and 0 3 in the control compared to 0 3 and 0 7 in the nitrate added group respectively then the abundance of total irb including geobacter dechloromonas and anaeromyxobacter further increased from 1 on day 50 to 1 4 on day 90 in the nitrate added group fig s5a and table s3 while it was almost unchanged in the control i e about 0 3 on day 50 and 90 besides irb the no3 reducing fe ii oxidizer acidovorax and the family comamonadaceae bao and li 2017 belonging to iron oxidizing bacteria iob were also detected in both groups but more abundant in the nitrate added group table s4 for example the abundance of comamonadaceae was 1 8 in the control compared to 1 9 in the nitrate added group on day 50 fig s4b and increased to 2 8 in the nitrate added group on day 90 fig s5b the detected no3 reducing fe ii oxidizer further demonstrated that ndfo occurred noteworthily irb and no3 reducing fe ii oxidizer were also detected in the control without adding nitrate table s3 and table s4 it indicated that feammox eqs 2 and 3 and ndfo also occurred in the control which was related to 76 3 mg l of indigenous fe iii existing in the sludge table 1 ding et al 2014 putative denitrifiers including acinetobacter rhodoplanes bacillus pseudomonas corynebacterium and pseudoxanthomonas were few 0 1 in the two groups table s5 han et al 2013 li et al 2016 anammox was a possible way to remove nh4 but anammox bacteria belonging to five genera kuenenia brocadia anammoxoglobus jettenia and scalindua huang et al 2016 oshiki et al 2013 were not detected in both two groups implying that anammox could be negligible the qpcr results demonstrated that the copies of total 16s rrna nosz geobacteraceae anammox acidimicrobiaceae a6 and acidimicrobiaceae bacteria on day 90 in the nitrate added group were 1 3 106 4 9 102 2 4 105 8 5 102 1 7 104 and 2 3 105 accounting for 0 04 18 5 0 06 1 3 and 17 7 of total 16srna respectively table 2 noteworthily despite the low abundance of geobacter 0 5 and undetectable acidimicrobiaceae a6 through dna based high throughput sequencing analysis their abundances based on qpcr reached 18 5 and 1 3 respectively it indicated that geobacter and acidimicrobiaceae a6 as functional microorganisms of feammox huang et al 2016 huang and jaffé 2015 yuan et al 2016 were active in this study the abundance of anammox gene 0 07 were extremely low which further suggested that nitrogen removal in this study resulted from anammox could be negligible few denitrifying functional gene nosz 0 04 also showed few organic matters available for heterotrophic denitrification on day 90 and the electron donor for nitrate reduction was mainly fe ii i e ndfo the nitrifying bacteria gene aob amoa was not detected which was consistent with no do involved during the experiment the results indicated that continuous oscillations between reducing and oxidizing conditions by intermittent nitrate addition enriched irb in fact the oscillations between reducing and oxidizing conditions are common at natural interfaces of anaerobic oxic and anaerobic anoxic environments e g paddy soils marine sediments and intertidal wetland li et al 2015 and in iron rich soils and sediments these oscillations might stimulate the growth of both irb and iob and their metabolism could induce the cycling between fe ii and fe iii to realize nitrogen removal via feammox mejia et al 2016 kappler 2005 melton et al 2014 3 3 nitrogen removal as shown in fig 4 a the ammonium of both groups increased in the initial 36 days due to the ammonium generation from protein decomposition ammoniation no3 could accelerate the sludge degradation using organic matter as electron donor which advanced protein decomposition and caused more nh4 n generation in the nitrate added group fig s6 and fig 4a wang et al 2016 after the increase of nh4 n in the initial 36 days the nh4 n content of two groups began to decrease the decrease of nh4 n in the nitrate added group was significantly p 0 05 faster than that in the control the nh4 n in the nitrate added reactor was undetectable after day 94 while it still maintained around 280 mg l in the control fig 4a remarkably the decrease of nh4 n was accompanied with the accumulation of fe ii e g from day 90 to day 98 fe ii content increased from 163 4 mg l to 299 8 mg l while nh4 n content decreased from 85 2 mg l to undetected level in the nitrate group fig s7 the nh4 n content presented a dynamic equilibrium between consumption by feammox and production from protein decomposition especially in the initial digestion depended upon the total amount of nh4 n generation the apparent changes of nh4 n was unnecessarily synchronized with the fe iii reduction therefore the lower nh4 n content in the nitrate added group than that in the control began to be observed from day 45 while the dramatic fluctuations of fe ii began from day 30 fig 1a also the decrease of nh4 n was not matched with the increase of fe ii in the stoichiometric ratio according to feammox i e fe n 3 for example during days 90 98 the nh4 n loss was 88 5 mg l equal to 6 3 mm nitrogen while fe ii only increased by 136 4 mg l from 163 4 mg l to 299 8 mg l equal to 2 5 mm fe fig s7 namely the fe n ratio mole was only about 0 4 much lower than the theoretical ratio 3 which was because fe ii produced from feammox was partly oxidized back to fe iii via ndfo or fe ii fe iii cycle decreased the apparent content of produced fe ii from feammox after 98 days 1036 7 mg l of the initial total nitrogen content decreased to 605 5 mg l in the control and decreased to 103 2 mg l in the nitrate added group namely the nitrogen removal efficiency of the two groups reached 41 6 and 90 1 respectively fig 4b the significantly p 0 05 higher nitrogen removal efficiency and obvious fe ii fluctuation in the nitrate added group meant that feammox successively occurred with supplementing nitrate the self generated fe iii via ndfo eqs 2 5 could be used to proceed the next round of feammox however nh4 n content eventually remained about 280 mg l in the control fig 4a meaning that feammox basically come to a standstill due to less and less fe iii generated from ndfo specifically 6 or 8 mol fe iii were consumed when producing 1 mol no2 or no3 according to eqs 2 and 3 while only 2 mol eq 4 or 5 mol eq 5 fe iii could be produced when even all no3 and no2 were reduced to n2 via ndfo in other words the imbalance of electron transfer between the fe iii reduction and fe ii oxidation caused that the nitrogen removal from these processes deteriorated gradually comparatively nh4 n was undetected since day 94 in the nitrate added group with the total nitrogen removal efficiency up to 90 1 adding nitrate could serve as the oxidant to react with fe ii to regenerate the sufficient fe iii through ndfo fig 1b which brought the next round of feammox for the successive nitrogen removal the results were consistent with the fluctuations of fe ii content in the nitrate added group fig 1a actually the added nitrate served as the terminal electron acceptor to oxidize ammonium with fe ii fe iii as the electron shuttle just like a new anammox reaction 5nh4 3no3 4n2 9h2o 2h it could be confirmed by the stoichiometric relationship between the added nitrate and nitrogen loss during days 90 98 fig s7 specifically 6 3 mm nh4 n loss theoretically required 3 8 mm no3 n as terminal electron acceptor to produce n2 according to this anammox like reaction compared with 4 0 mm no3 n actually added similarly the decrease of nh4 n was 268 3 mg l during days 59 90 from 356 8 mg l to 88 5 mg l fig 4a which theoretically consumed 11 5 mm nitrate compared with added 16 mm nitrate 4 redox cycles 28 of nitrate imbalance during days 59 90 was higher than 5 3 8 vs 4 0 of that during days 90 98 in agreement with the less and less organic matters available for heterotrophic denitrification over the digestion compared with the control additional 502 3 mg l 605 5 103 2 fig 4b nitrogen and 2490 1 mg l 11939 1 9449 fig 3c tcod were removed after 98 days in the nitrate added group with the accumulative addition of 52 mm no3 on days 0 6 13 20 24 30 37 50 59 68 76 81 and 90 respectively theoretically the extra 502 3 mg l nitrogen or ammonium removal in the nitrate added group could reduce 21 5 mm no3 to n2 based on this anammox like reaction the remaining 30 5 mm no3 added 52 21 5 was used for the oxidation of organic matters i e heterotrophic denitrification however the 30 5 mm no3 could stoichiometrically consume 1220 mg l cod in the nitrate added group which was less than actual increased tcod removal 2490 1 mg l compared to control it was likely related that the decomposition of sludge by heterotrophic denitrification and dir was beneficial for the further mineralization of organics wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2010 thermodynamically both no2 and no3 can oxidize nh4 nh4 no2 n2 2h2o g0 358 kj mol 5nh4 3no3 4n2 9h2o 2h g0 3297 kj mol jetten et al 1998 the anaerobic ammonium oxidation by no2 i e anammox has been confirmed to be a pathway in chemolithoautotrophic oxidation of nh4 however the anaerobic ammonium oxidation by no3 has not been reported no3 cannot replace no2 for anammox partly because no2 is the direct precursor of no eqs 6 8 that is a necessary intermediate for oxidizing nh4 kartal et al 2011 strous et al 2006 this study demonstrated a novel reaction with no3 as a terminal electron acceptor to remove ammonium 6 no2 2h e no h2o e0 0 38v 7 no nh4 2h 3e n2h4 h2o e0 0 06v 8 n2h4 n2 4h 4e e0 0 75v 3 4 fe iii hydr oxide transformation during redox cycling xrd analysis of the sludge samples taken from reactors at different times was conducted from xrd pattern of original sludge fig s8 the characteristic peaks at 21 2 26 3 36 4 and 60 19 ascribed to the 1052 2874 772 and 662 planes corresponding to the standard card of iron hydroxide fe oh 3 jcpds card no 38 0032 indicating that the indigenous fe iii of the original sludge was likely in the form of iron hydroxide for the nitrate added group iron hydroxide fe oh 3 fig s9a and akaganeite q syn feo oh jcpds card no 34 1266 fig s9b were detected on day 30 after a day of next nitrate addition day 31 maghemite q syn fe2o3 jcpds card no 25 1402 fig s9c was formed afterwards iron nitrate hydrate fe no3 3 9h2o jcpds card no 01 0124 fig s9d was detected on day 68 the formation of these fe iii hydr oxide minerals implied the occurrence of fe ii oxidation which was consistent with the fe ii fluctuation fig 1a similarly iron hydroxide fe oh 3 fig s10a and akaganeite q syn feo oh fig s10b were detected on day 30 in the control while goethite feo oh jcpds card no 29 0713 fig s10c and maghemite q syn fe2o3 fig s10d were detected on day 68 which was consistent with that of previous reports mejia et al 2016 hansel et al 2005 burton et al 2008 it indicated that ferrihydrite similar to iron hydroxide fe oh 3 could be converted into other fe iii species during the processes these detected fe iii species might be directly produced from ndfo such as fe oh 3 10fe ii 2no3 24h2o 10fe oh 3 n2 18h and feo oh 4fe ii 2no2 5h2o 4feo oh n2o 6h melton et al 2014 the generated fe oh 3 and feo oh could participate in feammox again eqs 1 3 and 6feooh nh4 10h 6fe2 no2 10h2o melton et al 2014 noteworthily sulfur and phosphorus had a great influence on fe hydr oxide transformation liptzin and silver 2009 he et al 2019 however the sulfur and phosphorus content in the sludge was few fig s2 and fe s and f p mineral were also not undetected through xrd figs s9 and 10 therefore the effect of sulfur and phosphorus on fe hydr oxide transformation was neglectful in this study 4 implication nox as the product of feammox eqs 2 and 3 could oxidize fe ii to fe iii via ndfo it meant that fe iii might be regenerated to proceed the next round of feammox however the feammox could not be durable only with relying on the self regeneration of nox nevertheless adding no3 into the feammox system could oxidize fe ii to generate sufficient fe iii for removing more ammonium in other words this novel approach for nitrogen removal was just like the reaction between nh4 and no3 under the motivation of the fe iii fe ii cycle meaning that the iron could be acted as the catalyst to trigger the reaction between nh4 and no3 therefore the amount of iron is unnecessarily very high for example the iron used in this study was resulted from the sludge itself because fe coagulant was used in sludge dewatering before the digestion but if the iron content was too low additional iron might have to be added in order to increase the nitrogen removal rate effects of the iron amount on nitrogen removal need to be further studied ndfo followed by feammox was the essence of this approach in which two microorganisms iob and irb were mainly involved to undertake the ammonium removal a big advantage of no3 used as electron acceptor is that no3 is readily available to the practical application while no2 used in common anammox is easily oxidized to no3 by nitrite oxidizing bacteria wang et al 2019 according to the results of this study adding no3 in anaerobic digesters could trigger this anammox like process to cause an in situ nitrogen removal many industrial wastewaters contain high concentration of no3 such as steel manufacturing military industry chemical fertilizer production etc which however may be not compatible to use as no3 source due to their complexity in components since no3 present in low c n municipal wastewater is frequently hard to treat ji and chen 2010 the effluent of wastewater treatment plants can be considered as a source of no3 fig s11 it can simultaneously remove nitrate and ammonium providing a novel efficient and economical approach to treating high content nitrogen wastes 5 conclusions in this study no3 was added to forward fe iii regeneration through ndfo followed by successive ammonium removal through feammox results showed that each addition of no3 caused the significant p 0 05 decrease of fe ii fig 1 e g fe ii content dramatically decreased from 606 9 mg l on day 30 no3 addition to 298 2 mg l on day 31 it was also found that the produced no2 from no3 reduction could further oxidize fe ii fig 2 consequently the nh4 n in the nitrate added reactor was undetectable after day 94 while it still maintained around 280 mg l in the control fig 4a and total nitrogen removal efficiency reached 90 1 in the nitrate added reactor after 98 day operation much higher than that of control 41 6 without no3 addition the qpcr results further indicated that the abundance of geobacter as functional microorganisms of feammox reached 18 5 and the abundance of anammox gene 0 07 were extremely low which suggested that nitrogen removal in this study resulted from anammox could be negligible this study demonstrated a novel reaction with no3 as a terminal electron acceptor to remove ammonium with fe ii fe iii as the electron shuttle just like a new

introduction chlorine has been widely used as a disinfectant for the 20th century due to its relatively low cost and high performance in disinfection however many drinking water utilities have switched to combinations of primary disinfectants with chloramines as secondary disinfectants to meet more stringent regulations of disinfection byproducts dbps mcguire 2006 dotson et al 2012 in a drinking water supply system maintaining a disinfectant residual usually a chlorine or monochloramine residual provides an effective barrier against regrowth contamination of microorganisms kumpel and nelson 2014 li and mitch 2018 li et al 2019 the u s environmental protection agency epa guidelines regulated that either chlorine or chloramines must be maintained and not exceed 4 0 mg l as cl2 in the drinking water distribution systems u s epa 2007 gb 5749 2006 in china the levels of residual chlorine and monochloramine in the end of pipelines should be maintained at 0 05 4 0 and 0 05 3 0 mg l as cl2 respectively gb 5749 2006 gb 5749 2006 edible salt is essential to the health of humans and serves as a seasoning universally raw salt for edible salt production comes from brine and land salt brine with seawater as the predominant source is water containing a high concentration of salt land salt mainly includes rock salt well salt and lake salt which originally comes from the sea and due to billions of years of crustal movement the salt of the sea has remained on the land or in the stratum either in natural brine or land salt various anions such as bromide fluoride sulfate and carbonate are coexisting with chloride the main component of edible salt which are hard to be completely removed during raw salt refinement previous studies have shown that bromide presents in natural waters e g reservoirs surface waters ground waters at levels of several μg l to a few mg l sea water contains 60 70 mg l of bromide and the bromide content in reagent grade sodium chloride nacl can be up to 100 mg per kg of salt xie and rechow 1996 magazinovic et al 2004 suggesting that appreciable levels of bromide should also be present in edible salt mishra et al 2001 reported that the bromide contents in two indian edible salts were 152 and 336 mg per kg of salt reddy noone et al 2007 also found that the bromide levels in 10 commercial edible salts were 86 306 mg per kg of salt even so concerns on bromide content in edible salt have been quite limited probably because of the relatively low toxicity of bromide on mammals sangster et al 1983 as well as the slow individual edible salt consumption rate suggested to be no more than 3 75 5 75 g per day on age u s da and hhs 2010 food and agriculture organization fao world health organization who has given an acceptable daily intake adi value of bromide at 1 0 mg per kg body weight for humans fao who 1967 i e an adult with a body weight of 70 kg might intake up to 70 mg of bromide per day indicating that the bromide intake through edible salt consumption was expected to be far below the adi value although bromide is considered to be benign by itself in edible salt its role playing in a cooking process might not be neglected during cooking the bromide in edible salt may react with the chlorine monochloramine residual in tap water to form hypobromous acid hobr monobromamine nh2br bromochloramine nhbrcl which would react with the food organic matter e g rice wheat flour or with the natural organic matter in tap water to form brominated dbps br dbps cowman and singer 1996 kristiana et al 2009 zhai et al 2014 zhu and zhang 2016 the bromide content in the indian edible salt was up to 336 mg per kg of salt applying 1 g of such salt in 1 l of tap water a relatively low dose according to human salty acuity mitchell et al 2013 would produce water with a bromide concentration of 336 μg l that is much higher than the average bromide level i e 109 μg l in drinking water sources in the u s richardson et al 2008 and the bromide level i e 55 μg l in human activity impacted ground and surface waters in switzerland soltermann et al 2016 accordingly br dbps are expected to form at significant levels during cooking with edible salt relative to drinking water br dbps that have been studied for decades zhai and zhang 2011 zhai et al 2014 zhang and yang 2018 cooking water br dbps are quite unfamiliar to environmental researchers and the only studies about this were focusing on formation and control of trihalomethanes and haloacetonitriles under household water treatment processes and simulated cooking conditions yan et al 2016 ma et al 2017 shi et al 2017 accordingly we designed this study to determine bromide contents in different types of edible salts around the world to disclose whole pictures of polar br dbps generated in cooking with edible salt and simulated chlorinated and chloraminated tap water to explore formation of polar br dbps under different cooking conditions and to evaluate the mixture cytotoxicity of cooking water samples before after cooking condition optimization with an hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials suwannee river

modified eagles medium dmem containing 10 fetal bovine serum was offered by thermo scientific 2 2 determination of bromide contents in edible salts the bromide content in each of the 20 edible salts was determined using a spectrophotometric method according to a previous study chiu and eubanks 1989 briefly a 3 5 ml portion of an edible salt solution prepared by dissolving 2 g of the edible salt in ultrapure water to 1 l was added to a 10 ml volumetric flask containing 1 ml of a nah2po4 2h2o buffer solution ph 6 3 the mixture in the flask was dosed with 0 25 ml of a freshly prepared naocl solution 1 mol l naocl in 0 1 mol l naoh and immersed in a boiling water bath for 10 min the excessive naocl was destroyed to be sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate with sodium formate and the mixture was continued to be heated in the boiling water bath for another 5 min then the mixture was cooled to 21 c with an ice bath added with 4 5 ml of 2 mol l hbr and diluted to 10 ml with ultrapure water the ultraviolet uv absorbance of the solution at 267 nm against ultrapure water was measured using a shimadzu uv2550 spectrophotometer for each edible salt solution triplicate aliquots were analyzed to obtain an average bromide concentration calibration standard solutions were prepared using kbr at concentrations from 0 02 to 0 50 mg l as br 2 3 preparation of simulated cooking water preparation of simulated raw water was carried out with ultrapure water containing 3 mg l srnom as c and 90 mg l nahco3 as caco3 to prepare simulated tap water the simulated raw water was chlorinated chloraminated at room temperature with aimed disinfectant residual levels of 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 mg l as cl2 after a contact time of 12 h for preparation of simulated cooking water a 1 l portion of the simulated tap water was poured to a 2 l glass beaker and dosed with 0 5 4 0 g l of edible salt bromide content 200 mg per kg salt and 0 0 4 g l of rice flour the mixture in the beaker was heated on a

different sequences and intervals 0 20 min of adding the simulated tap water edible salt and rice flour were conducted immediately after cooking the simulated cooking water sample was brought back to

based on previous studies zhang et al 2008 pan et al 2016a the process of pretreatment was detailed in the supporting information si for the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay the organic layer was dried

hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay was performed to compare the overall cytotoxicity of simulated cooking water samples prepared before and after cooking condition optimization procedures of the assay

inc san jose ca the coefficient of determination r 2 in regression analysis evaluates the degree of correlation between the sets of data for multiple comparisons among treatment and control groups a one way analysis of variance anova followed by holm sidak multiple comparisons test was performed differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of bromide in edible salt as shown in fig 1 bromide was ubiquitously detected in the 20 edible salts at levels from 67 to 375 mg per kg of salt with an average level of 173 mg per kg of salt the bromide contents in different sources of edible salts varied substantially the sea salts contained the highest levels of bromide averagely 212 mg per kg salt followed by the well and rock salts averagely 137 mg per kg salt whereas the lake salts and bamboo salt contained relatively low levels of bromide below 100 mg per kg of salt during cooking applying 1 g of an edible salt containing the average level of bromide i e 173 mg per kg of salt in 1 l tap water would produce water with a bromide concentration of 173 μg l that was much higher than the average bromide concentration i e 109 μg l in drinking water sources in the u s richardson et al 2008 as well as the bromide level i e 55 μg l in human activity impacted ground and surface waters in switzerland soltermann et al 2016 3 2 detection of new unknown polar br dbps in simulated cooking water a representative chlorinated cooking water sample prepared using simulated tap water with 3 0 mg l naocl as

simulated tap water with 3 0 mg l nh2cl as cl2 added simultaneously with 0 2 g l rice flour and 2 g l edible salt heated to 100 c in 20 min and cooked at 100 c for 30 min were used for detection and identification of cooking water polar br dbps as shown in fig 2 numerous new unknown polar br dbps were detected in the two cooking water samples at various levels many high molecular weight m z 300 polar br dbps were detected in the two representative cooking samples especially in the chloraminated sample further aided with the uplc some overlapping bromine containing homologues were differentiated and 24 ion clusters were detected as summarized in table s1 among the 24 ion clusters m z 293 295 297 showed up at two retention times indicating that it corresponded to two br dbps accordingly a total of 25 polar br dbps were detected in the two representative cooking samples 11 were detected in the chlorinated cooking water sample and 17 were detected in the chloraminated cooking water sample among these detected polar br dbps 11 have been previously identified in drinking water pan and zhang 2013 huang et al 2018 whereas it is the first time that they were reported as cooking water polar br dbps all the new unknown cooking water polar br dbps were either analyzed with the uplc esi tqms mrm and product ion scans to obtain structural information or analyzed with the high resolution ms to obtain accurate m z values 3 3 structure formula identification of cooking water polar br dbps as displayed in fig 2 the isotopic abundance ratio of ion cluster m z 277 279 281 was 1 2 1 showing that this compound should contain 2 br as shown in fig 3 a f the retention time rt and product ion scan spectra of this compound suggested that this compound was probably 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde huang et al 2018 accordingly we proved the compound to be 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde through standard compound spiking similarly ion clusters 127 129 131 171 173 175 193 195 215 127 129 233 235 237 249 251 253 283 285 287 289 293 295 297 and 327 329 331 333 were confirmed to be chlorobromoacetic acid decarboxylated chlorobromoacetic acid bromomaletic acid dibromoacetic acid 3 bromo 5 chloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 bromo 5 chlorosalicylic acid 2 6 dibromo 4 chlorophenol 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dibromosalicylic acid and 2 4 6 tribromophenol in the simulated cooking water samples respectively as displayed in table s1 figs s1 s10 for the other 14 polar br dbps formulae identification was performed using high resolution ms analyses and identification of ion cluster m z 533 535 537 539 was shown here as an example the isotopic abundance ratio of ion cluster m z 533 535 537 539 was 1 3 3 1 fig 2 indicating that the compound should contain 3 br the exact m z values of the ion cluster were determined to be 532 9894 534 9877 536 9857 538 9836 fig 3g which should correspond to c18h32o3br3 with an m z value error of 2 4 ppm similarly ion clusters m z 257 259 261 263 301 303 305 307 345 347 349 351 377 379 391 393 407 409 413 415 417 427 429 431 453 455 457 471 473 475 489 491 493 495 507 509 511 513 and 551 553 555 were identified to be c5o3brcl2 c5o3br2cl c5o3br3 c18h34o3br c18h32o4br c18h32o5br c18h35o3brcl c18h33o4brcl c18h31o3br2 c18h33o4br2 c18h32o3br2cl c18h34o4br2cl and c21h29o7br2 respectively si and figs s11 s23 among these ion clusters m z 257 259 261 263 301 303 305 307 and 345 347 349 351 have been reported to be a group of emerging dbps in drinking water zhai and zhang 2011 gonsior et al 2014 and their structures were identified to be trihalo 5 hydroxy 4 cyclopentene 1 3 diones pan et al 2016b according to the molecular formulae of the other 11 ion clusters they were suggested to be a group of interrelated polar br dbps with similar carbon skeletons and chain structures since formulae of ion clusters m z 413 415 417 and 507 509 511 513 were saturated we speculated their structures to be ch3 ch2 12 choh 2chclchbrch2o and ch3 ch2 10 choh 3 chbr 2chclch2o respectively accordingly structures of ion clusters m z 377 379 391 393 407 409 427 429 431 453 455 457 471 473 475 489 491 493 495 533 535 537 539 and 551 553 555 were further proposed as summarized in table s1 these ion clusters could be converted to one another via oxidation substitution hydrolysis elimination addition and dehydration and their specific transformation pathways were depicted in fig 4 3 4 formation of polar br dbps in simulated cooking water 3 4 1 effects of disinfectant type and level and edible salt dose notably as displayed in fig s24 high molecular weight polar br dbps m z 300 were preferably generated in chloraminated samples according to previous studies hocl and hobr are strong oxidants that are responsible for the formation and decomposition of polar br dbps during chlorination whereas nhbrcl and nh2br are main oxidants in chloramination that are too weak to cause decomposition of br dbps zhai et al 2014 zhu and zhang 2016 therefore high molecular weight polar br dbps could accumulate in chloramination but quickly decompose in chlorination furthermore the highest formation of polar br dbps was detected at the disinfectant dose of 3 mg l as cl2 in chlorinated and chloraminated samples as presented in fig s25 with the increasing dose of edible salt from 0 5 to 4 g l formation of polar br dbps arrived maximum at the dose of 2 g l in chlorinated and chloraminated samples since high molecular weight polar br dbps might be intermediate compounds they could be degraded under a relatively high bromide concentration pan and zhang 2013 3 4 2 effects of type and dose of organic matter as shown in fig 5 a f levels and species of polar br dbps generated in the chlor am inated cooking water samples made with only srnom and only rice flour were quite different low molecular weight polar br dbps were at higher levels in samples made with only srnom while high molecular weight polar br dbps were at higher levels in samples made with only rice flour this might be due to relatively lower molecular weights of dbp precursors in srnom than in rice flour kwon et al 2005 jobling et al 2002 polar br dbps generated in the sample made with both srnom and rice flour were a compromise and combination of those formed in the samples made with only srnom and only rice flour besides rice flour the formation of polar br dbps in cooking water samples prepared with other three types of organic matter wheat flour corn starch and sweet potato starch was also investigated as shown in fig s26 similar species but different levels of polar br dbps were formed in these samples the four types of organic matter are mainly composed of carbohydrates 80 proteins 6 fat 1 moisture ash and vitamins shih and daigle 1997 bhattacharya et al 1999 okoye et al 2008 yadav et al 2006 amino acids hydrolysates of proteins and vitamins were confirmed to be major precursors of a few dbps krasner et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 carbohydrates are predominant components of these organic matters and can be hydrolyzed into monosaccharides e g glucose disaccharides e g maltose and polysaccharides e g starch as displayed by fig 5g n polar br dbps were also generated in cooking water samples made with only starch only maltose and only glucose suggesting that these carbohydrates were important precursors of cooking water polar br dbps this is because that hydroxyl groups on these hydrolysates could be oxidized to aldehydes ketones and carboxylic groups accompanying glucosidic bonds cleavage by disinfectants during cooking hebeish et al 1989 sangseethong et al 2010 in addition the highest formation of polar br dbps in both chlorinated and chloraminated cooking water samples was detected at a rice flour dose of 0 2 g l fig s27 3 4 3 effects of sequence and time interval of adding edible salt and rice flour formation of polar br dbps in chlor am inated cooking water samples prepared with three different processes were compared i adding edible salt 5 min earlier than adding rice flour ii adding edible salt and rice flour together and iii adding rice flour 5 min earlier than edible salt in the chlorinated cooking water samples polar br dbps were most preferentially generated in process i followed by process ii and iii fig 6 a c this is because in process i the reaction rates of hocl ocl and br k 1 4 102 m 1s 1 as well as hobr obr and natural organic matter nom k 1 0 106 m 1s 1 were much faster than that of hocl ocl and nom k 41 m 1s 1 leading to the accumulation of hobr obr and the enhanced formation of br dbps different from that in the chlorinated cooking water samples polar br dbps formation in the chloraminated samples was the highest in process iii followed by process ii and i fig 6d f it is because that addition of bromide before rice flour initiated reactions between nh2cl and br to form nh2br nhbr2 and nhbrcl which could auto decompose to cause loss of chloramines zhu and zhang 2016 on the contrary addition of rice flour before edible salt allowed formation of polar cl dbps which could further react with bromide in edible salt to form br dbps notably it was found that increasing the time interval between the addition of edible salt and rice flour in the chlorinated samples and increasing the time interval between the addition of rice flour and edible salt in the chloraminated samples from 0 to 20 min decreased polar br dbps formation by 64 and 47 respectively fig 6g n 3 4 4 effects of cooking temperature and time length as shown in fig s28 when cooking temperature was elevated from 20 to 100 c polar br dbps formation gradually decreased in the chlorinated sample whereas presented a first rising and then falling trend in the chloraminated sample different from chlorine depleted at 80 c monochloramine persisted during heating from 20 to 80 c and thus polar br dbps formation in the chloraminated sample was still in process at a rate higher than their degradation rate furthermore with cooking time length accumulating from 5 to 60 min at 100 c the levels of the polar br dbps kept relatively stable in chlorinated samples but substantially decreased in chloraminated samples fig s29 this is because that decomposition of polar br dbps in the chlorinated sample might occur before the temperature reaching 100 c and thus the decrease of polar br dbps in the chloraminated samples was observed after depletion of monochloramine 3 5 comparative cytotoxicity of simulated cooking water according to the aforementioned experiment results another two simulated cooking water samples were prepared with the optimized cooking condition as follows cooking time length 60 min cooking temperature 100 c addition sequence and interval adding rice flour 20 min earlier than edible salt chlorination or adding edible salt 20 min earlier than rice flour chloramination cytotoxicity of the cooking water samples prepared before and after optimization of cooking conditions was evaluated with an hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay which has been performed in examining comparative cytotoxicity of a few dbps and real water samples gong et al 2017 yin et al 2020 fig 7 displays the concentration factor response curve for the cytotoxicity of chlor am inated cooking water samples prepared before and after cooking condition optimization for each curve a regression analysis was performed to determine its r 2 and ec50 values anova test results showed that all the analyses were statistically significant with p 0 001 for the chlorinated cooking water sample optimization of cooking conditions substantially reduced the cytotoxicity by 57 with ec50 increasing from 125 to 288 similarly cooking condition optimization reduced the cytotoxicity of the chloraminated cooking water sample by 22 with ec50 increasing from 220 to 282 it was noted that before cooking condition optimization the cytotoxicity of the chlorinated cooking water sample was higher than that of the chloraminated cooking water sample which should mainly result from the higher total organic halogen level positively correlated with the toxicity of a disinfected water sample in the chlorinated cooking water sample han and zhang 2018 moreover as shown in fig 2 in the chlorinated cooking water sample the dominating br dbps were of low molecular weights whereas high molecular weight br dbps were predominant in the chloraminated cooking water sample previous studies have pointed out that the toxicity effects of organic compounds were achieved by narcosis of cell membrane followed by transferring across the cell membrane and reacting with cellular macromolecules and organelles or accumulation in the membrane that hinders its normal function plewa et al 2002 schultz et al 2003 liu and zhang 2014 therefore low molecular weight br dbps might be of higher ability to transfer across the cell membrane and react with cellular macromolecules and organelles more easily and thus exhibited higher cytotoxicity similar results were also found during chlorination of iopamidol that low molecular weight dbps were of higher cytotoxicity than high molecular weight dbps wendel et al 2016 4 conclusions our study proved that bromide was ubiquitously present at significant levels in different types of edible salts especially in sea salts since bromide in edible salts was considered to be safe at most cases it did not attract much attention from researchers however problems occurred when bromide in edible salts react with disinfectants in tap water and organic matter in food in a household cooking process during which formation of polar br dbps was detected and identified with regard to the adverse health effects of polar br dbps practical protocols to minimize their formation during cooking were raised e g a comparatively long time interval between the addition of rice flour and edible salt for chlorinated tap water a comparatively high cooking temperature and a comparatively long cooking time length under optimized cooking conditions the overall cytotoxicity of the chlor am inated cooking water samples could be substantially reduced last but not the least with possible presence of iodine fortifiers in edible salts mixed br i dbps or even mixed cl br i dbps might also be generated during cooking process and thus future studies are suggested to focus on a more comprehensive evaluation of halogenated dbps formed under various cooking conditions declaration of competing interest the authors

by 57 and 22 respectively compared with those prepared before cooking condition optimization graphical abstract image 1 keywords tap water disinfection byproducts edible salt cytotoxicity cooking 1 introduction chlorine has been widely used as a disinfectant for the 20th century due to its relatively low cost and high performance in disinfection however many drinking water utilities have switched to combinations of primary disinfectants with chloramines as secondary disinfectants to meet more stringent regulations of disinfection byproducts dbps mcguire 2006 dotson et al 2012 in a drinking water supply system maintaining a disinfectant residual usually a chlorine or monochloramine residual provides an effective barrier against regrowth contamination of microorganisms kumpel and nelson 2014 li and mitch 2018 li et al 2019 the u s environmental protection agency epa guidelines regulated that either chlorine or chloramines must be maintained and not exceed 4 0 mg l as cl2 in the drinking water distribution systems u s epa 2007 gb 5749 2006 in china the levels of residual chlorine and monochloramine in the end of pipelines should be maintained at 0 05 4 0 and 0 05 3 0 mg l as cl2 respectively gb 5749 2006 gb 5749 2006 edible salt is essential to the health of humans and serves as a seasoning universally raw salt for edible salt production comes from brine and land salt brine with seawater as the predominant source is water containing a high concentration of salt land salt mainly includes rock salt well salt and lake salt which originally comes from the sea and due to billions of years of crustal movement the salt of the sea has remained on the land or in the stratum either in natural brine or land salt various anions such as bromide fluoride sulfate and carbonate are coexisting with chloride the main component of edible salt which are hard to be completely removed during raw salt refinement previous studies have shown that bromide presents in natural waters e g reservoirs surface waters ground waters at levels of several μg l to a few mg l sea water contains 60 70 mg l of bromide and the bromide content in reagent grade sodium chloride nacl can be up to 100 mg per kg of salt xie and rechow 1996 magazinovic et al 2004 suggesting that appreciable levels of bromide should also be present in edible salt mishra et al 2001 reported that the bromide contents in two indian edible salts were 152 and 336 mg per kg of salt reddy noone et al 2007 also found that the bromide levels in 10 commercial edible salts were 86 306 mg per kg of salt even so concerns on bromide content in edible salt have been quite limited probably because of the relatively low toxicity of bromide on mammals sangster et al 1983 as well as the slow individual edible salt consumption rate suggested to be no more than 3 75 5 75 g per day on age u s da and hhs 2010 food and agriculture organization fao world health organization who has given an acceptable daily intake adi value of bromide at 1 0 mg per kg body weight for humans fao who 1967 i e an adult with a body weight of 70 kg might intake up to 70 mg of bromide per day indicating that the bromide intake through edible salt consumption was expected to be far below the adi value although bromide is considered to be benign by itself in edible salt its role playing in a cooking process might not be neglected during cooking the bromide in edible salt may react with the chlorine monochloramine residual in tap water to form hypobromous acid hobr monobromamine nh2br bromochloramine nhbrcl which would react with the food organic matter e g rice wheat flour or with the natural organic matter in tap water to form brominated dbps br dbps cowman and singer 1996 kristiana et al 2009 zhai et al 2014 zhu and zhang 2016 the bromide content in the indian edible salt was up to 336 mg per kg of salt applying 1 g of such salt in 1 l of tap water a relatively low dose according to human salty acuity mitchell et al 2013 would produce water with a bromide concentration of 336 μg l that is much higher than the average bromide level i e 109 μg l in drinking water sources in the u s richardson et al 2008 and the bromide level i e 55 μg l in human activity impacted ground and surface waters in switzerland soltermann et al 2016 accordingly br dbps are expected to form at significant levels during cooking with edible salt relative to drinking water br dbps that have been studied for decades zhai and zhang 2011 zhai et al 2014 zhang and yang 2018 cooking water br dbps are quite unfamiliar to environmental researchers and the only studies about this were focusing on formation and control of trihalomethanes and haloacetonitriles under household water treatment processes and simulated cooking conditions yan et al 2016 ma et al 2017 shi et al 2017 accordingly we designed this study to determine bromide contents in different types of edible salts around the world to disclose whole pictures of polar br dbps generated in cooking with edible salt and simulated chlorinated and chloraminated tap water to explore formation of polar br dbps under different cooking conditions and to evaluate the mixture cytotoxicity of cooking water samples before after cooking condition optimization with an hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials suwannee river

purchased from tokyo chemical industry and measured according to the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 2012 monochloramine nh2cl was freshly prepared by reacting naocl and nh4cl solutions in a chlorine to ammonia molar ratio of 0 8 just before use the human hepatoma cells hep g2 cell counting kit 8 cck 8 and phosphate buffered saline pbs were supplied by keygen biotech china dulbecco s modified eagles medium dmem containing 10 fetal bovine serum was offered by thermo scientific 2 2 determination of bromide contents in edible salts the bromide content in each of the 20 edible salts was determined using a spectrophotometric method according to a previous study chiu and eubanks 1989 briefly a 3 5 ml portion of an edible salt solution prepared by dissolving 2 g of the edible salt in ultrapure water to 1 l was added to a 10 ml volumetric flask containing 1 ml of a nah2po4 2h2o buffer solution ph 6 3 the mixture in the flask was dosed with 0 25 ml of a freshly prepared naocl solution 1 mol l naocl in 0 1 mol l naoh and immersed in a boiling water bath for 10 min the excessive naocl was destroyed to be sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate with sodium formate and the mixture was continued to be heated in the boiling water bath for another 5 min then the mixture was cooled to 21 c with an ice bath added with 4 5 ml of 2 mol l hbr and diluted to 10 ml with ultrapure water the ultraviolet uv absorbance of the solution at 267 nm against ultrapure water was measured using a shimadzu uv2550 spectrophotometer for each edible salt solution triplicate aliquots were analyzed to obtain an average bromide concentration calibration standard solutions were prepared using kbr at concentrations from 0 02 to 0 50 mg l as br 2 3 preparation of simulated cooking water preparation of simulated raw water was carried out with ultrapure water containing 3 mg l srnom as c and 90 mg l nahco3 as caco3 to prepare simulated tap water the simulated raw water was chlorinated chloraminated at room temperature with aimed disinfectant residual levels of 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 mg l as cl2 after a contact time of 12 h for preparation of simulated cooking water a 1 l portion of the simulated tap water was poured to a 2 l glass beaker and dosed with 0 5 4 0 g l of edible salt bromide content 200 mg per kg salt and 0 0 4 g l of rice flour the mixture in the beaker was heated on a

different sequences and intervals 0 20 min of adding the simulated tap water edible salt and rice flour were conducted immediately after cooking the simulated cooking water sample was brought back to 20 c with an ice bath the disinfectant residual in the sample was quantified and quenched with na2so3 2 4 pretreatment of simulated cooking water the simulated cooking water samples were pretreated based on previous studies zhang et al 2008 pan et al 2016a the process of pretreatment was detailed in the supporting information si for the hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay the organic layer was dried under a gentle nitrogen gas flow and re dissolved in 100 μl of dmso 105 concentration of the original cooking water sample 2 5 uplc esi tqms analysis the pretreated samples were analyzed by a waters

hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay was performed to compare the overall cytotoxicity of simulated cooking water samples prepared before and after cooking condition optimization procedures of the assay were basically followed previous studies and described specifically in si marabini et al 2006 gong et al 2017 cell viability was measured by relative absorbance of six replicates for each concentrated

inc san jose ca the coefficient of determination r 2 in regression analysis evaluates the degree of correlation between the sets of data for multiple comparisons among treatment and control groups a one way analysis of variance anova followed by holm sidak multiple comparisons test was performed differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of bromide in edible salt as shown in fig 1 bromide was ubiquitously detected in the 20 edible salts at levels from 67 to 375 mg per kg of salt with an average level of 173 mg per kg of salt the bromide contents in different sources of edible salts varied substantially the sea salts contained the highest levels of bromide averagely 212 mg per kg salt followed by the well and rock salts averagely 137 mg per kg salt whereas the lake salts and bamboo salt contained relatively low levels of bromide below 100 mg per kg of salt during cooking applying 1 g of an edible salt containing the average level of bromide i e 173 mg per kg of salt in 1 l tap water would produce water with a bromide concentration of 173 μg l that was much higher than the average bromide concentration i e 109 μg l in drinking water sources in the u s richardson et al 2008 as well as the bromide level i e 55 μg l in human activity impacted ground and surface waters in switzerland soltermann et al 2016 3 2 detection of new unknown polar br dbps in simulated cooking water a representative chlorinated cooking water sample prepared using simulated tap water with 3 0 mg l naocl as cl2 added simultaneously with 0 2 g l rice flour and 2 g l edible salt heated to 100 c in 20 min and cooked at 100 c for 30 min and a representative chloraminated cooking water sample prepared using simulated tap water with 3 0 mg l nh2cl as cl2 added simultaneously with 0 2 g l rice flour and 2 g l edible salt heated to 100 c in 20 min and cooked at 100 c for 30 min were used for detection and identification of cooking water polar br dbps as shown in fig 2 numerous new unknown polar br dbps were detected in the two cooking water samples at various levels many high molecular weight m z 300 polar br dbps were detected in the two representative cooking samples especially in the chloraminated sample further aided with the uplc some overlapping bromine containing homologues were differentiated and 24 ion clusters were detected as summarized in table s1 among the 24 ion clusters m z 293 295 297 showed up at two retention times indicating that it corresponded to two br dbps accordingly a total of 25 polar br dbps were detected in the two representative cooking samples 11 were detected in the chlorinated cooking water sample and 17 were detected in the chloraminated cooking water sample among these detected polar br dbps 11 have been previously identified in drinking water pan and zhang 2013 huang et al 2018 whereas it is the first time that they were reported as cooking water polar br dbps all the new unknown cooking water polar br dbps were either analyzed with the uplc esi tqms mrm and product ion scans to obtain structural information or analyzed with the high resolution ms to obtain accurate m z values 3 3 structure formula identification of cooking water polar br dbps as displayed in fig 2 the isotopic abundance ratio of ion cluster m z 277 279 281 was 1 2 1 showing that this compound should contain 2 br as shown in fig 3 a f the retention time rt and product ion scan spectra of this compound suggested that this compound was probably 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde huang et al 2018 accordingly we proved the compound to be 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde through standard compound spiking similarly ion clusters 127 129 131 171 173 175 193 195 215 127 129 233 235 237 249 251 253 283 285 287 289 293 295 297 and 327 329 331 333 were confirmed to be chlorobromoacetic acid decarboxylated chlorobromoacetic acid bromomaletic acid dibromoacetic acid 3 bromo 5 chloro 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde 3 bromo 5 chlorosalicylic acid 2 6 dibromo 4 chlorophenol 3 5 dibromo 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 3 5 dibromosalicylic acid and 2 4 6 tribromophenol in the simulated cooking water samples respectively as displayed in table s1 figs s1 s10 for the other 14 polar br dbps formulae identification was performed using high resolution ms analyses and identification of ion cluster m z 533 535 537 539 was shown here as an example the isotopic abundance ratio of ion cluster m z 533 535 537 539 was 1 3 3 1 fig 2 indicating that the compound should contain 3 br the exact m z values of the ion cluster were determined to be 532 9894 534 9877 536 9857 538 9836 fig 3g which should correspond to c18h32o3br3 with an m z value error of 2 4 ppm similarly ion clusters m z 257 259 261 263 301 303 305 307 345 347 349 351 377 379 391 393 407 409 413 415 417 427 429 431 453 455 457 471 473 475 489 491 493 495 507 509 511 513 and 551 553 555 were identified to be c5o3brcl2 c5o3br2cl c5o3br3 c18h34o3br c18h32o4br c18h32o5br c18h35o3brcl c18h33o4brcl c18h31o3br2 c18h33o4br2 c18h32o3br2cl c18h34o4br2cl and c21h29o7br2 respectively si and figs s11 s23 among these ion clusters m z 257 259 261 263 301 303 305 307 and 345 347 349 351 have been reported to be a group of emerging dbps in drinking water zhai and zhang 2011 gonsior et al 2014 and their structures were identified to be trihalo 5 hydroxy 4 cyclopentene 1 3 diones pan et al 2016b according to the molecular formulae of the other 11 ion clusters they were suggested to be a group of interrelated polar br dbps with similar carbon skeletons and chain structures since formulae of ion clusters m z 413 415 417 and 507 509 511 513 were saturated we speculated their structures to be ch3 ch2 12 choh 2chclchbrch2o and ch3 ch2 10 choh 3 chbr 2chclch2o respectively accordingly structures of ion clusters m z 377 379 391 393 407 409 427 429 431 453 455 457 471 473 475 489 491 493 495 533 535 537 539 and 551 553 555 were further proposed as summarized in table s1 these ion clusters could be converted to one another via oxidation substitution hydrolysis elimination addition and dehydration and their specific transformation pathways were depicted in fig 4 3 4 formation of polar br dbps in simulated cooking water 3 4 1 effects of disinfectant type and level and edible salt dose notably as displayed in fig s24 high molecular weight polar br dbps m z 300 were preferably generated in chloraminated samples according to previous studies hocl and hobr are strong oxidants that are responsible for the formation and decomposition of polar br dbps during chlorination whereas nhbrcl and nh2br are main oxidants in chloramination that are too weak to cause decomposition of br dbps zhai et al 2014 zhu and zhang 2016 therefore high molecular weight polar br dbps could accumulate in chloramination but quickly decompose in chlorination furthermore the highest formation of polar br dbps was detected at the disinfectant dose of 3 mg l as cl2 in chlorinated and chloraminated samples as presented in fig s25 with the increasing dose of edible salt from 0 5 to 4 g l formation of polar br dbps arrived maximum at the dose of 2 g l in chlorinated and chloraminated samples since high molecular weight polar br dbps might be intermediate compounds they could be degraded under a relatively high bromide concentration pan and zhang 2013 3 4 2 effects of type and dose of organic matter as shown in fig 5 a f levels and species of polar br dbps generated in the chlor am inated cooking water samples made with only srnom and only rice flour were quite different low molecular weight polar br dbps were at higher levels in samples made with only srnom while high molecular weight polar br dbps were at higher levels in samples made with only rice flour this might be due to relatively lower molecular weights of dbp precursors in srnom than in rice flour kwon et al 2005 jobling et al 2002 polar br dbps generated in the sample made with both srnom and rice flour were a compromise and combination of those formed in the samples made with only srnom and only rice flour besides rice flour the formation of polar br dbps in cooking water samples prepared with other three types of organic matter wheat flour corn starch and sweet potato starch was also investigated as shown in fig s26 similar species but different levels of polar br dbps were formed in these samples the four types of organic matter are mainly composed of carbohydrates 80 proteins 6 fat 1 moisture ash and vitamins shih and daigle 1997 bhattacharya et al 1999 okoye et al 2008 yadav et al 2006 amino acids hydrolysates of proteins and vitamins were confirmed to be major precursors of a few dbps krasner et al 2009 zhang et al 2019 carbohydrates are predominant components of these organic matters and can be hydrolyzed into monosaccharides e g glucose disaccharides e g maltose and polysaccharides e g starch as displayed by fig 5g n polar br dbps were also generated in cooking water samples made with only starch only maltose and only glucose suggesting that these carbohydrates were important precursors of cooking water polar br dbps this is because that hydroxyl groups on these hydrolysates could be oxidized to aldehydes ketones and carboxylic groups accompanying glucosidic bonds cleavage by disinfectants during cooking hebeish et al 1989 sangseethong et al 2010 in addition the highest formation of polar br dbps in both chlorinated and chloraminated cooking water samples was detected at a rice flour dose of 0 2 g l fig s27 3 4 3 effects of sequence and time interval of adding edible salt and rice flour formation of polar br dbps in chlor am inated cooking water samples prepared with three different processes were compared i adding edible salt 5 min earlier than adding rice flour ii adding edible salt and rice flour together and iii adding rice flour 5 min earlier than edible salt in the chlorinated cooking water samples polar br dbps were most preferentially generated in process i followed by process ii and iii fig 6 a c this is because in process i the reaction rates of hocl ocl and br k 1 4 102 m 1s 1 as well as hobr obr and natural organic matter nom k 1 0 106 m 1s 1 were much faster than that of hocl ocl and nom k 41 m 1s 1 leading to the accumulation of hobr obr and the enhanced formation of br dbps different from that in the chlorinated cooking water samples polar br dbps formation in the chloraminated samples was the highest in process iii followed by process ii and i fig 6d f it is because that addition of bromide before rice flour initiated reactions between nh2cl and br to form nh2br nhbr2 and nhbrcl which could auto decompose to cause loss of chloramines zhu and zhang 2016 on the contrary addition of rice flour before edible salt allowed formation of polar cl dbps which could further react with bromide in edible salt to form br dbps notably it was found that increasing the time interval between the addition of edible salt and rice flour in the chlorinated samples and increasing the time interval between the addition of rice flour and edible salt in the chloraminated samples from 0 to 20 min decreased polar br dbps formation by 64 and 47 respectively fig 6g n 3 4 4 effects of cooking temperature and time length as shown in fig s28 when cooking temperature was elevated from 20 to 100 c polar br dbps formation gradually decreased in the chlorinated sample whereas presented a first rising and then falling trend in the chloraminated sample different from chlorine depleted at 80 c monochloramine persisted during heating from 20 to 80 c and thus polar br dbps formation in the chloraminated sample was still in process at a rate higher than their degradation rate furthermore with cooking time length accumulating from 5 to 60 min at 100 c the levels of the polar br dbps kept relatively stable in chlorinated samples but substantially decreased in chloraminated samples fig s29 this is because that decomposition of polar br dbps in the chlorinated sample might occur before the temperature reaching 100 c and thus the decrease of polar br dbps in the chloraminated samples was observed after depletion of monochloramine 3 5 comparative cytotoxicity of simulated cooking water according to the aforementioned experiment results another two simulated cooking water samples were prepared with the optimized cooking condition as follows cooking time length 60 min cooking temperature 100 c addition sequence and interval adding rice flour 20 min earlier than edible salt chlorination or adding edible salt 20 min earlier than rice flour chloramination cytotoxicity of the cooking water samples prepared before and after optimization of cooking conditions was evaluated with an hep g2 cell cytotoxicity assay which has been performed in examining comparative cytotoxicity of a few dbps and real water samples gong et al 2017 yin et al 2020 fig 7 displays the concentration factor response curve for the cytotoxicity of chlor am inated cooking water samples prepared before and after cooking condition optimization for each curve a regression analysis was performed to determine its r 2 and ec50 values anova test results showed that all the analyses were statistically significant with p 0 001 for the chlorinated cooking water sample optimization of cooking conditions substantially reduced the cytotoxicity by 57 with ec50 increasing from 125 to 288 similarly cooking condition optimization reduced the cytotoxicity of the chloraminated cooking water sample by 22 with ec50 increasing from 220 to 282 it was noted that before cooking condition optimization the cytotoxicity of the chlorinated cooking water sample was higher than that of the chloraminated cooking water sample which should mainly result from the higher total organic halogen level positively correlated with the toxicity of a disinfected water sample in the chlorinated cooking water sample han and zhang 2018 moreover as shown in fig 2 in the chlorinated cooking water sample the dominating br dbps were of low molecular weights whereas high molecular weight br dbps were predominant in the chloraminated cooking water sample previous studies have pointed out that the toxicity effects of organic compounds were achieved by narcosis of cell membrane followed by transferring across the cell membrane and reacting with cellular macromolecules and organelles or accumulation in the membrane that hinders its normal function plewa et al 2002 schultz et al 2003 liu and zhang 2014 therefore low molecular weight br dbps might be of higher ability to transfer across the cell membrane and react with cellular macromolecules and organelles more easily and thus exhibited higher cytotoxicity similar results were also found during chlorination of iopamidol that low molecular weight dbps were of higher cytotoxicity than high molecular weight dbps wendel et al 2016 4 conclusions our study proved that bromide was ubiquitously present at significant levels in different types of edible salts especially in sea salts since bromide in edible salts was considered to be safe at most cases it did not attract much attention from researchers however problems occurred when bromide in edible salts react with disinfectants in tap water and organic matter in food in a household cooking process during which formation of polar br dbps was detected and identified with regard to the adverse health effects of polar br dbps practical protocols to minimize their formation during cooking were raised e g a comparatively long time interval between the addition of rice flour and edible salt for chlorinated tap water a comparatively high cooking temperature and a comparatively long cooking time length under optimized cooking conditions the overall cytotoxicity of the chlor am inated cooking water samples could be substantially reduced last but not the least with possible presence of iodine fortifiers in edible salts mixed br i dbps or even mixed cl br i dbps might also be generated during cooking process and thus future studies are suggested to focus on a more comprehensive evaluation of halogenated dbps formed under various cooking conditions declaration of competing interest the authors

18168,environmental management depends on high quality monitoring and its meaningful interpretation the combination of local weather dynamics regional anthropogenic stresses and global environmental changes make the evaluation of monitoring information in dynamic freshwater systems a challenging task while the lake ecosystems gather many complex biogeochemical interactions they remain constrained by the same physical environment of mixing and transport it is therefore crucial to obtain high quality physical system insight three dimensional hydrodynamic models are perfectly suited for providing such information however these models are complex to implement and their use is often limited to modellers here we aim to provide model output via a user friendly platform to a broad audience ranging from scientists to public and governmental stakeholders we present a unified approach merging the apparently diverse interests through meteolakes ch an online platform openly disseminating lake observations and three dimensional numerical simulations in near real time with short term forecasts and data assimilation meteolakes is scalable to a broad range of devices modular and distributed hence allowing its expansion to other regions and hardware infrastructures since 2016 the platform has continuously provided timely synoptic lake information to more than 250 000 users this web based system was built not only to provide guidance to scientists in the design and analysis of field experiments and to foster interdisciplinary lake studies but also to assist governmental agencies and professionals in the long term policy and planning of water resources management finally our system aimed at promoting awareness and understanding of the complexity of lakes and providing information to the public through user friendly interfaces this article details the design and operation of such a platform and its products applications are demonstrated by examples of a recent upwelling and a storm event both cases illustrate how meteolakes help scientists in their quest for process understanding as well as water professionals and civil society in providing specific warnings keywords lake modelling 3d hydrodynamics information dissemination real time monitoring forecasting data assimilation 1 introduction successful environmental management depends on high quality monitoring such information is relevant for the entire management chain from the definitions of environmental goals to planning implementation enforcement and finally to efficiency control a touchstone of effective management is the ability to convert monitoring to meaningful information and actions the complex dynamic response of water bodies to external forcing often hampers any straightforward interpretation of monitoring data external forcing always comes as a combination of long term global environmental changes local anthropogenic influences and short term weather dynamics in lakes a lack of anticipation of those responses can lead to management inefficiency and additional costs as well as compromising long term quality targets the combined costs related to eutrophication in the us freshwater systems amounts to 2 2 billion per year dodds et al 2009 long term eutrophication related issues lead to emergency interventions in response to harmful algae blooms a well known example was the drinking water shutdown on august 2nd 2014 in the vicinity of the city of toledo lake erie affecting more than 500 000 consumers carmichael and boyer 2016 besides the need to predict at short time scales the development and evolution of harmful algae paerl et al 2011 and more generally to prevent human exposure to critical substances and pathogens brookes et al 2004 there are many other environmental risks and human activities requiring attention i e management of heat extraction water level flooding leisure and professional boat navigation and related storm hazards the challenge is that biogeochemical processes are driven by an incommensurable number of reactions yet they are all subject to the same physical environment it is therefore crucial to first establish a high quality representation of the hydrodynamics that is the transport and mixing governed by advection diffusion equations furthermore physical and biogeochemical processes are usually spatially structured bouffard et al 2018 hence traditional in situ monitoring may lack representativeness due to its limited spatial coverage kiefer et al 2015 soulignac et al 2019 this brought to the fore the need for new monitoring programs hering et al 2015 using novel approaches in combining numerical simulations and remote sensing observations vörösmarty et al 2015 the adoption of one dimensional hydrodynamic models is growing at a rapid pace gaudard et al 2017 gaudard et al 2019 bruce et al 2018 kirillin et al 2011 while three dimensional 3d models beyond the expert users have been limited in their applications due to complexity and tedious calibration those latter models are currently the only source of information able of resolving physical processes at the large variety of spatio temporal scales involved in lake dynamics the results of the combination of direct observations and numerical simulations can be disseminated in a timely and comprehensive manner by operational forecasting systems as of today a limited number of operational systems with an integrated data model approach exist to monitor inland waters the most notable is undoubtedly the great lakes operational forecast system glofs https tidesandcurrents noaa gov ofs glofs html initiated more than 25 year ago schwab and bedford 1994 that provides nowcast and forecast guidance of various physical characteristics such as water levels temperature currents and ice cover for the five north american great lakes chu et al 2011 anderson et al 2018 other platforms have been developed such as the online lake modelling tool flake global http www flake igb berlin de model run a platform for the one dimensional estimation of temperature and mixing conditions in any shallow freshwater lake at seasonal scale kirillin et al 2011 the open access platform simstrat https simstrat eawag ch for high frequency lake modelling and statistics data sharing for scientists and practitioners gaudard et al 2019 the 3d monitoring and forecasting tool wis cast applied to a mid sized lake for a duration of three months kimura and wu 2018 or the 3d hydrodynamic model for lake constance bodenseeonline https www lubw baden wuerttemberg de wasser bodenseeonline nevertheless the number of online lake operational systems remains limited particularly when compared to the widespread use and development of meteorological and coastal ocean systems kourafalou et al 2015 in this study we present a near real time monitoring and forecasting system for lakes with its online platform meteolakes ch this platform aimed at a paradigm shift in how lakes are studied and monitored by providing the following possibilities i an unified user friendly data visualisation platform for citizens water professionals and scientists ii an open access to the model output for historical and forecasting data and iii an uncertainty quantification of model output through data assimilation these requirements warrant an optimal dissemination of data open access to the data facilitation of short term decision making user friendly visualisation and possible use of the output data uncertainty quantification meteolakes processes and disseminates past present and future spatial information derived by harnessing the combined potential of in situ measurements space borne remote sensing observations and numerical simulations to create a dynamic synoptic view of the entire lake operational since 2016 the system provides open access to lake environmental information to up to thousand daily visitors concerning recreational activities hazard warnings risk assessment and scientific phenomena besides the short term interests such information is used for long term planning and management decisions this article provides an overview of meteolakes its technical design and implementation observational and modelling components finally data products are showcased through two examples of notable meso scale physical phenomena including a strong upwelling and a storm event which affected commercial and recreational activities in and around the lake 2 methods meteolakes is a unified solution benefitting all interested in lakes the platform gathers into a single system the apparently disconnected objectives of public and governmental stakeholders for this purpose we designed an online data platform including an application programming interface api and real time data processing chains to openly distribute modelled key hydrodynamic variables with a state of the art uncertainty quantification through data assimilation and a complete spatio temporal coverage of the lake in near real time with short term forecasts meteolakes ultimately combines lake hydrodynamic simulations in situ measurements and remote sensing observations this section provides an overview on the data composition and acquisition scheme the computational framework key model components and the online interface 2 1 platform components the flowchart shown in fig 1 summarizes the system processes and key tasks software and hardware components the following subsections briefly describe the main components of the web based platform currently hydrodynamic processes in four lakes are available on meteolakes lake geneva lake zurich lake biel and greifensee yet the system can be scaled up to include additional others lakes moreover the architecture of the platform allows porting this system for worldwide applications by adding support for the local meteorological weather forcing in the absence of national weather products the latter can be achieved using european centre for medium range weather forecasts worldwide high resolution 9 km atmospheric products ecmwf hres for sake of simplicity we focus here on lake geneva only 2 1 1 study site lake geneva locally le léman is the largest freshwater lake of western europe maximum depth surface area and volume of 309 m 580 km2 and 89 km3 respectively it is located between switzerland and france 46 458 n 6 528 e in the perialpine region at an altitude of 372 m the mean hydraulic retention time is 11 4 years with its main tributary the rhône river located at the eastern end accounting for 75 of the water flow entering the lake average 1986 2013 of 184 m3 s lake geneva has a dam operated regulated outflow located at the western end in geneva complete deep convective mixing occurs only every 5 to 10 winters in lake geneva schwefel et al 2016 average wind speeds above the lake are in the range of 1 2 m s and currents reach speeds of 0 3 m s on windy days with wind speeds 5 m s 2 1 2 hydrodynamics computations delft3d flow the open source modelling suite delft3d flow deltares netherlands has been used for this system platform detailed hydrodynamic numerical model description can be found in the delft3d flow manual deltares 2015 this model has been extensively calibrated and validated for lake geneva bouffard et al 2018 baracchini et al 2019a 2019b soulignac et al 2018 2019 the current setup includes a 450 m horizontal grid resolution and 100 unevenly distributed from 20 cm at the surface to several m in the hypolimnion vertical z layers layers are horizontal and do not follow the lake bed with a time stepping of 1 min subgrid processes are parameterized with the κ ε turbulence closure model the model has initially been started from an in situ temperature profile taken at the deepest location in january 2015 and has been running continuously since then the model is forced by a time varying set of two dimensional meteorological data see below and by the river inflow data of the main tributaries see below meteorological forcing meteoswiss cosmo 1 and cosmo e products meteoswiss 2019a 2019b are used as meteorological forcing seven variables are extracted from those files by the model pre processor figs 1 and 2 wind speed wind direction solar radiation air pressure cloud cover relative humidity and air temperature cosmo 1 products are provided on a 1 1 km grid with hourly resolution cosmo e provide hourly forecasts over 120 h at a reduced spatial grid resolution 2 2 km model hindcasts are forced with cosmo 1 reanalyses while meteolakes daily forecasts are forced by cosmo e forecasts rivers forcing and water levels river data consists of discharge and water temperature collected at 10 min intervals by the federal office of the environment foen water level measurements are collected in real time and sent daily from the foen file transfer protocol ftp server water levels allow a hydrological budget closure and modelling of lake water level changes once received the files are corrected with various integrity checks including removal of duplicates removal of incoherent observations and inference of missing data the system then forecasts the next 4 5 days of river temperature and discharge based on hybrid models for river temperatures toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and statistical models marques et al 2006 for the other parameters flows and water levels more details on the entire procedure and the hydrological budget are available in appendix a this entire processing is monitored by the hypervisor fig 1 which warns the administrator via e mails when encountering missing or incoherent data and solution selected to circumvent the problem 2 1 3 remote sensing monitoring the space borne advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr sensor has been selected as the operational remote sensing data source its moderate spatial 1 km and high temporal 10 overpasses per day resolution enables the real time monitoring of the lake surface water temperature lswt and meso scale to basin scale lake dynamics the partnering oeschger centre at the university of bern has an operational data downlink from satellites which facilitated the access to the data the avhrr lswt retrieval process with locally adapted split window coefficients for lake geneva is described in lieberherr et al 2017 and lieberherr and wunderle 2018 the avhrr information is transferred to meteolakes local database using a ftp server for additional screening and comparison with the model the filtering on meteolakes local server fig 1 includes removing pixels with quality levels lower than 4 lieberherr and wunderle 2018 data is then mapped to the model grid compared with its corresponding model lswt field and uploaded via ftp to meteolakes web server the avhrr skin temperature is directly compared with the model bulk temperature and no skin to bulk conversion is applied in this current version due to the non trivial parameterization when both wind and convective processes play significant roles for the near surface turbulence differences due to skin effects can thereby be expected the update of the local database and comparison with the model is performed every 3 h fig 2 2 1 4 in situ monitoring a small nearshore permanent station located in shallow waters off the town of buchillon has been instrumented with various meteorological and in water sensors those include thermistors located at 1 m and 35 m depth and two radiometers heitronics pyrometer kt15ii measuring lake skin temperature meteorological observations include air temperature solar radiation wind speed and direction humidity dew point and air pressure a programmable campbell scientific controller with data logger and a gprs module ensures real time transmission of the data as well as modification of the setup when needed the data collection and update of the local database is performed on an hourly basis fig 2 and uploaded online on meteolakes ch all measured data are shared publicly on the web platform 2 1 5 data assimilation forecast uncertainties and more robust hindcasts are achieved by implementing a data assimilative operational model such an upgrade is needed to make optimal use of satellite based surface information drusch et al 2009 and in situ data the application of advanced data assimilation techniques with data from various sources across multiple spatio temporal scales is rare van velzen and verlaan 2007 it is however needed to effectively quantify and reduce the uncertainties of data products capable of providing actionable guidance and enabling risk based decision making coccia and todini 2011 pappenberger et al 2007 2008 thielen et al 2009 weerts et al 2011 in this study a data assimilative ensemble approach has been implemented to optimally combine the three information sources in an operational context the approach aims at quantifying and reducing system uncertainties while accounting for both observational and model errors technical details and the development of the open source tools are described in baracchini et al 2019a the same procedure developed for lake geneva is used in this study we briefly describe here the real time operations and information flow of such a method an ensemble kalman filter with 20 members is used to combine lswt with the hydrodynamics computations the avhrr data candidate for assimilation is filtered using the real time in situ monitoring station section 2 1 4 the thermistor located at 1 m depth selects satellite images with a temperature mismatch lower than 1 c compared to the bulk temperature at 1 m fig 1 this allows to circumvent translating the satellite skin temperature into water bulk temperature in addition to providing its uncertainty estimates as described in baracchini et al 2019a a localization scheme with a 15 km cut off distance is used model uncertainty is accounted for through the addition of spatio temporally correlated noise into the wind fields cosmo e statistical products containing the wind standard deviation are used to define the wind noise properties model noise processor fig 1 a maximum of one satellite image is assimilated per day with a maximum of five images per week to ensure the operational requirements our approach aimed at being operational and the upper limit of assimilated images is so far constrained by operational computational resources with the goal to provide output in 6 h hence we arbitrarily limited the amount of information being assimilated 2 2 computational framework meteolakes model computations and data processing are performed on a local server fig 1 the machine comprises two intel xeon e5 2697v4 with 256 gb of error correcting code random access memory and a raid 1 configured storage solution while the system has been built to be computationally easily distributed so far all numerical simulations are performed on this machine the 3d hydrodynamic simulations are run daily fig 2 every day the system computes the hydrodynamics of the lake starting arbitrarily from the previous sunday at 00h00 using cosmo 1 gridded surface meteorological reanalysis and tributaries observations model restart conditions are generated on sundays by a computation comprising the entire previous week and using reanalysis forcing forecasts from the previous day are overwritten the next day by the new nowcast cycle thereafter those daily computations perform a 4 5 days hydrodynamic forecast using the cosmo e products and river forecast model section 2 1 2 the automation of the processing tasks related to the numerical modelling is performed by powershell scripts triggered by the windows task scheduler at 8h00 in the morning fig 2 middle panel the river model model pre post processors and supervisor are coded in matlab and are called by the powershell scripting the pre processor formats river and meteorological data into delft3d flow input files the post processor creates netcdf and csv model output files by extracting and saving only specific fields e g temperature flow velocity grid information at a reduced spatial resolution to optimize storage load and the online user experience finally the supervisor analyses model results to automatically detect configured physical processes of interest in the current version monitored physical processes include upwelling by k means clustering high surface flow velocities and out of bounds cold warm waters at various depths the supervisor acts as an early warning system by sending information e mails with text and image detailing the intensity and location of the event to a list of subscribers via the meteolakes web server 2 3 web interface meteolakes includes two pathways for data dissemination with different target users the majority of users interact with meteolakes through its online interface meteolakes ch here the main objective is to provide immediate comprehensive interactive lake information on the website advanced users however request data with the api which provides the users that information in a simple format a smooth web navigation is critical to have the proposed monitoring system widely adopted by the civil society and lake professionals meteolakes online interface benefits from web 2 0 concepts with in particular optimized user data interaction and intuitive information exchange through simple and responsive designs moreover the meteolakes ch web interface has been built with platform and display scalability in mind for a seamless experience on a broad range of devices smartphone computer and tablet advanced users can generate url links which are interpreted by the server running the developed back end application the api extracts the desired dataset from the model netcdf output files and send it back to the user in formatted csv files detailed explanations on how to use the api and available data can be found directly on meteolakes ch at the following link http meteolakes ch data both interfaces are detailed in appendix b 3 products and application examples 3 1 meteolakes in this section we provide an overview of the meteolakes online products we start by describing the various interface elements followed by examples on how such elements can be used for practical assessments of physical phenomena two examples are presented an upwelling and a storm event with high local currents an illustration of meteolakes ch homepage is presented in fig 3 two animated maps show the lswt of lake geneva on the left and currents on the right computed by the delft3d flow hydrodynamic model for the time indicated in the top panel several drop down menus are available in the upper navigation bar one can select the lake currently four the year starting in 2009 the week and depth of interest the hydrodynamic interface displays weekly periods for each moment the absolute time and the position in the time frame slider are shown to the user the time slider is blue for forecasts and grey for the past in addition to basic functionalities such as zoom and displacement the maps can be clicked to obtain time series at selected locations fig 4 for systems with data assimilation e g lake geneva the time series will further show the uncertainty of the model by displaying the min and max of all ensemble members as shown in fig 4 the temperature map has two additional tabs providing a visualisation of temperature over depth at predefined transects along the main axes of the lake they allow the visualisation of stratification and mixing the flow velocity map has a secondary tab enabling a particle tracking mode when this mode is selected the user has the possibility to release particles online at any spatial location on the horizontal plane and over depth and to follow their trajectories particles are treated as passive tracers they are only advected horizontally by the user defined model layer and are not impacted by vertical mixing nor settling finally at the bottom of the web page fig 3 a navigation bar allows access to the in situ measurements the remote sensing validation the api documentation and various additional system information figs 5 and 6 are examples of respective in situ measurements and remote sensing observations as displayed on meteolakes ch fig 5 shows the water temperature at 1 m depth blue 35 m depth red and radiometric skin temperature orange measured at the buchillon station for in situ measurements the user has the possibility to define a period of interest starting late 2016 this data is available in near real time maximum delay of 1 h seven additional atmospheric variables are available not shown here remote sensing observations and a comparison with the modelled lswt are also available in near real time through the remote sensing tab fig 6 it is worth noting that although the avhrr data upper right plot have been filtered based on its quality flags section 2 1 3 no skin to bulk conversion is applied and the data is directly compared with model surface bulk temperature upper left plot fig 6 provides a spatial lower left plot and a temporal lower right plot overview of model deviations with respect to the avhrr skin temperature the temporal evolution is shown by displaying the median difference blue dot along with the 10th and 90th percentiles of those offsets green bars for each image model comparison it is possible to cycle through this temporal comparison to visualize each satellite image and corresponding model snapshot 3 2 upwelling event on 29th june 2017 a large upwelling was forecasted for the western basin of lake geneva fig 7 shows modelled temperature before left plots and during right plots the event left plots show a rather uniform and warm 21 c lswt on 30th june with a stratified profile and a thermocline around 15 m depth less than two days later the surface shows a large horizontal thermal gradient resulting from a strong westerly wind event with lswt 10 c colder on the western part of the lake compared to the main basin the bottom right plot indicates that the stratification has been broken in the western basin with a full upwelling of hypolimnetic water up to the surface the signature of the upwelling and following basin scale internal waves oscillations are also evident at the buchillon station fig 5 from in situ measurements located some 10 km away from the main upwelling zone there lswt dropped on june 29th immediately followed by a temperature rise both at the surface and at 35 m depth due to gravitational adjustment through the propagation of internal kelvin waves bouffard and lemmin 2013 such full upwelling did not only affect the lake but also the outflow water for millions of downstream residents as evidenced by the measured and modelled temperature at the outlet of lake geneva fig 8 in fig 8 both model and observation were in good agreement timing and intensity rmse 0 8 c and showed a 12 c drop in temperature in the downstream water over 2 days the uncertainties are not shown in this figure as the event occurred before the operational data assimilation scheme was implemented looking at the meteorological forcing which created the upwelling event we found that it is the result of long lasting winds blowing from south west the consequences of upwellings for the lake ecosystem and the downstream water remain poorly investigated one reason is the lack of monitoring tools for meso scale processes and the difficulty to conduct specific field measurements to track transient phenomena such as the illustrated event open access forecasting systems such as meteolakes can help planning field measurements and open new opportunities for understanding such processes and monitoring their magnitude and spatial extent in this study a diagnostic system to automatically detect and warn users has been developed the method is based on a k means clustering method splitting the lswt in two clusters when the centroid difference of those clusters is larger than 4 c an alert is triggered by the supervisor figs 1 and 2 in the case of lake geneva the developed early warning system allowed the subscribers to closely monitor such events during the course of two years 2017 and 2018 by being warned about possible occurrences up to four days in advance using a similar approach i e comparing a lake model grid point with outlet river temperature measurements we observed and modelled 6 and 16 respectively upwellings with a sudden drop of surface temperature by more than 5 c respectively 2 c at the eastern end of lake geneva between april and november 2016 3 3 storm induced lake currents lake forecasting systems are also relevant for predicting the dynamic effects of extreme storms the sudden high speed wind event from 6th august 2018 is an illustrative example for the application of such predictive approaches fig 9 illustrates the surface currents as a result of a spatially localized north eastern coastal wind event timing was critical as the storm lasted less than 3 h as shown by the plots before upper left during main plot and after upper right the event surface flows 3 h before the event were in the range of 0 2 0 3 m s during peak intensity at 18h00 currents reached 0 8 m s in the red patch of fig 9 before returning to 0 2 0 3 m s 3 h later the inset in fig 9 shows the devastating wind waves in vevey harbour on the north eastern shore while two physical phenomena are described in this study other processes with significant implications for the biogeochemistry of the lake are visible on the platform for instance gyres have been found to structure the lateral dispersion of primary productivity soomets et al 2019 as a result of the coriolis force and subsequent strong up down lifts of the thermocline those structures are repeatedly observed in lake geneva bouffard et al 2018 kiefer et al 2015 we refer the reader to meteolakes ch in order to visualize two of those events 1 november 3rd 2015 week 45 on meteolakes and 2 december 3rd 2018 week 48 visible in fig 3 in that regard we found that these recurrent gyre systems are the response of a prevalent north eastern wind and that they decay within weeks after those wind patterns dissipate 4 discussion platform acceptance since its deployment mid 2016 meteolakes has provided lake information to more than 250 000 users its usage reached an average of 1000 daily visitors in mid summer 2019 the platform demonstrated its effectiveness in disseminating both 3d model results and lake observations from satellites and in situ sensors analysis of logging data showed that 51 of connexion logs come from smartphones 41 from computers and 8 from tablets with 78 of the traffic originating from switzerland this device log distribution indicates that we created a scalable and responsive interface to distribute lake data we distinguish three categories of users from the platform i civil society ii lake professionals and iii scientists comments posted on the android application and articles in newspapers indicate that the civil society has positively received and used the web based platform with main interests in lake temperature and currents for recreational activities navigation swimming this category of lake users is also characterised by a strong seasonal variability with most activity over the summer period lake professionals such as fishermen contribute to a regular stream of visits independent of the season platform applications the web based interface allows the visualisation of vertical transects or any horizontal layer to detect zones of interest such as dynamic areas with strong temperature gradients the possibility to display near future currents and lake temperature at specific coordinates is also used by beach operators on their respective websites the upwelling event and associated 12 c temperature drop illustrated on figs 7 and 8 show the importance of monitoring and predicting lake surface nearshore temperature warning messages related to storm conditions on the lake as shown on fig 9 are also particularly relevant for lake professionals finally the possibility to interactively add passive tracers at selected coordinates and water depth and thereby evaluate the dispersion of pollutants is expected to help drinking water intake operators in case of contamination the practical benefit of the web based platform regarding dynamic pollution tracking has not yet been evaluated finally the use of meteolakes by scientists is now well established two approaches can be distinguished first such a model allows putting the in situ and satellite information into a basin scale context this approach has contributed for instance to the interpretation of negatively correlated remotely sensed temperature and chlorophyll areas which ultimately result from upwelling and basin scale internal waves propagation lifting the thermocline and deep chlorophyll maxima upward bouffard et al 2018 similarly the use of archived modelled data helped in identifying the source and the spatial distribution of a remotely sensed calcite precipitation event nouchi et al 2019 further investigation of such transient processes will require specific in situ measurements the forecasting mode of meteolakes is currently used for identifying areas warranting the deployment of in situ sensors in a similar way as suggested by baschek et al 2017 a global upscale of the platform is finally technically possible but would require large computer resources such global scale approaches are nowadays done with 1d model woolway and merchant 2019 and cannot account for spatially varying physical processes such as basin scale internal waves upwelling and ekman pumping or gyre circulations all affecting the biogeochemical responses of the trophogenic surface layer impacts of the platform are observed by three different types of stakeholders first the online system guides scientists in the design and planning of field campaigns and opens new frontiers for research on interdisciplinary processes this is particularly relevant for transient dynamic phenomena such as upwellings gyres or biogeochemical events such as algae blooms wynne et al 2013 whiting events nouchi et al 2019 which are difficult to observe using in situ observations without a priori knowledge second lake related professionals such as fishermen beach operators rescue organisations drinking water facilities and engineering consultants access information for diverse reasons third hundreds of citizen use meteolakes on a daily basis for recreational activities such as navigation and swimming or to discover the beauty of lake dynamics related to distinct weather events 5 conclusions like most environmental systems lakes are undergoing various stresses from global and local influences seriously compromising the ecosystem services they provide given that a large part of humanity lives near freshwater bodies reactions to extreme weather events can have drastic economical and human costs our current view of the problem is based on reanalysis of historical data and hindcasts while such classical approaches have provided tremendous amount of information many challenges are clearly unreachable with such frameworks specifically we are currently poorly prepared to react to short term transient events such as localized pollution harmful algae bloom upwelling events or storms furthermore such episodic features with localised influence are often difficult to study the coverage of those scales is only achieved by the combination and timely distribution of three types of information i in situ measurements ii remote sensing observations and iii model simulations here we have developed a new web based operational modelling platform allowing scientists lake professionals and citizens to easily access historical current and short term forecasting of lakes dynamics this platform is a step toward merging apparently disconnected interests of environmental aware citizens professionals and scientists interested in the fundamentals of the system practically the challenge is solved by providing an effectively functioning and interactive scalable interface together with an efficient archiving approach allowing open access to data and a forecasting mode importantly data assimilation of remotely sensed lake surface temperature allows quantifying the temporal and spatial evolution of the model uncertainty the presented platform meteolakes has provided spatio temporal lake temperature and currents to more than 250 000 visitors over the last three years and has been featured in numerous local media public events and museum exhibitions meteolakes propose a new way of disseminating model results through a modern approach combining i integration of in situ observation remotely sensed data and hydrodynamic models ii a user friendly web based visualisation of results for a broad audience from scientists to citizens and iii open access to model output with uncertainty quantification provided by data assimilation and iv operation forecast we believe that the combination of all these criteria combined into a platform for the first time with meteolakes is a necessary condition for the community to make major progress in science meteolakes is not a static platform instead the concept of meteolakes is that new features can be installed over times other lakes more post processing capabilities other in situ observation yet the goal to advance in science will remain to engage scientists via meteolakes in a more transparent and communicative way to openly provide

2020 115529 appendix a river data and hydrological budget closure flow and temperature are provided in real time for the rhône river inlet and outlet fig 2 lake water levels are collected 4 km east from the buchillon station along the shore at 10 min intervals finally the data foen also contains 4 5 days forecasts of the rhône river inflow based on meteoswiss cosmo e products after the daily download from the foen ftp server the data passes various integrity checks the filtering includes removal of duplicates removal of incoherent observations and inference of missing data specifically timestamp are checked to identify duplicate data and out of physically prescribed range data are scanned and automatically remover finally inference of missing data and 4 5 days forecast of the outflow are estimated by singular spectrum analysis forecasting marques et al 2006 using the first four principal components when both the lake outflow and inflow from the rhône river measurements and forecasts are available for the computational period the contributions from the remaining rivers are generated by the river model two methods have been implemented in meteolakes the first one considers a constant lake volume and the difference of the outflow with the rhône inflow is spread among the remaining three tributaries the second method currently used on the platform aims at reproducing the water level variations of the lake and therefore requires additional data water levels measurements in this method a gaussian filter is first applied to the observed water level time series to remove the high frequency signature from surface seiches the water levels time series then undergoes singular spectrum analysis forecasting to generate the next 4 5 days of forecasts for each time step i the missing flow q i m is given by a1 q i m q i o u t q i r h ô n e i n a h d h i d t i with q i out the outflow from lake geneva fig 2 q i rhône in the inflow from the rhône a the surface area of the lake as a function of its water level h and dh the change in lake water level during time step dt i the remaining flow q i m is then distributed among the three remaining rivers based on the flow contribution over the past 20 years cases of negative values are accounted for and mitigated additional filters ensure the remaining flow is coherent finally river temperature is needed to drive the model for the rhône real time measurements are used however for the remaining rivers or rhône temperature forecasts a physical model is operated from the work of toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 it is possible to estimate the river temperature as a function of air temperature and discharge this is achieved with the following integration a2 d t r i v e r d t 1 δ a 1 a 2 t a i r

the time and the duration of a year in the same units as t respectively and θ q r i v e r q r i v e r is the dimensionless discharge b web interface b1 online web application the angularjs open source javascript based front end framework is used to facilitate the web application development we make use of various existing libraries and protocols such as the leaflet map api asynchronous server client data transfers for a spatially enabled and responsive content to reduce computational load on the server the vast majority of meteolakes processing and rendering is performed client side apache cordova a mobile application development framework allowed wrapping up the css html and javascript code into a packaged android application this enabled a distribution on the google play store without the need to develop a truly native mobile application using platform specific apis meteolakes android app can be downloaded at the following link https play google com store apps details id ch epfl meteolakes hl fr ch the results stored on the web server which are processed by the web interface or mobile application are in text file format upon user request additional results can be displayed e g temperature and flow velocity at different depth those are provided directly by the api from model results files located on the local server fig 1 b2 application programming interface following user demands for raw data access and additional spatial information we developed an api meteolakes api is built using the open source node js runtime environment node js allows the execution of javascript code outside the browser in our case it runs server side directly on the meteolakes compute and local server fig 1 data requests are made by generating url links which are interpreted by the server running the node js application the developed back end application runs as background task constantly listening to a port on which the requests are made when receiving a request the server will extract in the model netcdf output files the desired dataset and send it back to the user the data is sent in formatted csv files due to the relatively large size model files can have we decided to have the api directly interact with the local server computing the hydrodynamic models rather than interacting with meteolakes ch web server as the latter would require having significantly more file transfers more information on how to use the api are available directly on meteolakes ch at the following link http meteolakes ch data 
18168,environmental management depends on high quality monitoring and its meaningful interpretation the combination of local weather dynamics regional anthropogenic stresses and global environmental changes make the evaluation of monitoring information in dynamic freshwater systems a challenging task while the lake ecosystems gather many complex biogeochemical interactions they remain constrained by the same physical environment of mixing and transport it is therefore crucial to obtain high quality physical system insight three dimensional hydrodynamic models are perfectly suited for providing such information however these models are complex to implement and their use is often limited to modellers here we aim to provide model output via a user friendly platform to a broad audience ranging from scientists to public and governmental stakeholders we present a unified approach merging the apparently diverse interests through meteolakes ch an online platform openly disseminating lake observations and three dimensional numerical simulations in near real time with short term forecasts and data assimilation meteolakes is scalable to a broad range of devices modular and distributed hence allowing its expansion to other regions and hardware infrastructures since 2016 the platform has continuously provided timely synoptic lake information to more than 250 000 users this web based system was built not only to provide guidance to scientists in the design and analysis of field experiments and to foster interdisciplinary lake studies but also to assist governmental agencies and professionals in the long term policy and planning of water resources management finally our system aimed at promoting awareness and understanding of the complexity of lakes and providing information to the public through user friendly interfaces this article details the design and operation of such a platform and its products applications are demonstrated by examples of a recent upwelling and a storm event both cases illustrate how meteolakes help scientists in their quest for process understanding as well as water professionals and civil society in providing specific warnings keywords lake modelling 3d hydrodynamics information dissemination real time monitoring forecasting data assimilation 1 introduction successful environmental management depends on high quality monitoring such information is relevant for the entire management chain from the definitions of environmental goals to planning implementation enforcement and finally to efficiency control a touchstone of effective management is the ability to convert monitoring to meaningful information and actions the complex dynamic response of water bodies to external forcing often hampers any straightforward interpretation of monitoring data external forcing always comes as a combination of long term global environmental changes local anthropogenic influences and short term weather dynamics in lakes a lack of anticipation of those responses can lead to management inefficiency and additional costs as well as compromising long term quality targets the combined costs related to eutrophication in the us freshwater systems amounts to 2 2 billion per year dodds et al 2009 long term eutrophication related issues lead to emergency interventions in response to harmful algae blooms a well known example was the drinking water shutdown on august 2nd 2014 in the vicinity of the city of toledo lake erie affecting more than 500 000 consumers carmichael and boyer 2016 besides the need to predict at short time scales the development and evolution of harmful algae paerl et al 2011 and more generally to prevent human exposure to critical substances and pathogens brookes et al 2004 there are many other environmental risks and human activities requiring attention i e management of heat extraction water level flooding leisure and professional boat navigation and related storm hazards the challenge is that biogeochemical processes are driven by an incommensurable number of reactions yet they are all subject to the same physical environment it is therefore crucial to first establish a high quality representation of the hydrodynamics that is the transport and mixing governed by advection diffusion equations furthermore physical and biogeochemical processes are usually spatially structured bouffard et al 2018 hence traditional in situ monitoring may lack representativeness due to its limited spatial coverage kiefer et al 2015 soulignac et al 2019 this brought to the fore the need for new monitoring programs hering et al 2015 using novel approaches in combining numerical simulations and remote sensing observations vörösmarty et al 2015 the adoption of one dimensional hydrodynamic models is growing at a rapid pace gaudard et al 2017 gaudard et al 2019 bruce et al 2018 kirillin et al 2011 while three dimensional 3d models beyond the expert users have been limited in their applications due to complexity and tedious calibration those latter models are currently the only source of information able of resolving physical processes at the large variety of spatio temporal scales involved in lake dynamics the results of the combination of direct observations and numerical simulations can be disseminated in a timely and comprehensive manner by operational forecasting systems as of today a limited number of operational systems with an integrated data model approach exist to monitor inland waters the most notable is undoubtedly the great lakes operational forecast system glofs https tidesandcurrents noaa gov ofs glofs html initiated more than 25 year ago schwab and bedford 1994 that provides nowcast and forecast guidance of various physical characteristics such as water levels temperature currents and ice cover for the five north american great lakes chu et al 2011 anderson et al 2018 other platforms have been developed such as the online lake modelling tool flake global http www flake igb berlin de model run a platform for the one dimensional estimation of temperature and mixing conditions in any shallow freshwater lake at seasonal scale kirillin et al 2011 the open access platform simstrat https simstrat eawag ch for high frequency lake modelling and statistics data sharing for scientists and practitioners gaudard et al 2019 the 3d monitoring and forecasting tool wis cast applied to a mid sized lake for a duration of three months kimura and wu 2018 or the 3d hydrodynamic model for lake constance bodenseeonline https www lubw baden wuerttemberg de wasser bodenseeonline nevertheless the number of online lake operational systems remains limited particularly when compared to the widespread use and development of meteorological and coastal ocean systems kourafalou et al 2015 in this study we present a near real time monitoring and forecasting system for lakes with its online platform meteolakes ch this platform aimed at a paradigm shift in how lakes are studied and monitored by providing the following possibilities i an unified user friendly data visualisation platform for citizens water professionals and scientists ii an open access to the model output for historical and forecasting data and iii an uncertainty quantification of model output through data assimilation these requirements warrant an optimal dissemination of data open access to the data facilitation of short term decision making user friendly visualisation and possible use of the output data uncertainty quantification meteolakes processes and disseminates past present and future spatial information derived by harnessing the combined potential of in situ measurements space borne remote sensing observations and numerical simulations to create a dynamic synoptic view of the entire lake operational since 2016 the system provides open access to lake environmental information to up to thousand daily visitors concerning recreational activities hazard warnings risk assessment and scientific phenomena besides the short term interests such information is used for long term planning and management decisions this article provides an overview of meteolakes its technical design and implementation observational and modelling components finally data products are showcased through two examples of notable meso scale physical phenomena including a strong upwelling and a storm event which affected commercial and recreational activities in and around the lake 2 methods meteolakes is a unified solution benefitting all interested in lakes the platform gathers into a single system the apparently disconnected objectives of public and governmental stakeholders for this purpose we designed an online data platform including an application programming interface api and real time data processing chains to openly distribute modelled key hydrodynamic variables with a state of the art uncertainty quantification through data assimilation and a complete spatio temporal coverage of the lake in near real time with short term forecasts meteolakes ultimately combines lake hydrodynamic simulations in situ measurements and remote sensing observations this section provides an overview on the data composition and acquisition scheme the computational framework key model components and the online interface 2 1 platform components the flowchart shown in fig 1 summarizes the system processes and key tasks software and hardware components the following subsections briefly describe the main components of the web based platform currently hydrodynamic processes in four lakes are available on meteolakes lake geneva lake zurich lake biel and greifensee yet the system can be scaled up to include additional others lakes moreover the architecture of the platform allows porting this system for worldwide applications by adding support for the local meteorological weather forcing in the absence of national weather products the latter can be achieved using european centre for medium range weather forecasts worldwide high resolution 9 km atmospheric products ecmwf hres for sake of simplicity we focus here on lake geneva only 2 1 1 study site lake geneva locally le léman is the largest freshwater lake of western europe maximum depth surface area and volume of 309 m 580 km2 and 89 km3 respectively it is located between switzerland and france 46 458 n 6 528 e in the perialpine region at an altitude of 372 m the mean hydraulic retention time is 11 4 years with its main tributary the rhône river located at the eastern end accounting for 75 of the water flow entering the lake average 1986 2013 of 184 m3 s lake geneva has a dam operated regulated outflow located at the western end in geneva complete deep convective mixing occurs only every 5 to 10 winters in lake geneva schwefel et al 2016 average wind speeds above the lake are in the range of 1 2 m s and currents reach speeds of 0 3 m s on windy days with wind speeds 5 m s 2 1 2 hydrodynamics computations delft3d flow the open source modelling suite delft3d flow deltares netherlands has been used for this system platform detailed hydrodynamic numerical model description can be found in the delft3d flow manual deltares 2015 this model has been extensively calibrated and validated for lake geneva bouffard et al 2018 baracchini et al 2019a 2019b soulignac et al 2018 2019 the current setup includes a 450 m horizontal grid resolution and 100 unevenly distributed from 20 cm at the surface to several m in the hypolimnion vertical z layers layers are horizontal and do not follow the lake bed with a time stepping of 1 min subgrid processes are parameterized with the κ ε turbulence closure model the model has initially been started from an in situ temperature profile taken at the deepest location in january 2015 and has been running continuously since then the model is forced by a time varying set of two dimensional meteorological data see below and by the river inflow data of the main tributaries see below meteorological forcing meteoswiss cosmo 1 and cosmo e products meteoswiss 2019a 2019b are used as meteorological forcing seven variables are extracted from those files by the model pre processor figs 1 and 2 wind speed wind direction solar radiation air pressure cloud cover relative humidity and air temperature cosmo 1 products are provided on a 1 1 km grid with hourly resolution cosmo e provide hourly forecasts over 120 h at a reduced spatial grid resolution 2 2 km model hindcasts are forced with cosmo 1 reanalyses while meteolakes daily forecasts are forced by cosmo e forecasts rivers forcing and water levels river data consists of discharge and water temperature collected at 10 min intervals by the federal office of the environment foen water level measurements are collected in real time and sent daily from the foen file transfer protocol ftp server water levels allow a hydrological budget closure and modelling of lake water level changes once received the files are corrected with various integrity checks including removal of duplicates removal of incoherent observations and inference of missing data the system then forecasts the next 4 5 days of river temperature and discharge based on hybrid models for river temperatures toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 and statistical models marques et al 2006 for the other parameters flows and water levels more details on the entire procedure and the hydrological budget are available in appendix a this entire processing is monitored by the hypervisor fig 1 which warns the administrator via e mails when encountering missing or incoherent data and solution selected to circumvent the problem 2 1 3 remote sensing monitoring the space borne advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr sensor has been selected as the operational remote sensing data source its moderate spatial 1 km and high temporal 10 overpasses per day resolution enables the real time monitoring of the lake surface water temperature lswt and meso scale to basin scale lake dynamics the partnering oeschger centre at the university of bern has an operational data downlink from satellites which facilitated the access to the data the avhrr lswt retrieval process with locally adapted split window coefficients for lake geneva is described in lieberherr et al 2017 and lieberherr and wunderle 2018 the avhrr information is transferred to meteolakes local database using a ftp server for additional screening and comparison with the model the filtering on meteolakes local server fig 1 includes removing pixels with quality levels lower than 4 lieberherr and wunderle 2018 data is then mapped to the model grid compared with its corresponding model lswt field and uploaded via ftp to meteolakes web server the avhrr skin temperature is directly compared with the model bulk temperature and no skin to bulk conversion is applied in this current version due to the non trivial parameterization when both wind and convective processes play significant roles for the near surface turbulence differences due to skin effects can thereby be expected the update of the local database and comparison with the model is performed every 3 h fig 2 2 1 4 in situ monitoring a small nearshore permanent station located in shallow waters off the town of buchillon has been instrumented with various meteorological and in water sensors those include thermistors located at 1 m and 35 m depth and two radiometers heitronics pyrometer kt15ii measuring lake skin temperature meteorological observations include air temperature solar radiation wind speed and direction humidity dew point and air pressure a programmable campbell scientific controller with data logger and a gprs module ensures real time transmission of the data as well as modification of the setup when needed the data collection and update of the local database is performed on an hourly basis fig 2 and uploaded online on meteolakes ch all measured data are shared publicly on the web platform 2 1 5 data assimilation forecast uncertainties and more robust hindcasts are achieved by implementing a data assimilative operational model such an upgrade is needed to make optimal use of satellite based surface information drusch et al 2009 and in situ data the application of advanced data assimilation techniques with data from various sources across multiple spatio temporal scales is rare van velzen and verlaan 2007 it is however needed to effectively quantify and reduce the uncertainties of data products capable of providing actionable guidance and enabling risk based decision making coccia and todini 2011 pappenberger et al 2007 2008 thielen et al 2009 weerts et al 2011 in this study a data assimilative ensemble approach has been implemented to optimally combine the three information sources in an operational context the approach aims at quantifying and reducing system uncertainties while accounting for both observational and model errors technical details and the development of the open source tools are described in baracchini et al 2019a the same procedure developed for lake geneva is used in this study we briefly describe here the real time operations and information flow of such a method an ensemble kalman filter with 20 members is used to combine lswt with the hydrodynamics computations the avhrr data candidate for assimilation is filtered using the real time in situ monitoring station section 2 1 4 the thermistor located at 1 m depth selects satellite images with a temperature mismatch lower than 1 c compared to the bulk temperature at 1 m fig 1 this allows to circumvent translating the satellite skin temperature into water bulk temperature in addition to providing its uncertainty estimates as described in baracchini et al 2019a a localization scheme with a 15 km cut off distance is used model uncertainty is accounted for through the addition of spatio temporally correlated noise into the wind fields cosmo e statistical products containing the wind standard deviation are used to define the wind noise properties model noise processor fig 1 a maximum of one satellite image is assimilated per day with a maximum of five images per week to ensure the operational requirements our approach aimed at being operational and the upper limit of assimilated images is so far constrained by operational computational resources with the goal to provide output in 6 h hence we arbitrarily limited the amount of information being assimilated 2 2 computational framework meteolakes model computations and data processing are performed on a local server fig 1 the machine comprises two intel xeon e5 2697v4 with 256 gb of error correcting code random access memory and a raid 1 configured storage solution while the system has been built to be computationally easily distributed so far all numerical simulations are performed on this machine the 3d hydrodynamic simulations are run daily fig 2 every day the system computes the hydrodynamics of the lake starting arbitrarily from the previous sunday at 00h00 using cosmo 1 gridded surface meteorological reanalysis and tributaries observations model restart conditions are generated on sundays by a computation comprising the entire previous week and using reanalysis forcing forecasts from the previous day are overwritten the next day by the new nowcast cycle thereafter those daily computations perform a 4 5 days hydrodynamic forecast using the cosmo e products and river forecast model section 2 1 2 the automation of the processing tasks related to the numerical modelling is performed by powershell scripts triggered by the windows task scheduler at 8h00 in the morning fig 2 middle panel the river model model pre post processors and supervisor are coded in matlab and are called by the powershell scripting the pre processor formats river and meteorological data into delft3d flow input files the post processor creates netcdf and csv model output files by extracting and saving only specific fields e g temperature flow velocity grid information at a reduced spatial resolution to optimize storage load and the online user experience finally the supervisor analyses model results to automatically detect configured physical processes of interest in the current version monitored physical processes include upwelling by k means clustering high surface flow velocities and out of bounds cold warm waters at various depths the supervisor acts as an early warning system by sending information e mails with text and image detailing the intensity and location of the event to a list of subscribers via the meteolakes web server 2 3 web interface meteolakes includes two pathways for data dissemination with different target users the majority of users interact with meteolakes through its online interface meteolakes ch here the main objective is to provide immediate comprehensive interactive lake information on the website advanced users however request data with the api which provides the users that information in a simple format a smooth web navigation is critical to have the proposed monitoring system widely adopted by the civil society and lake professionals meteolakes online interface benefits from web 2 0 concepts with in particular optimized user data interaction and intuitive information exchange through simple and responsive designs moreover the meteolakes ch web interface has been built with platform and display scalability in mind for a seamless experience on a broad range of devices smartphone computer and tablet advanced users can generate url links which are interpreted by the server running the developed back end application the api extracts the desired dataset from the model netcdf output files and send it back to the user in formatted csv files detailed explanations on how to use the api and available data can be found directly on meteolakes ch at the following link http meteolakes ch data both interfaces are detailed in appendix b 3 products and application examples 3 1 meteolakes in this section we provide an overview of the meteolakes online products we start by describing the various interface elements followed by examples on how such elements can be used for practical assessments of physical phenomena two examples are presented an upwelling and a storm event with high local currents an illustration of meteolakes ch homepage is presented in fig 3 two animated maps show the lswt of lake geneva on the left and currents on the right computed by the delft3d flow hydrodynamic model for the time indicated in the top panel several drop down menus are available in the upper navigation bar one can select the lake currently four the year starting in 2009 the week and depth of interest the hydrodynamic interface displays weekly periods for each moment the absolute time and the position in the time frame slider are shown to the user the time slider is blue for forecasts and grey for the past in addition to basic functionalities such as zoom and displacement the maps can be clicked to obtain time series at selected locations fig 4 for systems with data assimilation e g lake geneva the time series will further show the uncertainty of the model by displaying the min and max of all ensemble members as shown in fig 4 the temperature map has two additional tabs providing a visualisation of temperature over depth at predefined transects along the main axes of the lake they allow the visualisation of stratification and mixing the flow velocity map has a secondary tab enabling a particle tracking mode when this mode is selected the user has the possibility to release particles online at any spatial location on the horizontal plane and over depth and to follow their trajectories particles are treated as passive tracers they are only advected horizontally by the user defined model layer and are not impacted by vertical mixing nor settling finally at the bottom of the web page fig 3 a navigation bar allows access to the in situ measurements the remote sensing validation the api documentation and various additional system information figs 5 and 6 are examples of respective in situ measurements and remote sensing observations as displayed on meteolakes ch fig 5 shows the water temperature at 1 m depth blue 35 m depth red and radiometric skin temperature orange measured at the buchillon station for in situ measurements the user has the possibility to define a period of interest starting late 2016 this data is available in near real time maximum delay of 1 h seven additional atmospheric variables are available not shown here remote sensing observations and a comparison with the modelled lswt are also available in near real time through the remote sensing tab fig 6 it is worth noting that although the avhrr data upper right plot have been filtered based on its quality flags section 2 1 3 no skin to bulk conversion is applied and the data is directly compared with model surface bulk temperature upper left plot fig 6 provides a spatial lower left plot and a temporal lower right plot overview of model deviations with respect to the avhrr skin temperature the temporal evolution is shown by displaying the median difference blue dot along with the 10th and 90th percentiles of those offsets green bars for each image model comparison it is possible to cycle through this temporal comparison to visualize each satellite image and corresponding model snapshot 3 2 upwelling event on 29th june 2017 a large upwelling was forecasted for the western basin of lake geneva fig 7 shows modelled temperature before left plots and during right plots the event left plots show a rather uniform and warm 21 c lswt on 30th june with a stratified profile and a thermocline around 15 m depth less than two days later the surface shows a large horizontal thermal gradient resulting from a strong westerly wind event with lswt 10 c colder on the western part of the lake compared to the main basin the bottom right plot indicates that the stratification has been broken in the western basin with a full upwelling of hypolimnetic water up to the surface the signature of the upwelling and following basin scale internal waves oscillations are also evident at the buchillon station fig 5 from in situ measurements located some 10 km away from the main upwelling zone there lswt dropped on june 29th immediately followed by a temperature rise both at the surface and at 35 m depth due to gravitational adjustment through the propagation of internal kelvin waves bouffard and lemmin 2013 such full upwelling did not only affect the lake but also the outflow water for millions of downstream residents as evidenced by the measured and modelled temperature at the outlet of lake geneva fig 8 in fig 8 both model and observation were in good agreement timing and intensity rmse 0 8 c and showed a 12 c drop in temperature in the downstream water over 2 days the uncertainties are not shown in this figure as the event occurred before the operational data assimilation scheme was implemented looking at the meteorological forcing which created the upwelling event we found that it is the result of long lasting winds blowing from south west the consequences of upwellings for the lake ecosystem and the downstream water remain poorly investigated one reason is the lack of monitoring tools for meso scale processes and the difficulty to conduct specific field measurements to track transient phenomena such as the illustrated event open access forecasting systems such as meteolakes can help planning field measurements and open new opportunities for understanding such processes and monitoring their magnitude and spatial extent in this study a diagnostic system to automatically detect and warn users has been developed the method is based on a k means clustering method splitting the lswt in two clusters when the centroid difference of those clusters is larger than 4 c an alert is triggered by the supervisor figs 1 and 2 in the case of lake geneva the developed early warning system allowed the subscribers to closely monitor such events during the course of two years 2017 and 2018 by being warned about possible occurrences up to four days in advance using a similar approach i e comparing a lake model grid point with outlet river temperature measurements we observed and modelled 6 and 16 respectively upwellings with a sudden drop of surface temperature by more than 5 c respectively 2 c at the eastern end of lake geneva between april and november 2016 3 3 storm induced lake currents lake forecasting systems are also relevant for predicting the dynamic effects of extreme storms the sudden high speed wind event from 6th august 2018 is an illustrative example for the application of such predictive approaches fig 9 illustrates the surface currents as a result of a spatially localized north eastern coastal wind event timing was critical as the storm lasted less than 3 h as shown by the plots before upper left during main plot and after upper right the event surface flows 3 h before the event were in the range of 0 2 0 3 m s during peak intensity at 18h00 currents reached 0 8 m s in the red patch of fig 9 before returning to 0 2 0 3 m s 3 h later the inset in fig 9 shows the devastating wind waves in vevey harbour on the north eastern shore while two physical phenomena are described in this study other processes with significant implications for the biogeochemistry of the lake are visible on the platform for instance gyres have been found to structure the lateral dispersion of primary productivity soomets et al 2019 as a result of the coriolis force and subsequent strong up down lifts of the thermocline those structures are repeatedly observed in lake geneva bouffard et al 2018 kiefer et al 2015 we refer the reader to meteolakes ch in order to visualize two of those events 1 november 3rd 2015 week 45 on meteolakes and 2 december 3rd 2018 week 48 visible in fig 3 in that regard we found that these recurrent gyre systems are the response of a prevalent north eastern wind and that they decay within weeks after those wind patterns dissipate 4 discussion platform acceptance since its deployment mid 2016 meteolakes has provided lake information to more than 250 000 users its usage reached an average of 1000 daily visitors in mid summer 2019 the platform demonstrated its effectiveness in disseminating both 3d model results and lake observations from satellites and in situ sensors analysis of logging data showed that 51 of connexion logs come from smartphones 41 from computers and 8 from tablets with 78 of the traffic originating from switzerland this device log distribution indicates that we created a scalable and responsive interface to distribute lake data we distinguish three categories of users from the platform i civil society ii lake professionals and iii scientists comments posted on the android application and articles in newspapers indicate that the civil society has positively received and used the web based platform with main interests in lake temperature and currents for recreational activities navigation swimming this category of lake users is also characterised by a strong seasonal variability with most activity over the summer period lake professionals such as fishermen contribute to a regular stream of visits independent of the season platform applications the web based interface allows the visualisation of vertical transects or any horizontal layer to detect zones of interest such as dynamic areas with strong temperature gradients the possibility to display near future currents and lake temperature at specific coordinates is also used by beach operators on their respective websites the upwelling event and associated 12 c temperature drop illustrated on figs 7 and 8 show the importance of monitoring and predicting lake surface nearshore temperature warning messages related to storm conditions on the lake as shown on fig 9 are also particularly relevant for lake professionals finally the possibility to interactively add passive tracers at selected coordinates and water depth and thereby evaluate the dispersion of pollutants is expected to help drinking water intake operators in case of contamination the practical benefit of the web based platform regarding dynamic pollution tracking has not yet been evaluated finally the use of meteolakes by scientists is now well established two approaches can be distinguished first such a model allows putting the in situ and satellite information into a basin scale context this approach has contributed for instance to the interpretation of negatively correlated remotely sensed temperature and chlorophyll areas which ultimately result from upwelling and basin scale internal waves propagation lifting the thermocline and deep chlorophyll maxima upward bouffard et al 2018 similarly the use of archived modelled data helped in identifying the source and the spatial distribution of a remotely sensed calcite precipitation event nouchi et al 2019 further investigation of such transient processes will require specific in situ measurements the forecasting mode of meteolakes is currently used for identifying areas warranting the deployment of in situ sensors in a similar way as suggested by baschek et al 2017 a global upscale of the platform is finally technically possible but would require large computer resources such global scale approaches are nowadays done with 1d model woolway and merchant 2019 and cannot account for spatially varying physical processes such as basin scale internal waves upwelling and ekman pumping or gyre circulations all affecting the biogeochemical responses of the trophogenic surface layer impacts of the platform are observed by three different types of stakeholders first the online system guides scientists in the design and planning of field campaigns and opens new frontiers for research on interdisciplinary processes this is particularly relevant for transient dynamic phenomena such as upwellings gyres or biogeochemical events such as algae blooms wynne et al 2013 whiting events nouchi et al 2019 which are difficult to observe using in situ observations without a priori knowledge second lake related professionals such as fishermen beach operators rescue organisations drinking water facilities and engineering consultants access information for diverse reasons third hundreds of citizen use meteolakes on a daily basis for recreational activities such as navigation and swimming or to discover the beauty of lake dynamics related to distinct weather events 5 conclusions like most environmental systems lakes are undergoing various stresses from global and local influences seriously compromising the ecosystem services they provide given that a large part of humanity lives near freshwater bodies reactions to extreme weather events can have drastic economical and human costs our current view of the problem is based on reanalysis of historical data and hindcasts while such classical approaches have provided tremendous amount of information many challenges are clearly unreachable with such frameworks specifically we are currently poorly prepared to react to short term transient events such as localized pollution harmful algae bloom upwelling events or storms furthermore such episodic features with localised influence are often difficult to study the coverage of those scales is only achieved by the combination and timely distribution of three types of information i in situ measurements ii remote sensing observations and iii model simulations here we have developed a new web based operational modelling platform allowing scientists lake professionals and citizens to easily access historical current and short term forecasting of lakes dynamics this platform is a step toward merging apparently disconnected interests of environmental aware citizens professionals and scientists interested in the fundamentals of the system practically the challenge is solved by providing an effectively functioning and interactive scalable interface together with an efficient archiving approach allowing open access to data and a forecasting mode importantly data assimilation of remotely sensed lake surface temperature allows quantifying the temporal and spatial evolution of the model uncertainty the presented platform meteolakes has provided spatio temporal lake temperature and currents to more than 250 000 visitors over the last three years and has been featured in numerous local media public events and museum exhibitions meteolakes propose a new way of disseminating model results through a modern approach combining i integration of in situ observation remotely sensed data and hydrodynamic models ii a user friendly web based visualisation of results for a broad audience from scientists to citizens and iii open access to model output with uncertainty quantification provided by data assimilation and iv operation forecast we believe that the combination of all these criteria combined into a platform for the first time with meteolakes is a necessary condition for the community to make major progress in science meteolakes is not a static platform instead the concept of meteolakes is that new features can be installed over times other lakes more post processing capabilities other in situ observation yet the goal to advance in science will remain to engage scientists via meteolakes in a more transparent and communicative way to openly provide

2020 115529 appendix a river data and hydrological budget closure flow and temperature are provided in real time for the rhône river inlet and outlet fig 2 lake water levels are collected 4 km east from the buchillon station along the shore at 10 min intervals finally the data foen also contains 4 5 days forecasts of the rhône river inflow based on meteoswiss cosmo e products after the daily download from the foen ftp server the data passes various integrity checks the filtering includes removal of duplicates removal of incoherent observations and inference of missing data specifically timestamp are checked to identify duplicate data and out of physically prescribed range data are scanned and automatically remover finally inference of missing data and 4 5 days forecast of the outflow are estimated by singular spectrum analysis forecasting marques et al 2006 using the first four principal components when both the lake outflow and inflow from the rhône river measurements and forecasts are available for the computational period the contributions from the remaining rivers are generated by the river model two methods have been implemented in meteolakes the first one considers a constant lake volume and the difference of the outflow with the rhône inflow is spread among the remaining three tributaries the second method currently used on the platform aims at reproducing the water level variations of the lake and therefore requires additional data water levels measurements in this method a gaussian filter is first applied to the observed water level time series to remove the high frequency signature from surface seiches the water levels time series then undergoes singular spectrum analysis forecasting to generate the next 4 5 days of forecasts for each time step i the missing flow q i m is given by a1 q i m q i o u t q i r h ô n e i n a h d h i d t i with q i out the outflow from lake geneva fig 2 q i rhône in the inflow from the rhône a the surface area of the lake as a function of its water level h and dh the change in lake water level during time step dt i the remaining flow q i m is then distributed among the three remaining rivers based on the flow contribution over the past 20 years cases of negative values are accounted for and mitigated additional filters ensure the remaining flow is coherent finally river temperature is needed to drive the model for the rhône real time measurements are used however for the remaining rivers or rhône temperature forecasts a physical model is operated from the work of toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 it is possible to estimate the river temperature as a function of air temperature and discharge this is achieved with the following integration a2 d t r i v e r d t 1 δ a 1 a 2 t a i r

having to specify explicitly all geometrical characteristics of the river and specific heat inputs toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 tair is the air temperature obtained from cosmo e products t and t y are the time and the duration of a year in the same units as t respectively and θ q r i v e r q r i v e r is the dimensionless discharge b web interface b1 online web application the angularjs open source javascript based front end framework is used to facilitate the web application development we make use of various existing libraries and protocols such as the leaflet map api asynchronous server client data transfers for a spatially enabled and responsive content to reduce computational load on the server the vast majority of meteolakes processing and rendering is performed client side apache cordova a mobile application development framework allowed wrapping up the css html and javascript code into a packaged android application this enabled a distribution on the google play store without the need to develop a truly native mobile application using platform specific apis meteolakes android app can be downloaded at the following link https play google com store apps details id ch epfl meteolakes hl fr ch the results stored on the web server which are processed by the web interface or mobile application are in text file format upon user request additional results can be displayed e g temperature and flow velocity at different depth those are provided directly by the api from model results files located on the local server fig 1 b2 application programming interface following user demands for raw data access and additional spatial information we developed an api meteolakes api is built using the open source node js runtime environment node js allows the execution of javascript code outside the browser in our case it runs server side directly on the meteolakes compute and local server fig 1 data requests are made by generating url links which are interpreted by the server running the node js application the developed back end application runs as background task constantly listening to a port on which the requests are made when receiving a request the server will extract in the model netcdf output files the desired dataset and send it back to the user the data is sent in formatted csv files due to the relatively large size model files can have we decided to have the api directly interact with the local server computing the hydrodynamic models rather than interacting with meteolakes ch web server as the latter would require having significantly more file transfers more information on how to use the api are available directly on meteolakes ch at the following link http meteolakes ch data 
18169,selenium se and zinc zn are essential micronutrients that are often lacking in the diet of humans and animals leading to deficiency diseases lemna and azolla are two aquatic plants with a substantial protein content which offer the possibility of utilizing them to remove se and zn from waste water while producing micronutrient enriched dietary proteins and fertilizers in this study we explored interaction effects occurring between se and zn when these micronutrients are taken up by azolla and lemna the two aquatic plants were grown on hydroponic cultures containing 0 5 0 mg l of se se iv or se vi and zn the se and zn content of the plants growth indicators bioconcentration factor bcf and se zn removal efficiency from the water phase were evaluated the results demonstrated that se iv is more toxic than se vi for both plant species as evidenced by the remarkable decrease of biomass content and root length when exposed to se iv both aquatic plants took up around 10 times more se iv than se vi from the medium moreover the se accumulation and removal efficiency increased by 66 99 for se iv and by 34 59 for se vi in lemna when increasing zn dosage from 0 to 5 0 mg l in the medium whereas it declined by 13 26 for se iv and 21 35 for se vi in azolla suggesting a synergetic effect in lemna but an antagonistic effect in azolla the maximum bcf of se in lemna and azolla were 507 and 667 respectively the protein content in freeze dried lemna and azolla was approximately 17 the high tolerance and accumulation of se and zn in lemna and azolla combined with their rapid growth high protein content and transformation of inorganic to organic se species upon se iv exposure make lemna and azolla potential candidates for the production of se iv and zn enriched biomass that can be used as crop fertilizers or protein rich food feed supplements or ingredients accordingly by growing the azolla and lemna on wastewater a high value product can be produced from wastewater while recovering resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquatic plants dietary protein micronutrient fertilizer nutrient accumulation se zn nomenclature se selenium zn zinc di deionized water tn total nitrogen semet se methionine secys2 se cystine semetsecys se methyl selenocysteine secys selenocysteine me semet methylselenomethionine bcf bioconcentration factor 1 introduction se and zn are essential trace elements playing a crucial role in the functioning of enzymes in humans and animals hatfield et al 2014 for plants zn is also an essential element that can enhance plant growth whereas se is considered as a beneficial element that can enhance resistance to stress feng et al 2013 subramanyam et al 2019 certain human proteins require se or zn to maintain their catalytic activity se and zn are involved in the biosynthesis of proteins and in scavenging of reactive oxygen species snchez et al 2017 in an adult human diet the recommended daily intake for se and zn is 0 04 0 4 and 15 mg per person respectively fao who 2001 despite the importance of these trace nutrients se and zn intakes are still low in a wide range of countries e g new zealand finland the united kingdom and germany broadley et al 2006 thomson 2004 resulting in se and zn deficiencies globally approximately 15 of the world s population is se deficient and more than 30 is zn deficient poblaciones and rengel 2017 se and zn deficiencies have various negative health effects in humans including increased risk of mortality poor immune function and cognitive decline lavu et al 2016 rayman 2012 farm animals and pets van zelst et al 2016 can also be affected by se and zn deficiencies leading to economic losses the se and zn content in the human and animal diet are therefore a topic of interest to public health systems around the world in order to achieve optimal se and zn levels in the human diet se and zn fertilizers are commonly added to crops in deficient regions however plants can not take up all of se applied through conventional inorganic fertilizers the residual trace elements are leached with rainwater or fixed and accumulated in the soil thus posing a potential threat to the environment broadley et al 2006 wang et al 2018 micronutrient slow release fertilizers such as organic fertilizers banuelos et al 2016 banuelos and hanson 2010 and chemical nano se wang et al 2017 are therefore currently being developed to overcome these limitations and risks on the contrary excess of se and zn in the environment is also frequently observed se and zn are likely to co occur in waste streams or in the environment as a result of both industrial and agricultural activities such as in petroleum refinery effluents wake 2005 in the groundwater of uranium mill tailings repositories morrison et al 2002 in leachates of zn mining etteieb et al 2020 and in agricultural runoff after application of se and zn fertilizers for improving crop yield and nutrition mao et al 2014 wastewaters loaded with both se and zn can serve as potential nutrient sources from which the nutrients may be valorized to produce slow release organic fertilizers accordingly it could be beneficial to produce micronutrient enriched fertilizers or food feed supplements locally from micronutrient containing waste waters using environmentally friendly techniques phytoextraction is an environmentally friendly method to recover micronutrients from waste water the aquatic plants lemna and azolla have fast growth rates high tolerance to extreme conditions and can be easily harvested making them as potential plant species for natural waste water treatment systems miranda et al 2016 sasmaz et al 2015 for instance ohlbaum et al 2018 recently found that the duckweed lemna minor can efficiently remove se 76 from seleniferous soil leachates 74 μg l azolla filiculoides grown in synthetic wastewater reduced the se content up to 40 after 5 days of treatment miranda et al 2016 besides lemna and azolla have also a high potential to remove zn from water sasmaz et al 2015 most the previous studies have investigated the se or zn removal by aquatic plants individually while little studies consider the case of se and zn co occurrence in the environment hence this study explored the case of simultaneous se and zn contamination in water and investigated the simultaneous effects of se and zn on floating aquatic plants that are rich in proteins in addition earlier studies only focused on the removal of contaminants by different biotechnologies tan et al 2016 while the byproducts generated from the water treatment processes could be considered as a new contaminant for the environment luo et al 2020 in this study we will not only consider the removal of se and zn by biotechnology but also propose the potential use of the resulting products se and zn enriched lemna and azolla as micronutrient enriched food feed supplements especially these two aquatic plants are rich in proteins so they may also be considered as alternative se and zn enriched protein sources replacing animal proteins in food and feed systems this may be particularly useful for se as se is preferably accumulated as an organic form i e as selenoaminoacids eiche et al 2015 such alternative proteins would contribute to the sustainability of our food and feed production systems as they can be produced on wastewater as nutrient source during secondary or tertiary treatment if too little se and zn would be present in these wastewaters these micronutrients could also be added from an external source to end up with a micronutrient enriched product without the need to apply additional macronutrients for plant growth therefore a high value product can be produced from wastewater while recovering resources accordingly in this study two aquatic plants lemna and azolla were planted in media with different dosages of se and zn to investigate 1 the effect of two se forms selenite and selenate supplied together with zn on the growth of the two plants 2 the potential of the two plants to remove se and zn together towards the potential use of the se and zn enriched lemna and azolla as micronutrient enriched fertilizers and or food feed supplements and 3 the potential interactions of se and zn on the uptake of these elements by those two plant species 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials the aquatic plants lemna minuta and azolla cristata were collected from a natural freshwater canal in delft the netherlands and cultivated in modified hoagland solution at ph 6 to acclimatize for seven days in a greenhouse hassan and mostafa 2016 ohlbaum et al 2018 the modified hoagland solution contained 472 mg l ca no3 2 4h2o 202 mg l kno3 197 mg l mgso4 7h2o 9 mg l feso4

of modified hoagland solution with varied concentrations of sodium selenite na2seo3 sodium selenate na2seo4 and zinc chloride zncl2 2 2 experimental design the concentrations of se and zn were ranged from 0 to 5 0 mg l including 0 0 5 2 5 and 5 0 mg l and also additionally 1 0 mg l for zn medium without se and zn served as control all experiments were performed in triplicate with a total of 210 pots for the 70 treatments table 1 the temperature in the greenhouse varied between 25 and 30 c and light was provided with a minimum light intensity of 100 μmol m2 s photons the whole plants were harvested after seven days of incubation washed with deionized di water and analyzed for dry weight root length total se and zn content and protein content 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 determination of se and zn concentration the harvested whole plants were oven dried at 60 c until constant weight homogenized and then digested using a microwave oven cem mars 5 matthews nc usa dry samples were weighed into a digestion vessel followed by the addition of 10 ml concentrated hno3 the digestion temperature was raised to 165 c in 10 min and kept for 1 min then raised to 175 c in 2 min and maintained for 5 min the digested solution was diluted with di water and analyzed for total se and zn total se was determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer coupled to a graphite furnace gf aas thermo elemental solaar mqz gf95 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and total zn with flame atomic absorption spectroscopy f aas aanalyst 200 perkinelmer waltham ma usa as described by ohlbaum et al 2018 and mal et al 2016 respectively 2 3 2 determination of protein content the protein content was calculated by multiplying the total nitrogen tn concentration by 5 0 the conversion factor 5 0 was selected based on the literature brouwer et al 2018 2019 zhao et al 2014 and the analyzed amino acid profile of the two plants table s1 tn was determined according to van ranst et al 1999 dry whole plant samples 0 100 g were weighed and digested with 0 2 g se catalyst and 10 ml concentrated sulfuric acid at 380 c until the digestion solution turned clear after acid digestion the sample solution was cooled and ammonia was distilled and collected in boric acid then a back titration was performed to measure the n concentration 2 3 3 determination of se speciation se speciation analysis was determined according to lavu et al 2012 2013 specifically 0 1 g of whole plant samples and 40 mg of the enzyme protease xiv sigma aldrich st louis mo usa were dispersed in 5 ml water in a 10 ml centrifuge tube the mixture was shaken for 24 h at 37 c and centrifuged for 30 min at 10000g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe pvdf membrane filter the filtrate was analyzed for total se and se speciation by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer drc e sunnyvale ca usa and icp ms coupled to high performance liquid chromatography series 200 hplc perkinelmer sunnyvale ca usa respectively a hamilton prp x100 anion exchange column 250 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm was used as stationary phase in the hplc instrument the mobile phase was 10 mm citric acid with 5

concentration in the corresponding medium mplant is the average biomass weight and vmedium is the volume of the medium 150 ml 3 results 3 1 plant growth the effect of se and zn on the growth of lemna and azolla was assessed based on the biomass production i e dry weight fig 1 and the root length fig 2 a decrease of biomass production of both plant species was significantly associated with se iv and zn application fig 1a and c p 0 01 increasing concentrations of se iv from 0 to 5 0 mg l reduced the dry weight of lemna stepwise from 0 12 g to 0 05 g fig 1a p 0 01 while 0 5 mg l of se iv reduced the dry weight of azolla from 0 10 g to 0 08 g p 0 01 and no further decrease was observed at higher se iv concentrations fig 1c on the other hand the exposure to up to 5 0 mg l of single se vi did not cause growth inhibition on lemna fig 1b p 0 24 for azolla the effect of se vi was similar to that of se iv fig 1d in addition the application of se vi seemed to slightly counteract the inhibiting effect of zn on the growth of lemna fig 1b for example the exposure to 1 0 mg l of zn in the absence of se vi caused a remarkable decrease in the dry weight of lemna from 0 12 g to 0 05 g p 0 01 while in the presence of 0 5 5 0 mg l of se vi and the same zn concentration 1 0 mg l the dry weight of lemna was approximately 0 11 g p 0 92 the length of the roots of lemna and azolla decreased with increasing se and zn concentrations an increment of the se iv dosage from 0 to 5 0 mg l significantly reduced the root length of lemna from 1 5 to 0 5 cm p 0 01 and decreased the root length of azolla from 3 7 to 1 4 cm p 0 01 fig 2a and c additionally the exposure to 5 0 mg l of se vi caused a decrease of 0 7 cm in both lemna p 0 01 and azolla p 0 02 roots fig 2b and d similarly an increasing zn application from 0 to 5 0 mg l in the absence of se caused a noticeable decrease in the root length of lemna from 1 5 to 0 7 cm p 0 01 while the growth of the root length of azolla was not associated with the zn application p 0 08 the dose response data could be described satisfactorily by a log logistic equation for lemna fig 2a and b from the fitted equation the effective concentrations of se that caused a 50 inhibition ed50 of the root length of lemna were estimated at 2 7 and 3 8 mg l se for the application of se iv and se vi respectively these results indicated that lemna was more resistant to se vi than to se iv 3 2 se concentration in lemna and azolla the se concentration in the plants differed significantly depending on the chemical form and concentration of the se amendment fig 3 p 0 01 for both azolla and lemna the increasing of se concentration was significantly related to the increasing se dosage in the medium p 0 01 both plants have a higher ability to take up se iv compared with se vi which is reflected by the higher se content in the plants cultivated on the se iv enriched medium the presence of zn in the medium affected the se concentration in lemna and azolla differently fig 3 in general the se concentration in lemna gradually increased with increasing zn application dose while it declined in azolla specifically for the plants exposed to se iv the maximum se concentration in the plants was found at 5 0 mg l se iv with 5 0 mg l zn in lemna 1665 mg kg and 5 0 mg l se iv without zn in azolla 1139 mg kg fig 3a and c similarly for the se vi application the highest se concentration in lemna was 168 mg kg at 5 0 mg l se vi coupled with a 5 0 mg l zn dose and the maximum se concentration in azolla was 196 mg kg at 5 0 mg l se vi without zn fig 3b and d 3 3 se accumulation and removal by lemna and azolla the total se accumulation in the plants and the se removal efficiency are presented in tables 2 5 in both plants the total se accumulation significantly increased with the increase of se dose in the medium tables 2 and 4 whereas a decreasing trend was generally observed in the se removal efficiency tables 3 and 5 p 0 01 when both plants were exposed to se vi the se accumulation and se removal efficiency were much lower compared to se iv exposure specifically the highest se accumulation and se removal efficiency were 15 9 and 17 3 μg pot and 3 6 and 3 0 in lemna and azolla respectively when exposed to the se vi growth solution however when lemna and azolla were exposed to se iv medium the maximum se accumulation and se removal efficiency were 89 2 and 90 5 μg pot and 30 2 and 38 9 respectively the exposure to zn increased the se removal efficiency and se accumulation in lemna tables 2 and 3 while having an inhibitory effect on the se removal efficiency and se accumulation in azolla tables 4 and 5 for instance for lemna grown on 2 5 mg l se iv increasing the zn dose from 0 to 5 0 mg l remarkably increased the se accumulation from 44 to 89 μg pot and the se removal efficiency from 12 to 24 p 0 01 in contrast the addition of 5 0 mg l of zn to the growth medium of azolla containing 2 5 mg l se iv caused a considerable decline of the se accumulation from 88 to 66 μg pot and the se removal efficiency from 24 to 18 p 0 01 3 4 bcfse the bcfse in lemna ranged from 231 to 552 for the se iv addition and from 20 0 to 55 6 for the se vi treatments in azolla the range of the bcfse values was 182 667 for the se iv application and 23 1 to 51 9 for the se vi treatments table 6 3 5 zn concentration in lemna and azolla a increased of zn concentration in both plants was significantly associated with the increasing zn dose in the culture solution fig 4 p 0 01 the maximum zn concentrations in lemna and azolla were 3144 and 1709 mg kg respectively when exposed to the highest zn amount 5 0 mg l but at different se concentrations for the same zn application the zn concentration in lemna significantly increased with increasing se iv dose p 0 01 while it remained almost constant with increasing se vi concentrations fig 4a b in contrast the zn concentration in azolla generally declined with increasing amounts of se iv and se vi in the medium p 0 01 except for a slight increase observed at 5 0 mg l se iv fig 4c d in the presence of 5 0 mg l zn increasing the dose of se iv from 0 to 5 0 mg l raised the zn content in lemna from 1769 to 3144 mg kg p 0 01 while it diminished the zn content in azolla from 1709 to 1530 mg kg p 0 09 3 6 zn accumulation removal and bcfzn the total zn accumulation zn removal efficiency and bcfzn by lemna and azolla are illustrated in tables s2 s6 see supplementary information the total zn accumulation in both plants significantly raised with the increase in zn application while the zn removal efficiency decreased remarkably p 0 01 the largest zn accumulation and the highest zn removal efficiencies in lemna and azolla were up to 196 μg pot and 90 7 and 151 μg pot and 64 7 respectively the bcfzn was much higher than the bcfse in both plants table s6 the maximum bcfzn reached up to 1310 and 843 in lemna and azolla respectively 3 7 protein content the maximum content of true protein in lemna and azolla was 162 and 170 mg g when exposed to 2 5 mg l se iv respectively whereas a protein content of 131 and 159 mg g was observed when lemna and azolla were grown in the control medium the inhibition effect of se and zn exposure was not reflected in the protein content except a decrease of protein content in the presence of 5 0 mg l se iv for lemna p 0 04 when increasing the zn application to 5 0 mg l fig 5 3 8 se speciation the plants grown in the presence of 2 5 mg l of se medium were selected for se speciation determination the recovery of se in both plants grown in the se iv containing medium ranged from 13 to 40 compared to the total se content after protease hydrolysis while it ranged from 63 to 92 in the presence of se vi medium table s7 when plants were grown in the se iv medium the production rate of se amino acids was higher than when plants were grown in the medium with se vi fig 6 table s8 organic se species such as semet semetsecys and secys2 were the main se species of identified se in lemna grown on se iv enriched medium fig 6a whereas inorganic se in the form of selenate approximately 50 was the predominant se species in lemna grown on se vi containing medium fig 6b table s8 semet accounted for the highest proportion 5 9 of total se of identified se species in lemna grown in se iv while semetsecys predominated 4 6 of total se in the se iv treatment with zn in azolla the main species were organic semet and semetsecys and inorganic selenate upon se iv exposure while selenate was detected in azolla as predominant species 92 and 75 in the absence and presence of zn respectively when exposed to se vi moreover excepting selenate species in azolla semetsecys was the most abundant se species under se iv exposure with zn while semet has the highest proportion under only se iv exposure fig 6c and d table s8 apart from the identified se species some unidentified se species were found in both lemna and azolla grown in the presence of se iv fig 6a and c 4 discussion 4 1 se uptake and toxic effects of se and zn on lemna and azolla changes in the growth rate of plants as evidenced by biomass production and root length are a direct indicator of plant toxicity in contaminated environments duan et al 2010 han et al 2013 in this study the decrease of biomass production of both lemna and azolla was significantly associated p 0 001 with increasing se iv dosage in the medium figs 1 and 2 while no inhibition effect was found at the highest dose of se vi p 0 24 and 0 11 for lemna and azolla respectively the toxic effect of se iv to aquatic plants has been reported previously zhong et al 2016 reported negative impacts of se iv on the chlorophyll fluorescence starch content and fatty acid content of the duckweed landoltia punctata after exposure to 40 μmol l se iv equivalent to 3 2 mg l se carvalho and martin 2001 also recorded that dry biomass of the duckweed lemna obscura aust decreased from 50 to 20 mg when the se iv concentration was increased from 1 to 20 mg l in the cultivation medium the higher plant tolerance to se vi compared to se iv has also been observed in other plants such as sunflower and maize when cultivated in a hydroponic system garousi et al 2016 the different toxicity of se iv and se vi on plants growth can be explained by the different mobility bioavailability and metabolic uptake mechanisms li et al 2008 specifically se vi is taken up in an active way and easily distributed from roots to shoots arvy 1993 while se iv is absorbed in a faster passive way and quickly converted into organic forms of se fig 6 the organic se is then incorporated into proteins by replacing sulfur in plant tissues resulting in malformed selenoproteins arvy 1993 de oliveira et al 2017 moreover se induced oxidative stress also contributes to plant toxicity van hoewyk 2013 accordingly the reduction of se iv to organic se forms e g semet secys2 may produce additional organic se metabolites such as selenodiglutathione which is more toxic than se iv inducing oxidative stress in plants van hoewyk 2013 wallenberg et al 2010 the higher toxicity of se iv can also be attributed to the higher se uptake accumulation in the plant tissues when the two plants were cultivated in se iv containing medium compared to the se vi treatment the uptake of se iv in both lemna and azolla was higher than that of se vi resulting in se concentrations in both plants more than 10 fold higher when they were grown in se iv supplemented medium fig 3 similarly broyer et al 1972 reported more accumulation of se iv than se vi by the hyper accumulator astragalus crotolariae after 7 12 weeks of hydroponic culture zhang et al 2003 observed 4 times higher uptake of se iv than se vi by soybean glycine max while arvy 1993 reported a similar uptake rate for the two se species by bean plants phaseolus vulgaris during a 3 h uptake experiment the higher uptake of se iv can be explained by the different metabolism of se iv and se vi in plants se vi is taken up by plants reduced to se iv and then converted into organic se van hoewyk 2013 the se vi reduction occurs via substitution for sulfate in the atp sulfurylase reductase system which is an atp consumption process and rate limiting step salt et al 2002 van hoewyk 2013 the se vi reduction rate is much slower than the uptake rate resulting in se vi saturation and lower se content in plant tissues which is supported by the high proportion of se vi species in both lemna and azolla grown in the presence of se vi fig 6 on the other hand versini et al 2016 reported a lower uptake of se iv compared to se vi in the non accumulator ryegrass grown in hydroponic cultures garousi et al 2016 also observed that the root to shoot se translocation and total se uptake was lower in se iv treated plants maize and sunflower than in se vi treated plants these discrepancies are likely caused by different external environmental factors such as temperature light intensity se exposure concentration and medium composition especially the content of macronutrient e g sulfate and phosphate or micronutrient elements as well as the differences in plant species kikkert and berkelaar 2013 for instance astragalus crotolariae and soybean glycine max are se hyperaccumulators whereas ryegrass maize and sunflower are non accumulators the se hyperaccumulators differ from the non accumulators in the capacity of reduction of the intracellular concentration of selenocysteine secys and semet terry et al 2000 non accumulators incorporate most secys and semet into proteins with damaging effects to plant functions while hyperaccumulators metabolize the secys primarily into various non protein selenoamino acids such as semetsecys se cystathionine and γ glutamyl methylselenocysteine to tolerate high concentrations of se in their cells terry et al 2000 the high tolerance keeps the cell membranes functional and improves the passive uptake of se iv resulting in more accumulation of se iv than that of se vi by se hyeraccumulators besides wang et al 2019 evidenced that tomato solanum lycopersicum l has a higher uptake ability of se vi than se iv at 0 0175 0 2998 mg l se exposure while the opposite was observed when se exposure was higher than 0 2998 mg l which partially confirms that the se exposure concentration may affect the uptake ability of se by plants 4 2 simultaneous uptake of se and zn the se concentration in lemna increased with increasing zn dosage in the medium whereas it declined in azolla these results indicate that zn promoted the se uptake in lemna but inhibited the se uptake in azolla accordingly the zn concentration in lemna also raised with raising se dose in the culture medium but it decreased in azolla these findings demonstrate that se and zn have synergetic effects in lemna but antagonistic effects in azolla the interactions between se and other elements during plant absorption have been reported but ambiguous conclusions have been drawn in line with our results with azolla previous studies have demonstrated that se absorption can decrease the uptake of certain elements for example singh and singh 1978 found that se application reduced the zn and cu concentration in wheat triticum aestivum similarly the antagonistic effects between se and other elements such as mg k p fe cu and zn have been demonstrated by feng et al 2009 in the fern pteris vittata l however other studies showed that se could improve zn uptake which supports part of our findings in lemna fig 4 for instance arvy 1992 demonstrated that helminthia echioides grown under field conditions accumulated se at concentration ranging from 2 05 to 7 90 mg kg and that se accumulation was positively correlated with mn zn ni co and cd uptake hu et al 2015 showed that mn zn cu ni and co in the stems of danshen salvia miltiorrhiza were higher when se vi was added to the soil similarly the foliar application of se iv in turnip brassica rapa var rapa linn positively affected the uptake of several elements such as mg fe zn mn and cu li et al 2018 the increase of se concentration in lemna with increasing zn addition fig 3 could be partially explained by bioconcentration because of the decline of biomass li et al 2015 this is supported by the negative correlation between the se concentration and biomass of lemna exposed to different zn dosages within each se application dose while this correlation was not observed in azolla table s9 similarly the increment of the zn concentration in lemna with increasing se iv application may be related to the decrease of biomass table s10 which is also evidenced by the significant decrease of zn accumulation multiplying biomass by concentration and zn removal efficiency by lemna when the se application increased p 0 01 tables s2 and s3 additionally se is detoxified by methylation of secys2 and semet to semetsecys and methylselenomethionine me semet which cannot be incorporated into proteins thereby avoiding toxicity and allowing a safe se accumulation gupta and gupta 2017 in this study semet accounted for the highest proportion of the identified se species in lemna grown in se iv while semetsecys predominated in the se iv treatment with zn fig 6 the formation and accumulation of non toxic semetsecys species from toxic secys2 could have been stimulated by the addition of zn probably by stimulating the expression of selenocysteine methyltransferase smt van hoewyk 2013 eventually resulting in the enhancement of se accumulation and the higher se concentration in lemna in the treatment with se and zn azolla on the other hand showed an antagonistic effect between the uptake of se and zn which may be related to the higher metal tolerance ability of azolla and the se mediated detoxification of heavy metals for lemna the supplementation of 5 0 mg l se iv or zn decreased the dry weight of the biomass by 61 and 29 respectively while for azolla the reduction was only 20 and 6 respectively fig 1 the higher metal tolerance of azolla suggests a detoxification mechanism was triggered by the exposure to se and zn accumulated metal ions are normally detoxified by phytochelatins pcs which are synthesized from glutathione gsh during exposure to heavy metals pcs form a complex with metal ions and sequester them into the vacuole yadav 2010 research has evidenced that zn could induce the pcs synthesis in some plants tsuji et al 2002 however hawrylak nowak et al 2014 reported that se reduced the pcs accumulation in the presence of cd due to se interference with the s metabolism and replacement of s in amino acids forming se amino acids semet and secys se amino acids are subsequently incorporated into enzymatic proteins including phytochelatin synthase as this contains cysteine affecting their catalytic activity thus the replacement of cysteine by secys in the phytochelatin synthase probably affects the biosynthesis and accumulation of pcs in the plant tissues malik et al 2012 wan et al 2016 the decrease of pcs induced by se could explain the decrease of the zn concentration in azolla when se was supplied in addition increasing se doses cause saturation of lipids and increases membrane stiffness resulting in lower membrane permeability and less accumulation of micro and macronutrients in plants filek et al 2010 contrasting interactions between the uptake of metal and metalloids by lemna and azolla have been reported for cu and as for example cu inhibited as uptake in azolla caroliniana while it stimulated as uptake in lemna minor rofkar et al 2014 although the combined interactions of se and zn uptake in lemna and azolla were demonstrated in this study the mechanisms are still unclear particularly the reason why zn and se showed opposite effects on se zn uptake between azolla and lemna should be further explored therefore further studies using e g 77se isotope should be conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of micronutrient accumulation and se species transformations in both lemna and azolla di tullo et al 2015 4 3 potential of lemna and azolla for wastewater treatment and production of micronutrient enriched bioproducts the species of lemna and azolla used in this study can tolerate and accumulate high se levels indicating that the two aquatic plants are optimal se bioaccumulators the maximum accumulation of se in lemna and azolla was 1664 and 1139 mg kg respectively tables 2 and 4 these values are much higher than the se accumulation in the duckweed landoltia punctate 785 mg kg which was reported to tolerate up to 80 μmol l na2seo3 6 3 mg l se zhong and cheng 2016 and also higher than the se accumulation in azolla caroliniana less than 1000 mg kg exposed to 1 10 mg l se iv hassan and mostafa 2016 moreover the se and zn accumulation in lemna increased with increasing zn exposure which confirms that lemna can efficiently remove se and zn together figs 3 and 4 the bcf provides information on the ability of a plant to accumulate contaminants from polluted water or soil in general a bcf larger than 1 suggests that a plant can be considered as a candidate with good phytoextraction efficiency li et al 2015 the bcfse values of lemna and azolla were all larger than 1 table 6 however the se removal efficiency by lemna and azolla was not as high as other indicators e g se content bcf the maximum se iv removal efficiencies by lemna and azolla were 30 and 39 respectively and only 3 for se vi this may be due to the small amount of biomass 1 0 g fresh weight transferred into each treatment and to a limiting water surface area in this study as floating aquatic plants can only root on the water surface regarding the lower removal efficiency of se vi it could be also partially attributed to the competition between se vi and sulfate 0 83 mm in the medium resulting in a lower ability of the plant to take up and accumulate se vi it should be noted that the sulfate concentration applied in the medium is a normal concentration in wastewater and suitable for plant growth li et al 2008 mechora et al 2015 therefore the se removal efficiencies could improve by increasing the biomass concentration or optimizing the geometry of the treatment tank and the chemical composition of waste water despite the currently low se removal efficiencies the high se iv and zn accumulation capacity 1000 mg kg se and zn of lemna and azolla together with the high tolerance to se and zn the fast growth rate and the easy harvest make these plant species interesting alternatives for the production of micronutrient enriched food feed supplements or fertilizers therefore the plants could also be grown in treatment ponds treating non se rich wastewater e g domestic wastewater to which se iv is added to obtain se enriched food feed supplements or fertilizers in that way a high value product is produced from the wastewater while recovering resources particularly a high protein content is beneficial for food feed supplements or ingredients in this study the true protein content in lemna and azolla were as high as 162 and 170 mg g fig 5 respectively which is much higher than other plants such as turnip brassica rapa var rapa linn and codonopsis lanceolata li et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 the crude protein content in turnip was 59 5 93 5 mg g when 0 200 mg l se iv was sprayed on the leaves and the protein content in c lanceolata was 15 4 17 2 mg g when 0 5 2 0 mg kg se iv was applied to the soil li et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 besides it should be noted that the conversion factor 5 conversion n to protein applied in this study may potentially underestimate the protein content due to some missing amino acids were not analyzed e g cysteine and tryptophan table s1 moreover most of the identified se species in both lemna and azolla were organic se forms around 88 90 and 54 76 of identified se species respectively when grown on se iv containing medium fig 6 which are the preferred forms for se supplementation in animal feed zhan et al 2007 it has to be noted that the sum of identified se species ranged from 3 2 to 12 2 when the plants were grown on se iv containing medium table s7 the low recoveries of se indicated that se iv is easily metabolized and incorporated into different se compounds complicating their extraction and identification moreover the inorganic se content also seem to be relatively high when plants are exposed to se iv and se vi particularly for use in food or feed further product processing through fractionation of the obtained micronutrient enriched lemna and azolla and or applying lower se dosages may help to remove excess inorganic se for use as micronutrient rich feed or food supplement a high se concentration is preferred but for use as feed or food ingredient which will be consumed in higher amounts a high protein content combined with a lower se concentration is sufficient furthermore the produced se and zn enriched bioproducts could be reused and applied as slow release organic fertilizers in se zn deficient fields to improve the se and zn levels in the soil and the crops growing on these soils the potential of se and zn enriched lemna and azolla for this application also requires further investigation including pot or field trials with relevant crops 5 conclusions this study investigated the accumulation and combined effects of se and zn in two aquatic plants lemna and azolla grown in hydroponic culture 1 the results demonstrated that se iv is more toxic than se vi for both plant species investigated as evidenced by the considerable decrease of biomass content and root length when exposed to se iv rich medium both aquatic plants took up around 10 times more se iv than se vi from the medium 2 the se accumulation and removal efficiency by lemna increased with increasing zn dosage in the medium whereas it declined in azolla suggesting a synergetic effect in lemna but an antagonistic effect in azolla 3 both lemna and azolla can tolerate and accumulate high levels of se iv and zn which combined with the observed transformation to organic species high protein content and rapid plant growth makes them good candidates for the production of se and zn enriched biomass that can be used as crop fertilizers or protein rich food feed supplements or ingredients declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18169,selenium se and zinc zn are essential micronutrients that are often lacking in the diet of humans and animals leading to deficiency diseases lemna and azolla are two aquatic plants with a substantial protein content which offer the possibility of utilizing them to remove se and zn from waste water while producing micronutrient enriched dietary proteins and fertilizers in this study we explored interaction effects occurring between se and zn when these micronutrients are taken up by azolla and lemna the two aquatic plants were grown on hydroponic cultures containing 0 5 0 mg l of se se iv or se vi and zn the se and zn content of the plants growth indicators bioconcentration factor bcf and se zn removal efficiency from the water phase were evaluated the results demonstrated that se iv is more toxic than se vi for both plant species as evidenced by the remarkable decrease of biomass content and root length when exposed to se iv both aquatic plants took up around 10 times more se iv than se vi from the medium moreover the se accumulation and removal efficiency increased by 66 99 for se iv and by 34 59 for se vi in lemna when increasing zn dosage from 0 to 5 0 mg l in the medium whereas it declined by 13 26 for se iv and 21 35 for se vi in azolla suggesting a synergetic effect in lemna but an antagonistic effect in azolla the maximum bcf of se in lemna and azolla were 507 and 667 respectively the protein content in freeze dried lemna and azolla was approximately 17 the high tolerance and accumulation of se and zn in lemna and azolla combined with their rapid growth high protein content and transformation of inorganic to organic se species upon se iv exposure make lemna and azolla potential candidates for the production of se iv and zn enriched biomass that can be used as crop fertilizers or protein rich food feed supplements or ingredients accordingly by growing the azolla and lemna on wastewater a high value product can be produced from wastewater while

essential trace elements playing a crucial role in the functioning of enzymes in humans and animals hatfield et al 2014 for plants zn is also an essential element that can enhance plant growth whereas se is considered as a beneficial element that can enhance resistance to stress feng et al 2013 subramanyam et al 2019 certain human proteins require se or zn to maintain their catalytic activity se and zn are involved in the biosynthesis of proteins and in scavenging of reactive oxygen species snchez et al 2017 in an adult human diet the recommended daily intake for se and zn is 0 04 0 4 and 15 mg per person respectively fao who 2001 despite the importance of these trace nutrients se and zn intakes are still low in a wide range of countries e g new zealand finland the united kingdom and germany broadley et al 2006 thomson 2004 resulting in se and zn deficiencies globally approximately 15 of the world s population is se deficient and more than 30 is zn deficient poblaciones and rengel 2017 se and zn deficiencies have various negative health effects in humans including increased risk of mortality poor immune function and cognitive decline lavu et al 2016 rayman 2012 farm animals and pets van zelst et al 2016 can also be affected by se and zn deficiencies leading to economic losses the se and zn content in the human and animal diet are therefore a topic of interest to public health systems around the world in order to achieve optimal se and zn levels in the human diet se and zn fertilizers are commonly added to crops in deficient regions however plants can not take up all of se applied through conventional inorganic fertilizers the residual trace elements are leached with rainwater or fixed and accumulated in the soil thus posing a potential threat to the environment broadley et al 2006 wang et al 2018 micronutrient slow release fertilizers such as organic fertilizers banuelos et al 2016 banuelos and hanson 2010 and chemical nano se wang et al 2017 are therefore currently being developed to overcome these limitations and risks on the contrary excess of se and zn in the environment is also frequently observed se and zn are likely to co occur in waste streams or in the environment as a result of both industrial and agricultural activities such as in petroleum refinery effluents wake 2005 in the groundwater of uranium mill tailings repositories morrison et al 2002 in leachates of zn mining etteieb et al 2020 and in agricultural runoff after application of se and zn fertilizers for improving crop yield and nutrition mao et al 2014 wastewaters loaded with both se and zn can serve as potential nutrient sources from which the nutrients may be valorized to produce slow release organic fertilizers accordingly it could be beneficial to produce micronutrient enriched fertilizers or food feed supplements locally from micronutrient containing waste waters using environmentally friendly techniques phytoextraction is an environmentally friendly method to recover micronutrients from waste water the aquatic plants lemna and azolla have fast growth rates high tolerance to extreme conditions and can be easily harvested making them as potential plant species for natural waste water treatment systems miranda et al 2016 sasmaz et al 2015 for instance ohlbaum et al 2018 recently found that the duckweed lemna minor can efficiently remove se 76 from seleniferous soil leachates 74 μg l azolla filiculoides grown in synthetic wastewater reduced the se content up to 40 after 5 days of treatment miranda et al 2016 besides lemna and azolla have also a high potential to remove zn from water sasmaz et al 2015 most the previous studies have investigated the se or zn removal by aquatic plants individually while little studies consider the case of se and zn co occurrence in the environment hence this study explored the case of simultaneous se and zn contamination in water and investigated the simultaneous effects of se and zn on floating aquatic plants that are rich in proteins in addition earlier studies only focused on the removal of contaminants by different biotechnologies tan et al 2016 while the byproducts generated from the water treatment processes could be considered as a new contaminant for the environment luo et al 2020 in this study we will not only consider the removal of se and zn by biotechnology but also propose the potential use of the resulting products se and zn enriched lemna and azolla as micronutrient enriched food feed supplements especially these two aquatic plants are rich in proteins so they may also be considered as alternative se and zn enriched protein sources replacing animal proteins in food and feed systems this may be particularly useful for se as se is preferably accumulated as an organic form i e as selenoaminoacids eiche et al 2015 such alternative proteins would contribute to the sustainability of our food and feed production systems as they can be produced on wastewater as nutrient source during secondary or tertiary treatment if too little se and zn would be present in these wastewaters these micronutrients could also be added from an external source to end up with a micronutrient enriched product without the need to apply additional macronutrients for plant growth therefore a high value product can be produced from wastewater while recovering resources accordingly in this study two aquatic plants lemna and azolla were planted in media with different dosages of se and zn to investigate 1 the effect of two se forms selenite and selenate supplied together with zn on the growth of the two plants 2 the potential of the two plants to remove se and zn together towards the potential use of the se and zn enriched lemna and azolla as micronutrient enriched fertilizers and or food feed supplements and 3 the potential interactions of se and zn on the uptake of these elements by those two plant species 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental

concentration in the corresponding medium mplant is the average biomass weight and vmedium is the volume of the medium 150 ml 3 results 3 1 plant growth the effect of se and zn on the growth of lemna and azolla was assessed based on the biomass production i e dry weight fig 1 and the root length fig 2 a decrease of biomass production of both plant species was significantly associated with se iv and zn application fig 1a and c p 0 01 increasing concentrations of se iv from 0 to 5 0 mg l reduced the dry weight of lemna stepwise from 0 12 g to 0 05 g fig 1a p 0 01 while 0 5 mg l of se iv reduced the dry weight of azolla from 0 10 g to 0 08 g p 0 01 and no further decrease was observed at higher se iv concentrations fig 1c on the other hand the exposure to up to 5 0 mg l of single se vi did not cause growth inhibition on lemna fig 1b p 0 24 for azolla the effect of se vi was similar to that of se iv fig 1d in addition the application of se vi seemed to slightly counteract the inhibiting effect of zn on the growth of lemna fig 1b for example the exposure to 1 0 mg l of zn in the absence of se vi caused a remarkable decrease in the dry weight of lemna from 0 12 g to 0 05 g p 0 01 while in the presence of 0 5 5 0 mg l of se vi and the same zn concentration 1 0 mg l the dry weight of lemna was approximately 0 11 g p 0 92 the length of the roots of lemna and azolla decreased with increasing se and zn concentrations an increment of the se iv dosage from 0 to 5 0 mg l significantly reduced the root length of lemna from 1 5 to 0 5 cm p 0 01 and decreased the root length of azolla from 3 7 to 1 4 cm p 0 01 fig 2a and c additionally the exposure to 5 0 mg l of se vi caused a decrease of 0 7 cm in both lemna p 0 01 and azolla p 0 02 roots fig 2b and d similarly an increasing zn application from 0 to 5 0 mg l in the absence of se caused a noticeable decrease in the root length of lemna from 1 5 to 0 7 cm p 0 01 while the growth of the root length of azolla was not associated with the zn application p 0 08 the dose response data could be described satisfactorily by a log logistic equation for lemna fig 2a and b from the fitted equation the effective concentrations of se that caused a 50 inhibition ed50 of the root length of lemna were estimated at 2 7 and 3 8 mg l se for the application of se iv and se vi respectively these results indicated that lemna was more resistant to se vi than to se iv 3 2 se concentration in lemna and azolla the se concentration in the plants differed significantly depending on the chemical form and concentration of the se amendment fig 3 p 0 01 for both azolla and lemna the increasing of se concentration was significantly related to the increasing se dosage in the medium p 0 01 both plants have a higher ability to take up se iv compared with se vi which is reflected by the higher se content in the plants cultivated on the se iv enriched medium the presence of zn in the medium affected the se concentration in lemna and azolla differently fig 3 in general the se concentration in lemna gradually increased with increasing zn application dose while it declined in azolla specifically for the plants exposed to se iv the maximum se concentration in the plants was found at 5 0 mg l se iv with 5 0 mg l zn in lemna 1665 mg kg and 5 0 mg l se iv without zn in azolla 1139 mg kg fig 3a and c similarly for the se vi application the highest se concentration in lemna was 168 mg kg at 5 0 mg l se vi coupled with a 5 0 mg l zn dose and the maximum se concentration in azolla was 196 mg kg at 5 0 mg l se vi without zn fig 3b and d 3 3 se accumulation and removal by lemna and azolla the total se accumulation in the plants and the se removal efficiency are presented in tables 2 5 in both plants the total se accumulation significantly increased with the increase of se dose in the medium tables 2 and 4 whereas a decreasing trend was generally observed in the se removal efficiency tables 3 and 5 p 0 01 when both plants were exposed to se vi the se accumulation and se removal efficiency were much lower compared to se iv exposure specifically the highest se accumulation and se removal efficiency were 15 9 and 17 3 μg pot and 3 6 and 3 0 in lemna and azolla respectively when exposed to the se vi growth solution however when lemna and azolla were exposed to se iv medium the maximum se accumulation and se removal efficiency were 89 2 and 90 5 μg pot and 30 2 and 38 9 respectively the exposure to zn increased the se removal efficiency and se accumulation in lemna tables 2 and 3 while having an inhibitory effect on the se removal efficiency and se accumulation in azolla tables 4 and 5 for instance for lemna grown on 2 5 mg l se iv increasing the zn dose from 0 to 5 0 mg l remarkably increased the se accumulation from 44 to 89 μg pot and the se removal efficiency from 12 to 24 p 0 01 in contrast the addition of 5 0 mg l of zn to the growth medium of azolla containing 2 5 mg l se iv caused a considerable decline of the se accumulation from 88 to 66 μg pot and the se removal efficiency from 24 to 18 p 0 01 3 4 bcfse the bcfse in lemna ranged from 231 to 552 for the se iv addition and from 20 0 to 55 6 for the se vi treatments in azolla the range of the bcfse values was 182 667 for the se iv application and 23 1 to 51 9 for the se vi treatments table 6 3 5 zn concentration in lemna and azolla a increased of zn concentration in both plants was significantly associated with the increasing zn dose in the culture solution fig 4 p 0 01 the maximum zn concentrations in lemna and azolla were 3144 and 1709 mg kg respectively when exposed to the highest zn amount 5 0 mg l but at different se concentrations for the same zn application the zn concentration in lemna significantly increased with increasing se iv dose p 0 01 while it remained almost constant with increasing se vi concentrations fig 4a b in contrast the zn concentration in azolla generally declined with increasing amounts of se iv and se vi in the medium p 0 01 except for a slight increase observed at 5 0 mg l se iv fig 4c d in the presence of 5 0 mg l zn increasing the dose of se iv from 0 to 5 0 mg l raised the zn content in lemna from 1769 to 3144 mg kg p 0 01 while it diminished the zn content in azolla from 1709 to 1530 mg kg p 0 09 3 6 zn accumulation removal and bcfzn the total zn accumulation zn removal efficiency and bcfzn by lemna and azolla are illustrated in tables s2 s6 see supplementary information the total zn accumulation in both plants significantly raised with the increase in zn application while the zn removal efficiency decreased remarkably p 0 01 the largest zn accumulation and the highest zn removal efficiencies in lemna and azolla were up to 196 μg pot and 90 7 and 151 μg pot and 64 7 respectively the bcfzn was much higher than the bcfse in both plants table s6 the maximum bcfzn reached up to 1310 and 843 in lemna and azolla respectively 3 7 protein content the maximum content of true protein in lemna and azolla was 162 and 170 mg g when exposed to 2 5 mg l se iv respectively whereas a protein content of 131 and 159 mg g was observed when lemna and azolla were grown in the control medium the inhibition effect of se and zn exposure was not reflected in the protein content except a decrease of protein content in the presence of 5 0 mg l se iv for lemna p 0 04 when increasing the zn application to 5 0 mg l fig 5 3 8 se speciation the plants grown in the presence of 2 5 mg l of se medium were selected for se speciation determination the recovery of se in both plants grown in the se iv containing medium ranged from 13 to 40 compared to the total se content after protease hydrolysis while it ranged from 63 to 92 in the presence of se vi medium table s7 when plants were grown in the se iv medium the production rate of se amino acids was higher than when plants were grown in the medium with se vi fig 6 table s8 organic se species such as semet semetsecys and secys2 were the main se species of identified se in lemna grown on se iv enriched medium fig 6a whereas inorganic se in the form of selenate approximately 50 was the predominant se species in lemna grown on se vi containing medium fig 6b table s8 semet accounted for the highest proportion 5 9 of total se of identified se species in lemna grown in se iv while semetsecys predominated 4 6 of total se in the se iv treatment with zn in azolla the main species were organic semet and semetsecys and inorganic selenate upon se iv exposure while selenate was detected in azolla as predominant species 92 and 75 in the absence and presence of zn respectively when exposed to se vi moreover excepting selenate species in azolla semetsecys was the most abundant se species under se iv exposure with zn while semet has the highest proportion under only se iv exposure fig 6c and d table s8 apart from the identified se species some unidentified se species were found in both lemna and azolla grown in the presence of se iv fig 6a and c 4 discussion 4 1 se uptake and toxic effects of se and zn on lemna and azolla changes in the growth rate of plants as evidenced by biomass production and root length are a direct indicator of plant toxicity in contaminated environments duan et al 2010 han et al 2013 in this study the decrease of biomass production of both lemna and azolla was significantly associated p 0 001 with increasing se iv dosage in the medium figs 1 and 2 while no inhibition effect was found at the highest dose of se vi p 0 24 and 0 11 for lemna and azolla respectively the toxic effect of se iv to aquatic plants has been reported previously zhong et al 2016 reported negative impacts of se iv on the chlorophyll fluorescence starch content and fatty acid content of the duckweed landoltia punctata after exposure to 40 μmol l se iv equivalent to 3 2 mg l se carvalho and martin 2001 also recorded that dry biomass of the duckweed lemna obscura aust decreased from 50 to 20 mg when the se iv concentration was increased from 1 to 20 mg l in the cultivation medium the higher plant tolerance to se vi compared to se iv has also been observed in other plants such as sunflower and maize when cultivated in a hydroponic system garousi et al 2016 the different toxicity of se iv and se vi on plants growth can be explained by the different mobility bioavailability and metabolic uptake mechanisms li et al 2008 specifically se vi is taken up in an active way and easily distributed from roots to shoots arvy 1993 while se iv is absorbed in a faster passive way and quickly converted into organic forms of se fig 6 the organic se is then incorporated into proteins by replacing sulfur in plant tissues resulting in malformed selenoproteins arvy 1993 de oliveira et al 2017 moreover se induced oxidative stress also contributes to plant toxicity van hoewyk 2013 accordingly the reduction of se iv to organic se forms e g semet secys2 may produce additional organic se metabolites such as selenodiglutathione which is more toxic than se iv inducing oxidative stress in plants van hoewyk 2013 wallenberg et al 2010 the higher toxicity of se iv can also be attributed to the higher se uptake accumulation in the plant tissues when the two plants were cultivated in se iv containing medium compared to the se vi treatment the uptake of se iv in both lemna and azolla was higher than that of se vi resulting in se concentrations in both plants more than 10 fold higher when they were grown in se iv supplemented medium fig 3 similarly broyer et al 1972 reported more accumulation of se iv than se vi by the hyper accumulator astragalus crotolariae after 7 12 weeks of hydroponic culture zhang et al 2003 observed 4 times higher uptake of se iv than se vi by soybean glycine max while arvy 1993 reported a similar uptake rate for the two se species by bean plants phaseolus vulgaris during a 3 h uptake experiment the higher uptake of se iv can be explained by the different metabolism of se iv and se vi in plants se vi is taken up by plants reduced to se iv and then converted into organic se van hoewyk 2013 the se vi reduction occurs via substitution for sulfate in the atp sulfurylase reductase system which is an atp consumption process and rate limiting step salt et al 2002 van hoewyk 2013 the se vi reduction rate is much slower than the uptake rate resulting in se vi saturation and lower se content in plant tissues which is supported by the high proportion of se vi species in both lemna and azolla grown in the presence of se vi fig 6 on the other hand versini et al 2016 reported a lower uptake of se iv compared to se vi in the non accumulator ryegrass grown in hydroponic cultures garousi et al 2016 also observed that the root to shoot se translocation and total se uptake was lower in se iv treated plants maize and sunflower than in se vi treated plants these discrepancies are likely caused by different external environmental factors such as temperature light intensity se exposure concentration and medium composition especially the content of macronutrient e g sulfate and phosphate or micronutrient elements as well as the differences in plant species kikkert and berkelaar 2013 for instance astragalus crotolariae and soybean glycine max are se hyperaccumulators whereas ryegrass maize and sunflower are non accumulators the se hyperaccumulators differ from the non accumulators in the capacity of reduction of the intracellular concentration of selenocysteine secys and semet terry et al 2000 non accumulators incorporate most secys and semet into proteins with damaging effects to plant functions while hyperaccumulators metabolize the secys primarily into various non protein selenoamino acids such as semetsecys se cystathionine and γ glutamyl methylselenocysteine to tolerate high concentrations of se in their cells terry et al 2000 the high tolerance keeps the cell membranes functional and improves the passive uptake of se iv resulting in more accumulation of se iv than that of se vi by se hyeraccumulators besides wang et al 2019 evidenced that tomato solanum lycopersicum l has a higher uptake ability of se vi than se iv at 0 0175 0 2998 mg l se exposure while the opposite was observed when se exposure was higher than 0 2998 mg l which partially confirms that the se exposure concentration may affect the uptake ability of se by plants 4 2 simultaneous uptake of se and zn the se concentration in lemna increased with increasing zn dosage in the medium whereas it declined in azolla these results indicate that zn promoted the se uptake in lemna but inhibited the se uptake in azolla accordingly the zn concentration in lemna also raised with raising se dose in the culture medium but it decreased in azolla these findings demonstrate that se and zn have synergetic effects in lemna but antagonistic effects in azolla the interactions between se and other elements during plant absorption have been reported but ambiguous conclusions have been drawn in line with our results with azolla previous studies have demonstrated that se absorption can decrease the uptake of certain elements for example singh and singh 1978 found that se application reduced the zn and cu concentration in wheat triticum aestivum similarly the antagonistic effects between se and other elements such as mg k p fe cu and zn have been demonstrated by feng et al 2009 in the fern pteris vittata l however other studies showed that se could improve zn uptake which supports part of our findings in lemna fig 4 for instance arvy 1992 demonstrated that helminthia echioides grown under field conditions accumulated se at concentration ranging from 2 05 to 7 90 mg kg and that se accumulation was positively correlated with mn zn ni co and cd uptake hu et al 2015 showed that mn zn cu ni and co in the stems of danshen salvia miltiorrhiza were higher when se vi was added to the soil similarly the foliar application of se iv in turnip brassica rapa var rapa linn positively affected the uptake of several elements such as mg fe zn mn and cu li et al 2018 the increase of se concentration in lemna with increasing zn addition fig 3 could be partially explained by bioconcentration because of the decline of biomass li et al 2015 this is supported by the negative correlation between the se concentration and biomass of lemna exposed to different zn dosages within each se application dose while this correlation was not observed in azolla table s9 similarly the increment of the zn concentration in lemna with increasing se iv application may be related to the decrease of biomass table s10 which is also evidenced by the significant decrease of zn accumulation multiplying biomass by concentration and zn removal efficiency by lemna when the se application increased p 0 01 tables s2 and s3 additionally se is detoxified by methylation of secys2 and semet to semetsecys and methylselenomethionine me semet which cannot be incorporated into proteins thereby avoiding toxicity and allowing a safe se accumulation gupta and gupta 2017 in this study semet accounted for the highest proportion of the identified se species in lemna grown in se iv while semetsecys predominated in the se iv treatment with zn fig 6 the formation and accumulation of non toxic semetsecys species from toxic secys2 could have been stimulated by the addition of zn probably by stimulating the expression of selenocysteine methyltransferase smt van hoewyk 2013 eventually resulting in the enhancement of se accumulation and the higher se concentration in lemna in the treatment with se and zn azolla on the other hand showed an antagonistic effect between the uptake of se and zn which may be related to the higher metal tolerance ability of azolla and the se mediated detoxification of heavy metals for lemna the supplementation of 5 0 mg l se iv or zn decreased the dry weight of the biomass by 61 and 29 respectively while for azolla the reduction was only 20 and 6 respectively fig 1 the higher metal tolerance of azolla suggests a detoxification mechanism was triggered by the exposure to se and zn accumulated metal ions are normally detoxified by phytochelatins pcs which are synthesized from glutathione gsh during exposure to heavy metals pcs form a complex with metal ions and sequester them into the vacuole yadav 2010 research has evidenced that zn could induce the pcs synthesis in some plants tsuji et al 2002 however hawrylak nowak et al 2014 reported that se reduced the pcs accumulation in the presence of cd due to se interference with the s metabolism and replacement of s in amino acids forming se amino acids semet and secys se amino acids are subsequently incorporated into enzymatic proteins including phytochelatin synthase as this contains cysteine affecting their catalytic activity thus the replacement of cysteine by secys in the phytochelatin synthase probably affects the biosynthesis and accumulation of pcs in the plant tissues malik et al 2012 wan et al 2016 the decrease of pcs induced by se could explain the decrease of the zn concentration in azolla when se was supplied in addition increasing se doses cause saturation of lipids and increases membrane stiffness resulting in lower membrane permeability and less accumulation of micro and macronutrients in plants filek et al 2010 contrasting interactions between the uptake of metal and metalloids by lemna and azolla have been reported for cu and as for example cu inhibited as uptake in azolla caroliniana while it stimulated as uptake in lemna minor rofkar et al 2014 although the combined interactions of se and zn uptake in lemna and azolla were demonstrated in this study the mechanisms are still unclear particularly the reason why zn and se showed opposite effects on se zn uptake between azolla and lemna should be further explored therefore further studies using e g 77se isotope should be conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of micronutrient accumulation and se species transformations in both lemna and azolla di tullo et al 2015 4 3 potential of lemna and azolla for wastewater treatment and production of micronutrient enriched bioproducts the species of lemna and azolla used in this study can tolerate and accumulate high se levels indicating that the two aquatic plants are optimal se bioaccumulators the maximum accumulation of se in lemna and azolla was 1664 and 1139 mg kg respectively tables 2 and 4 these values are much higher than the se accumulation in the duckweed landoltia punctate 785 mg kg which was reported to tolerate up to 80 μmol l na2seo3 6 3 mg l se zhong and cheng 2016 and also higher than the se accumulation in azolla caroliniana less than 1000 mg kg exposed to 1 10 mg l se iv hassan and mostafa 2016 moreover the se and zn accumulation in lemna increased with increasing zn exposure which confirms that lemna can efficiently remove se and zn together figs 3 and 4 the bcf provides information on the ability of a plant to accumulate contaminants from polluted water or soil in general a bcf larger than 1 suggests that a plant can be considered as a candidate with good phytoextraction efficiency li et al 2015 the bcfse values of lemna and azolla were all larger than 1 table 6 however the se removal efficiency by lemna and azolla was not as high as other indicators e g se content bcf the maximum se iv removal efficiencies by lemna and azolla were 30 and 39 respectively and only 3 for se vi this may be due to the small amount of biomass 1 0 g fresh weight transferred into each treatment and to a limiting water surface area in this study as floating aquatic plants can only root on the water surface regarding the lower removal efficiency of se vi it could be also partially attributed to the competition between se vi and sulfate 0 83 mm in the medium resulting in a lower ability of the plant to take up and accumulate se vi it should be noted that the sulfate concentration applied in the medium is a normal concentration in wastewater and suitable for plant growth li et al 2008 mechora et al 2015 therefore the se removal efficiencies could improve by increasing the biomass concentration or optimizing the geometry of the treatment tank and the chemical composition of waste water despite the currently low se removal efficiencies the high se iv and zn accumulation capacity 1000 mg kg se and zn of lemna and azolla together with the high tolerance to se and zn the fast growth rate and the easy harvest make these plant species interesting alternatives for the production of micronutrient enriched food feed supplements or fertilizers therefore the plants could also be grown in treatment ponds treating non se rich wastewater e g domestic wastewater to which se iv is added to obtain se enriched food feed supplements or fertilizers in that way a high value product is produced from the wastewater while recovering resources particularly a high protein content is beneficial for food feed supplements or ingredients in this study the true protein content in lemna and azolla were as high as 162 and 170 mg g fig 5 respectively which is much higher than other plants such as turnip brassica rapa var rapa linn and codonopsis lanceolata li et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 the crude protein content in turnip was 59 5 93 5 mg g when 0 200 mg l se iv was sprayed on the leaves and the protein content in c lanceolata was 15 4 17 2 mg g when 0 5 2 0 mg kg se iv was applied to the soil li et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 besides it should be noted that the conversion factor 5 conversion n to protein applied in this study may potentially underestimate the protein content due to some missing amino acids were not analyzed e g cysteine and tryptophan table s1 moreover most of the identified se species in both lemna and azolla were organic se forms around 88 90 and 54 76 of identified se species respectively when grown on se iv containing medium fig 6 which are the preferred forms for se supplementation in animal feed zhan et al 2007 it has to be noted that the sum of identified se species ranged from 3 2 to 12 2 when the plants were grown on se iv containing medium table s7 the low recoveries of se indicated that se iv is easily metabolized and incorporated into different se compounds complicating their extraction and identification moreover the inorganic se content also seem to be relatively high when plants are exposed to se iv and se vi particularly for use in food or feed further product processing through fractionation of the obtained micronutrient enriched lemna and azolla and or applying lower se dosages may help to remove excess inorganic se for use as micronutrient rich feed or food supplement a high se concentration is preferred but for use as feed or food ingredient which will be consumed in higher amounts a high protein content combined with a lower se concentration is sufficient furthermore the produced se and zn enriched bioproducts could be reused and applied as slow release organic fertilizers in se zn deficient fields to improve the se and zn levels in the soil and the crops growing on these soils the potential of se and zn enriched lemna and azolla for this application also requires further investigation including pot or field trials with relevant crops 5 conclusions this study investigated the accumulation and combined effects of se and zn in two aquatic plants lemna and azolla grown in hydroponic culture 1 the results demonstrated that se iv is more toxic than se vi for both plant species investigated as evidenced by the considerable decrease of biomass content and root length when exposed to se iv rich medium both aquatic plants took up around 10 times more se iv than se vi from the medium 2 the se accumulation and removal efficiency by lemna increased with increasing zn dosage in the medium whereas it declined in azolla suggesting a synergetic effect in lemna but an antagonistic effect in azolla 3 both lemna and azolla can tolerate and accumulate high levels of se iv and zn which combined with the observed transformation to organic species high protein content and rapid plant growth makes them good candidates for the production of se and zn enriched biomass that can be used as crop fertilizers or protein rich food feed supplements or ingredients declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
