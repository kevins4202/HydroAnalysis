1465,as a trace heavy metal lead pb has many anthropogenic applications but also produces many environmental pollution problems because of its high toxicity in this study we combined two in situ high resolution sampling techniques high resolution dialysis hr peeper and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt with the dgt induced fluxes in sediment difs model to explore the mechanism of pb release and resupply between sediments and pore water in the lower reaches and estuary of the jiuxi river and the adjacent coast an analysis of the chemical forms of pb in the sediments showed that the content of the acid extractable fraction f1 was higher at the coastal site than at the other sampling sites which indicates that pb in the coastal sediments had greater activity and was more likely to cause pb pollution the apparent diffusion fluxes of pb across the sediment water interface swi in the lower reaches estuary and coastal zone are negative and the absolute value of pb flux in the estuary is several times higher than that in the other two stations indicating a strong downward pb diffusion trend which may be due to water pollution caused by the nearby sewage outlet as an insensitive element to redox pb did not exhibit an obvious correlation with fe in particular the high pb concentration and strong downward diffusion trend of the overlying water in the estuary caused the significant negative correlation between pb and fe the calculated results of the difs model show that the reduced layer in the intertidal zone along the coast has the highest r value the highest desorption rate k 1 and the shortest response time tc indicating that sediment particles in the coastal intertidal zone supply pb to the pore water at the fastest rate consequently pb pollution in the coastal zone is worthy of further attention keywords lead diffusive gradients in thin films pore water sediment water interface dgt induced fluxes in sediment model 1 introduction trace heavy metals in the environment have drawn widespread concern because they are highly toxic and nonbiodegradable chen et al 2019b among the heavy metals lead pb which is a nonessential element for living organisms is toxic to the nervous hematopoietic and renal systems beyer et al 2013 mateo et al 2003 the accumulation of pb in the body will damage the nervous and endocrine systems particularly in children leading to mental retardation and growth retardation moreover pb accumulation can also affect the absorption of minerals thereby causing a lack of zinc iron calcium and other nutrients and leading to picky eating anorexia anemia rickets and other conditions cao et al 2014 dorea 2019 numerous studies have shown that pb can irreversibly damage the nervous systems and brains of children almeida lopes et al 2016 reuben 2018 with the increase in exogenous control in recent years the contribution of sediment which is an endogenous pollution source to water pollution has gradually increased pollutant migration and transformation occur in the micro interface in many cases and changes in pollutant migration and transformation or their reaction characteristics are also closely related to the microenvironment of the interface kang et al 2010 sediments have high spatial heterogeneity in particular a microecosystem can even occur in the microenvironment at the sediment water interface swi maynard et al 2009 thus the study of many environmental pollution processes has also developed from the conventional scale to the micro scale the minimum can reach the nanometer scale brendel and luther 1995 luther et al 1999 honeyman 1999 therefore high resolution acquisition technology is required to characterize the complex occurrence mechanisms of environmental pollution the jiuxi river is a vital component of the xiang an district of xiamen due to the influence of human activities especially the development of township enterprises in the 1990s the jiuxi river has been seriously polluted and the ecological environment throughout the river basin has been destroyed trace heavy metal pollution caused by industrial and residential processes has been widely studied it is well known that the amount of heavy metals in sediments does not predict their bioavailability or toxicity cornu et al 2006 tusseau vuillemin et al 2007 thus studying the distribution of metal species in sediments is a key aspect of evaluating the bioavailability of heavy metals peng et al 2004 the traditional methods for obtaining the metal concentrations of pore water in sediments are usually centrifugation extrusion or dialysis batley et al 1980 carignan et al 1985 however the metal species may change during the sampling and extraction process as a new in situ passive sampling technique the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique davison and zhang 1994 can not only meet the needs of micro interface research by enabling the high resolution determination of heavy metals in sediment pore water but also largely eliminate the influence of traditional active sampling techniques on sample validity in addition chelex dgt can be used to synchronously acquire pb and fe avoiding the spatial dislocation caused by nonsynchronized acquisition wang et al 2017 therefore dgt is an optimal technique for the determination of available metals by simulating biological absorption webb and keough 2002 in the present work the lower reaches rl estuarine intertidal zone tu and estuarine subtidal zone td of the jiuxi river as well as the adjacent coastal intertidal zone su and coastal subtidal zone sd were selected as study sites fig 1 in this study two new in situ passive sampling techniques namely hr peeper hesslein 1976 teasdale et al 1995 xu et al 2012 and zro chelex dgt wang et al 2017 were used to measure the dissolved pb and dgt labile pb in sediments and pore water respectively ding et al 2010 xu et al 2013 the dgt induced fluxes in soil difs model is a numerical model that quantitatively describes the adsorption and desorption process between sediments and pore water ernstberger et al 2002 harper et al 2000 dissolved pb and dgt labile pb were combined with the difs model ernstberger et al 2002 harper et al 2000 and the migration of pb between sediments and pore water was simulated and analyzed the primary objectives of this study were to 1 provide sufficient information to assess the risk of pb contamination in the sediments 2 describe the spatial distributions of dgt pb and dissolved pb and analyze their diffusive fluxes at the swi and 3 use the difs model to explore the mechanism of pb release and resupply between sediments and pore water 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of hr peeper and dgt probes hr peeper and zro chelex dgt are manufactured by easy sensor ltd china www easysensor net the principles and assembly methods of the hr peeper and dgt probes have been described in detail in published materials xu et al 2012 ding et al 2016b davison and zhang 1994 the hr peeper devices used in this study were 20 cm long and 5 cm wide had a 5 mm vertical resolution and included a total of 36 cells for sample collection using a pvdf filter membrane pore diameter 0 45 Î¼m thickness 0 1 mm the size of the adsorbed gel of the dgt probe was 15 cm long and 1 8 cm wide the assembled hr peeper and dgt devices were soaked in clean deionized water to avoid dehydration and violent vibrations and the oxygen in the device was removed by filling the airspace with nitrogen before using dgt devices 2 2 study sites and sample collection the study sites are distributed along the lower reaches and estuaries of the jiuxi river and adjacent coast in xiamen china fig 1 the jiuxi river which is the largest river in the xiang an district of xiamen has a total length of 20 55 km and a basin area of 101 km2 and it originates in the wuyingzhai mountains and empties into the dadeng sea the climate of the basin is a typical subtropical maritime monsoon climate warm and humid with moderate temperatures and abundant rainfall the average annual precipitation is 1143 5 mm and the amount of rainfall varies seasonally the flood season of the jiuxi river is generally from april to september during which precipitation can account for more than 70 of the annual precipitation jin et al 2013 the mean annual runoff is 1 79 m3 s and varies seasonally the tide in the dadeng sea is a normal semidiurnal tide that takes the form of a reciprocating current and the tidal range varies between 1 m and 6 m with an average tidal range of 4 m pan et al 2020 the hydrodynamic force from waves and tides is weak which is favorable for the deposition of argillaceous sediments therefore the tidal flats are mainly composed of argillaceous sediments and their width can reach up to 400 m with a very low slope in january winter 2018 a sampling campaign was performed at five sampling sites as shown in fig 1 during the low tide period hr peeper sampling probes were first inserted into the sediments at each sampling site after 24 h the zro chelex dgt sampling probe was inserted into the sediments at each sampling site after an additional 24 h the dgt and hr peeper devices were simultaneously retrieved from the sediments when the devices at each sampling site were removed a 5 cm diameter pvc tube was used to collect the sediment surrounding the device the surfaces of the probes were cleaned with deionized water sealed with plastic wrap and put into a plastic bag the hr peeper probes dgt probes and sediment cores were taken back to the laboratory as quickly as possible for analysis 2 3 pore water and solid phase analyses after each sediment core was taken back to the laboratory the four undisturbed jiuxi sediment cores were divided at 2 cm intervals the divided samples were placed in sealed polyethylene bags and kept at a low temperature prior to experimental analysis based on modified steps of bcr sequential extraction european community bureau of reference the chemical species of pb in the sediments are divided into four parts soluble exchangeable pb f1 reducible pb f2 oxidizable pb f3 and residual pb f4 pueyo et al 2008 f1 usually stands for pb in the form of exchangeable ions or pb bound to carbonate f2 represents the portion of pb bound to amorphous iron manganese oxides and iron manganese hydroxides and can be released into pore water if the environment becomes more reducing f3 represents the pb bound to organic matter and sulfides and can be released if the environment becomes more oxidizing f4 represents pb in mineral lattice stable in nature and has little contribution to pb migration and bioavailability in sediments panda et al 1995 f1 f2 and f3 which represent the major fractions with release potential were analyzed in this study according to the method of simultaneous determination of 16 kinds of anions and cations by wang et al 2017 zro chelex dgt probes were cut into long strips at intervals of 5 mm in the horizontal direction and put into the centrifugal tube successively then 1 2 ml of 1 0 m hno3 was added to each centrifuge tube to extract the dgt labile pb and fe finally 1 ml of the extract was taken out and put into the new centrifuge tube and 0 6 ml of 3 hno3 was added for dilution the hr peeper probe samples were removed 0 2 ml from top to bottom with a pipette and packed into a sealed centrifuge tube to analyze the concentration of dissolved pb and fe to dilute and preserve the sample 3 8 ml of 3 hno3 was added to each centrifuge tube the concentrations of labile pb and dissolved pb as well as the concentrations of labile fe and dissolved fe were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7500ce 2 4 calculation of dgt labile pb and fe concentrations the flux of specific metal ions from the liquid phase to the fixed gel layer f and the concentration of metal ions in water or pore water at the device interface c dgt can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 davison and zhang 1994 1 f m at 2 c dgt m g dat where m is the total number of ions fixed in the fixed gel layer a is the area of the gel

s the diffusivity of each ion only depends on temperature and not on other properties of the aqueous solution wang et al 2016 m can be calculated by eq 3 3 m c e v g v e f e where c e is the concentration of the metal in the eluate Î¼g l 1 v g is the volume of gel v e is the volume of nitric acid and f e is the extraction coefficient of nitric acid on heavy metals in the resin gel 0 889 for fe and 0 955 for pb wang et al 2016 2 5 calculation of difs model parameters r represents the strength of the concentration retention and indicates the ability of sediment recharge and it can be calculated by eq 4 4 r c dgt c porewoter in this study c porewater was measured by hr peeper other major difs model parameters are calculated as follows 5 k d c s c d f 1 c porewater 6 k 1 1 t c 1 k d

1 overlying water and sediment properties the morphological distribution of heavy metals is affected by the geochemical parameters of sediments jacquat et al 2009 table 1 lists the main properties of the sediments and overlying water at each sampling site rl tu td su and sd including the total organic carbon toc toc total nitrogen tn ratio salinity s ph dissolved oxygen do and dissolved pb concentration in the overlying water in the sediments the toc value was highest at sd 0 76 and lowest at td 0 48 the toc tn ratio was highest in the rl 14 60 and lowest along the sd 7 43 indicating that the source of organic matter changes from terrigenous to thalassogenous perdue and koprivnjak 2007 in the overlying water the s fluctuated between 0 54 and 9 12 with the lowest value at rl and the highest value at su which is consistent with the pattern in which s increases from land to sea the ph values ranged from 7 80 to 8 74 with small differences between the estuary and the coast indicating that the sediments in the study area were weakly alkaline the do content was high in the rl 16 96 and sd 7 71 and lowest in the estuary 2 85 indicating hypoxic conditions in the estuarine water which is consistent with the findings of a previous study pan et al 2020 in this study the dissolved pb concentration in the overlying water was determined by the hr peeper device teasdale et al 1995 because the samples above the swi in the intertidal zone were exposed to air during low tide we do not discuss the dissolved pb in the overlying water of the intertidal zone in addition because the hr peeper at the sd sampling site was broken by shell fragments in the sediment dissolved pb data at sd are not available therefore in this study we discuss only the dissolved pb concentrations in the overlying water at rl and td the concentrations of dissolved pb at rl and td were 1 21 Î¼g l 1 and 4 50 Î¼g l 1 respectively table 1 according to the seawater quality standards of the people s republic of china gb 3097 1997 the dissolved pb concentrations in the rl and estuary both exceed the class i seawater standard 3 2 chemical forms of pb in sediments according to the bcr sequential extraction the pb in sediments was divided into four different chemical forms it is generally believed that f1 the acid extractable fraction of pb f2 the easily reducible fraction of pb and f3 the oxidizable fraction of pb have relatively high potential for conversion into biologically available dissolved pb and release from sediments long et al 2009 chen et al 2019a fig 2 shows the vertical distribution of pb concentrations in three different chemical forms in sediments the maximum value of f1 occurs at depths of 8 to 10 cm rather than in the surface sediments in most profiles the reason for this finding may be that this form of pb is easily released from surface sediments into the overlying water resulting in a maximum value in the subsurface this fraction of pb presents the greatest environmental threat because it will migrate into the overlying water if more acidic conditions occur usero et al 1998 the concentration of f1 in coastal sediments su and sd was higher than that in the estuary tu and td and rl indicating that the pb in the coastal sediments was active and could easily cause pb pollution the pb in the sediments at the five sampling sites is mainly f2 the easily reducible fraction of pb which is consistent with the findings of a previous study reported by nemati et al 2011 the f2 concentration of pb in the coastal sediments su and sd is lower than that at the other sites and the corresponding f1 and f3 contents are relatively high the concentration of f3 in the coastal sediments su and sd is especially high and the concentration in the sd is higher than that in the su relevant studies have shown that toc plays an important role in the release of heavy metals in sediments seidemann 1991 barhoumi et al 2019 and the toc content table 1 at the sd site is the highest the reducing conditions in the subtidal zone td and sd are stronger than those in the intertidal zone tu and su all of which may contribute to the especially high content of f3 in the sd profile in addition the highest f3 and lowest f2 concentrations in the coastal sediments indicate that a large amount of pb is bound to organic matter and sulfides which is possibly due to the strong sulfate reduction in sulfate rich coastal sediments 3 3 depth profiles of dissolved pb and dgt labile pb fig 3 shows the depth profiles of dissolved pb and dgt labile pb the concentration of labile pb ranged from 0 30 Î¼g l 1 to 0 40 Î¼g l 1 0 30 Î¼g l 1 to 0 68 Î¼g l 1 0 30 Î¼g l 1 to 0 39 Î¼g l 1 0 04 Î¼g l 1 to 0 74 Î¼g l 1 and 0 13 Î¼g l 1 to 0 40 Î¼g l 1 at the rl tu td su and sd sampling sites respectively the concentration of dissolved pb ranged from 0 88 Î¼g l 1 to 4 5 Î¼g l 1 3 36 Î¼g l 1 to 8 43 Î¼g l 1 0 56 Î¼g l 1 to 12 33 Î¼g l 1 and 0 25 Î¼g l 1 to 2 82 Î¼g l 1 at the rl tu td and su sampling sites respectively the mean pb concentrations in the pore water below the swi at the five sampling sites are shown in fig 4 the concentration of dissolved pb is significantly higher than that of labile pb because cdgt is the average concentration between dgt and the sediment interface during the measurement period if the metal in the pore water is adsorbed and the soil particles are unable to replenish the metal the concentration of cdgt will be lower than the actual effective state concentration of the metal in the sediment davison and zhang 1994 additionally the dgt device measures the effective state concentration of the metal according to the reaction of free ions with the adsorbent in the adsorption film if a portion of the metal complex is not dissociated in the diffusion layer it cannot react with the adsorbent sun et al 2019 the effective state is defined here as the metal form that can be rapidly exchanged in solution and that can then diffuse and be absorbed by plants barber 1995 the hr peeper device measures the concentration of all dissolved pb in the pore water while the dgt probe can adsorb pb in only the active ionic state yin et al 2014 in general the free state ions of pb are adsorbed by dissolved organic matter dom and do not readily dissociate therefore the dgt probe cannot detect the fraction of dissolved pb complexed with dom zhang and davison 1995 the maximum values of dissolved pb and labile pb were both observed at the tu site and the second highest dissolved pb concentration was observed at the td site which indicates that the dissolved pb concentration in the estuary is much higher than that at the other sampling sites however the dgt labile pb value did not increase significantly in the estuary considering the sedimentary environment in the estuary the high dissolved pb concentration is probably due to the nearby sewage outlet which causes increased dom input consistent with hypoxia in the overlying water however most pb is complexed with dom resulting in little change in the value of dgt labile pb compared with the dissolved and dgt labile fe concentrations which increase with depth below the swi fig 5 the dissolved and dgt labile pb concentrations exhibit no clear trend with depth fig 3 this result indicates that pb is less sensitive to redox conditions than fe and other redox sensitive elements e g mn as and p ding et al 2016a ding et al 2012 pan et al 2017 pan et al 2019a pan et al 2019b the migration of pb is affected by fe and mn oxides for example pb is adsorbed or coprecipitated by fe or mn oxides under oxidation conditions do 2 mg l 1 and released by dissolution of fe or mn oxides under hypoxic conditions do 0 5 mg l 1 dong et al 2000 munger et al 2016 ibm spss statistics 24 for windows was used to perform a statistical analysis of the correlation a correlation of p 0 05 indicated that two parameters were significantly correlated table 2 shows the statistical correlations between pb and fe the correlations between pb and fe for the surface layer and the whole profile were calculated separately from the whole profile both the measured hr peeper and dgt results showed that the correlation between pb and fe is not high dissolved pb and dissolved fe even exhibited relatively strong negative correlations at both tu and td fig 3 shows that the pb concentrations of the overlying water are high at both tu and td and the vertical distribution showed obviously high pb concentrations in the upper layer and low pb concentrations in the lower layer this pattern may have been caused by the downward diffusion of pb from the overlying water which is contrary to the vertical distribution of fe which increased in concentration with depth resulting in a negative correlation between pb and fe high concentrations in the overlying water also occurred at rl 1 21 Î¼g l 1 and su 1 25 Î¼g l 1 although an obvious pattern of high concentrations in the upper layer and low concentrations in the lower layer was not observed this result may be related to the hydrodynamic conditions which are strong in the estuary thereby promoting the downward diffusion of pb from the overlying water as the depth of the redox conversion layer differs at each station the depth of the surface layer also differed as shown in table 2 except for su the correlation between pb and fe in the surface layer was weak at the other stations this result occurred because pb migration is affected not only by fe oxide dissolution but also by other factors in sediments such as the redox potential eh do value and dom complex olaniran et al 2013 the pb and fe in the surface layer of su sites were highly correlated regardless of the dissolved pb and fe or dgt labile pb and fe indicating that the pb migration in the coastal intertidal zone was significantly affected by fe reduction at su both the dissolved pb and labile pb concentrations significantly increased abruptly at a depth of 6 75 cm which may be related to the remineralization of organic matter in fig 5 dissolved fe also increased at a depth of 6 75 cm although the labile fe concentration exhibited no significant change which was possibly because fe reduction promotes the remineralization of organic matter which releases pb and allows fe to bond with dom 3 4 molecular diffusion flux of pb across the swi based on the characteristics of sediments and dissolved pb concentration in sediment and overlying water a numerical model is applied to calculate the apparent pb fluxes at the swi the equation is as follows ding et al 2015 gao et al 2018 9 j j w j s d w c porewater x w x 0 Ï d s c porewater x s x 0 where j represents the apparent flux of pb across the swi j w and j s represent the molecular diffusive flux of unstable pb from the overlying water across the swi and from sediment across the swi respectively c porewater x w and c porewater x s are the concentration gradients of dissolved pb in a range of 2 cm above the swi and 2 cm below the swi respectively which are obtained by fitting a curve Ï represents the sediment porosity and d w and d s represent the molecular diffusion coefficient of pb in the overlying water and sediments respectively at a certain temperature according to li 1974 if Ï 0 7 d s is equal to Ï 2 d w to compare the apparent flux of pb across the swi at the three different sites lower reach estuary and coast we combined the apparent flux of pb at tu and td to obtain a mean value to represent the level in the estuary and combined the su and sd data to represent the coast a positive apparent flux means pb migrates from the sediment to the overlying water and a negative apparent flux means pb migrates from the overlying water to the sediment fig 6 shows the average apparent flux of pb across the swi in the lower reaches estuary and adjacent coast of the jiuxi river the pb flux is negative at all sites indicating that pb tends to migrate from the overlying water to the sediments and this result is consistent with the observed vertical distribution pattern fig 3 the absolute value of pb flux at the estuary is several times higher than that at the other sites indicating that the pb diffusion downward from the overlying water is intense in the estuary as mentioned in section 3 3 above this result may be due to the hydrodynamic influence 3 5 pb release revealed by the difs model fe is a redox sensitive element and dissolved fe exhibits an obvious vertical distribution fig 5 according to the vertical distribution of fe the depth profile of sediments is divided into three layers from top to bottom namely the oxidizing layer transition layer and reducing layer table 3 lists the input parameters and output parameters of the difs model for all three layers at four of the sampling sites the equilibrium distribution coefficient of the solid phase and solution kd can represent the potential of sediment to release pb with the highest value in the transition layer at su 5679 89 cm3 g 1 and the lowest value in the transition layer at tu 156 10 cm3 g 1 the sediment porosity Ï represents the size of the pore space between sediment particles and ranged from 0 46 to 0 74 at the sampling sites tc ranged from 1 13 103 s to 1 00 107 s at all sampling sites with the lowest value observed in the reducing layer at su and the highest values observed in the oxidizing layer transition layer and reducing layer at tu the k 1 value ranged from 2 58 10 7 s 1 in the oxidizing layer at rl to 1 31 10 10 s 1 in the reducing layer at tu the r value is the ratio of cdgt pb to the total pb concentration dissolved pb in the pore water and can be used to describe the ability of sediment particles to resupply pb after pore water pb is transferred or consumed according to the r value the ability of sediment particles to resupply pb can be divided into three types complete persistence r 0 90 partial persistence 0 10 r 0 90 and single diffusion r 0 10 http www dgtresearch com at the sampling sites the r value ranged from 0 06 to 0 49 rl td and su belong to the partial persistence type while tu belongs to the single diffusion type r tc and k 1 all exhibit certain regular changes at tu td and su all sites except rl from the oxidizing layer to the reducing layer the r values gradually increased and at td and su tc gradually decreased and k 1 gradually increased these patterns indicate that the rate of pb release increases gradually from the oxidizing layer to the transition layer and then the reducing layer and the rate at which sediments release pb into pore water increases with increasing depth however there are no significant differences in r values among the three layers at rl which is related to lack of significant differences in the vertical distribution of dissolved pb in rl fig 3 therefore the ability of sediments to replenish pb does not change significantly in the vertical profile of rl the r values at tu are too low which may be due to the influence of pb complexation with dom as mentioned in section 3 3 which leads to a dissolved pb value that is significantly higher than the labile pb value resulting in extremely small r values the high toc values at tu table 1 can be used as evidence the r values were less than 0 90 and greater than 0 10 at all sampling sites except tu indicating that these sites could be grouped into the partial persistence type these results indicate that the concentration of available pb added by sediment particles is not enough to sustain cdgt pb at the initial concentration the r value of tu is less than 0 10 indicating that this site may belong to the single diffusion type in other words sediment particles cannot supply pb to the pore water and the pb in the dgt interface can be supplied by only diffusion from the high concentration zone fig 7 shows the time dependent curve of the r value at four sampling sites rl tu td and su reflecting the variation in the r value with increasing duration of the deployment of the dgt device at the early stage of dgt device deployment the r value rapidly increases and reaches the maximum value over a period of approximately 1 h in this process the dgt labile pb in pore water enters the diffusion gel layer and forms a concentration gradient therefore the r value increases linearly ernstberger et al 2005 menezes blackburn et al 2016 after the peak point the curve of the r value transforms into one of three different forms the first form includes the oxidizing layer transition layer and reducing layer at tu and the oxidizing layer at td in which the r values continuously decrease rapidly with time after the peak although the rate of decline slowed and the curve tended to be smoother after 5 h the curve did not reach equilibrium for a long time 24 h this result occurred because the pb concentration around the interface of the dgt device decreased after effective pb was adsorbed from pore water the migration rate of pb from the solid phase to the liquid phase was very slow and a steady state could not be maintained due to the insufficient desorption rate the second form includes the transition layer and reducing layer at td and the oxidizing layer at su as in the first form after reaching the highest point the r value decreases however the r values of these three layers are higher than those in the first form and the desorption rate of sediments is faster thus the potential for releasing pb from the sediments kd is also high these factors cause r to reach equilibrium after 6 h the third form includes the oxidizing layer transition layer and reducing layer at rl and the transition layer and reducing layer at su which exhibit small changes after the peak and rapidly stabilize with no significant change over time this finding indicates that the continuous replenishment rate in the solid phase is rapid and remains stable overall the r value curves show that during the initial period before 30 min the order of the r value is tu su td rl which depends on the porosity Ï as shown in table 3 that is the greater the porosity is the higher the r value after a long period following attainment of the peak value the order of the r value is su rl td tu which depends on the rate of solid phase resupply of pb in the sediments ernstberger et al 2005 xu et al 2019 4 conclusions in this study the risks and mechanisms of pb release in the jiuxi river were explored by dgt technology and hr peeper sampling technology in combination with difs model analysis the pb in the sediments at the five sampling sites is mainly reducible f2 the f1 content in the coastal sediments is high indicating that the pb in the surface sediments has a high risk of release the highest f3 at the sd sampling site may be due to the strong reducing environment and high toc content at this site the dissolved pb concentration in the estuary is much higher than that in the other regions due to the nearby sewage outlets inputting pb bound to dom compared with fe pb is not a redox sensitive element the high concentration and downward diffusion of the overlying water may be an important reason for the vertical distribution of pb resulting in high concentrations in the upper layer and low concentrations in the lower layer this finding is contrary to the vertical distribution trend of fe which increases with increasing depth the apparent pb flux is negative in the lower reaches estuary and coastal zone because of the high concentrations in the overlying water the occurrence of the highest absolute pb flux value in the estuary may be due to the strong hydrodynamic forces in the estuary which promote the downward migration of pb the r values of td and su both show a relatively obvious increase from the oxidizing layer to the reducing layer long after r reaches the peak value the order of r is su rl td tu which represents the capacity of the sediments to resupply pb to the pore water the reducing layer of su has the highest r value indicating that the coast has the highest risk of pb release in general the results of the swi flux and difs analysis indicate that more attention should be paid to the potential of pb release in coastal sediments in this study a research example involving the application of the difs model is provided and a new method of evaluating the resupply ability of trace metals is proposed in future works more consideration should be given to the effect of organic matter adsorption on pb declaration of competing interest the authors declare

1465,as a trace heavy metal lead pb has many anthropogenic applications but also produces many environmental pollution problems because of its high toxicity in this study we combined two in situ high resolution sampling techniques high resolution dialysis hr peeper and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt with the dgt induced fluxes in sediment difs model to explore the mechanism of pb release and resupply between sediments and pore water in the lower reaches and estuary of the jiuxi river and the adjacent coast an analysis of the chemical forms of pb in the sediments showed that the content of the acid extractable fraction f1 was higher at the coastal site than at the other sampling sites which indicates that pb in the coastal sediments had greater activity and was more likely to cause pb pollution the apparent diffusion fluxes of pb across the sediment water interface swi in the lower reaches estuary and coastal zone are negative and the absolute value of pb flux in the estuary is several times higher than that in the other two stations indicating a strong downward pb diffusion trend which may be due to water pollution caused by the nearby sewage outlet as an insensitive element to redox pb did not exhibit an obvious correlation with fe in particular the high pb concentration and strong downward diffusion trend of the overlying water in the estuary caused the significant negative correlation between pb and fe the calculated results of the difs model show that the reduced layer in the intertidal zone along the coast has the highest r value the highest desorption rate k 1 and the shortest response time tc indicating that sediment particles in the coastal intertidal zone supply pb to the pore water at the fastest rate consequently pb pollution in the coastal zone is worthy of further attention keywords lead diffusive gradients in thin films pore water sediment water interface dgt induced fluxes in sediment model 1 introduction trace heavy metals in the environment have drawn widespread concern because they are highly toxic and nonbiodegradable chen et al 2019b among the heavy metals lead pb which is a nonessential element for living organisms is toxic to the nervous hematopoietic and renal systems beyer et al 2013 mateo et al 2003 the accumulation of pb in the body will damage the nervous and endocrine systems particularly in children leading to mental retardation and growth retardation moreover pb accumulation can also affect the absorption of minerals thereby causing a lack of zinc iron calcium and other nutrients and leading to picky eating anorexia anemia rickets and other conditions cao et al 2014 dorea 2019 numerous studies have shown that pb can irreversibly damage the nervous systems and brains of children almeida lopes et al 2016 reuben 2018 with the increase in exogenous control in recent years the contribution of sediment which is an endogenous pollution source to water pollution has gradually increased pollutant migration and transformation occur in the micro interface in many cases and changes in pollutant migration and transformation or their reaction characteristics are also closely related to the microenvironment of the interface kang et al 2010 sediments have high spatial heterogeneity in particular a microecosystem can even occur in the microenvironment at the sediment water interface swi maynard et al 2009 thus the study of many environmental pollution processes has also developed from the conventional scale to the micro scale the minimum can reach the nanometer scale brendel and luther 1995 luther et al 1999 honeyman 1999 therefore high resolution acquisition technology is required to characterize the complex occurrence mechanisms of environmental pollution the jiuxi river is a vital component of the xiang an district of xiamen due to the influence of human activities especially the development of township enterprises in the 1990s the jiuxi river has been seriously polluted and the ecological environment throughout the river basin has been destroyed trace heavy metal pollution caused by industrial and residential processes has been widely studied it is well known that the amount of heavy metals in sediments does not predict their bioavailability or toxicity cornu et al 2006 tusseau vuillemin et al 2007 thus studying the distribution of metal species in sediments is a key aspect of evaluating the bioavailability of heavy metals peng et al 2004 the traditional methods for obtaining the metal concentrations of pore water in sediments are usually centrifugation extrusion or dialysis batley et al 1980 carignan et al 1985 however the metal species may change during the sampling and extraction process as a new in situ passive sampling technique the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique davison and zhang 1994 can not only meet the needs of micro interface research by enabling the high resolution determination of heavy metals in sediment pore water but also largely eliminate the influence of traditional active sampling techniques on sample validity in addition chelex dgt can be used to synchronously acquire pb and fe avoiding the spatial dislocation caused by nonsynchronized acquisition wang et al 2017 therefore dgt is an optimal technique for the determination of available metals by simulating biological absorption webb and keough 2002 in the present work the lower reaches rl estuarine intertidal zone tu and estuarine subtidal zone td of the jiuxi river as well as the adjacent coastal intertidal zone su and coastal subtidal zone sd were selected as study sites fig 1 in this study two new in situ passive sampling techniques namely hr peeper hesslein 1976 teasdale et al 1995 xu et al 2012 and zro chelex dgt wang et al 2017 were used to measure the dissolved pb and dgt labile pb in sediments and pore water respectively ding et al 2010 xu et al 2013 the dgt induced fluxes in soil difs model is a numerical model that quantitatively describes the adsorption and desorption process between sediments and pore water ernstberger et al 2002 harper et al 2000 dissolved pb and dgt labile pb were combined with the difs model ernstberger et al 2002 harper et al 2000 and the migration of pb between sediments and pore water was simulated and analyzed the primary objectives of this study were to 1 provide sufficient information to assess the risk of pb contamination in the sediments 2 describe the spatial distributions of dgt pb and dissolved pb and analyze their diffusive fluxes at the swi and 3 use the difs model to explore the mechanism of pb release and resupply between sediments and pore water 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of hr peeper and dgt probes hr peeper and zro chelex dgt are manufactured by easy sensor ltd china www easysensor net the principles and assembly methods of the hr peeper and dgt probes have been described in detail in published materials xu et al 2012 ding et al 2016b davison and zhang 1994 the hr peeper devices used in this study were 20 cm long and 5 cm wide had a 5 mm vertical resolution and included a total of 36 cells for sample collection using a pvdf filter membrane pore diameter 0 45 Î¼m thickness 0 1 mm the size of the adsorbed gel of the dgt probe was 15 cm long and 1 8 cm wide the assembled hr peeper and dgt devices were soaked in clean deionized water to avoid dehydration and violent vibrations and the oxygen in the device was removed by filling the airspace with nitrogen before using dgt devices 2 2 study sites and sample collection the study sites are distributed along the lower reaches and estuaries of the jiuxi river and adjacent coast in xiamen china fig 1 the jiuxi river which is the largest river in the xiang an district of xiamen has a total length of 20 55 km and a basin area of 101 km2 and it originates in the wuyingzhai mountains and empties into the dadeng sea the climate of the basin is a typical subtropical maritime monsoon climate warm and humid with moderate temperatures and abundant rainfall the average annual precipitation is 1143 5 mm and the amount of rainfall varies seasonally the flood season of the jiuxi river is generally from april to september during which precipitation can account for more than 70 of the annual precipitation jin et al 2013 the mean annual runoff is 1 79 m3 s and varies seasonally the tide in the dadeng sea is a normal semidiurnal tide that takes the form of a reciprocating current and the tidal range varies between 1 m and 6 m with an average tidal range of 4 m pan et al 2020 the hydrodynamic force from waves and tides is weak which is favorable for the deposition of argillaceous sediments therefore the tidal flats are mainly composed of argillaceous sediments and their width can reach up to 400 m with a very low slope in january winter 2018 a sampling campaign was performed at five sampling sites as shown in fig 1 during the low tide period hr peeper sampling probes were first inserted into the sediments at each sampling site after 24 h the zro chelex dgt sampling probe was inserted into the sediments at each sampling site after an additional 24 h the dgt and hr peeper devices were simultaneously retrieved from the sediments when the devices at each sampling site were removed a 5 cm diameter pvc tube was used to collect the sediment surrounding the device the surfaces of the probes were cleaned with deionized water sealed with plastic wrap and put into a plastic bag the hr peeper probes dgt probes and sediment cores were taken back to the laboratory as quickly as possible for analysis 2 3 pore water and solid phase analyses after each sediment core was taken back to the laboratory the four undisturbed jiuxi sediment cores were divided at 2 cm intervals the divided samples were placed in sealed polyethylene bags and kept at a low temperature prior to experimental analysis based on modified steps of bcr sequential extraction european community bureau of reference the chemical species of pb in the sediments are divided into four parts soluble exchangeable pb f1 reducible pb f2 oxidizable pb f3 and residual pb f4 pueyo et al 2008 f1 usually stands for pb in the form of exchangeable ions or pb bound to carbonate f2 represents the portion of pb bound to amorphous iron manganese oxides and iron manganese hydroxides and can be released into pore water if the environment becomes more reducing f3 represents the pb bound to organic matter and sulfides and can be released if the environment becomes more oxidizing f4 represents pb in mineral lattice stable in nature and has little contribution to pb migration and bioavailability in sediments panda et al 1995 f1 f2 and f3 which represent the major fractions with release potential were analyzed in this study according to the method of simultaneous determination of 16 kinds of anions and cations by wang et al 2017 zro chelex dgt probes were cut into long strips at intervals of 5 mm in the horizontal direction and put into the centrifugal tube successively then 1 2 ml of 1 0 m hno3 was added to each centrifuge tube to extract the dgt labile pb and fe finally 1 ml of the extract was taken out and put into the new centrifuge tube and 0 6 ml of 3 hno3 was added for dilution the hr peeper probe samples were removed 0 2 ml from top to bottom with a pipette and packed into a sealed centrifuge tube to analyze the concentration of dissolved pb and fe to dilute and preserve the sample 3 8 ml of 3 hno3 was added to each centrifuge tube the concentrations of labile pb and dissolved pb as well as the concentrations of labile fe and dissolved fe were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7500ce 2 4 calculation of dgt labile pb and fe concentrations the flux of specific metal ions from the liquid phase to the fixed gel layer f and the concentration of metal ions in water or pore water at the

1 overlying water and sediment properties the morphological distribution of heavy metals is affected by the geochemical parameters of sediments jacquat et al 2009 table 1 lists the main properties of the sediments and overlying water at each sampling site rl tu td su and sd including the total organic carbon toc toc total nitrogen tn ratio salinity s ph dissolved oxygen do and dissolved pb concentration in the overlying water in the sediments the toc value was highest at sd 0 76 and lowest at td 0 48 the toc tn ratio was highest in the rl 14 60 and lowest along the sd 7 43 indicating that the source of organic matter changes from terrigenous to thalassogenous perdue and koprivnjak 2007 in the overlying water the s fluctuated between 0 54 and 9 12 with the lowest value at rl and the highest value at su which is consistent with the pattern in which s increases from land to sea the ph values ranged from 7 80 to 8 74 with small differences between the estuary and the coast indicating that the sediments in the study area were weakly alkaline the do content was high in the rl 16 96 and sd 7 71 and lowest in the estuary 2 85 indicating hypoxic conditions in the estuarine water which is consistent with the findings of a previous study pan et al 2020 in this study the dissolved pb concentration in the overlying water was determined by the hr peeper device teasdale et al 1995 because the samples above the swi in the intertidal zone were exposed to air during low tide we do not discuss the dissolved pb in the overlying water of the intertidal zone in addition because the hr peeper at the sd sampling site was broken by shell fragments in the sediment dissolved pb data at sd are not available therefore in this study we discuss only the dissolved pb concentrations in the overlying water at rl and td the concentrations of dissolved pb at rl and td were 1 21 Î¼g l 1 and 4 50 Î¼g l 1 respectively table 1 according to the seawater quality standards of the people s republic of china gb 3097 1997 the dissolved pb concentrations in the rl and estuary both exceed the class i seawater standard 3 2 chemical forms of pb in sediments according to the bcr sequential extraction the pb in sediments was divided into four different chemical forms it is generally believed that f1 the acid extractable fraction of pb f2 the easily reducible fraction of pb and f3 the oxidizable fraction of pb have relatively high potential for conversion into biologically available dissolved pb and release from sediments long et al 2009 chen et al 2019a fig 2 shows the vertical distribution of pb concentrations in three different chemical forms in sediments the maximum value of f1 occurs at depths of 8 to 10 cm rather than in the surface sediments in most profiles the reason for this finding may be that this form of pb is easily released from surface sediments into the overlying water resulting in a maximum value in the subsurface this fraction of pb presents the greatest environmental threat because it will migrate into the overlying water if more acidic conditions occur usero et al 1998 the concentration of f1 in coastal sediments su and sd was higher than that in the estuary tu and td and rl indicating that the pb in the coastal sediments was active and could easily cause pb pollution the pb in the sediments at the five sampling sites is mainly f2 the easily reducible fraction of pb which is consistent with the findings of a previous study reported by nemati et al 2011 the f2 concentration of pb in the coastal sediments su and sd is lower than that at the other sites and the corresponding f1 and f3 contents are relatively high the concentration of f3 in the coastal sediments su and sd is especially high and the concentration in the sd is higher than that in the su relevant studies have shown that toc plays an important role in the release of heavy metals in sediments seidemann 1991 barhoumi et al 2019 and the toc content table 1 at the sd site is the highest the reducing conditions in the subtidal zone td and sd are stronger than those in the intertidal zone tu and su all of which may contribute to the especially high content of f3 in the sd profile in addition the highest f3 and lowest f2 concentrations in the coastal sediments indicate that a large amount of pb is bound to organic matter and sulfides which is possibly due to the strong sulfate reduction in sulfate rich coastal sediments 3 3 depth profiles of dissolved pb and dgt labile pb fig 3 shows the depth profiles of dissolved pb and dgt labile pb the concentration of labile pb ranged from 0 30 Î¼g l 1 to 0 40 Î¼g l 1 0 30 Î¼g l 1 to 0 68 Î¼g l 1 0 30 Î¼g l 1 to 0 39 Î¼g l 1 0 04 Î¼g l 1 to 0 74 Î¼g l 1 and 0 13 Î¼g l 1 to 0 40 Î¼g l 1 at the rl tu td su and sd sampling sites respectively the concentration of dissolved pb ranged from 0 88 Î¼g l 1 to 4 5 Î¼g l 1 3 36 Î¼g l 1 to 8 43 Î¼g l 1 0 56 Î¼g l 1 to 12 33 Î¼g l 1 and 0 25 Î¼g l 1 to 2 82 Î¼g l 1 at the rl tu td and su sampling sites respectively the mean pb concentrations in the pore water below the swi at the five sampling sites are shown in fig 4 the concentration of dissolved pb is significantly higher than that of labile pb because cdgt is the average concentration between dgt and the sediment interface during the measurement period if the metal in the pore water is adsorbed and the soil particles are unable to replenish the metal the concentration of cdgt will be lower than the actual effective state concentration of the metal in the sediment davison and zhang 1994 additionally the dgt device measures the effective state concentration of the metal according to the reaction of free ions with the adsorbent in the adsorption film if a portion of the metal complex is not dissociated in the diffusion layer it cannot react with the adsorbent sun et al 2019 the effective state is defined here as the metal form that can be rapidly exchanged in solution and that can then diffuse and be absorbed by plants barber 1995 the hr peeper device measures the concentration of all dissolved pb in the pore water while the dgt probe can adsorb pb in only the active ionic state yin et al 2014 in general the free state ions of pb are adsorbed by dissolved organic matter dom and do not readily dissociate therefore the dgt probe cannot detect the fraction of dissolved pb complexed with dom zhang and davison 1995 the maximum values of dissolved pb and labile pb were both observed at the tu site and the second highest dissolved pb concentration was observed at the td site which indicates that the dissolved pb concentration in the estuary is much higher than that at the other sampling sites however the dgt labile pb value did not increase significantly in the estuary considering the sedimentary environment in the estuary the high dissolved pb concentration is probably due to the nearby sewage outlet which causes increased dom input consistent with hypoxia in the overlying water however most pb is complexed with dom resulting in little change in the value of dgt labile pb compared with the dissolved and dgt labile fe concentrations which increase with depth below the swi fig 5 the dissolved and dgt labile pb concentrations exhibit no clear trend with depth fig 3 this result indicates that pb is less sensitive to redox conditions than fe and other redox sensitive elements e g mn as and p ding et al 2016a ding et al 2012 pan et al 2017 pan et al 2019a pan et al 2019b the migration of pb is affected by fe and mn oxides for example pb is adsorbed or coprecipitated by fe or mn oxides under oxidation conditions do 2 mg l 1 and released by dissolution of fe or mn oxides under hypoxic conditions do 0 5 mg l 1 dong et al 2000 munger et al 2016 ibm spss statistics 24 for windows was used to perform a statistical analysis of the correlation a correlation of p 0 05 indicated that two parameters were significantly correlated table 2 shows the statistical correlations between pb and fe the correlations between pb and fe for the surface layer and the whole profile were calculated separately from the whole profile both the measured hr peeper and dgt results showed that the correlation between pb and fe is not high dissolved pb and dissolved fe even exhibited relatively strong negative correlations at both tu and td fig 3 shows that the pb concentrations of the overlying water are high at both tu and td and the vertical distribution showed obviously high pb concentrations in the upper layer and low pb concentrations in the lower layer this pattern may have been caused by the downward diffusion of pb from the overlying water which is contrary to the vertical distribution of fe which increased in concentration with depth resulting in a negative correlation between pb and fe high concentrations in the overlying water also occurred at rl 1 21 Î¼g l 1 and su 1 25 Î¼g l 1 although an obvious pattern of high concentrations in the upper layer and low concentrations in the lower layer was not observed this result may be related to the hydrodynamic conditions which are strong in the estuary thereby promoting the downward diffusion of pb from the overlying water as the depth of the redox conversion layer differs at each station the depth of the surface layer also differed as shown in table 2 except for su the correlation between pb and fe in the surface layer was weak at the other stations this result occurred because pb migration is affected not only by fe oxide dissolution but also by other factors in sediments such as the redox potential eh do value and dom complex olaniran et al 2013 the pb and fe in the surface layer of su sites were highly correlated regardless of the dissolved pb and fe or dgt labile pb and fe indicating that the pb migration in the coastal intertidal zone was significantly affected by fe reduction at su both the dissolved pb and labile pb concentrations significantly increased abruptly at a depth of 6 75 cm which may be related to the remineralization of organic matter in fig 5 dissolved fe also increased at a depth of 6 75 cm although the labile fe concentration exhibited no significant change which was possibly because fe reduction promotes the remineralization of organic matter which releases pb and allows fe to bond with dom 3 4 molecular diffusion flux of pb across the swi based on the characteristics of sediments and dissolved pb concentration in sediment and overlying water a numerical model is applied to calculate the apparent pb fluxes at the swi the equation is as follows ding et al 2015 gao et al 2018 9 j j w j s d w c porewater x w x 0 Ï d s c porewater x s x 0 where j represents the apparent flux of pb across the swi j w and j s represent the molecular diffusive flux of unstable pb from the overlying water across the swi and from sediment across the swi respectively c porewater x w and c porewater x s are the concentration gradients of dissolved pb in a range of 2 cm above the swi and 2 cm below the swi respectively which are obtained by fitting a curve Ï represents the sediment porosity and d w and d s represent the molecular diffusion coefficient of pb in the overlying water and sediments respectively at a certain temperature according to li 1974 if Ï 0 7 d s is equal to Ï 2 d w to compare the apparent flux of pb across the swi at the three different sites lower reach estuary and coast we combined the apparent flux of pb at tu and td to obtain a mean value to represent the level in the estuary and combined the su and sd data to represent the coast a positive apparent flux means pb migrates from the sediment to the overlying water and a negative apparent flux means pb migrates from the overlying water to the sediment fig 6 shows the average apparent flux of pb across the swi in the lower reaches estuary and adjacent coast of the jiuxi river the pb flux is negative at all sites indicating that pb tends to migrate from the overlying water to the sediments and this result is consistent with the observed vertical distribution pattern fig 3 the absolute value of pb flux at the estuary is several times higher than that at the other sites indicating that the pb diffusion downward from the overlying water is intense in the estuary as mentioned in section 3 3 above this result may be due to the hydrodynamic influence 3 5 pb release revealed by the difs model fe is a redox sensitive element and dissolved fe exhibits an obvious vertical distribution fig 5 according to the vertical distribution of fe the depth profile of sediments is divided into three layers from top to bottom namely the oxidizing layer transition layer and reducing layer table 3 lists the input parameters and output parameters of the difs model for all three layers at four of the sampling sites the equilibrium distribution coefficient of the solid phase and solution kd can represent the potential of sediment to release pb with the highest value in the transition layer at su 5679 89 cm3 g 1 and the lowest value in the transition layer at tu 156 10 cm3 g 1 the sediment porosity Ï represents the size of the pore space between sediment particles and ranged from 0 46 to 0 74 at the sampling sites tc ranged from 1 13 103 s to 1 00 107 s at all sampling sites with the lowest value observed in the reducing layer at su and the highest values observed in the oxidizing layer transition layer and reducing layer at tu the k 1 value ranged from 2 58 10 7 s 1 in the oxidizing layer at rl to 1 31 10 10 s 1 in the reducing layer at tu the r value is the ratio of cdgt pb to the total pb concentration dissolved pb in the pore water and can be used to describe the ability of sediment particles to resupply pb after pore water pb is transferred or consumed according to the r value the ability of sediment particles to resupply pb can be divided into three types complete persistence r 0 90 partial persistence 0 10 r 0 90 and single diffusion r 0 10 http www dgtresearch com at the sampling sites the r value ranged from 0 06 to 0 49 rl td and su belong to the partial persistence type while tu belongs to the single diffusion type r tc and k 1 all exhibit certain regular changes at tu td and su all sites except rl from the oxidizing layer to the reducing layer the r values gradually increased and at td and su tc gradually decreased and k 1 gradually increased these patterns indicate that the rate of pb release increases gradually from the oxidizing layer to the transition layer and then the reducing layer and the rate at which sediments release pb into pore water increases with increasing depth however there are no significant differences in r values among the three layers at rl which is related to lack of significant differences in the vertical distribution of dissolved pb in rl fig 3 therefore the ability of sediments to replenish pb does not change significantly in the vertical profile of rl the r values at tu are too low which may be due to the influence of pb complexation with dom as mentioned in section 3 3 which leads to a dissolved pb value that is significantly higher than the labile pb value resulting in extremely small r values the high toc values at tu table 1 can be used as evidence the r values were less than 0 90 and greater than 0 10 at all sampling sites except tu indicating that these sites could be grouped into the partial persistence type these results indicate that the concentration of available pb added by sediment particles is not enough to sustain cdgt pb at the initial concentration the r value of tu is less than 0 10 indicating that this site may belong to the single diffusion type in other words sediment particles cannot supply pb to the pore water and the pb in the dgt interface can be supplied by only diffusion from the high concentration zone fig 7 shows the time dependent curve of the r value at four sampling sites rl tu td and su reflecting the variation in the r value with increasing duration of the deployment of the dgt device at the early stage of dgt device deployment the r value rapidly increases and reaches the maximum value over a period of approximately 1 h in this process the dgt labile pb in pore water enters the diffusion gel layer and forms a concentration gradient therefore the r value increases linearly ernstberger et al 2005 menezes blackburn et al 2016 after the peak point the curve of the r value transforms into one of three different forms the first form includes the oxidizing layer transition layer and reducing layer at tu and the oxidizing layer at td in which the r values continuously decrease rapidly with time after the peak although the rate of decline slowed and the curve tended to be smoother after 5 h the curve did not reach equilibrium for a long time 24 h this result occurred because the pb concentration around the interface of the dgt device decreased after effective pb was adsorbed from pore water the migration rate of pb from the solid phase to the liquid phase was very slow and a steady state could not be maintained due to the insufficient desorption rate the second form includes the transition layer and reducing layer at td and the oxidizing layer at su as in the first form after reaching the highest point the r value decreases however the r values of these three layers are higher than those in the first form and the desorption rate of sediments is faster thus the potential for releasing pb from the sediments kd is also high these factors cause r to reach equilibrium after 6 h the third form includes the oxidizing layer transition layer and reducing layer at rl and the transition layer and reducing layer at su which exhibit small changes after the peak and rapidly stabilize with no significant change over time this finding indicates that the continuous replenishment rate in the solid phase is rapid and remains stable overall the r value curves show that during the initial period before 30 min the order of the r value is tu su td rl which depends on the porosity Ï as shown in table 3 that is the greater the porosity is the higher the r value after a long period following attainment of the peak value the order of the r value is su rl td tu which depends on the rate of solid phase resupply of pb in the sediments ernstberger et al 2005 xu et al 2019 4 conclusions in this study the risks and mechanisms of pb release in the jiuxi river were explored by dgt technology and hr peeper sampling technology in combination with difs model analysis the pb in the sediments at the five sampling sites is mainly reducible f2 the f1 content in the coastal sediments is high indicating that the pb in the surface sediments has a high risk of release the highest f3 at the sd sampling site may be due to the strong reducing environment and high toc content at this site the dissolved pb concentration in the estuary is much higher than that in the other regions due to the nearby sewage outlets inputting pb bound to dom compared with fe pb is not a redox sensitive element the high concentration and downward diffusion of the overlying water may be an important reason for the vertical distribution of pb resulting in high concentrations in the upper layer and low concentrations in the lower layer this finding is contrary to the vertical distribution trend of fe which increases with increasing depth the apparent pb flux is negative in the lower reaches estuary and coastal zone because of the high concentrations in the overlying water the occurrence of the highest absolute pb flux value in the estuary may be due to the strong hydrodynamic forces in the estuary which promote the downward migration of pb the r values of td and su both show a relatively obvious increase from the oxidizing layer to the reducing layer long after r reaches the peak value the order of r is su rl td tu which represents the capacity of the sediments to resupply pb to the pore water the reducing layer of su has the highest r value indicating that the coast has the highest risk of pb release in general the results of the swi flux and difs analysis indicate that more attention should be paid to the potential of pb release in coastal sediments in this study a research example involving the application of the difs model is provided and a new method of evaluating the resupply ability of trace metals is proposed in future works more consideration should be given to the effect of organic matter adsorption on pb declaration of competing interest the authors declare

1466,fluids exhibiting non newtonian rheologies are used in a range of applications including hydraulic fracturing enhanced oil recovery remediation and industrial processes hydraulic fracturing in particular has received attention from environmental scientists policy makers and the general public due in part to concerns about the possibility of contamination of groundwater resources by the complex and potentially harmful fluids used in the process the non newtonian nature of many hydraulic fracturing fluids complicates the prediction of their movement and precludes use of most traditional flow and transport models to improve understanding of the flow of such fluids in porous media a series of column experiments was conducted and a pore scale lattice boltzmann model lbm was developed verified and used to simulate analogous systems flow experiments were conducted with guar gum solutions of varying concentration and three porous media systems the lbm was developed for transient three dimensional porous medium systems and included a shear rate dependent dynamic viscosity based on the cross rheological model the lbm was verified using a semi analytical solution for cross model fluid flow openfoam simulations and grid resolution inter comparisons between two different solution approaches simulations were performed on synthetic porous medium systems produced with a sphere packing algorithm to approximate the properties of the experimental systems the simulations were in good agreement with the experimental results particularly for systems that exhibited the greatest non newtonian character the modeling approach developed in this work provides a valuable tool for investigating relationships between pore scale fluid flow and macroscale variables of

rate which is efficient for determining the viscosity at a point for non newtonian fluids ginzburg and steiner 2002 as with other pore scale modeling approaches lbm provides information about the microscale fluid velocity field which can be used to investigate both the microscale flow patterns and approaches for upscaling the fluid viscosity and velocity while non newtonian lbms have been developed no published studies have employed lbm for cross model fluids nor have any been used to simulate complex 3d porous medium systems additionally validation of previously published methods is minimal typically involving the use of analytical solutions in simple geometries or comparison with alternate cfd approaches direct experimental validation has not been performed for any published

with sodium azide 0 1 wt to prevent biodegradation in an electric blender and blending until the guar gum was fully dispersed the mixture was then transferred to a sealed container and stirred with a

sealed containers in the dark at 4 c and used within 7d the actual concentrations of the solutions after centrifuging and filtering were determined gravimetrically by evaporating an accurately weighed mass of the solution at 105 c 2 2 2 rheometry rheological measurements of the guar gum solutions were collected using a ta instruments ar g2 rotational rheometer with a cone and plate configuration the cone was 1 and 40 mm in diameter and the plate was equipped with an integrated peltier temperature control unit a one minute pre shear was performed at a constant shear rate of 1 s 1 all samples were measured at a constant temperature of 22 c measurements of shear rate and apparent viscosity were performed in torque controlled mode with a torque range of approximately 0 05 to 500 Î¼n m depending on the sample two sets of measurements where made for each solution the first set of measurements was conducted within 48 h of the solutions being made for this set three measurements were taken per each logarithmic decade of torque a second set of measurements was taken five days after the solutions were made and the number of sampling points was increased to five measurements per decade of torque at each torque the resulting strain was measured by the instrument every five seconds for a minimum of one minute the first 20 s of data were always ignored to allow the instrument to reach a steady state the remaining values were averaged and the relative standard deviation was typically 1 or less with none over 3 the cross model eq 3 was fit to the apparent viscosity and shear rate values output by the rheometer in datagraph software 2 2 3 column experiments column experiments were conducted in a vertically oriented glass column ace glass with a 2 5 cm inner diameter the column was packed by first inserting a ptfe plunger with a viton o ring seal and a steel mesh filter into the bottom of the column for the accusand columns dry sand was poured into the column while the sand bead mixture was first moistened with water to prevent separation and layering during the packing process an air vibrator was used to compact the sand and a second plunger was inserted until firmly touching the sand the columns were vibrated and the plunger was compressed a minimum of five times to ensure the media was compacted influent and effluent lines consisted of minimum lengths of 2 mm inner diameter ptfe tubing connected directly to the plungers the column and tubing was secured to a metal framework to prevent movement during the course of the experiments once fully compacted co2 was pumped upwards through the column for 30 min at a rate of 50 cm3 min to displace the air in the system next a minimum of seven pore volumes of di water was pumped upwards at a rate of 10 cm3

pure water each flow rate was conducted in triplicate the permeability was determined by fitting the pressure form of darcy s law to the data column properties are provided in table 1 column flow experiments were conducted by injecting guar gum solution upward through the column at various flow rates using a programmable syringe pump harvard apparatus phd4400 prior to collecting measurements a minimum of four pore volumes of guar gum solution were injected through the column at a constant flow rate the pressure drop across the column was monitored with a pressure transducer omega px800 during this process to ensure that a steady pressure drop was obtained experiments were conducted in order of increasing guar gum concentration to prevent viscous fingering each flow rate was maintained until a stable pressure drop reading was attained with a minimum time of 60 s measurements were recorded as an average of a minimum of 40 instantaneous pressure readings 40 s after the attainment of a stable pressure the range of flow rates was selected for each solution such that the resultant pressure drops ranged from 0 to 7 104 pa which represented the measurement range of the pressure transducer triplicate measurements were collected for each flow rate with alternate runs conducted in order of increasing and decreasing flow rates to identify any dynamic effects experiments

steiner 2002 ginzburg and steiner 2003 three dimensional synthetic representations of the experimental porous media were generated using a sphere packing algorithm dye et al 2013 the algorithm builds packings of non overlapping spheres based on a given porosity and a log normal size distribution for the sphere radii to match the morphological properties of the real media the arithmetic mean and variances of each media were converted to log normal mean and variance for the algorithm due to constraints of the sphere packing algorithm the simulated systems do not exactly match the porous media used in the laboratory experiments fig 8 each simulated system was large enough to be considered a representative elementary volume rev the simulations were performed by setting constant velocity boundary conditions equal to the experimental darcy velocity on opposite faces of the system with a small reservoir between the faces and the media and with periodic boundaries on all other sides of the system fig 2 shows an example of how these boundary conditions were implemented the velocity boundary conditions were initialized and the simulation was allowed to reach steady state steady state was defined when the change in average velocity of the fluid v w between time steps was less than 10 8 after steady state was reached the average pressure was calculated at each end of the system for comparison to experimental results once results were collected for di water flowing through the synthetic media an intrinsic permeability for that synthetic medium was calculated from darcy s law below 19 q Îº Î¼ p where p is the macroscale pressure gradient which was estimated as the difference in the average pressure on each side of the system divided by the macroscale length Î´p l for a one

model an openfoam model was run using the same set of synthetic media openfoam is a commonly used open source modeling toolkit which has pre built functions for simulating the laminar flow of non newtonian fluids nonnewtonianicofoam greenshields 2018 a castellated mesh was generated using the snappyhexmesh utility an entry velocity boundary condition was established with an exit pressure boundary condition and the system was allowed to run until a steady state was achieved other boundary conditions were similar to those used for the lbm as illustrated in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental the fitted values for each cross model parameter are shown in table 2 as would be expected zero shear viscosities increase with guar gum concentration with a range of roughly three orders of magnitude for the solutions used in this study the infinite shear viscosities for all concentrations were within a factor of two indicating that the solutions converge toward similar viscosities at high flow rates the value of k increased monotonically with concentration ranging over roughly two orders of magnitude the values of the exponential parameter n were very similar for 2 5 g kg solutions ranging from 0 679 0 707 the lowest gum concentrations 0 5 1 g kg showed increasing n values 0 817 and 0 754 respectively indicative of a shift toward newtonian behavior the fits for these latter solutions also showed relatively little sensitivity to n due to the low values of k columns were first injected with di water over a range of flow rates to determine the intrinsic permeability of each column the results of these experiments are shown in fig 3 the di water results for all columns exhibited a non linear pressure velocity curve indicative of non darcy behavior and therefore the data was fit to the darcy forchheimer equation given by 23 Î´ p l Î¼ w Îº q Ï w Îº 1 q 2 where Îº 1 is the inertial permeability Î¼ w is the dynamic viscosity of water and Ï w is the density of water the fitted values for Îº and Îº 1 are provided in table 3 the intrinsic permeabilities of the 20 30 as and the sand bead mixture were similar while the permeability of the 40 50 as was less than half of these other values the inertial permeability was considerably lower for the sand bead mixture than either of the accusands which is consistent with previous studies that have indicated that higher grain size variances result in more pronounced inertial effects dye et al 2013 for the experiments performed using guar gum the 3 and 5 g kg solutions exhibited distinctly non linear concave downward pressure velocity relationships this behavior was not apparent for the 0 5 g kg solution and in fact a slight upward concavity indicative of non darcy behavior was observed especially for the sand bead mixture as would be expected pressure drops were consistently higher for the lower permeability 40 50 accusand and increased with guar gum concentration generally similar results were observed for the 20 30 accusand and sand bead mixture columns a somewhat surprising finding given the much greater grain size variance of the mixture 3 2 pore scale modeling the lbm was first validated against a semi analytical solution for cross model fluid flow through parallel stationary plates sochi 2015 the results of this validation show strong agreement between the lbm and the semi analytical model indicating that the lbm accurately captures cross model fluid behavior for a simple geometry fig 4 the lbm was further validated against openfoam by simulating a 2 g kg guar gum flowing through a synthetic 20 30 accusand media at the same flow rates that were conducted during the column experiments the results of these simulations were also in strong agreement fig 5 a computational analysis was conducted to compare the lbm developed here to an openfoam simulator as well as to determine when a realistic non newtonian porous medium system achieves grid independence goals of this computational comparison include establishing the grid refinement needed to reduce discretization errors for both methods and to comment on the differences in applying each of these numerical methods a fluid with the same properties as the 5 g kg guar gum was simulated flowing through a randomly packed set of spheres that matched the size distribution of the 20 30 accusand the number of cells in the case of openfoam modeling and lattice sites in the lbm case were gradually increased and the amount of time required for the simulation was measured openfoam simulations were carried out using the simplefoam steady state algorithm and the geometric algebraic multigrid gamg solver convergence criteria were set such that a residual of 10 8 was achieved for velocity and pressure during the gamg solver step relaxation factors for the underrelaxation of the picard nonlinear solver were set for velocity 0 9 and pressure 0 7 the relaxation factors were selected by running a set of simulations with a coarse grid search between 0 1 and 1 for a 2503 case and selecting those parameters that produced the fastest convergence the mesh generated for the lbm was converted to an openfoam mesh and stl file so that both methods were used to simulate exactly the same solid phase geometry as the meshes used for each method were refined the solid phase refinement remained the same with the void space being refined the snappyhexmesh utility was used to generate meshes with greater refinement levels near the solid phase each level of refinement corresponded to the refinement of any cell in contact with the solid phase into 8 cells with subsequent refinement of those cells as the refinement level was increased level 0 l0 1 l1 and 2 l2 meshes were generated simulations were run in parallel such that approximately 2503 cells of the background mesh were assigned to each processor in the lbm and openfoam cpu time was calculated by multiplying the amount of time required for the full simulation by the number of processor cores used simulations for the computational comparison were conducted on the dogwood supercomputer at the university of north carolina at chapel hill openfoam meshes were generated for 1253 l1 and l2 2503 l0 l1 and l2 5003 l0 and l1 and 10003 l0 base refinements and lbm meshes were generated for 2503 5003 10003 and 20003 refinements with no level refinement the results from these refinements were used to carry out a richardson s extrapolation to determine what the convergent pressure drop p through the system would be pan et al 2001 this pressure drop was used to calculate a relative error for each refinement using 24 relative error p m p p where p m is the pressure drop for refinement m there was a difference of 2 5 between the extrapolated pressure drop calculated for openfoam and the lbm which may be due to an inaccuracy in the representation of the solid geometry which has been observed when using mrt with standard bounce back conditions as was done here pan et al 2006 the final results for the computational comparison between lbm and openfoam are shown in fig 6 the cpu time required for openfoam to achieve a similar relative error to the lbm is shorter at lower refinements but longer for larger refinements additionally the relative error for the lbm decreased faster than openfoam with refinement the l2 mesh simulations for openfoam achieved a similar rate of convergence as the lbm with increased refinement one difference between the solvers which may explain why openfoam is faster than lbm for less refined systems is that the simplefoam utility is a steady state solver while the lbm simulates a transient system until steady state is achieved simulations with a transient openfoam solver were significantly less efficient than those reported based upon the steady state simulation the relative error based on the richardson extrapolated result did not fall below 10 for the lbm until the refinement was raised to 10003 where the relative error was under 5 this was selected as the discretization at which grid effects are not significant the openfoam results did not reach an error of 10 relative to the richardson extrapolation of their results the purpose of this comparison was to determine how the lbm compared to a typical non newtonian simulator it was found that for less refined systems openfoam is a more efficient method than lbm but that lbm is more efficient for larger more refined systems the largest simulations performed in this work were with a grid of 20003 with the lbm which is considered a state of the science simulation combined with other drawbacks of openfoam including the inability to use cyclic boundary conditions for parallel systems and difficulties with meshing large systems this finding suggests that openfoam is not currently ideal for simulation of rev sized systems of non newtonian fluid flows the lbm did not suffer from the above mentioned shortcomings and demonstrated near ideal parallel efficiency the results of the lbm simulations are compared to the experimental results in fig 7 due to differences in the system dimensions and scales and slight difference between the real and synthetic media e g spherical versus slightly angular grains the results were converted to reynolds number and piezometric head per length this allows for a dimensionless comparison between two systems which are analogous but not the identical bear 1972 the calculated intrinsic permeabilities of the synthetic packed media as well as the log normal mean and standard deviations used for packing each of the synthetic media are listed below in table 4 log normal statistical properties were calculated using the arithmetic means and variances listed for the real media in table 1 porosities for the random sphere packing were near the lower limit for random stochastic packings of 0 36 which differed from the experimental porosities by a relatively significant amount it has been found in the past that slight differences in porosity of sand can lead to significant differences in flow characteristics and permeabilities schroth et al 1996 the lbm results were generally in good agreement with the experimental results especially as the concentration of guar gum increased the reason for discrepancies between modeling and experimental results at low concentration is likely due to inertial effects which were more pronounced for the non spherical lower porosity real sand than for the spherical synthetic media the difference between the media can be clearly seen from imaging the two media shown in fig 8 as the concentration of guar gum increased the viscous forces became more significant compared to inertial effects and the difference in media properties became less significant in the development of flow paths it is useful to note that most hydraulic fracturing operations that use guar gum as a viscosity modifying agent use concentrations in excess of 2 g kg barati and liang 2014 norman et al 1996 free 1976 robert and pin 1993 lester et al 2014 u s epa 2015b li et al 2016 thus such models are most accurate when applied to conditions that are closer to field conditions differences between experimental results and simulations at lower pressures are likely due to conditions approaching the detectability limit of the instruments used the greatest error was observed for the high variance sand bead mixture which may be due to the packing method used for this medium the moist packing approach while minimizing layering allowed less compaction of the medium and potentially mobilization of the fine grained sands i e 80 mesh resulting in additional differences between the experimental and modeled systems the lbm and experimental results also differed in terms of non darcy effects inertial effects were not observed in the lbm until re 10 consistent with the literature and well above the range of the experiments however non darcy flow was consistently and repeatably observed for the di and 0 5 g kg runs for all media in the experiments the reason for the lower re onset of transition effects in the experimental media is not clear the angularity and asphericity of the sands likely contribute but would not be expected to alone reduce the onset to re 1 one possibility is that imperfect compaction of the media allowed additional flow driven compaction to occur at high velocities while not visibly observed during the experiments this mechanism better explains the reversible nature of the resistance increases than other explanations such as clogging or mobilization of fine grained sands to assess the adequacy of existing porous medium shear rate models eq 4 was first substituted into the cross model eq 3 to provide a relationship for the apparent viscosity given by 25 Î¼ app Î¼ 0 Î¼ 1 k Î± q ÎºÏ n Î¼ the Î± parameter was fit to the lbm data using nonlinear least squares curve fitting for each individual concentration of guar gum fits for the three porous media are shown in fig 9 for four different concentrations of guar gum 0 5 1 3 and 5 g kg the model was not able to fit the 0 5 g kg guar gum data and while it fits the 1 g kg guar gum simulation data for 40 50 accusand the fit is not as good for the other systems there are multiple possible reasons for the poor fitting with low concentrations of guar gum first small difference between the values of Î¼ and Î¼ 0 may lead to a large degree of sensitivity to error in these parameters another potential reason is that as the concentration decreases the viscosity will have a significantly smaller functional dependence on shear rate and thus on flow rate as well this explanation would suggest that the original shear rate model i e eq 4 is not appropriate for systems which exhibit only slight non newtonian behavior generally Î± was found to be a decreasing function of guar gum concentration it is likely that this relationship between Î± and concentration is inversely a function of Î¼ 0 Î¼ and k which all increase with guar gum concentration however it is most likely that k has the greatest effect as it determines the impact of shear rate on viscosity the parameters are also a function of the medium however clear relationships to medium properties such as permeability porosity or grain size distribution are not apparent from the limited suite of media used in this work while researchers have developed equations to relate Î± to fluid and medium properties primarily based on analytical solutions for power law flow through capillary tubes sabiri and comiti 1995 chhabra et al 2001 a more general theoretical model has yet to be developed pearson and tardy 2002 sochi 2010 future work will further investigate these relationships both theoretically and by simulating a wide range of media properties with the developed lbm to test the ability of modeled results to be applied directly to real systems the apparent viscosities for the experimental system were calculated with eq 25 using the Î± values fit to the lbm data this approach resulted in reasonable matches for many of the data especially 3 g kg but failed to capture the significant non darcy behavior at high flow rates and low guar gum concentrations because non darcy effects were observed in the experiments and would be expected at high flow rates in the field e g in the vicinity of injection extraction wells a modified version of eq 25 was employed that takes into account non darcy flow through an inertial term on the right hand side tosco et al 2013 26 Î¼ app Î¼ 0 Î¼ 1 k Î± q ÎºÏ n Î¼ ÏÎº q Îº 1 calculations with this equation matched the 0 5 g kg guar gum experimental data remarkably well and reasonably predicted the 3 g kg experiments fig 10 there was however significant deviation for the 5 g kg experiments with the 20 30 accusand and sand bead mixture columns likely due to the differences between the real and model systems notably these calculations were produced with Î± values fit to lbm results since these shift factors are functions of both the fluid and the medium the fact that the experimental and virtual systems differ would also suggest that differences in the Î± values would be expected due to the differences between the synthetic and experimental media 4 conclusions the modeling of the flow of fracking fluids and polymer enhanced remediation fluids in the subsurface is complicated by the non newtonian character of the fluids used in these applications most current simulators for these systems ignore non newtonian behavior or require empirically determining a value of Î± in eq 4 the former case fails to account for significant flow dependent variation in viscosity of non newtonian fluids within a system thereby introducing major error into simulations the latter approach requires conducting experiments with the specific fluid and medium of interest due a dependence on both of these factors and the current lack of a generalized relationship for Î± the lbm developed here was found to accurately capture the complex behavior of non newtonian fluid flow in porous media validated through experiments and alternate numerical approaches and can be used to directly determine these shift factors without experiments furthermore the lbm allows for investigation of the relationships between fluid and media properties and Î± and ultimately to develop more generalized forms for the apparent shear rate in porous media a major advantage of the lbm approach is that it allows direct observation of local velocity and viscosity distributions the lbm can be applied to any three dimensional medium including both virtually created systems with arbitrary properties and geometries and real systems that have been imaged with x ray micro computed tomography Î¼ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri additionally the lbm developed here was found to be better suited than existing software openfoam for simulating non newtonian fluid flow in rev scale systems these advantages make the lbm a versatile and valuable tool for further investigation of non newtonian flow through porous and fractured media and especially in probing relationships between the microscale and macroscale physics at play in these systems better understanding the fundamental physics involved will greatly improve our ability to predict flow and transport of contaminants exhibiting non newtonian behavior and to design more effective in situ remediation methods that utilize non newtonian fluids although further study is required to allow direct application to hydraulic fracturing operations including validation for fractured systems and assessment of the impact of fracture geometry the results of this work and the features discussed above suggest that this lbm provides a capable tool for such study this lbm can additionally be extended to apply to other kinds of non newtonian fluids and applied to other systems where non newtonian fluids are encountered such as handling of hydraulic fracturing waste waters polymer flooding for enhanced oil

1466,fluids exhibiting non newtonian rheologies are used in a range of applications including hydraulic fracturing enhanced oil recovery remediation and industrial processes hydraulic fracturing in particular has received attention from environmental scientists policy makers and the general public due in part to concerns about the possibility of contamination of groundwater resources by the complex and potentially harmful fluids used in the process the non newtonian nature of many hydraulic fracturing fluids complicates the prediction of their movement and precludes use of most traditional flow and transport models to improve understanding of the flow of such fluids in porous media a series of column experiments was conducted and a pore scale lattice boltzmann model lbm was developed verified and used to simulate analogous systems flow experiments were conducted with guar gum solutions of varying concentration and three porous media systems the lbm was developed for transient three dimensional porous medium systems and included a shear rate dependent dynamic viscosity based on the cross rheological model the lbm was verified using a semi analytical solution for cross model fluid flow openfoam simulations and grid resolution inter comparisons between two different solution approaches simulations were performed on synthetic porous medium systems produced with a sphere packing algorithm to approximate the properties of the experimental systems the simulations were in good agreement with the experimental results particularly for systems that exhibited the greatest non newtonian character the modeling approach developed in this work provides a valuable tool for investigating relationships between pore scale fluid flow and macroscale variables of

parallel computing is required yang et al 2015 for possible future applications such as modeling multiphase or turbulent systems that exhibit non newtonian character investigation into the capabilities of currently available software and alternatives is warranted an alternative pore scale simulation approach is the lattice boltzmann method lbm various lbm schemes have been developed and employed for a range of applications over the past decades including for non newtonian flow chen et al 2014 yoshino et al 2007 sullivan et al 2006 kehrwald 2005 aharonov and rothman 1993 lbm has several advantages including computational efficiency compatibility with parallel architectures and ease of implementation of complex porous and fractured media lbm directly computes the local shear rate which is efficient for determining the viscosity at a point for non newtonian fluids ginzburg and steiner 2002 as with other pore scale modeling approaches lbm provides information about the microscale fluid velocity field which can be used to investigate both the microscale flow patterns and approaches for upscaling the fluid viscosity and velocity while non newtonian lbms have been developed no published studies have employed lbm for cross model fluids nor have any been used to simulate complex 3d porous medium systems additionally validation of previously published methods is minimal typically involving the use of analytical solutions in simple geometries or comparison with alternate cfd approaches direct experimental validation has not been performed for any published study the goal of this work is to develop an efficient pore scale simulator for the flow of non newtonian fluids in porous media specific objectives include 1 developing a 3d lbm to model the flow of cross model and other non newtonian fluids at the pore scale 2 assessing the computational efficiency of the lbm 3 investigating the rev for non newtonian flow in porous media and 4 validating the lbm against a thorough suite of experiments using multiple fluids media and flow rates the developed method will accurately simulate the flow of fluids relevant to hydraulic fracturing environmental

guar gum grade s 4500 g was obtained from synthetic natural polymers inc durham nc columns were packed with three media 20 30 accusand 40 50 accusand and a mixture composed of two sizes of glass beads 2 mm and 3 mm diameter fisher and 12 sieved sand fractions 16 80 mesh accusand and u s silica 2 2 methods 2 2 1 guar gum solutions guar gum solutions were produced by combining guar gum and di along with sodium azide 0 1 wt to prevent biodegradation in an electric blender and blending until the guar gum was fully dispersed the mixture was then transferred to a sealed container and stirred with a magnetic stir bar for 48 h the solutions were centrifuged for 1 h at 2000 g and vacuum filtered through a 2 5 Î¼m glass fiber filter baxter scientific after filtering the solutions were stored in sealed containers in the dark at 4 c and used within 7d the actual concentrations of the solutions after centrifuging and filtering were determined gravimetrically by evaporating an accurately weighed mass of the solution at 105 c 2 2 2 rheometry rheological measurements of the guar gum solutions were collected using a ta instruments ar g2 rotational rheometer with a cone and plate configuration the cone was 1 and 40 mm in diameter and the plate was equipped with an integrated peltier temperature control unit a one minute pre shear was performed at a constant shear rate of 1 s 1 all samples were measured at a constant temperature of 22 c measurements of shear rate and apparent viscosity were performed in torque controlled mode with a torque range of approximately 0 05 to 500 Î¼n m depending on the sample two sets of measurements where made for each solution the first set of measurements was conducted within 48 h of the solutions being made for this set three measurements were taken per each logarithmic decade of torque a second set of measurements was taken five days after the solutions were made and the number of sampling points was increased to five measurements per decade of torque at each torque the resulting strain was measured by the instrument every five seconds for a minimum of one minute the first 20 s of data were always ignored to allow the instrument to reach a steady state the remaining values were averaged and the relative standard deviation was typically 1 or less with none over 3 the cross model eq 3 was fit to the apparent viscosity and shear rate values output by the rheometer in datagraph software 2 2 3 column experiments column experiments were conducted in a vertically oriented glass column ace glass with a 2 5 cm inner diameter the column was packed by first inserting a ptfe plunger with a viton o ring seal and a steel mesh filter into the bottom of the column for the accusand columns dry sand was poured into the column while the sand bead mixture was first moistened with water to prevent separation and layering during the packing process an air vibrator was used to compact the sand and a second plunger was inserted until firmly touching the sand the columns were vibrated and the plunger was compressed a minimum of five times to ensure the media was compacted influent and effluent lines consisted of minimum lengths of 2 mm inner diameter ptfe tubing connected directly to the plungers the column and tubing was secured to a metal framework to prevent movement during the course of the experiments once fully compacted co2 was pumped upwards through the column for 30 min at a rate of 50 cm3 min to displace the air in the system next a minimum of seven pore volumes of di water was pumped upwards at a rate of 10 cm3 hr to displace and dissolve the co2 the porosity Ï was estimated by weighing the sand added to the column and measuring the packed length to allow calculation of the bulk density Ï b porosity was then calculated assuming a particle density Ï p of 2 65 g cm3 using the following equation 5 Ï 1 Ï b Ï p the permeability was determined by conducting flow experiments at varying flow rates with pure water each flow rate was conducted in triplicate the permeability was determined by fitting the pressure form of darcy s law to the data column properties are provided in table 1 column flow experiments were conducted by injecting guar gum solution upward through the column at various flow rates using a programmable syringe pump harvard apparatus phd4400 prior to collecting measurements a minimum of four pore volumes of guar gum solution were injected through the column at a constant flow rate the pressure drop across the column was monitored with a pressure transducer omega px800 during this process to ensure that a steady pressure drop was obtained experiments were conducted in order of increasing guar gum concentration to prevent viscous fingering each flow rate was maintained until a stable pressure drop reading was attained with a minimum time of 60 s measurements were recorded as an average of a minimum of 40 instantaneous pressure readings 40 s after the attainment of a stable pressure the range of flow rates was selected for each solution such that the resultant pressure drops ranged from 0 to 7 104 pa which represented the measurement range of the pressure transducer triplicate measurements were collected for each flow rate with alternate runs conducted in order of increasing and decreasing flow rates to identify any dynamic effects experiments

steiner 2002 ginzburg and steiner 2003 three dimensional synthetic representations of the experimental porous media were generated using a sphere packing algorithm dye et al 2013 the algorithm builds packings of non overlapping spheres based on a given porosity and a log normal size distribution for the sphere radii to match the morphological properties of the real media the arithmetic mean and variances of each media were converted to log normal mean and variance for the algorithm due to constraints of the sphere packing algorithm the simulated systems do not exactly match the porous media used in the laboratory experiments fig 8 each simulated system was large enough to be considered a representative elementary volume rev the simulations were performed by setting constant velocity boundary conditions equal to the experimental darcy velocity on opposite faces of the system with a small reservoir between the faces and the media and with periodic boundaries on all other sides of the system fig 2 shows an example of how these boundary conditions were implemented the velocity boundary conditions were initialized and the simulation was allowed to reach steady state steady state was defined when the change in average velocity of the fluid v w between time steps was less than 10 8 after steady state was reached the average pressure was calculated at each end of the system for comparison to experimental results once results were collected for di water flowing through the synthetic media an intrinsic permeability for that synthetic medium was calculated from darcy s law below 19 q Îº Î¼ p where p is the macroscale pressure gradient which was estimated as the difference in the average pressure on each side of the system divided by the macroscale length Î´p l for a one dimensional system with the intrinsic permeability of the synthetic media known the apparent viscosity that occurs during non newtonian flow through that media can also be calculated from darcy s law

model an openfoam model was run using the same set of synthetic media openfoam is a commonly used open source modeling toolkit which has pre built functions for simulating the laminar flow of non newtonian fluids nonnewtonianicofoam greenshields 2018 a castellated mesh was generated using the snappyhexmesh utility an entry velocity boundary condition was established with an exit pressure boundary condition and the system was allowed to run until a steady state was achieved other boundary conditions were similar to those used for the lbm as illustrated in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental the fitted values for each cross model parameter are shown in table 2 as would be expected zero shear viscosities increase with guar gum concentration with a range of roughly three orders of magnitude for the solutions used in this study the infinite shear viscosities for all concentrations were within a factor of two indicating that the solutions converge toward similar viscosities at high flow rates the value of k increased monotonically with concentration ranging over roughly two orders of magnitude the values of the exponential parameter n were very similar for 2 5 g kg solutions ranging from 0 679 0 707 the lowest gum concentrations 0 5 1 g kg showed increasing n values 0 817 and 0 754 respectively indicative of a shift toward newtonian behavior the fits for these latter solutions also showed relatively little sensitivity to n due to the low values of k columns were first injected with di water over a range of flow rates to determine the intrinsic permeability of each column the results of these experiments are shown in fig 3 the di water results for all columns exhibited a non linear pressure velocity curve indicative of non darcy behavior and therefore the data was fit to the darcy forchheimer equation given by 23 Î´ p l Î¼ w Îº q Ï w Îº 1 q 2 where Îº 1 is the inertial permeability Î¼ w is the dynamic viscosity of water and Ï w is the density of water the fitted values for Îº and Îº 1 are provided in table 3 the intrinsic permeabilities of the 20 30 as and the sand bead mixture were similar while the permeability of the 40 50 as was less than half of these other values the inertial permeability was considerably lower for the sand bead mixture than either of the accusands which is consistent with previous studies that have indicated that higher grain size variances result in more pronounced inertial effects dye et al 2013 for the experiments performed using guar gum the 3 and 5 g kg solutions exhibited distinctly non linear concave downward pressure velocity relationships this behavior was not apparent for the 0 5 g kg solution and in fact a slight upward concavity indicative of non darcy behavior was observed especially for the sand bead mixture as would be expected pressure drops were consistently higher for the lower permeability 40 50 accusand and increased with guar gum concentration generally similar results were observed for the 20 30 accusand and sand bead mixture columns a somewhat surprising finding given the much greater grain size variance of the mixture 3 2 pore scale modeling the lbm was first validated against a semi analytical solution for cross model fluid flow through parallel stationary plates sochi 2015 the results of this validation show strong agreement between the lbm and the semi analytical model indicating that the lbm accurately captures cross model fluid behavior for a simple geometry fig 4 the lbm was further validated against openfoam by simulating a 2 g kg guar gum flowing through a synthetic 20 30 accusand media at the same flow rates that were conducted during the column experiments the results of these simulations were also in strong agreement fig 5 a computational analysis was conducted to compare the lbm developed here to an openfoam simulator as well as to determine when a realistic non newtonian porous medium system achieves grid independence goals of this computational comparison include establishing the grid refinement needed to reduce discretization errors for both methods and to comment on the differences in applying each of these numerical methods a fluid with the same properties as the 5 g kg guar gum was simulated flowing through a randomly packed set of spheres that matched the size distribution of the 20 30 accusand the number of cells in the case of openfoam modeling and lattice sites in the lbm case were gradually increased and the amount of time required for the simulation was measured openfoam simulations were carried out using the simplefoam steady state algorithm and the geometric algebraic multigrid gamg solver convergence criteria were set such that a residual of 10 8 was achieved for velocity and pressure during the gamg solver step relaxation factors for the underrelaxation of the picard nonlinear solver were set for velocity 0 9 and pressure 0 7 the relaxation factors were selected by running a set of simulations with a coarse grid search between 0 1 and 1 for a 2503 case and selecting those parameters that produced the fastest convergence the mesh generated for the lbm was converted to an openfoam mesh and stl file so that both methods were used to simulate exactly the same solid phase geometry as the meshes used for each method were refined the solid phase refinement remained the same with the void space being refined the snappyhexmesh utility was used to generate meshes with greater refinement levels near the solid phase each level of refinement corresponded to the refinement of any cell in contact with the solid phase into 8 cells with subsequent refinement of those cells as the refinement level was increased level 0 l0 1 l1 and 2 l2 meshes were generated simulations were run in parallel such that approximately 2503 cells of the background mesh were assigned to each processor in the lbm and openfoam cpu time was calculated by multiplying the amount of time required for the full simulation by the number of processor cores used simulations for the computational comparison were conducted on the dogwood supercomputer at the university of north carolina at chapel hill openfoam meshes were generated for 1253 l1 and l2 2503 l0 l1 and l2 5003 l0 and l1 and 10003 l0 base refinements and lbm meshes were generated for 2503 5003 10003 and 20003 refinements with no level refinement the results from these refinements were used to carry out a richardson s extrapolation to determine what the convergent pressure drop p through the system would be pan et al 2001 this pressure drop was used to calculate a relative error for each refinement using 24 relative error p m p p where p m is the pressure drop for refinement m there was a difference of 2 5 between the extrapolated pressure drop calculated for openfoam and the lbm which may be due to an inaccuracy in the representation of the solid geometry which has been observed when using mrt with standard bounce back conditions as was done here pan et al 2006 the final results for the computational comparison between lbm and openfoam are shown in fig 6 the cpu time required for openfoam to achieve a similar relative error to the lbm is shorter at lower refinements but longer for larger refinements additionally the relative error for the lbm decreased faster than openfoam with refinement the l2 mesh simulations for openfoam achieved a similar rate of convergence as the lbm with increased refinement one difference between the solvers which may explain why openfoam is faster than lbm for less refined systems is that the simplefoam utility is a steady state solver while the lbm simulates a transient system until steady state is achieved simulations with a transient openfoam solver were significantly less efficient than those reported based upon the steady state simulation the relative error based on the richardson extrapolated result did not fall below 10 for the lbm until the refinement was raised to 10003 where the relative error was under 5 this was selected as the discretization at which grid effects are not significant the openfoam results did not reach an error of 10 relative to the richardson extrapolation of their results the purpose of this comparison was to determine how the lbm compared to a typical non newtonian simulator it was found that for less refined systems openfoam is a more efficient method than lbm but that lbm is more efficient for larger more refined systems the largest simulations performed in this work were with a grid of 20003 with the lbm which is considered a state of the science simulation combined with other drawbacks of openfoam including the inability to use cyclic boundary conditions for parallel systems and difficulties with meshing large systems this finding suggests that openfoam is not currently ideal for simulation of rev sized systems of non newtonian fluid flows the lbm did not suffer from the above mentioned shortcomings and demonstrated near ideal parallel efficiency the results of the lbm simulations are compared to the experimental results in fig 7 due to differences in the system dimensions and scales and slight difference between the real and synthetic media e g spherical versus slightly angular grains the results were converted to reynolds number and piezometric head per length this allows for a dimensionless comparison between two systems which are analogous but not the identical bear 1972 the calculated intrinsic permeabilities of the synthetic packed media as well as the log normal mean and standard deviations used for packing each of the synthetic media are listed below in table 4 log normal statistical properties were calculated using the arithmetic means and variances listed for the real media in table 1 porosities for the random sphere packing were near the lower limit for random stochastic packings of 0 36 which differed from the experimental porosities by a relatively significant amount it has been found in the past that slight differences in porosity of sand can lead to significant differences in flow characteristics and permeabilities schroth et al 1996 the lbm results were generally in good agreement with the experimental results especially as the concentration of guar gum increased the reason for discrepancies between modeling and experimental results at low concentration is likely due to inertial effects which were more pronounced for the non spherical lower porosity real sand than for the spherical synthetic media the difference between the media can be clearly seen from imaging the two media shown in fig 8 as the concentration of guar gum increased the viscous forces became more significant compared to inertial effects and the difference in media properties became less significant in the development of flow paths it is useful to note that most hydraulic fracturing operations that use guar gum as a viscosity modifying agent use concentrations in excess of 2 g kg barati and liang 2014 norman et al 1996 free 1976 robert and pin 1993 lester et al 2014 u s epa 2015b li et al 2016 thus such models are most accurate when applied to conditions that are closer to field conditions differences between experimental results and simulations at lower pressures are likely due to conditions approaching the detectability limit of the instruments used the greatest error was observed for the high variance sand bead mixture which may be due to the packing method used for this medium the moist packing approach while minimizing layering allowed less compaction of the medium and potentially mobilization of the fine grained sands i e 80 mesh resulting in additional differences between the experimental and modeled systems the lbm and experimental results also differed in terms of non darcy effects inertial effects were not observed in the lbm until re 10 consistent with the literature and well above the range of the experiments however non darcy flow was consistently and repeatably observed for the di and 0 5 g kg runs for all media in the experiments the reason for the lower re onset of transition effects in the experimental media is not clear the angularity and asphericity of the sands likely contribute but would not be expected to alone reduce the onset to re 1 one possibility is that imperfect compaction of the media allowed additional flow driven compaction to occur at high velocities while not visibly observed during the experiments this mechanism better explains the reversible nature of the resistance increases than other explanations such as clogging or mobilization of fine grained sands to assess the adequacy of existing porous medium shear rate models eq 4 was first substituted into the cross model eq 3 to provide a relationship for the apparent viscosity given by 25 Î¼ app Î¼ 0 Î¼ 1 k Î± q ÎºÏ n Î¼ the Î± parameter was fit to the lbm data using nonlinear least squares curve fitting for each individual concentration of guar gum fits for the three porous media are shown in fig 9 for four different concentrations of guar gum 0 5 1 3 and 5 g kg the model was not able to fit the 0 5 g kg guar gum data and while it fits the 1 g kg guar gum simulation data for 40 50 accusand the fit is not as good for the other systems there are multiple possible reasons for the poor fitting with low concentrations of guar gum first small difference between the values of Î¼ and Î¼ 0 may lead to a large degree of sensitivity to error in these parameters another potential reason is that as the concentration decreases the viscosity will have a significantly smaller functional dependence on shear rate and thus on flow rate as well this explanation would suggest that the original shear rate model i e eq 4 is not appropriate for systems which exhibit only slight non newtonian behavior generally Î± was found to be a decreasing function of guar gum concentration it is likely that this relationship between Î± and concentration is inversely a function of Î¼ 0 Î¼ and k which all increase with guar gum concentration however it is most likely that k has the greatest effect as it determines the impact of shear rate on viscosity the parameters are also a function of the medium however clear relationships to medium properties such as permeability porosity or grain size distribution are not apparent from the limited suite of media used in this work while researchers have developed equations to relate Î± to fluid and medium properties primarily based on analytical solutions for power law flow through capillary tubes sabiri and comiti 1995 chhabra et al 2001 a more general theoretical model has yet to be developed pearson and tardy 2002 sochi 2010 future work will further investigate these relationships both theoretically and by simulating a wide range of media properties with the developed lbm to test the ability of modeled results to be applied directly to real systems the apparent viscosities for the experimental system were calculated with eq 25 using the Î± values fit to the lbm data this approach resulted in reasonable matches for many of the data especially 3 g kg but failed to capture the significant non darcy behavior at high flow rates and low guar gum concentrations because non darcy effects were observed in the experiments and would be expected at high flow rates in the field e g in the vicinity of injection extraction wells a modified version of eq 25 was employed that takes into account non darcy flow through an inertial term on the right hand side tosco et al 2013 26 Î¼ app Î¼ 0 Î¼ 1 k Î± q ÎºÏ n Î¼ ÏÎº q Îº 1 calculations with this equation matched the 0 5 g kg guar gum experimental data remarkably well and reasonably predicted the 3 g kg experiments fig 10 there was however significant deviation for the 5 g kg experiments with the 20 30 accusand and sand bead mixture columns likely due to the differences between the real and model systems notably these calculations were produced with Î± values fit to lbm results since these shift factors are functions of both the fluid and the medium the fact that the experimental and virtual systems differ would also suggest that differences in the Î± values would be expected due to the differences between the synthetic and experimental media 4 conclusions the modeling of the flow of fracking fluids and polymer enhanced remediation fluids in the subsurface is complicated by the non newtonian character of the fluids used in these applications most current simulators for these systems ignore non newtonian behavior or require empirically determining a value of Î± in eq 4 the former case fails to account for significant flow dependent variation in viscosity of non newtonian fluids within a system thereby introducing major error into simulations the latter approach requires conducting experiments with the specific fluid and medium of interest due a dependence on both of these factors and the current lack of a generalized relationship for Î± the lbm developed here was found to accurately capture the complex behavior of non newtonian fluid flow in porous media validated through experiments and alternate numerical approaches and can be used to directly determine these shift factors without experiments furthermore the lbm allows for investigation of the relationships between fluid and media properties and Î± and ultimately to develop more generalized forms for the apparent shear rate in porous media a major advantage of the lbm approach is that it allows direct observation of local velocity and viscosity distributions the lbm can be applied to any three dimensional medium including both virtually created systems with arbitrary properties and geometries and real systems that have been imaged with x ray micro computed tomography Î¼ct and magnetic resonance imaging mri additionally the lbm developed here was found to be better suited than existing software openfoam for simulating non newtonian fluid flow in rev scale systems these advantages make the lbm a versatile and valuable tool for further investigation of non newtonian flow through porous and fractured media and especially in probing relationships between the microscale and macroscale physics at play in these systems better understanding the fundamental physics involved will greatly improve our ability to predict flow and transport of contaminants exhibiting non newtonian behavior and to design more effective in situ remediation methods that utilize non newtonian fluids although further study is required to allow direct application to hydraulic fracturing operations including validation for fractured systems and assessment of the impact of fracture geometry the results of this work and the features discussed above suggest that this lbm provides a capable tool for such study this lbm can additionally be extended to apply to other kinds of non newtonian fluids and applied to other systems where non newtonian fluids are encountered such as handling of hydraulic fracturing waste waters polymer flooding for enhanced oil

1467,drinking water fluorosis is universal along coastal zones and the seawater or brine water intrusion is occasionally supposed to enrich groundwater fluorine levels however there is no conclusive proof and the laws and mechanisms remain ambiguous granite the common fluorine bearing rock is selected and experimented upon to reveal the characteristics and laws of fluorine s leaching ability during the intrusion of seawater the fluorine leaching ability increases with the increasing ratios of seawater or brine water the increasing levels of nacl or nahco3 and the decreasing levels of cacl2 such results directly confirm that seawater or brine water intrusion as well as the conditions of higher na hco3 and lower ca2 promotes fluorine leaching ability from granite the intensities of siosi siofe sioal bonds decrease but those of oh bonds increase with a higher ratio of seawater or brine water the higher levels of nacl or nahco3 and the lower levels of cacl2 this indicates the more silicate dissolution and stronger oh f exchange evoked by seawater or brine water intrusion are responsible for the higher fluorine leaching from granite therefore the process of seawater or brine water intrusion should be important for the groundwater enrichment dynamics along coastal zones keywords ftir fluorine leaching ability granite seawater intrusion coastal zones 1 introduction fluorine element f is the most abundant of halogen family and is particularly important for the growth of bone and tooth bellomo et al 2003 however an excessive intake causes negative effect on animal and human health such as dental fluorosis or skeletal fluorosis gao et al 2016 high fluorine groundwater has been the most universal cause for fluorosis all over the world chen et al 2014 thapa et al 2018 jia et al 2019 therefore the origins and enrichment mechanisms for high fluorine groundwater have been hot topics in recent years and a series of fluorine geochemical processes during water rock interaction were detailedly discussed in different fluorosis areas chae et al 2006 thapa et al 2018 chen et al 2019a the fluorine levels of surrounding rocks largely determine groundwater fluorine levels and various high fluorine rocks or minerals have been reported to be the cause of high fluorine groundwater such as fluorapatite topaz fluorite scaillet and macdonald 2004 fluorine is an element incompatible with lithophile and preferentially partitions into melts during the process of magmatic crystallization xiong and zhu 1998 thus fluorine easily enriches in late stage granites in fact the high fluorine groundwater in south korea chae et al 2007 northeast japan kanisiwa 1979 mayo tsanaga river basin cameroon fantong et al 2010 east antarctica li et al 2003 hermosillo city sonora mexico valenzuela vasquez et al 2006 nalgonda district india reddy et al 2010 laizhou bay china chen et al 2014 is revealed in all these locations to be linked with the granite basement therefore an investigation of the fluorine leaching ability of granite is significant for drinking water fluorosis the simulation experiments of water rock interaction can directly reveal the process of fluorine leaching these experiments are widely performed in laboratory but they are only carried out under the condition of fresh water li et al 2013 however multiple researchers have documented that high fluorine groundwater favored in soft and alkaline conditions those have high na levels and low ca2 levels chae et al 2007 walna et al 2007 chen et al 2014 ma et al 2014 chen et al 2019b particularly fluorosis and seawater intrusion are both typical along coastal zones and people have noticed their inherent relationship recently our previous researches also concluded that groundwater fluorine enrichment is related to the high ph na hco3 tds salinity and low ca2 caused by seawater or brine water intrusion and the high fluorine groundwater and seawater intrusion have the same distribution pattern and evolution tendency chen et al 2014 wang et al 2015 jia et al 2019 some special processes during seawater intrusion such as cation exchange are also proved to be responsible for high fluorine groundwater wang et al 2015 accordingly there are still no direct simulation experiments performed under the condition of seawater or brine water solutions and such a lack impedes our further knowledge about fluorosis in seawater intrusion areas on the circumstance of mentioned above the different solutions were used to simulate the degree of seawater brine water intrusion and the fluorine leaching ability of granites was tested the aims of this project are to 1 compare the fluorine leaching ability of granites under different ratios of fresh water seawater or brine water and directly clarify the contribution of seawater mixture to granite fluorine leaching 2 compare the fluorine leaching ability of granites with different solutions and reveal the potential influencing factors 3 characterize the fourier transform infrared ftir of before and after treated granites and discuss the mechanism of granite fluorine leaching 2 experimental and analyzing methods 2 1 experimental methods the granite samples were gained from the north eastern part of shandong province where the granite widely distributes including aishan type guojialing type luanjiahe type and linglong type granites the experimental sample belongs to luanjiahe type granite with the fluorine level of 682 mg kg the fresh rock sample was used for simulation the granites are mainly constituted of 20 35 quartz 20 45 plagioclase 20 50 feldspar about 3 biotite and 1 3 muscovite the accessory minerals with contents of more than 1 10 4 include magnetite allanite ilmenite apatite hamartite zircon monazite pyrite and titanite the average macro elements and trace elements are listed in table 1 luo and miao 2002 generally there are two types of seawater intrusion along coastal zones that is modern seawater intrusion and brine water intrusion chen et al 2020b pure freshwater 1 1 fresh water and seawater and seawater were used to simulate different degree of seawater intrusion pure fresh water 1 1 fresh water and brine water and brine water were used to simulate different degree of brine water intrusion moreover 0 1 mol l and 1 mol l nacl nahco3 and cacl2 solutions were designed to reveal the influence of single ions on fluorine leaching totally 11 solutions were prepared for the leaching tests the granite sample was ground into particles less than 100 mesh 0 15 mm and 112 000 ml beakers were prepared with 50 g sample being placed in every beaker then 1500 ml of every prepared solution was poured into every beaker respectively and the beaker was left to stand after it was magnetically stirred for 1 min 150 ml supernatant was respectively extracted at the occasion of 8 h 16 h 24 h 48 h and 192 h 2 2 analyzing methods the fluorine levels in supernatants were analyzed by a fluoride selective electrode dz t0167 2006 the blank samples standard samples and repetitive samples were analyzed for quality control and the errors were less than 5 ph 3c ph meter was used to analyse ph after calibrated by ph 4 01 6 86 9 18 standard solutions the before and after treated samples were characterized by fourier transform infrared ftir method thermo nicolet 3800 instrument was applied and the transmission spectra were between 400 and 4000 cm 1 2 3 calculation of leached fluorine ions the leached fluorine ions were calculated by subtracting the initial fluorine levels from the fluorine levels in simulation solutions consideration of the different fluorine levels in different solutions 3 results 3 1 the fluorine leaching ability of granite with different solutions figs 1 and 2 illustrate the fluorine leaching ability of granite with different ratios of seawater and brine water the fluorine leaching ability fluctuates with the contact time especially in the fresh water this may be because the fluorine leaching is deeply influenced by the complex processes of adsorption desorption precipitation dissolution and complexation dissociation jia et al 2019 actually the fluctuations are also observed by other simulation experiments of ions as so4 2 na ca2 etc wang et al 2008 generally the leached fluorine ions show increasing tendencies with the higher ratios of seawater or brine water except at 24 h in seawater solution and 48 h in 1 1 fresh water and brine water solutions this indicates that fluorine leaching ability of granite is enhanced by the higher ratios of seawater or brine water to reveal the influence of a single factor on fluorine leaching ability different concentrations of nacl nahco3 and cacl2 were used as simulation solutions and the results are presented in fig 3 generally the leached fluorine obviously increases with the contact time except in the 0 1 mol l cacl2 solution the fluorine leaching abilities in 1 mol l nacl and nahco3 are higher than those in 0 1 mol l nacl and nahco3 respectively however the leached fluorine in 1 mol l cacl2 shows lower values than that in 0 1 mol l such results imply that conditions of higher levels of nacl and nahco3 and lower levels of cacl2 are helpful for fluorine leaching moreover the leached fluorine in nahco3 solutions is more than that in nacl solutions indicating the more contribution of nahco3 groundwater geochemical properties deeply change because of seawater brine water intrusion seawater has higher levels of na cl hco3 and naturally seawater or brine water intrusion causes higher levels of nacl and nahco3 in groundwater multiply field investigations also reported high levels of nacl and nahco3 in seawater intrusion areas xue et al 1997 ma et al 2014 chen et al 2019b the alkaline condition and high so4 2 levels due to seawater intrusion result in the oversaturation and precipitation of caco3 and caso4 minerals chen et al 2019a the calcite and gypsum minerals were also observed in the aquifers in seawater intrusion areas chen et al 2020a moreover the direct na ca cation exchange the important process during seawater intrusion consumed part of groundwater ca2 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2020c to be concluded the groundwater is characterized by higher na hco3 and low ca2 after seawater or brine water intrudes thus our simulation with different solutions fig 3 can explain the simulation results with seawater and brine water figs 1 and 2 3 2 the ftir characteristics the ftir spectrums of granite with different solutions are determined to discuss the fluorine leaching mechanism the bands at around 3417 cm 1 and 3070 cm 1 are associated with the stretching vibration of oh bonds liu et al 2009 the absorption peaks at around 1636 cm 1 and 694 cm 1 correspond to the bending vibration of oh bonds liu et al 2009 prabhu et al 2016 the co3 2 is reflected on the bands at 1467 cm 1 and 849 cm 1 linker et al 2005 the detection of strong bands at around 1036 cm 1 indicates the presence of siosi bonds linker et al 2005 the single absorption peaks of quartz occur at the bands of 778 cm 1 liu et al 1996 the bands at 642 cm 1 and 431 cm 1 are attributed to m o m al fe mn zr si bonds farmer 1974 mendelovici et al 2001 habibi and mardani 2017 the bands near 537 cm 1 and 586 cm 1 are assigned to the bending vibration of sioal bonds and 468 cm 1 to the bending vibration of siofe bonds lu et al 2016 the intensities of siosi sioal siofe bonds decrease with higher ratios of seawater or brine water indicating the further dissolution of the silicate minerals fig 5 fluorine always occurs in magmatic rocks bearing si o si since it is an incompatible lithophile element and enriches in the late stage magma scaillet and macdonald 2004 the f atom is more nucleophilic with si atom than o atom and the f atom can substitute for the o atom in the siosi bond li 2015 jia et al 2019 thus the higher dissolution capacity of silicate minerals in granite due to the more mixture of seawater or brine water surely results in a greater leaching of the associated fluorine indeed the weathering of silicate mineral phase has been widely reported to elevate groundwater fluorine mondal and gupta 2015 moreover some metal ionic compounds such as sif6 2 alf6 2 fef6 2 and incomplete coordination related to fe al or si the main forms of water fluorine ions enhance fluorine leaching with the dissolving of siosi sioal siofe bonds the experiments have revealed that fluorine extraction is associated with the sio2 and al2o3 extraction tang et al 1997 the fact that groundwater fluorine increases with the higher sio2 level has also been widely documented chae et al 2007 the intensity of oh bond distinctly shows increased tendency with a corresponding increase in fluorine leaching fig 5 the oh and f ions have almost the same radius and can substitute for each other and oh f exchange has been regarded as the most universal and important dynamic of groundwater fluorine enrichment during water rock interaction saxena and ahmed 2001 gao et al 2007 chae et al 2007 chen et al 2014 jia et al 2019 obviously the increasing intensity of oh bonds with higher ratios of seawater or brine water implies that more oh in water is used to exchange f in granite which aptly explains the mechanism of higher fluorine leaching ability with higher ratios of seawater or brine water the ftir spectrums of granite with different solutions are depicted in fig 6 the intensities of siosi siofe sioal bonds increase while those of oh bonds decrease with the increasing levels of nacl and nahco3 this means the fluorine leaching ability of granite is also enhanced by the silicate dissolution and oh f exchange when more nacl and nahco3 mix into water however with the increasing of cacl2 concentration the intensities of siosi siofe sioal bonds decrease and the oh bonds show no marked change or even are weakened such facts imply that cacl2 restricts the fluorine leaching of granite during water rock interaction the strong peaks at 1467 cm 1 and 849 cm 1 which only appear in nahco3 and cacl2 solutions indicate precipitation of caco3 4 discussion granite has been considered as the key origin of drinking water fluorosis since it accumulates the fluorine and often acts as the basement for bedrock in fluorosis areas the fluorine leaching laws of granite are important for groundwater fluorine enrichment however the high fluorine groundwater is always linked with the conditions of high na cl tds ph chae et al 2007 walna et al 2007 sun et al 2015 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2014 thapa et al 2018 and some documents even concluded that seawater or brine water intrusion is responsible for the groundwater fluorine enrichment in plain areas wang et al 2015 chen et al 2015 yang 2016 zhang et al 2016 therefore the simulation of granite fluorine leaching with seawater or brine water is expected to reveal the essence of fluorine migration from granite along coastal zones solubility of fluorine ions generally increased with increased groundwater na levels since the naf has higher solubility than caf2 and mgf2 and the na has priority over ca2 and mg2 in combing with f gao et al 2007 wang et al 2015 the observation has confirmed that complex as naf increased in groundwater with the higher na levels gao et al 2007 the facts that groundwater fluorine ions enrich in na rich groundwater have also been widely documented chae et al 2007 chen et al 2014 conversely the higher ca2 decreased the fluorine leaching ability because the f solubility is restricted by the caf2 dissolution the groundwater fluorine levels are frequently found to be negatively correlated with ca2 saxena and ahmed 2003 ozsvath 2008 overall the conditions of high na and low ca2 promote fluorine leaching from rocks and become important factors of groundwater fluorine enrichment our simulation experiments observed that the fluorine leaching ability of granite increases with increased nacl and nahco3 levels and decreased with the increased cacl2 levels by changing the si o and o h groups in granite which is in agreement with the mentioned above logically the geochemical processes affecting the balance of groundwater na and ca2 deeply determine groundwater fluorine levels for example higher na and lower ca2 in seawater intrusion areas the weathering of na bearing minerals the precipitation of caco3 all are reported to be related to groundwater fluorine levels wang et al 2015 mondal and gupta 2015 what is more na ca cation exchange the common process during seawater intrusion or other water rock interaction takes place as follows 2 na k ca mg x 2 na k x ca 2 mg 2 where x is the solid material that is the na k and mg2 ca2 can displace each other between solid material and water direct cation exchange is characterized by the displacement of na k at solid surface by mg2 ca2 in water reverse cation exchange is the exchange of mg2 ca2 on the solid material by na k in water obviously the reverse exchange results in higher na and low ca2 in water which has been commonly observed in drinking water fluorosis areas and regarded as the important dynamic of groundwater fluorine enrichment wang et al 2015 these facts well support the validity of our experiments and explanation oh f exchange deeply affects the fluorine distribution between water and rock and is detected in research as fluorine enrichment leaching or defluorination ayoob and gupta 2006 jiang et al 2017 thapa et al 2018 high ph due to seawater or brine water mixture causes further exchange of oh in water with f in granite our simulation also found the intensity of oh bonds in granite increase with more fluorine released into water figs 4 and 5 fig 6 depicted the ph in different simulation solutions the ph shows complex irregular variation because it is influenced by other geochemical processes such as those of nh4 fe2 fe3 al3 cu2 free co2 and salinity the ph increases with the more mixture of seawater and brine water and the reason may be that seawater and brine water is more alkaline than fresh water xue et al 1997 the intensities of oh bands become stronger with more seawater or brine water which indicates the stronger exchange of f in granite with oh with more mixture of seawater or brine water generally the ph in simulation solutions is in the order nahco3 nacl cacl2 which is in accordance to the deviation of oh intensities in 0 1 mol l and 1 mol l that is the higher ph the more deviation in the two concentrations the deviation of the intensity of oh bonds in 0 1 mol l from that in 1 mol l nahco3 is more remarkable than the deviation of the intensity of oh bonds in 0 1 mol l from that in1 mol l nacl fig 5 which can be ascribed to the more alkaline nahco3 solution therefore the higher ph due to seawater or brine water intrusion results in an increase in the leaching of fluorine from granite into the water high fluorine groundwater along coastal zones has been widely documented such as in yingkou of liaoning province laizhou bay of shandong province cangzhou of hebei province wang et al 2015 yang 2016 these areas are always characterized by seawater or brine water intrusion with high ph na cl tds and low ca2 levels in groundwater multiply researches also argued that high fluorine groundwater enriches in the conditions of high na ph and low ca2 gao et al 2007 wang et al 2015 thapa et al 2018 nevertheless the process of seawater or brine water mixture hasn t been concerned when the forming mechanism of high fluorine groundwater along coastal zones is discussed additionally although there is no any direct evidence demonstrating the effect of seawater intrusion on fluorine leaching from granite the salt lake water intrusion in yuncheng of china gao et al 2007 and nagar parker of pakistan tahir et al 2009 which has the similar process to seawater intrusion has been confirmed to elevate the groundwater fluorine levels 5 conclusions the fluorine leaching ability of granite with different solutions was simulated in the laboratory and the followings are gained 1 the fluorine leaching ability of granite increases with the increasing ratios of seawater or brine water implying the mixture of seawater or brine water largely promotes the fluorine enrichment in water the fluorine leaching ability of granite also increases with the increasing nacl and nahco3 levels but decreases with the increasing cacl2 levels which indicates the conditions of high na and low ca2 help for the fluorine leaching 2 the intensities of siosi siofe sioal bonds in granite decrease and those of oh bonds increase with the increasing ratios of seawater or brine water ratios the higher nacl and nahco3 levels and the lower cacl2 levels such facts indicate silicate dissolution and oh f exchange are the important dynamics of groundwater fluorine enrichment when seawater or brine water intrudes therefore the processes of seawater or brine water intrusion should be considered when seeking the dynamics for groundwater fluorine enrichment along coastal zones author statement qiao chen

a fluoride selective electrode dz t0167 2006 the blank samples standard samples and repetitive samples were analyzed for quality control and the errors were less than 5 ph 3c ph meter was used to analyse ph after calibrated by ph 4 01 6 86 9 18 standard solutions the before and after treated samples were characterized by fourier transform infrared ftir method thermo nicolet 3800 instrument was applied and the transmission spectra were between 400 and 4000 cm 1 2 3 calculation of leached fluorine ions the leached fluorine ions were calculated by subtracting the initial fluorine levels from the fluorine levels in simulation solutions consideration of the different fluorine levels in different solutions 3 results 3 1 the fluorine leaching ability of granite with different solutions figs 1 and 2 illustrate the fluorine leaching ability of granite with different ratios of seawater and brine water the fluorine leaching ability fluctuates with the contact time especially in the fresh water this may be because the fluorine leaching is deeply influenced by the complex processes of adsorption desorption precipitation dissolution and complexation dissociation jia et al 2019 actually the fluctuations are also observed by other simulation experiments of ions as so4 2 na ca2 etc wang et al 2008 generally the leached fluorine ions show increasing tendencies with the higher ratios of seawater or brine water except at 24 h in seawater solution and 48 h in 1 1 fresh water and brine water solutions this indicates that fluorine leaching ability of granite is enhanced by the higher ratios of seawater or brine water to reveal the influence of a single factor on fluorine leaching ability different concentrations of nacl nahco3 and cacl2 were used as simulation solutions and the results are presented in fig 3 generally the leached fluorine obviously increases with the contact time except in the 0 1 mol l cacl2 solution the fluorine leaching abilities in 1 mol l nacl and nahco3 are higher than those in 0 1 mol l nacl and nahco3 respectively however the leached fluorine in 1 mol l cacl2 shows lower values than that in 0 1 mol l such results imply that conditions of higher levels of nacl and nahco3 and lower levels of cacl2 are helpful for fluorine leaching moreover the leached fluorine in nahco3 solutions is more than that in nacl solutions indicating the more contribution of nahco3 groundwater geochemical properties deeply change because of seawater brine water intrusion seawater has higher levels of na cl hco3 and naturally seawater or brine water intrusion causes higher levels of nacl and nahco3 in groundwater multiply field investigations also reported high levels of nacl and nahco3 in seawater intrusion areas xue et al 1997 ma et al 2014 chen et al 2019b the alkaline condition and high so4 2 levels due to seawater intrusion result in the oversaturation and precipitation of caco3 and caso4 minerals chen et al 2019a the calcite and gypsum minerals were also observed in the aquifers in seawater intrusion areas chen et al 2020a moreover the direct na ca cation exchange the important process during seawater intrusion consumed part of groundwater ca2 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2020c to be concluded the groundwater is characterized by higher na hco3 and low ca2 after seawater or brine water intrudes thus our simulation with different solutions fig 3 can explain the simulation results with seawater and brine water figs 1 and 2 3 2 the ftir characteristics the ftir spectrums of granite with different solutions are determined to discuss the fluorine leaching mechanism the bands at around 3417 cm 1 and 3070 cm 1 are associated with the stretching vibration of oh bonds liu et al 2009 the absorption peaks at around 1636 cm 1 and 694 cm 1 correspond to the bending vibration of oh bonds liu et al 2009 prabhu et al 2016 the co3 2 is reflected on the bands at 1467 cm 1 and 849 cm 1 linker et al 2005 the detection of strong bands at around 1036 cm 1 indicates the presence of siosi bonds linker et al 2005 the single absorption peaks of quartz occur at the bands of 778 cm 1 liu et al 1996 the bands at 642 cm 1 and 431 cm 1 are attributed to m o m al fe mn zr si bonds farmer 1974 mendelovici et al 2001 habibi and mardani 2017 the bands near 537 cm 1 and 586 cm 1 are assigned to the bending vibration of sioal bonds and 468 cm 1 to the bending vibration of siofe bonds lu et al 2016 the intensities of siosi sioal siofe bonds decrease with higher ratios of seawater or brine water indicating the further dissolution of the silicate minerals fig 5 fluorine always occurs in magmatic rocks bearing si o si since it is an incompatible lithophile element and enriches in the late stage magma scaillet and macdonald 2004 the f atom is more nucleophilic with si atom than o atom and the f atom can substitute for the o atom in the siosi bond li 2015 jia et al 2019 thus the higher dissolution capacity of silicate minerals in granite due to the more mixture of seawater or brine water surely results in a greater leaching of the associated fluorine indeed the weathering of silicate mineral phase has been widely reported to elevate groundwater fluorine mondal and gupta 2015 moreover some metal ionic compounds such as sif6 2 alf6 2 fef6 2 and incomplete coordination related to fe al or si the main forms of water fluorine ions enhance fluorine leaching with the dissolving of siosi sioal siofe bonds the experiments have revealed that fluorine extraction is associated with the sio2 and al2o3 extraction tang et al 1997 the fact that groundwater fluorine increases with the higher sio2 level has also been widely documented chae et al 2007 the intensity of oh bond distinctly shows increased tendency with a corresponding increase in fluorine leaching fig 5 the oh and f ions have almost the same radius and can substitute for each other and oh f exchange has been regarded as the most universal and important dynamic of groundwater fluorine enrichment during water rock interaction saxena and ahmed 2001 gao et al 2007 chae et al 2007 chen et al 2014 jia et al 2019 obviously the increasing intensity of oh bonds with higher ratios of seawater or brine water implies that more oh in water is used to exchange f in granite which aptly explains the mechanism of higher fluorine leaching ability with higher ratios of seawater or brine water the ftir spectrums of granite with different solutions are depicted in fig 6 the intensities of siosi siofe sioal bonds increase while those of oh bonds decrease with the increasing levels of nacl and nahco3 this means the fluorine leaching ability of granite is also enhanced by the silicate dissolution and oh f exchange when more nacl and nahco3 mix into water however with the increasing of cacl2 concentration the intensities of siosi siofe sioal bonds decrease and the oh bonds show no marked change or even are weakened such facts imply that cacl2 restricts the fluorine leaching of granite during water rock interaction the strong peaks at 1467 cm 1 and 849 cm 1 which only appear in nahco3 and cacl2 solutions indicate precipitation of caco3 4 discussion granite has been considered as the key origin of drinking water fluorosis since it accumulates the fluorine and often acts as the basement for bedrock in fluorosis areas the fluorine leaching laws of granite are important for groundwater fluorine enrichment however the high fluorine groundwater is always linked with the conditions of high na cl tds ph chae et al 2007 walna et al 2007 sun et al 2015 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2014 thapa et al 2018 and some documents even concluded that seawater or brine water intrusion is responsible for the groundwater fluorine enrichment in plain areas wang et al 2015 chen et al 2015 yang 2016 zhang et al 2016 therefore the simulation of granite fluorine leaching with seawater or brine water is expected to reveal the essence of fluorine migration from granite along coastal zones solubility of fluorine ions generally increased with increased groundwater na levels since the naf has higher solubility than caf2 and mgf2 and the na has priority over ca2 and mg2 in combing with f gao et al 2007 wang et al 2015 the observation has confirmed that complex as naf increased in groundwater with the higher na levels gao et al 2007 the facts that groundwater fluorine ions enrich in na rich groundwater have also been widely documented chae et al 2007 chen et al 2014 conversely the higher ca2 decreased the fluorine leaching ability because the f solubility is restricted by the caf2 dissolution the groundwater fluorine levels are frequently found to be negatively correlated with ca2 saxena and ahmed 2003 ozsvath 2008 overall the conditions of high na and low ca2 promote fluorine leaching from rocks and become important factors of groundwater fluorine enrichment our simulation experiments observed that the fluorine leaching ability of granite increases with increased nacl and nahco3 levels and decreased with the increased cacl2 levels by changing the si o and o h groups in granite which is in agreement with the mentioned above logically the geochemical processes affecting the balance of groundwater na and ca2 deeply determine groundwater fluorine levels for example higher na and lower ca2 in seawater intrusion areas the weathering of na bearing minerals the precipitation of caco3 all are reported to be related to groundwater fluorine levels wang et al 2015 mondal and gupta 2015 what is more na ca cation exchange the common process during seawater intrusion or other water rock interaction takes place as follows 2 na k ca mg x 2 na k x ca 2 mg 2 where x is the solid material that is the na k and mg2 ca2 can displace each other between solid material and water direct cation exchange is characterized by the displacement of na k at solid surface by mg2 ca2 in water reverse cation exchange is the exchange of mg2 ca2 on the solid material by na k in water obviously the reverse exchange results in higher na and low ca2 in water which has been commonly observed in drinking water fluorosis areas and regarded as the important dynamic of groundwater fluorine enrichment wang et al 2015 these facts well support the validity of our experiments and explanation oh f exchange deeply affects the fluorine distribution between water and rock and is detected in research as fluorine enrichment leaching or defluorination ayoob and gupta 2006 jiang et al 2017 thapa et al 2018 high ph due to seawater or brine water mixture causes further exchange of oh in water with f in granite our simulation also found the intensity of oh bonds in granite increase with more fluorine released into water figs 4 and 5 fig 6 depicted the ph in different simulation solutions the ph shows complex irregular variation because it is influenced by other geochemical processes such as those of nh4 fe2 fe3 al3 cu2 free co2 and salinity the ph increases with the more mixture of seawater and brine water and the reason may be that seawater and brine water is more alkaline than fresh water xue et al 1997 the intensities of oh bands become stronger with more seawater or brine water which indicates the stronger exchange of f in granite with oh with more mixture of seawater or brine water generally the ph in simulation solutions is in the order nahco3 nacl cacl2 which is in accordance to the deviation of oh intensities in 0 1 mol l and 1 mol l that is the higher ph the more deviation in the two concentrations the deviation of the intensity of oh bonds in 0 1 mol l from that in 1 mol l nahco3 is more remarkable than the deviation of the intensity of oh bonds in 0 1 mol l from that in1 mol l nacl fig 5 which can be ascribed to the more alkaline nahco3 solution therefore the higher ph due to seawater or brine water intrusion results in an increase in the leaching of fluorine from granite into the water high fluorine groundwater along coastal zones has been widely documented such as in yingkou of liaoning province laizhou bay of shandong province cangzhou of hebei province wang et al 2015 yang 2016 these areas are always characterized by seawater or brine water intrusion with high ph na cl tds and low ca2 levels in groundwater multiply researches also argued that high fluorine groundwater enriches in the conditions of high na ph and low ca2 gao et al 2007 wang et al 2015 thapa et al 2018 nevertheless the process of seawater or brine water mixture hasn t been concerned when the forming mechanism of high fluorine groundwater along coastal zones is discussed additionally although there is no any direct evidence demonstrating the effect of seawater intrusion on fluorine leaching from granite the salt lake water intrusion in yuncheng of china gao et al 2007 and nagar parker of pakistan tahir et al 2009 which has the similar process to seawater intrusion has been confirmed to elevate the groundwater fluorine levels 5 conclusions the fluorine leaching ability of granite with different solutions was simulated in the laboratory and the followings are gained 1 the fluorine leaching ability of granite increases with the increasing ratios of seawater or brine water implying the mixture of seawater or brine water largely promotes the fluorine enrichment in water the fluorine leaching ability of granite also increases with the increasing nacl and nahco3 levels but decreases with the increasing cacl2 levels which indicates the conditions of high na and low ca2 help for the fluorine leaching 2 the intensities of siosi siofe sioal bonds in granite decrease and those of oh bonds increase with the increasing ratios of seawater or brine water ratios the higher nacl and nahco3 levels and the lower cacl2 levels such facts indicate silicate dissolution and oh f exchange are the important dynamics of groundwater fluorine enrichment when seawater or brine water intrudes therefore the processes of seawater or brine water intrusion should be considered when seeking the dynamics for groundwater fluorine enrichment along coastal zones author statement qiao chen

1468,a large number of potentially contaminated sites reported worldwide require cost and time effective assessment of the extent of contamination and the threats posed to the water resources a significant risk assessment metric for these sites can be the determination of the maximum i e steady state contaminant plume length l max analytical approaches in the literature provide an option for such an assessment but they include a certain degree of uncertainty often the causes of such uncertainties are the simplifications in the analytical models e g not considering the influence of hydrogeological stresses such as recharge which impact the plume development significantly this may lead to an over or underestimation of l max this work includes the influence of the recharge for the effective estimation of l max for that several two dimensional 2d numerical simulations have been performed by considering different aquifer thicknesses 1 m 4 m and recharge rates ranging from 0 to 3 6 mm day from the numerical results of this work it has been deduced that 1 the application of the recharge shortens l max and the recharge entering the aquifer top causes the plume to tilt 2 the reduction percentage in l max depends on the recharge rate applied and the aquifer thickness and 3 the reduction percentage varies in a non linear manner with respect to the recharge rate for a fixed aquifer thickness based on these results a hybrid analytical empirical solution has been developed for the estimation of l max with the inclusion of the recharge rate the proposed hybrid analytical empirical solution superimposes an empirically obtained correction factor onto an analytical solution although extensive confirmation steps of the developed model are required for including the effect of the recharge on aquifer hydraulics the proposed expression improves the estimation of the l max significantly the hybrid analytical empirical solution has also been confirmed with a selection of limited field contamination sites data the hybrid model result l hyb provides a significant improvement in the estimation i e an order of magnitude lower mean relative error compared to the analytical model keywords contaminant transport steady state plume length numerical modeling hybrid analytical empirical solution 1 introduction water stress is emerging as one of the major global issues schlosser et al 2014 stated that by the year 2050 52 of the population worldwide might be living under at least moderately stressed water resource conditions and one fifth of it might be living in regions with over exploited water resources worldwide 2 5 billion people are dependent on groundwater to fulfill their basic daily water needs wwap 2012 unlike the surface water resources which are accessible at limited locations only groundwater is easily available in many places hence it forms the largest share of the world s agriculture and drinking water supply additionally it is also a source of the base flow of surface water systems therefore deterioration in the quality of the groundwater may also affect the quality of the surface water which forms a significant source of supply as well the cumulative effect of groundwater contamination poses a serious threat to water resources associated ecosystems and drinking water security therefore there is a pressing need for studies concerning the assessment and remediation of the contaminated sites as per the eea 2014 approximately 14 of an estimated 2 5 million potentially contaminated sites in the european union eu are expected to be contaminated and in need of remediation while one third of these contaminated sites have been identified already only about 15 have been remediated so far eea 2014 given the immense size of the problem effective assessment and management techniques are required eea 2014 suggested that the cost of remediation could be over ten times the investigation cost 40 of the reported cases thus it is essential to gauge the magnitude of the problem in order to assess the required resources like workforce finances and time eea 2014 there have been numerous research works on contaminant transport and plume development over the decades bear 1979 and batu 1989 2005 discussed the development of analytical models for the estimation of natural attenuation zhang et al 2007 2008 conducted physical experiments to examine groundwater flow and contaminant spreading in the subsurface to support the development of mathematical models field studies by conant jr et al 2004 investigated the influence of contaminant plumes on local streams ponds and rivers also ham et al 2004 chu et al 2005 liedl et al 2005 2011 and cirpka et al 2006 proposed analytical solutions for estimating the steady state or maximum plume length l max based on several assumptions such as homogeneous two dimensional aquifer domain uniform flow and straightforward reaction mechanisms likewise maier and grathwohl 2006 developed an empirical method for calculating the l max through a large number of numerical simulations furthermore the architecture of a source zone was studied through non invasive imaging by werth et al 2010 de barros and nowak 2010 introduced the concept of effective source width and source efficiency and their importance in assessment of plume developemnt furthermore cirpka et al 2012 discussed the steady state reactive transport in two dimensional heterogeneous porous media to quatfy the sources of uncertainity in predicting contaminant plume lengths preliminary investigations using field exploration techniques and laboratory experiments are conventionally used for site management however considering a large number of potentially contaminated sites they may prove to be challenging as well as very expensive numerical models provide a better alternative over the field methods and they are widely prevalent however they too prove to be intractable due to the requirements of extensive data pertaining to the aquifer contaminants and technical expertise in such cases analytical solutions or empirical models can provide a satisfactory alternative to preliminary investigations given the availability of minimal data input required determining a reasonably good estimate of l max which mostly represents a worst case scenario can serve as an adequate measure for the pre assessment of a contaminant site as such analytical or empirical models can be advantageous for predicting l max with the input of very few parameters however the available models e g ham et al 2004 liedl et al 2005 2011 cirpka et al 2006 cirpka and valocchi 2007 maier and grathwohl 2006 often oversimplify the real site conditions thus quite often leading to a highly overestimated or underestimated value of l max therefore in the current state the available analytical solutions have limited field applicability owing to the complex scenarios at real sites a large number of contaminated sites huge costs involved in field investigation techniques and difficulties associated with the numerical models indicate the research gap in the development of analytical empirical models beyond the simplifying assumptions a few research works have tried to assess the performance of analytical solutions beyond the simplifying assumptions e g yadav et al 2013 investigated the impact of partially penetrating contamination sources on l max based on the scenarios presented in liedl et al 2005 2011 for several 2d and 3d cases other works e g yang et al 2012 and jeon et al 2013 suggested that hydrogeological stresses external stresses like seasonal hydrologic variations flood events groundwater abstraction irrigation or drainage precipitation and lake stage variation influence the contaminant transport yang et al 2012 found a strong correlation between the contaminant concentration levels in the groundwater with seasonal recharge and the fluctuations in groundwater levels the contaminant concentrations and the solute mass discharge through the source were also found to be closely associated with the seasonal recharge and the changes in the groundwater table levels jeon et al 2013 also found a close association between the groundwater levels and the levels of contaminant concentration indicating an increase in the concentration during the dry season this showed the likely impact of change in groundwater levels on the fate and transport of contaminants the long running residence time of contaminants e g napls in the subsurface also makes the external stresses a critical factor furthermore the extreme cases of external stresses such as floods droughts and pumping may impact the plume development significantly the direction and volume of contaminant flux respond to the changes in the groundwater levels originating from these external stresses the above discussion on the current state of steady state models and the influence of external stresses on l max identifies a shortcoming in the ability of analytical models for a proper assessment of the contaminated sites under the influence of external stresses the motivation behind this study is to investigate the influence of recharge rates on the steady state plume length by applying a numerical approach i e finite difference scheme and the development of a novel hybrid analytical empirical solution for the subsurface transport problems for this work a hybrid analytical empirical solution referred to as hybrid model hereafter is defined as one which is developed by the superimposition of analytical model and empirical model the innovative hybrid model is presented providing a relationship between l max and recharge rate with all the other assumptions still valid as stated in the analytical development of l max by liedl et al 2005 the proposed hybrid model is then evaluated against a set of selected field plume lengths as the focus of the work is on the development of a hybrid model the selection of the analytical model is still based on simple assumptions more precisely the base analytical model liedl et al 2005 provides a vertically oriented two dimensional model that may suit best for the application of a vertical recharge process the selection of a more robust base analytical models is an interesting direction of research and it will be treated in future work the work is organized in the following order first the conceptual geometry with the underlying hydro geophysical state is presented this is followed by introducing a numerical scheme that allows the use of a conservative model to simulate a reactive system in the second step the numerical results are presented the development of the hybrid model is presented in the third step which is followed by the evaluation of the proposed model as the final step 2 methodology 2 1 the conceptual model the domain for the numerical modeling see fig 1 has been set in a manner similar to the conceptual model proposed by liedl et al 2005 to the best of the authors knowledge the solution given by liedl et al 2005 is the only two dimensional analytical solution that considers a vertical aquifer cross section such a conceptual model provides a better representation of the supply of electron acceptor ea and the recharge entering the aquifer from the top boundary in comparison to several horizontal models moreover it solves the limitations associated with the previous works for instance a sharp front due to the entire consumption of the contaminant source electron donor or ed and ea in an instantaneous bi molecular reaction occurring at the fringe is recognized as a result finite plumes are developed a vertical cross section also allows an easier examination of the impact of recharge rates on the plume length in this study an aquifer contaminated with ed source e g dnapls with ea e g oxygen as a partner reactant has been considered see fig 1 the two dimensional model domain has been assumed to be a saturated homogeneous aquifer with a uniform horizontal flow field without application of the recharge a uniformly distributed contaminant ed with concentration c ed at the inflow boundary and ea with uniform concentration c ea at the aquifer top has been applied for the purpose of our study c ed 5 mg l and c ea 8 mg l have been considered as was the case in liedl et al 2005 the contaminant source fully penetrates the total thickness of the aquifer at the source inflow boundary i e the source thickness m s equals the aquifer thickness m a bi molecular instantaneous reaction with utilization factor the stoichiometric ratio for the instantaneous bimolecular reaction Î³ 3 5 involving ed and ea has been assumed ea is being supplied by a spatio temporal constant concentration boundary at the water table the parameters used in the numerical simulations are listed in table 1 the head values at the constant head boundaries have been chosen in order to establish the required hydraulic gradient of 0 01 which in turn has ensured the flow direction from left to right in the model domain the groundwater velocity and the darcy flux in the domain are 0 0864 m day and 0 34 m day respectively based on the parameters listed in table 1 following liedl et al 2005 and other similar works it has been assumed that the molecular diffusion has negligible influence in comparison to the mechanical dispersion the vertical transverse dispersivity has been taken as 0 05 m in the modeling and it has been kept constant for all the simulations similar to the earlier works yadav et al 2013 liedl et al 2011 2 2 a simplified transformation conservative modeling of reactive transport a simplified transformation which enables the simulation of an instantaneous bi molecular reaction using a conservative modeling approach has been used the approach for this transformation described in the works of acharya et al 2007 and yadav et al 2013 involves transforming the coupled transport equations of c ed and c ea into a single transport equation in terms of a new concentration parameter c here c Î³ c ed c ea represents the acceptor deficit apart from the bi molecular reaction rate represented by r the electron donor and acceptor concentrations are subjected to advection longitudinal dispersion vertical transverse dispersion and the molecular diffusion in a 2d domain x l in the horizontal direction and z l in the vertical direction for the transformation the ed transport equation eq 1 is first multiplied with Î³ which is the dimensionless utilization factor and then the resulting equation is subtracted from the ea transport equation eq 2 the transformation leads to the loss of the reaction terms appearing in eqs 1 and 2 consequently reactive transport is transformed into a conservative one eq 3 1 v c ed x Î± l v d ed 2 c e d x 2 Î± tv v d ed 2 c ed z 2 r 2 v c ea x Î± l v d ea 2 c ea x 2 Î± tv v d ea 2 c ea z 2 Î³r applying the transformation mentioned above and assuming the coefficient of diffusions to be equal i e d ea d ed d yields 3 v c x Î± l v d 2 c x 2 Î± tv v d 2 c z 2 0 eq 3 can be further simplified by dividing both sides of it by v this results in d v terms appearing on the left side of the equation following this the terms having d v can be ignored since mostly v d accordingly the following model equation eq 4 can be obtained 4 c x Î± l 2 c x 2 Î± tv 2 c z 2 0 liedl et al 2005 provided the following analytical solution for eq 4 with the given boundary conditions c 0 z Î³c ed c

ruling out the co existence of ed and ea in the model domain see fig 2 liedl et al 2005 model confirm that the longitudinal dispersivity has a negligible role in determining the steady state plume length the effect of the longitudinal dispersion was not considered in the simplified solution given by liedl et al 2005 as 6 l max 4 m 2 Ï 2 Î± tv ln 4 Ï Î³ c ed c ea c ea eq 6 is valid under the assumption that Ï2Î±l Î± tv m 2 1 thus the resulting positive concentrations c 0 see fig 2 refer to the contaminated region with concentration c ed c Î³ whereas negative concentrations c 0 represent the acceptor region with acceptor concentrations c ea c for the numerical modeling see the next sections in this work the transformed eq 4 has been used the numerical plume length without the recharge has been confirmed with the analytical solution once the model was confirmed the recharge quantity has been added to obtain the numerical plume length that also includes the effect of recharge the following section compares the numerical plume length by taking the recharge into account with the analytical plume length that does not include recharge for the 2d numerical simulation of the groundwater flow modflow2005 harbaugh 2005 has been used the contaminant transport in the groundwater aquifer has been modeled using the mt3d zheng 2010 the boundary conditions for the numerical domain have been set as follows i constant head boundaries at the left and the right end of the domain to create uniform horizontal flow ii no flow boundary along the impervious bottom of the domain iii a constant flux boundary at the top of the aquifer for the incoming recharge iv constant concentration boundary at the left end of the domain for the donor source and v a constant concentration boundary at the top and right end for the acceptor using Î³ 3 5 a typical value for aerobic degradation of btex taken from wiedemeier et al 1999 the concentrations are equivalent to transformed concentrations c Î³ c ed 3 5 5 17 5 mg l and c c ea 8 mg l the longitudinal extension of the numerical domain has been taken to be two times the plume length predicted by the analytical solution eq 5 the recharge is expected to shorten the plume length and hence domain length equal to two times the l max is sufficient to avoid numerical effects from the downgradient boundary the appropriate mesh size required for the numerical simulation is considered next for this several trials for determining the grid sizes have been simulated eventually the grid size has been selected with the optimum trade off between the accuracy and the computational time the results of trials for vertical grid size with the accuracy ratio of numerical plume length with analytical plume length i e l num l ana are shown in fig 3 the optimum grid size has been determined to be 0 5 m and 1 cm in x and z direction respectively which has been used for all the simulations the grid peclet number was 0 1 well within the range thus satisfying the numerical stability criterion furthermore simulations have been carried out to quantify the influence of the longitudinal dispersivity on l max as can also be observed in fig 3 there is an insignificant difference in plume length with a change in the longitudinal dispersivity from 0 25 m to 1 m but because for the lower longitudinal dispersivity values peclet number was higher showing some artificial oscillations hence the longitudinal dispersivity of 1 m was used for all the simulations several research works e g liedl et al 2005 ham et al 2004 cirpka et al 2006 presented a similar conclusion consequently the longitudinal dispersivity has been kept constant at 1 m for all the simulations in this work 2 3 variation of model parameters various studies e g liedl et al 2005 2011 engelmann et al 2019 considered the source geometry as a factor that has a significant influence on l max also it can be observed in eq 5 that the aquifer thickness equal to the source thickness is the most influential parameter in determining l max it is to be noted that the source geometry here source thickness in this work is equivalent to aquifer thickness see fig 1 also see liedl et al 2005 hence although the purpose of this work is to identify the influence of recharge rates on l max the variation in aquifer thickness has also been considered in the numerical simulations for over 200 simulations the aquifer thickness and the recharge rate have been varied from 1 m to 4 m and 0 mm day to 3 6 mm day respectively the used recharge parameter range encompasses a purely analytical solution for r 0 mm day and at the same time 3 6 mm day which is over 1300 mm year and higher than the average yearly precipitation of the world as well as in many countries the range of recharge is found to be quite comprehensive very well encompassing the extremes c ed c ea and Î± tv have been kept constant for all the simulations in this study the effect of these quantities has been captured by the analytical solution the inferences drawn on the basis of numerical and analytical results are presented in the following sections 3 results 3 1 steady state plume length under the influence of recharge rates the base model results have been considered well confirmed as without the application of recharge the numerical plume lengths provided a close match up to 95 accurate to analytical plume lengths once confirmed the simulations have been performed with the application of recharge the results have suggested the downward diversion and decreased longitudinal extension of the plumes on the application of the recharge see fig 4 a the recharge entering the aquifer causes the plume to have steeper gradients and thus shorter plume lengths results the results could also be attributed to the downward component of the flow velocity and the increased incoming electron acceptor with non contaminated water with more recharge more electron acceptor enters the domain consuming the contaminant faster fig 4 a shows that the plume length has a negative correlation with the recharge rate for a given aquifer thickness m also the larger the m the higher the relative decrease observed in the numerical plume length for the same recharge rate r next comparisons are drawn from liedl et al 2005 in order to observe the deviations in the numerical plume length while taking the recharge into account fig 4 b shows the variation in the percentage decrease in the numerical plume length l num compared to the analytical plume length l ana with respect to r which is observed to follow an exponential trend furthermore the percent reduction in l num owing to the recharge rates depends on r and m for m 4 m and r 1 mm day the reduction in l num compared to l ana is limited to approximately 17 it has been observed that the reduction percentage in the plume length owing to the recharge rates depends on the magnitude of the applied recharge and the aquifer thickness the ratio of the numerical plume length l num to the analytical plume length l ana l max which is without recharge decreases linearly with the recharge if r rises up to 1 mm day as shown in fig 5 inset although for smaller values of r the trend is linear for higher values of r the trend deviates from linearity i e if r is increased beyond a specific value depending on the value of aquifer thickness the trend becomes non linear see fig 5 3 2 hybrid model to predict l max with the recharge rate the hybrid models generally overcome the disadvantages which are associated with the development of analytical models e g assumptions such as uniform geometry or no external stresses the variation of l num with m and r up to 1 mm day is captured in fig 6 a each curve in this figure can be described by l num 1 c r l ana where c is the slope of the curve if the slope of the individual line is plotted against m the constant c in that case is a linear function of m see fig 6 b thus the following relation for l num can be obtained 7 l num 1 c m r l ana where c is the constant and is equal to 0 03998 m mm day 1 fig 7 explores the ratio of l num to l ana against m over a broader range of r for smaller values of recharge e g r 1 mm day a linearly decreasing trend is observed this trend is found to change at higher recharge r 1 mm day i e non linear trends are observed moreover the slope of the ratio l num l ana increases more rapidly with an increase in r this indicates that the linear relationship for l num eq 7 needs to be modified for higher r following the above results a modification of eq 7 with m and r raised to the power of two positive values a and b respectively has been hypothesized thus the eq 7 has been modified as 8 l hyb 1 c m a r b l ana where l hyb l denotes the steady state plume length with the influence of the recharge rate the slope of the curve for a constant value of the recharge as shown in fig 7 is smaller than the slope of the curve for a constant value of the aquifer thickness see fig 5 suggesting the exponent b to be larger than a based on the simulation results the matlab curve fitting toolbox has been used to fit the custom equation eq 8 that resulted in the best approximation as a 0 405 0 052 b 1 883 0 097 and c 0 047 0 005 with the root mean squared error rmse 0 043 m the low rmse and the error interval of parameter values indicate a good fit based on these results the following expression has been proposed for the estimation of plume length with the inclusion of recharge 9 l hyb 1 0 047 m 0 405 r 1 883 4 m 2 Ï 2 Î± tv ln 4 Ï Î³ c ed c ea c ea in eq 9 the term in the square brackets is the analytical solution without r for steady state plume length l ana provided in liedl et al 2005 the first term in the parentheses represents a correction factor vis a vis the plume length considering the influence of r as can be observed from the equation when r 0 l hyb l ana it is highly improbable that for a combination of m and r the second term in the bracket will equal to 1 resulting in l hyb 0 this case however represents the limitation of the model the correction factor derived empirically in the proposed model has been developed for the recharge r magnitude ranging between 0 mm day and 3 6 mm day from the literature works this range has been found to be very comprehensive also included in the correction factor is the source thickness m the most sensitive quantity of the base analytical model see liedl et al 2005 since m is also present in the base analytical model m 1 m to 4 m has only been considered for the correction factor development other quantities such as chemical reaction quantities have not been included in the correction factor as these are less sensitive quantities for the base analytical model see liedl et al 2005 the impact of these quantities is assumed to be reflected by the base analytical model in the proposed hybrid model the empirical correction factor has been proposed for the study as the trends were similar across the ranges of the aquifer thickness and the recharge rates in the absence of such trends a closed form correction factor may be difficult to propose such limitations may likely be possible for other analytical solutions and hence development along the similar lines may not be feasible for them the current study addresses the concept of hybrid model development with liedl et al 2005 including the influence of the recharge only the concept of the novel hybrid model is relevant as it helps in improving the applicability of the base analytical model i e liedl et al 2005 in this study the selection of the base analytical model is vital from the aspect of the added parameters being investigated for the influence on the steady state plume length as discussed in the previous sections liedl et al 2005 model have been chosen for the advantages it provides being the only vertical two dimensional model to the best of authors knowledge other two dimensional models with more complex structures including heterogeneity spatial and temporal variation of parameters and the sensitivity analysis and assumptions can be chosen for further development of similar hybrid models addressing the more complex issues like heterogeneity etc in the following section the performance of the proposed hybrid model has been evaluated by comparison with the field data 3 3 confirmation of the hybrid model with the field data the model for predicting the steady state plume lengths including the influence of the recharge rates is confirmed using limited field data for that the selective field data from afcee air force center for environmental excellence database wiedemeier et al 1999 and german federal ministry of education and research bmbf funded priority project retention and degradation processes to reduce contaminants in groundwater and soil abbreviated as kora have been used see table 2 the selected sites have different recharge attributes and are from various locations in the usa and germany the applicability of the proposed hybrid model results has been studied using data over a wide range with aquifer thickness ranging from 3 m to 12 m contaminant concentration ranging from 0 02 mg l to 29 mg l field plume length varying from 90 m to 500 m hence confirmation process included a broad spectrum of critical parameters this also ensures the applicability of the hybrid model columns 2 9 in table 2 enlist the various site parameters obtained from the literature transverse dispersivity in column 7 is not supplied in the dataset and has been assumed based on aquifer thickness and the electron donor value the table also enlists the calculated plume lengths from an analytical model provided by liedl et al 2005 in column 10 column 11 provides the recharge rate for the obtained site data column 12 provides the hybrid model results from eq 9 the relative error for each site has also been calculated where the relative error is defined as l model l field l field the mean relative error for liedl et al 2005 is 4 56 while the same for the developed hybrid model is 0 50 the hybrid model result l hyb has at least an order of magnitude lower mean relative error compared to the analytical model which is a significant improvement given that such models will aid as risk management tools minor overestimations can be ignored while the proposed hybrid model improves the estimation of the field l max significantly it is essential to consider its limitation and applicability foremost the proposed hybrid model adopts every limitation of the base analytical model i e liedl et al 2005 this includes the two dimensional homogeneous isotropic domain with only horizontal groundwater flow besides the reaction system in the domain is limited to an instantaneous bi molecular reaction that may only be suitable for rapidly reacting contaminants furthermore the role of the dispersivity which is among the most critical ranked second most critical in liedl et al 2005 has not been assessed in the current study the application table 2 also shows the usefulness of the model at a varying range of recharge rates while the recharge rates as high as 3 6 mm day may rather be unlikely in most field conditions but the effect on the groundwater flow hydraulics dispersion may be considerable at the substantially higher recharge rates the current study has not considered these factors the uncertainties arising from the assumptions of the base model and the role of quantities such as dispersivity have to be considered before applying the proposed hybrid model it can be argued that many of the limitations of the proposed hybrid model or the future development of similar hybrid models can be mitigated with a selection of a more appropriate base analytical model for example the stochastic approach from cirpka et al 2012 could provide an option to address the two dimensional heterogeneities and sources of uncertainty likewise works of de barros and nowak 2010 can be used for addressing the source geometry and inclusion of effective parameters similarly three dimensional analytical models e g liedl et al 2011 can be used to address dimensional limitations for the selection of the base analytical model it is crucial to identify the functions and assumptions of such models and how they adhere to the goal of the hybrid models furthermore while it may be possible to combine the results of any base analytical model and numerical model hypothesizing the hybrid model see eq 8 may not always be possible with the complexity of the base analytical model the interplay between model parameters may need to be more appropriately addressed in the current development the source thickness m see eq 9 is the only common quantity between the base analytical model and the numerically obtained factor the obtained results provide insights into the development of useful models to address complicated contaminated site management problems 4 conclusions the current study proposes an innovative approach for evaluating the steady state plume lengths with the inclusion of the influence of the recharge rates a two dimensional numerical model similar to the conceptual model from liedl et al 2005 has been set up with a homogeneous aquifer domain uniform flow field and instantaneous bi molecular reaction mechanism simulations have been run for different values of the recharge rates to determine the influence of the recharge rates on the steady state plume length besides the aquifer thickness has also been varied as it is the most critical parameter in the estimation of l max using liedl et al 2005 the results indicate that recharge rates shorten the steady state plume length and the change observed in plume length with respect to analytical solution depends upon the aquifer thickness and the magnitude of the recharge rate it has also been observed that the plume gets steeper on the application of the recharge the overall change in the plume length is not very high for smaller values of the recharge rates given that the uncertainty involved in the field parameters and the extension of the contaminant plume is limited to a few hundred meters but for the higher value of the recharge rates the change in the plume length is significantly higher based on the numerical results an empirical correction factor has been proposed for the estimation of l max the superimposition of the correction factor on the analytical solution given by liedl et al 2005 leads to a hybrid model for the prediction of the steady state plume lengths including the effect of the recharge if the aquifer thickness m the reaction stoichiometry c ed c ea Î³ the vertical transverse dispersivity Î± tv and the recharge rate r are known a more accurate estimation of the steady state plume lengths can be obtained the accuracy is stated to be higher in comparison to the analytical solution the developed relation has been confirmed with selective field data from kora and afcee sites database as discussed in section 3 3 the hybrid model has over an order of magnitude lower mean relative error compared to the analytical solution the applicability of the hybrid model is limited up to the recharge value of 3 6 mm day the study depicts how taking hydrogeological stresses into account improves the efficiency of the analytical models thus making them more relevant to evaluate the risks of the groundwater pollution categorize the contaminated sites and estimate the natural attenuation perspectives the proposed model can be used for pre assessment of the contaminated sites the numerical modeling can be additionally used for more complex scenarios additional effects of heterogeneity source geometry form factors regular vs irregular effective parameters complex hydraulics and three spatial dimensions need to be analyzed independently more complex and realistic scenarios e g non homogeneous aquifers partially penetrating contamination sources with the variation of critical factors e g transverse dispersivity along with the use of more sophisticated models may possibly improve the estimation of prediction and remain to be studied the availability of reliable data and specific parameters such as the transverse dispersivity which are difficult to measure in the field may also improve the applicability of such hybrid models as an outlook of future work the hybrid model could be extended for three dimensional analytical models with the source geometry and inclusion of the recharge and including factors such as the source geometry with the inclusion of the recharge and water abstraction factor author statement sandhya birla conceptualization data curation investigation

1468,a large number of potentially contaminated sites reported worldwide require cost and time effective assessment of the extent of contamination and the threats posed to the water resources a significant risk assessment metric for these sites can be the determination of the maximum i e steady state contaminant plume length l max analytical approaches in the literature provide an option for such an assessment but they include a certain degree of uncertainty often the causes of such uncertainties are the simplifications in the analytical models e g not considering the influence of hydrogeological stresses such as recharge which impact the plume development significantly this may lead to an over or underestimation of l max this work includes the influence of the recharge for the effective estimation of l max for that several two dimensional 2d numerical simulations have been performed by considering different aquifer thicknesses 1 m 4 m and recharge rates ranging from 0 to 3 6 mm day from the numerical results of this work it has been deduced that 1 the application of the recharge shortens l max and the recharge entering the aquifer top causes the plume to tilt 2 the reduction percentage in l max depends on the recharge rate applied and the aquifer thickness and 3 the reduction percentage varies in a non linear manner with respect to the recharge rate for a fixed aquifer thickness based on these results a hybrid analytical empirical solution has been developed for the estimation of l max with the inclusion of the recharge rate the proposed hybrid analytical empirical solution superimposes an empirically obtained correction factor onto an analytical solution although extensive confirmation steps of the developed model are required for including the effect of the recharge on aquifer hydraulics the proposed expression improves the estimation of the l max significantly the hybrid analytical empirical solution has also been confirmed with a selection of limited field contamination sites data the hybrid model result l hyb provides a significant improvement in the estimation i e an order of magnitude lower mean relative error compared to the analytical model keywords contaminant transport steady state plume length numerical modeling hybrid analytical empirical solution 1 introduction water stress is emerging as one of the major global issues schlosser et al 2014 stated that by the year 2050 52 of the population worldwide might be living under at least moderately stressed water resource conditions and one fifth of it might be living in regions with over exploited water resources worldwide 2 5 billion people are dependent on groundwater to fulfill their basic daily water needs wwap 2012 unlike the surface water resources which are accessible at limited locations only groundwater is easily available in many places hence it forms the largest share of the world s agriculture and drinking water supply additionally it is also a source of the base flow of surface water systems therefore deterioration in the quality of the groundwater may also affect the quality of the surface water which forms a significant source of supply as well the cumulative effect of groundwater contamination poses a serious threat to water resources associated ecosystems and drinking water security therefore there is a pressing need for studies concerning the assessment and remediation of the contaminated sites as per the eea 2014 approximately 14 of an estimated 2 5 million potentially contaminated sites in the european union eu are expected to be contaminated and in need of remediation while one third of these contaminated sites have been identified already only about 15 have been remediated so far eea 2014 given the immense size of the problem effective assessment and management techniques are required eea 2014 suggested that the cost of remediation could be over ten times the investigation cost 40 of the reported cases thus it is essential to gauge the magnitude of the problem in order to assess the required resources like workforce finances and time eea 2014 there have been numerous research works on contaminant transport and plume development over the decades bear 1979 and batu 1989 2005 discussed the development of analytical models for the estimation of natural attenuation zhang et al 2007 2008 conducted physical experiments to examine groundwater flow and contaminant spreading in the subsurface to support the development of mathematical models field studies by conant jr et al 2004 investigated the influence of contaminant plumes on local streams ponds and rivers also ham et al 2004 chu et al 2005 liedl et al 2005 2011 and cirpka et al 2006 proposed analytical solutions for estimating the steady state or maximum plume length l max based on several assumptions such as homogeneous two dimensional aquifer domain uniform flow and straightforward reaction mechanisms likewise maier and grathwohl 2006 developed an empirical method for calculating the l max through a large number of numerical simulations furthermore the architecture of a source zone was studied through non invasive imaging by werth et al 2010 de barros and nowak 2010 introduced the concept of effective source width and source efficiency and their importance in assessment of plume developemnt furthermore cirpka et al 2012 discussed the steady state reactive transport in two dimensional heterogeneous porous media to quatfy the sources of uncertainity in predicting contaminant plume lengths preliminary investigations using field exploration techniques and laboratory experiments are conventionally used for site management however considering a large number of potentially contaminated sites they may prove to be challenging as well as very expensive numerical models provide a better alternative over the field methods and they are widely prevalent however they too prove to be intractable due to the requirements of extensive data pertaining to the aquifer contaminants and technical expertise in such cases analytical solutions or empirical models can provide a satisfactory alternative to preliminary investigations given the availability of minimal data input required determining a reasonably good estimate of l max which mostly represents a worst case scenario can serve as an adequate measure for the pre assessment of a contaminant site as such analytical or empirical models can be advantageous for predicting l max with the input of very few parameters however the available models e g ham et al 2004 liedl et al 2005 2011 cirpka et al 2006 cirpka and valocchi 2007 maier and grathwohl 2006 often oversimplify the real site conditions thus quite often leading to a highly overestimated or underestimated value of l max therefore in the current state the available analytical solutions have limited field applicability owing to the complex scenarios at real sites a large number of contaminated sites huge costs involved in field investigation techniques and difficulties associated with the numerical models indicate the research gap in the development of analytical empirical models beyond the simplifying assumptions a few research works have tried to assess the performance of analytical solutions beyond the simplifying assumptions e g yadav et al 2013 investigated the impact of partially penetrating contamination sources on l max based on the scenarios presented in liedl et al 2005 2011 for several 2d and 3d cases other works e g yang et al 2012 and jeon et al 2013 suggested that hydrogeological stresses external stresses like seasonal hydrologic variations flood events groundwater abstraction irrigation or drainage precipitation and lake stage variation influence the contaminant transport yang et al 2012 found a strong correlation between the contaminant concentration levels in the groundwater with seasonal recharge and the fluctuations in groundwater levels the contaminant concentrations and the solute mass discharge through the source were also found to be closely associated with the seasonal recharge and the changes in the groundwater table levels jeon et al 2013 also found a close association between the groundwater levels and the levels of contaminant concentration indicating an increase in the concentration during the dry season this showed the likely impact of change in groundwater levels on the fate and transport of contaminants the long running residence time of contaminants e g napls in the subsurface also makes the external stresses a critical factor furthermore the extreme cases of external stresses such as floods droughts and pumping may impact the plume development significantly the direction and volume of contaminant flux respond to the changes in the groundwater levels originating from these external stresses the above discussion on the current state of steady state models and the influence of external stresses on l max identifies a shortcoming in the ability of analytical models for a proper assessment of the contaminated sites under the influence of external stresses the motivation behind this study is to investigate the influence of recharge rates on the steady state plume length by applying a numerical approach i e finite difference scheme and the development of a novel hybrid analytical empirical solution for the subsurface transport problems for this work a hybrid analytical empirical solution referred to as hybrid model hereafter is defined as one which is developed by the superimposition of analytical model and empirical model the innovative hybrid model is presented providing a relationship between l max and recharge rate with all the other assumptions still valid as stated in the analytical development of l max by liedl et al 2005 the proposed hybrid model is then evaluated against a set of selected field plume lengths as the focus of the work is on the development of a hybrid model the selection of the analytical model is still based on simple assumptions more precisely the base analytical model liedl et al 2005 provides a vertically oriented two dimensional model that may suit best for the application of a vertical recharge process the selection of a more robust base analytical models is an interesting direction of research and it will be treated in future work the work is organized in the following order first the conceptual geometry with the underlying hydro geophysical state is presented this is followed by introducing a numerical scheme that allows the use of a conservative model to simulate a reactive system in the second step the numerical results are presented the development of the hybrid model is presented in the third step which is followed by the evaluation of the proposed model as the final step 2 methodology 2 1 the conceptual model the domain for the numerical modeling see fig 1 has been set in a manner similar to the conceptual model proposed by liedl et al 2005 to the best of the authors knowledge the solution given by liedl et al 2005 is the only two dimensional analytical solution that considers a vertical aquifer cross section such a conceptual model provides a better representation of the supply of electron acceptor ea and the recharge entering the aquifer from the top boundary in comparison to several horizontal models moreover it solves the limitations associated with the previous works for instance a sharp front due to the entire consumption of the contaminant source electron donor or ed and ea in an instantaneous bi molecular reaction occurring at the fringe is recognized as a result finite plumes are developed a vertical cross section also allows an easier examination of the impact of recharge rates on the plume length in this study an aquifer contaminated with ed source e g dnapls with ea e g oxygen as a partner reactant has been considered see fig 1 the two dimensional model domain has been assumed to be a saturated homogeneous aquifer with a uniform horizontal flow field without application of the recharge a uniformly distributed contaminant ed with concentration c ed at the inflow boundary and ea with uniform concentration c ea at the aquifer top has been applied for the purpose of our study c ed 5 mg l and c ea 8 mg l have been considered as was the case in liedl et al 2005 the contaminant source fully penetrates the total thickness of the aquifer at the source inflow boundary i e the source thickness m s equals the aquifer thickness m a bi molecular instantaneous reaction with utilization factor the stoichiometric ratio for the instantaneous bimolecular reaction Î³ 3 5 involving ed and ea has been assumed ea is being supplied by a spatio temporal constant concentration boundary at the water table the parameters used in the numerical simulations are listed in table 1 the head values at the constant head boundaries have been chosen in order to establish the required hydraulic gradient of 0 01 which in turn has ensured the flow direction from left to right in the model domain the groundwater velocity and the darcy flux in the domain are 0 0864 m day and 0 34 m day respectively based on the parameters listed in table 1 following liedl et al 2005 and other similar works it has been assumed that the molecular diffusion has negligible influence in comparison to the mechanical dispersion the vertical transverse dispersivity has been taken as 0 05 m in the modeling and it has been kept constant for all the simulations similar to the earlier works yadav et al 2013 liedl et al 2011 2 2 a simplified transformation conservative modeling of reactive transport a simplified transformation which enables the simulation of an instantaneous bi molecular reaction using a conservative modeling approach has been used the approach for this transformation described in the works of acharya et al 2007 and yadav et al 2013 involves transforming the coupled transport equations of c ed and c ea into a single transport equation in terms of a new concentration parameter c here c Î³ c ed c ea represents the acceptor deficit apart from the bi molecular reaction rate represented by r the electron donor and acceptor concentrations are subjected to advection longitudinal dispersion vertical transverse dispersion and the molecular diffusion in a 2d domain x l in the horizontal direction and z l in the vertical direction for the transformation the ed transport equation eq 1 is first multiplied with Î³ which is the dimensionless utilization factor and then the resulting equation is subtracted from the ea transport equation eq 2 the transformation leads to the loss of the reaction terms appearing in eqs 1 and 2 consequently reactive transport is transformed into a conservative one eq 3 1 v c ed x Î± l v d ed 2 c e d x 2 Î± tv v d ed 2 c ed z 2 r 2 v c ea x Î± l v d ea 2 c ea x 2 Î± tv v d ea 2

simplified by dividing both sides of it by v this results in d v terms appearing on the left side of the equation following this the terms having d v can be ignored since mostly v d accordingly the following model equation eq 4 can be obtained 4 c x Î± l 2 c x 2 Î± tv 2 c z 2 0 liedl et al 2005 provided the following analytical solution for eq 4 with the given boundary conditions c 0 z Î³c ed c

ruling out the co existence of ed and ea in the model domain see fig 2 liedl et al 2005 model confirm that the longitudinal dispersivity has a negligible role in determining the steady state plume length the effect of the longitudinal dispersion was not considered in the simplified solution given by liedl et al 2005 as 6 l max 4 m 2 Ï 2 Î± tv ln 4 Ï Î³ c ed c ea c ea eq 6 is valid under the assumption that Ï2Î±l Î± tv m 2 1 thus the resulting positive concentrations c 0 see fig 2 refer to the contaminated region with concentration c ed c Î³ whereas negative concentrations c 0 represent the acceptor region with acceptor concentrations c ea c for the numerical modeling see the next sections in this work the transformed eq 4 has been used the numerical plume length without the recharge has been confirmed with the analytical solution once the model was confirmed the recharge quantity has been added to obtain the numerical plume length that also includes the effect of recharge the following section compares the numerical plume length by taking the recharge into account with the analytical plume length that does not include recharge for the 2d numerical simulation of the groundwater flow modflow2005 harbaugh 2005 has been used the contaminant transport in the groundwater aquifer has been modeled using the mt3d zheng 2010 the boundary conditions for the numerical domain have been set as follows i constant head boundaries at the left and the right end of the domain to create uniform horizontal flow ii no flow boundary along the impervious bottom of the domain iii a constant flux boundary at the top of the aquifer for the incoming recharge iv constant concentration boundary at the left end of the domain for the donor source and v a constant concentration boundary at the top and right end for the acceptor using Î³ 3 5 a typical value for aerobic degradation of btex taken from wiedemeier et al 1999 the concentrations are equivalent to transformed concentrations c Î³ c ed 3 5 5 17 5 mg l and c c ea 8 mg l the longitudinal extension of the numerical domain has been taken to be two times the plume length predicted by the analytical solution eq 5 the recharge is expected to shorten the plume length and hence domain length equal to two times the l max is sufficient to avoid numerical effects from the downgradient boundary the appropriate mesh size required for the numerical simulation is considered next for this several trials for determining the grid sizes have been simulated eventually the grid size has been selected with the optimum trade off between the accuracy and the computational time the results of trials for vertical grid size with the accuracy ratio of numerical plume length with analytical plume length i e l num l ana are shown in fig 3 the optimum grid size has been determined to be 0 5 m and 1 cm in x and z direction respectively which has been used for all the simulations the grid peclet number was 0 1 well within the range thus satisfying the numerical stability criterion furthermore simulations have been carried out to quantify the influence of the longitudinal dispersivity on l max as can also be observed in fig 3 there is an insignificant difference in plume length with a change in the longitudinal dispersivity from 0 25 m to 1 m but because for the lower longitudinal dispersivity values peclet number was higher showing some artificial oscillations hence the longitudinal dispersivity of 1 m was used for all the simulations several research works e g liedl et al 2005 ham et al 2004 cirpka et al 2006 presented a similar conclusion consequently the longitudinal dispersivity has been kept constant at 1 m for all the simulations in this work 2 3 variation of model parameters various studies e g liedl et al 2005 2011 engelmann et al 2019 considered the source geometry as a factor that has a significant influence on l max also it can be observed in eq 5 that the aquifer thickness equal to the source thickness is the most influential parameter in determining l max it is to be noted that the source geometry here source thickness in this work is equivalent to aquifer thickness see fig 1 also see liedl et al 2005 hence although the purpose of this work is to identify the influence of recharge rates on l max the variation in aquifer thickness has also been considered in the numerical simulations for over 200 simulations the aquifer thickness and the recharge rate have been varied from 1 m to 4 m and 0 mm day to 3 6 mm day respectively the used recharge parameter range encompasses a purely analytical solution for r 0 mm day and at the same time 3 6 mm day which is over 1300 mm year and higher than the average yearly precipitation of the world as well as in many countries the range of recharge is found to be quite comprehensive very well encompassing the extremes c ed c ea and Î± tv have been kept constant for all the simulations in this study the effect of these quantities has been captured by the analytical solution the inferences drawn on the basis of numerical and analytical results are presented in the following sections 3 results 3 1 steady state plume length under the influence of recharge rates the base model results have been considered well confirmed as without the application of recharge the numerical plume lengths provided a close match up to 95 accurate to analytical plume lengths once confirmed the simulations have been performed with the application of recharge the results have suggested the downward diversion and decreased longitudinal extension of the plumes on the application of the recharge see fig 4 a the recharge entering the aquifer causes the plume to have steeper gradients and thus shorter plume lengths results the results could also be attributed to the downward component of the flow velocity and the increased incoming electron acceptor with non contaminated water with more recharge more electron acceptor enters the domain consuming the contaminant faster fig 4 a shows that the plume length has a negative correlation with the recharge rate for a given aquifer thickness m also the larger the m the higher the relative decrease observed in the numerical plume length for the same recharge rate r next comparisons are drawn from liedl et al 2005 in order to observe the deviations in the numerical plume length while taking the recharge into account fig 4 b shows the variation in the percentage decrease in the numerical plume length l num compared to the analytical plume length l ana with respect to r which is observed to follow an exponential trend furthermore the percent reduction in l num owing to the recharge rates depends on r and m for m 4 m and r 1 mm day the reduction in l num compared to l ana is limited to approximately 17 it has been observed that the reduction percentage in the plume length owing to the recharge rates depends on the magnitude of the applied recharge and the aquifer thickness the ratio of the numerical plume length l num to the analytical plume length l ana l max which is without recharge decreases linearly with the recharge if r rises up to 1 mm day as shown in fig 5 inset although for smaller values of r the trend is linear for higher values of r the trend deviates from linearity i e if r is increased beyond a specific value depending on the value of aquifer thickness the trend becomes non linear see fig 5 3 2 hybrid model to predict l max with the recharge rate the hybrid models generally overcome the disadvantages which are associated with the development of analytical models e g assumptions such as uniform geometry or no external stresses the variation of l num with m and r up to 1 mm day is captured in fig 6 a each curve in this figure can be described by l num 1 c r l ana where c is the slope of the curve if the slope of the individual line is plotted against m the constant c in that case is a linear function of m see fig 6 b thus the following relation for l num can be obtained 7 l num 1 c m r l ana where c is the constant and is equal to 0 03998 m mm day 1 fig 7 explores the ratio of l num to l ana against m over a broader range of r for smaller values of recharge e g r 1 mm day a linearly decreasing trend is observed this trend is found to change at higher recharge r 1 mm day i e non linear trends are observed moreover the slope of the ratio l num l ana increases more rapidly with an increase in r this indicates that the linear relationship for l num eq 7 needs to be modified for higher r following the above results a modification of eq 7 with m and r raised to the power of two positive values a and b respectively has been hypothesized thus the eq 7 has been modified as 8 l hyb 1 c m a r b l ana where l hyb l denotes the steady state plume length with the influence of the recharge rate the slope of the curve for a constant value of the recharge as shown in fig 7 is smaller than the slope of the curve for a constant value of the aquifer thickness see fig 5 suggesting the exponent b to be larger than a based on the simulation results the matlab curve fitting toolbox has been used to fit the custom equation eq 8 that resulted in the best approximation as a 0 405 0 052 b 1 883 0 097 and c 0 047 0 005 with the root mean squared error rmse 0 043 m the low rmse and the error interval of parameter values indicate a good fit based on these results the following expression has been proposed for the estimation of plume length with the inclusion of recharge 9 l hyb 1 0 047 m 0 405 r 1 883 4 m 2 Ï 2 Î± tv ln 4 Ï Î³ c ed c ea c ea in eq 9 the term in the square brackets is the analytical solution without r for steady state plume length l ana provided in liedl et al 2005 the first term in the parentheses represents a correction factor vis a vis the plume length considering the influence of r as can be observed from the equation when r 0 l hyb l ana it is highly improbable that for a combination of m and r the second term in the bracket will equal to 1 resulting in l hyb 0 this case however represents the limitation of the model the correction factor derived empirically in the proposed model has been developed for the recharge r magnitude ranging between 0 mm day and 3 6 mm day from the literature works this range has been found to be very comprehensive also included in the correction factor is the source thickness m the most sensitive quantity of the base analytical model see liedl et al 2005 since m is also present in the base analytical model m 1 m to 4 m has only been considered for the correction factor development other quantities such as chemical reaction quantities have not been included in the correction factor as these are less sensitive quantities for the base analytical model see liedl et al 2005 the impact of these quantities is assumed to be reflected by the base analytical model in the proposed hybrid model the empirical correction factor has been proposed for the study as the trends were similar across the ranges of the aquifer thickness and the recharge rates in the absence of such trends a closed form correction factor may be difficult to propose such limitations may likely be possible for other analytical solutions and hence development along the similar lines may not be feasible for them the current study addresses the concept of hybrid model development with liedl et al 2005 including the influence of the recharge only the concept of the novel hybrid model is relevant as it helps in improving the applicability of the base analytical model i e liedl et al 2005 in this study the selection of the base analytical model is vital from the aspect of the added parameters being investigated for the influence on the steady state plume length as discussed in the previous sections liedl et al 2005 model have been chosen for the advantages it provides being the only vertical two dimensional model to the best of authors knowledge other two dimensional models with more complex structures including heterogeneity spatial and temporal variation of parameters and the sensitivity analysis and assumptions can be chosen for further development of similar hybrid models addressing the more complex issues like heterogeneity etc in the following section the performance of the proposed hybrid model has been evaluated by comparison with the field data 3 3 confirmation of the hybrid model with the field data the model for predicting the steady state plume lengths including the influence of the recharge rates is confirmed using limited field data for that the selective field data from afcee air force center for environmental excellence database wiedemeier et al 1999 and german federal ministry of education and research bmbf funded priority project retention and degradation processes to reduce contaminants in groundwater and soil abbreviated as kora have been used see table 2 the selected sites have different recharge attributes and are from various locations in the usa and germany the applicability of the proposed hybrid model results has been studied using data over a wide range with aquifer thickness ranging from 3 m to 12 m contaminant concentration ranging from 0 02 mg l to 29 mg l field plume length varying from 90 m to 500 m hence confirmation process included a broad spectrum of critical parameters this also ensures the applicability of the hybrid model columns 2 9 in table 2 enlist the various site parameters obtained from the literature transverse dispersivity in column 7 is not supplied in the dataset and has been assumed based on aquifer thickness and the electron donor value the table also enlists the calculated plume lengths from an analytical model provided by liedl et al 2005 in column 10 column 11 provides the recharge rate for the obtained site data column 12 provides the hybrid model results from eq 9 the relative error for each site has also been calculated where the relative error is defined as l model l field l field the mean relative error for liedl et al 2005 is 4 56 while the same for the developed hybrid model is 0 50 the hybrid model result l hyb has at least an order of magnitude lower mean relative error compared to the analytical model which is a significant improvement given that such models will aid as risk management tools minor overestimations can be ignored while the proposed hybrid model improves the estimation of the field l max significantly it is essential to consider its limitation and applicability foremost the proposed hybrid model adopts every limitation of the base analytical model i e liedl et al 2005 this includes the two dimensional homogeneous isotropic domain with only horizontal groundwater flow besides the reaction system in the domain is limited to an instantaneous bi molecular reaction that may only be suitable for rapidly reacting contaminants furthermore the role of the dispersivity which is among the most critical ranked second most critical in liedl et al 2005 has not been assessed in the current study the application table 2 also shows the usefulness of the model at a varying range of recharge rates while the recharge rates as high as 3 6 mm day may rather be unlikely in most field conditions but the effect on the groundwater flow hydraulics dispersion may be considerable at the substantially higher recharge rates the current study has not considered these factors the uncertainties arising from the assumptions of the base model and the role of quantities such as dispersivity have to be considered before applying the proposed hybrid model it can be argued that many of the limitations of the proposed hybrid model or the future development of similar hybrid models can be mitigated with a selection of a more appropriate base analytical model for example the stochastic approach from cirpka et al 2012 could provide an option to address the two dimensional heterogeneities and sources of uncertainty likewise works of de barros and nowak 2010 can be used for addressing the source geometry and inclusion of effective parameters similarly three dimensional analytical models e g liedl et al 2011 can be used to address dimensional limitations for the selection of the base analytical model it is crucial to identify the functions and assumptions of such models and how they adhere to the goal of the hybrid models furthermore while it may be possible to combine the results of any base analytical model and numerical model hypothesizing the hybrid model see eq 8 may not always be possible with the complexity of the base analytical model the interplay between model parameters may need to be more appropriately addressed in the current development the source thickness m see eq 9 is the only common quantity between the base analytical model and the numerically obtained factor the obtained results provide insights into the development of useful models to address complicated contaminated site management problems 4 conclusions the current study proposes an innovative approach for evaluating the steady state plume lengths with the inclusion of the influence of the recharge rates a two dimensional numerical model similar to the conceptual model from liedl et al 2005 has been set up with a homogeneous aquifer domain uniform flow field and instantaneous bi molecular reaction mechanism simulations have been run for different values of the recharge rates to determine the influence of the recharge rates on the steady state plume length besides the aquifer thickness has also been varied as it is the most critical parameter in the estimation of l max using liedl et al 2005 the results indicate that recharge rates shorten the steady state plume length and the change observed in plume length with respect to analytical solution depends upon the aquifer thickness and the magnitude of the recharge rate it has also been observed that the plume gets steeper on the application of the recharge the overall change in the plume length is not very high for smaller values of the recharge rates given that the uncertainty involved in the field parameters and the extension of the contaminant plume is limited to a few hundred meters but for the higher value of the recharge rates the change in the plume length is significantly higher based on the numerical results an empirical correction factor has been proposed for the estimation of l max the superimposition of the correction factor on the analytical solution given by liedl et al 2005 leads to a hybrid model for the prediction of the steady state plume lengths including the effect of the recharge if the aquifer thickness m the reaction stoichiometry c ed c ea Î³ the vertical transverse dispersivity Î± tv and the recharge rate r are known a more accurate estimation of the steady state plume lengths can be obtained the accuracy is stated to be higher in comparison to the analytical solution the developed relation has been confirmed with selective field data from kora and afcee sites database as discussed in section 3 3 the hybrid model has over an order of magnitude lower mean relative error compared to the analytical solution the applicability of the hybrid model is limited up to the recharge value of 3 6 mm day the study depicts how taking hydrogeological stresses into account improves the efficiency of the analytical models thus making them more relevant to evaluate the risks of the groundwater pollution categorize the contaminated sites and estimate the natural attenuation perspectives the proposed model can be used for pre assessment of the contaminated sites the numerical modeling can be additionally used for more complex scenarios additional effects of heterogeneity source geometry form factors regular vs irregular effective parameters complex hydraulics and three spatial dimensions need to be analyzed independently more complex and realistic scenarios e g non homogeneous aquifers partially penetrating contamination sources with the variation of critical factors e g transverse dispersivity along with the use of more sophisticated models may possibly improve the estimation of prediction and remain to be studied the availability of reliable data and specific parameters such as the transverse dispersivity which are difficult to measure in the field may also improve the applicability of such hybrid models as an outlook of future work the hybrid model could be extended for three dimensional analytical models with the source geometry and inclusion of the recharge and including factors such as the source geometry with the inclusion of the recharge and water abstraction factor author statement sandhya birla conceptualization data curation investigation

1469,a practical approach for in situ hydrous ferric oxide hfo precipitation was developed for iodine immobilization under field scale conditions at the hanford site a series of 1d meter long bench top column experiments packed with hanford sediments was conducted with a single acidic ferric solution 0 1 m ph 1 5 injection because carbonate and clay minerals are widely present in sediments self ph buffering of the injected acidic ferric solution occurred due to mineral dissolution leading to hfo precipitation under a neutral condition up to 12 mg g fe as hfo successfully precipitated and evenly distributed in the column sediments and the remobilization of the neoformed hfo precipitates was limited 3 16 wt after over 100 pore volumes pv of flushing the transport of iodate io3 in the hfo amended sediments was strongly retarded through both adsorption and co precipitation processes however reversible adsorption of iodine on hfo was observed which might limit its application to slow moving groundwater systems keywords hfo in situ precipitation iodate sorption co precipitation leaching 1 introduction radionuclides and metals can be an environmental concern in soil and groundwater due to recalcitrance toxicity and mobility in the environment whereas traditional pump and treat approaches can be costly and produce high concentration wastes ex situ in situ remediation approaches can be advantageous because they can limit site disruption lower costs and secondary waste generation reduce worker exposure and treat at depth or under obstructed sites doe 1994 although nanoparticle injections for in situ remediation can be prepared above ground using particle stabilizing techniques that prevent particle aggregation and improve soil deliverability without losing reactivity liu et al 2015 reactive materials can also be formed in situ martin and kempton 2000 xie et al 2015 in situ technologies have the potential to provide treatment with minimal long term operational requirements and to stabilize contaminants that may slowly diffuse out of low permeability zones after active pump and treat applications have ceased fe oxides and hydroxides hereafter referred to as fe oxides are good sorbents of anionic species due to the high point of zero charge harrison and berkheiser 1982 schwertmann and taylor 1977 jain et al 1999 kosmulski 2009 li and kaplan 2012 past studies have demonstrated high extent of iodine adsorption on fe oxides especially on hfo ferrihydrite whitehead 1974 neal and truesdale 1976 machesky et al 1989 nagata and fukushi 2010 wang et al 2019 hfo is cost effective non hazardous and exhibits a large surface area and high adsorptive capacity making it a promising material for the remediation of subsurface iodine fe oxide formation for contaminant remediation has been demonstrated in several laboratory studies by alternating injections of ferrous fe and oxidant solutions or aerated water into an aquifer where fe ii will be oxidized to fe iii and directly precipitated as fe oxides in the sediment matrix doe 1994 martin and kempton 2000 roberts et al 2004 stollenwerk et al 2008 hu 2010 xie et al 2015 due to the large surface area of the fe oxide particles concentrations of the target contaminants in groundwater will be reduced by increased adsorption and co precipitation martin and kempton 2000 demonstrated this approach in the laboratory by injecting ferrous sulfate and oxygen solution into a sand packed column retarding the transport of chromium and arsenic hu 2010 and abia 2011 also demonstrated arsenic removal with fe oxide coatings on sand grains the procedure involved sequential injection of acidified fe ii solution deoxygenated water and oxidant alkalinity supply mixture into sand packed columns the advective diffusive transport of the two reagents in porous media created a reaction zone where fe ii was oxidized and precipitated as fe oxides on the surfaces of the sand grain the injection of the deoxygenated water provided a buffer zone to avoid clogging due to the rapid precipitation of fe oxides formed upon direct contact between the two chemical reagents at the field scale sheffer et al 2010 reported a pilot study to assess an in situ arsenic remediation treatment by injecting an acidified hydrated ferrous chloride hcl and fecl2 4h2o solution ph of 3 5 into an essentially oxygen saturated aquifer to create a filter zone around the injection well and the results showed a 50 reduction in arsenic concentration an hfo chemical barrier was created for uranium remediation doe 1994 in situ injection approaches can be costly involving two to three chemical reagents with multiple injection procedures thereby limiting the practical application of this technology in addition the oxidation of fe ii to fe oxides has to be carefully controlled through a water buffer zone to avoid immediate precipitation at the injection inlets where clogging might occur stollenwerk et al 2008 sheffer et al 2010 although the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii has been observed at ph levels of 4 10 cornell and schwertmann 2003 the oxidation of fe ii to fe oxides also produces protons thereby lowering the solution ph alba ii 2011 many metals or radionuclides are redox active and so the aqueous solubility depends on the chemical oxidation states injection of oxidants can favor the immobilization of some contaminants but increase the mobility of other co located contaminants such as cr se u and tc which have lower solubility in their reduced species therefore a new approach to in situ fe oxides formation is needed to simplify the injection and eliminate oxidant input although numerous studies have documented an in situ approach for arsenic chromium and uranium immobilization to the authors knowledge no in situ approach has been applied to iodine immobilization the goal of this study is to identify a practical approach for in situ hfo precipitation for iodine immobilization under field scale conditions at the hanford site located in southeastern washington state instead of fe ii and oxidant solutions single injection of acidic fe no3 3 solution was first tested in bench scale column experiments for hfo precipitation since carbonate and clay minerals are widely present in sediments self ph buffering of the injected acidic fe iii solution will occur due to mineral dissolution leading to hfo precipitation under neutral ph conditions this hypothesis is supported by the observed ph neutralization and zonation that occurred at hanford site resulting from historical acidic and alkaline subsurface waste discharges wan et al 2004 szecsody et al 2013 deutsch and pavish 2013 wang et al 2017 this paper presents the results of column experiments that evaluated a new hfo solution injection for iodine immobilization under different conditions these 1d 1 to 3 m long column experiments were carried out using hanford sediments and artificial groundwater agw that mimicked the geochemical signature of hanford groundwater hfo precipitation was tested under different flow rates io3 was injected into the hfo laden sediment column to capture it within the sediments through adsorption or was injected together with the hfo forming solution acidic fe iii into the iodine laden sediment column to test the iodine hfo co precipitation effects effluent ph and cations were monitored for elevated concentrations of ca al si and sr which were expected to increase due to mineral dissolution szecsody et al 2013 and thereby impact iodine adsorption and co precipitation due to the elevated ionic strength the precipitated fe content in the hfo laden sediments was determined using acid extraction techniques and the mineralogy phases were analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds leaching was also performed to determine the neoformed hfo stability in the sediments and to test the long term retention capacity of the adsorbed and co precipitated iodine in fe oxide within the sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 hanford fine sand hfs hanford fine sand hfs collected at a near surface burial ground excavation at 218 e 12b was used in these column experiments hfs is composed of the silty sand facies from the hanford formation in the hanford 200 area and contains 0 23 wt gravel 72 61 wt sand and 27 16 wt silt and clay serne et al 2008 the sediments were sieved to remove the size fraction greater than 2 mm prior to experiments the hfs is typical of hanford formation sediments and contains quartz k na feldspar and smectite along with illite and chlorite as the dominant mineral phases with a low calcium carbonate content 1 75 wt as identified by mineralogical analysis in serne et al 2008 2 1 2 preparation of acidic ferric solution and io3 solution ferric nitrate fe no3 3 9 h2o 99 sigma aldrich was used as the fe iii source for ferric solution preparation briefly 80 089 g of fe no3 3 9 h2o was dissolved into 1 l of agw ph 7 9 at room temperature resulting in a brown colored acidic 0 1 m fe iii solution with a ph value of 1 5 sodium iodate 99 acros organics corp was dissolved into agw to make an io3 solution for the adsorption co precipitation experiments the concentration of the prepared io3 solution was of 100 Î¼g l based on certain iodine plume conditions in the field truex et al 2015 in addition one io3 solution 100 Î¼g l was prepared in the 0 1 m fe iii solution matrix to test the io3 co precipitation with the produced fe oxides the agw recipe is listed in the supporting information table s1 2 2 in situ hfo precipitation hfo in situ precipitation experiments were conducted in four 1d columns packed with hfs sediments including two glass columns of 1 cm id 100 cm length and two pvc columns of 1 5 cm id 300 cm length the glass column enables visible observation of the in situ hfo precipitation as well as its distribution within the columns the two glass columns were also used for io3 remediation experiments in a reasonable laboratory experimental time scale the injecting amendment at a field scale length was accomplished by evaluating the spatial distribution of hfo precipitation in the two 3 m scale pvc columns briefly 823 861 g and 118 119 g of hfs was dry packed into the 3 m pvc named as 3mp and 1 m glass named as 1mg columns leading to a porosity of 0 41 0 42 and 0 30 0 32 respectively a narrow range of solid to solution ratio of 3 8 5 1 was achieved in all the tested columns the four packed columns were saturated through pumping agw into the columns where the column porosity was determined based on the pumped agw mass balance after column saturation the prepared 0 1 m acidic fe iii solution was pumped into the columns at a controlled flow rate using a syringe pump for the in situ hfo precipitation for the two 3mp columns a constant average linear flow velocity of 2 0 or 21 4 m day corresponding to a solution residence time of 35 5 and 3 4 h respectively was applied to mimic a single well injection time scale to a 10 to 15 m radius for the two 1mg columns a single constant average linear flow velocity of 3 1 3 3 m day leading to a solution residence time of 7 3 7 6 h was used for the ferric solution delivery the effluent ph was monitored during the entire reaction process by an accumet ph meter the injection was stopped when the effluent solution color turned brown where an effluent solution ph of 4 0 was normally observed after the 0 1 m fe iii injection each column except 1mg 2 column was flushed with agw under the same flow velocity as used for ferric solution injection to test the stability of the in situ precipitated hfo in the column sediments through a fe mass balance calculation effluent samples were collected and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes for fe ca si sr and al concentrations all the column experimental setup and flow conditions are listed in table 1 2 3 iodine immobilization and leaching the io3 transport and immobilization experiments were conducted with the two glass columns described above the performance of the in situ precipitated hfo for io3 immobilization in this study was evaluated under two scenarios 1 injecting io3 spiked acidic ferric solution into io3 contaminated sediments column 1mg 2 in table 1 to mimic a remediation scenario within the iodine plumes source term in the subsurface and 2 injecting io3 solution into the hfo laden sediments column 1mg 1 in table 1 where the newly precipitated hfo served as a permeable reactive barrier prb because natural and anthropogenic iodine 127 as io3 and iodide i in the hfs sediments is present as aqueous adsorbed and one or more precipitate phases including fe oxides and calcite the performance of the hfo precipitated sediments was also tested against untreated sediments to evaluate source area remediation of io3 in aqueous solution and in precipitates three 1d column injection experimental steps were conducted a pre equilibration of the sediment b injection of aqueous io3 into untreated sediment and c simultaneous injection of aqueous io3 and the ph 1 5 ferric iron solution into sediment briefly for the pre equilibration step agw was injected at an average liner velocity of 3 1 m day table 1 into the untreated sediment packed in the column 1mg 2 and the effluent io3 concentrations were monitored the agw injection including a 72 h stop flow event was not stopped until the effluent iodine concentration showing a tailing phase after that an io3 solution of 100 Î¼g l was injected into the column at an average linear velocity of 7 7 m day to evaluate io3 behavior in this pre equilibrated untreated sediment this injection step was designed for two purposes 1 determine the io3 transport behavior in the untreated sediments to compare with the io3 transport in the hfo laden sediments and 2 generate an io3 contaminated source zone relevant to field conditions the injection of the 100 Î¼g l io3 solution at this step also including an 84 h stop flow event was not stopped until the io3 concentration of 100 Î¼g l in the effluent solution was observed finally the injection of a 100 Î¼g l io3 spiked 0 1 m fe iii solution at an average liner velocity of 3 1 m day was conducted for the hfo io3 co precipitation this step injection was stopped after the effluent solution color turned brown to test the prb scenario an io3 solution of 100 Î¼g l in agw was injected at a constant average linear velocity of 8 3 m day into the 1mg 1 column after the acidic ferric solution injection for hfo precipitation and the followed agw flushing this extended agw flushing 45 5 pv before the io3 injection enabled the elimination of any potential hfo colloid particle facilitated io3 transport for both the source term and prb columns after the io3 uptake procedures leaching was immediately performed using neutral agw to evaluate the long term retention capacity of the adsorbed and co precipitated iodine in hfo within the sediments the leaching used the same flow velocity as for the io3 uptake process and extended to more than 100 pv the iodine concentrations in the effluent samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms all iodine column experimental conditions applied in this study are listed in table 1 2 4 solid characterization 2 4 1 fe and io3 extraction after the entire column experimental procedures the fe contents mg g in the treated sediments collected at five column locations for each column was determined using 8 m hno3 acid extraction demirkanli et al 2018 detailed sample location is presented in table s2 the in situ precipitated fe content was calculated by subtracting the extracted fe in the untreated hfs samples from that of each hfo amended sample briefly triplicate extraction vials containing 2 g of air dried solid sample plus 6 ml 8 m hno3 solution was cooked for 3 h at 95 c in a heating box after cooling to room temperature the supernatant was passed a 0 45 Î¼m filter and analyzed for fe concentrations using icp oes the solution volume was determined by reactor mass balance combined with the solution density measurement and the final extracted fe mass was calculated in addition to extraction using 8 m hno3 extractions with 0 5 m hcl or 1 m cacl2 in an anaerobic chamber were also conducted for the exchangeable fe ii contents demirkanli et al 2018 fe ii concentration in the extracted solution was determined using hach 8147 method by reaction with ferrozine in addition to fe iodine concentrations in the treated and untreated sediment samples were extracted by the koh kno3 fusion method geiszler 2016 for mass balance calculation to identify the final immobilized iodine percentage after the experiments the immobilized io3 percentage was calculated as io3 extracted from the reacted sediments io3 extracted from the untreated sediments the total injected io3 100 the detailed calculation terms are listed in table 2 2 4 2 xrd and sem eds characterization powder xrd was used to identify the precipitated fe oxide mineral phases as well as any potential mineral changes in the sediments before and after the treatment with the acidic ferric solution selected treated sediment samples were also characterized using sem coupled with eds to identify crystal geomorphology and to look for relatively high fe content domains in the treated sediments which may reflect the hfo precipitation detailed characterization methods for xrd and sem eds are provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ hfo precipitation 3 1 1 aqueous measurements during ferric fe injection and hfo precipitation the in situ hfo precipitation was identified in the two transparent glass columns through visibly significant color changes in the packed sediment where the grayish hfs sediment matrix turned brown indicating the precipitation of hfo fig s1 as expected self ph buffering of the injected acidic ferric solution occurred leading to nearly 100 of the injected fe precipitating out of the solution in the column fig 1 fig 1 a clearly illustrates that the injected acidic solution ph 1 5 was immediately buffered to above ph 6 ph 5 5 in 3mp 2 column after the first pore volume effluent ph 7 9 the relatively higher ph from the first pore volume resulted from the agw column saturation injection before the acidic ferric solution fe signals in all the column effluents were near or under the icp oes detection limit 41 1 Î¼g l indicating the fe precipitation in the columns under neutralized ph conditions in all the columns the effluent solution turned brown in color after about 6 5 8 5 pv accompanied by a dramatic decrease of effluent ph to 4 and an increase of fe concentrations this indicated that the injected acidic ferric solution overwhelmed the hfs acid neutralization capacity and the injection ceased the ph self buffering of the injected ferric solution in the columns mainly resulted from calcite carbonate dissolution fig 2 shows the measured concentrations of ca si sr and al in the effluents during the acidic ferric solution injection as expected carbonate dissolution in hfs sediments was rapid where the ca concentration in all tested columns was dramatically increased to 120 mmol l after the first pore volume and a concentration plateau was maintained during the entire ferric solution injection process the elevated ca concentration and the constant concentration plateau indicated a dominant carbonate dissolution process because the cation exchangeable ca is much smaller for hanford sediments szecsody et al 2013 the carbonate dissolution was also indicated by the continuous gas bubbles observed in the effluents this is because the carbonate concentrations were well above aqueous carbonate solubility which resulted in most carbonate outgassing as co2 gas in contrast the limited increases of si and al concentrations in the effluent fig 2 suggests limited dissolution of clay minerals in the sediment 3 1 2 ferric iron precipitates in sediments by fe extraction the in situ precipitated hfo mass in the columns was quantified by the total ferric iron extracted with 8 m hno3 minus the background ferric iron determined in the untreated sediments fig 3 shows the fe contents extracted from the treated samples and compared with the values from the untreated hfs indicating a relative constant value 10 12 mg g of the maximum precipitated fe concentration determined among all the tested columns despite the differences in the column lengths 1 or 3 m and the ferric solution injection rates 2 0 21 4 m day in the 1 m glass columns fig 3a the precipitated hfo was nearly evenly distributed within the entire columns with the precipitated fe contents of 5 3 10 6 mg g for the two 3 m pvc columns fig 3b higher hfo precipitation occurred in the middle of the columns 6 94 12 02 mg g at 72 5 232 5 cm with less mass 3 98 4 63 mg g and limited mass 0 40 0 85 mg g precipitated at the column inlet 0 10 cm or outlet areas 290 300 cm respectively column 3mp 2 demonstrated an increasing trend in hfo precipitation along the direction of flow this might be due to the high injection velocity 21 4 m day applied on this column the resulting residence time 3 4 h may hinder local ph buffering under a relative high flow through velocity the sediments near the column inlet had the potential for more mineral dissolution due to the continuous flow of the low ph solution therefore hfo precipitation occurred farther from the inlet where solution ph was near neutralized in addition to the total fe extraction fe ii extraction using 0 5 m hcl was also conducted on the reacted sediments collected from columns 3mp 1 3mp 2 and 1mg 1 at the same locations described above the detailed extraction results are presented in fig s2 with extracted fe ii values of 0 49 0 77 mg g as expected no significant fe ii difference between the untreated and column treated sediments was observed and the extracted fe ii contents were nearly constant among the samples collected at different column locations these results indicated that no significant fe ii containing minerals in the sediments were dissolved which had no impact on iodine transport these results were further confirmed by the 1 m cacl2 extraction where no significant ion exchangeable fe ii was observed data not shown 3 1 3 xrd and sem eds analysis no hfo phases could be identified in the xrd analysis fig 4 this is because of the poor crystalline phase of hfo combined with the low concentrations of the resulted hfo precipitates in the treated sediment 10 mg g i e 1 wt which is lower than the xrd detection limit 5 10 wt for hfo meanwhile the xrd pattern also did not show any other fe oxides goethite magnetite hematite lepidocrocite or akageneite which requires much less concentration contents in the samples due to the well crystalized features although not identified in the xrd analysis the formation of hfo is evidenced by the color changes of the packed sediments after the column treatment see section 3 1 1 considering the common laboratory synthetic route method for hfo which is through hydrolysis of acid fe iii solutions by raising the solution ph to ca neutral with alkali schwertmann and cornell 1991 the hfo precipitation herein was much likely where the injected acidic fe iii solution neutralized through the ph self buffering process which is analogous to the route hfo synthesis pathway the chemical composition analysis through sem eds provided strong evidence for hfo precipitation fig 4 fig 4 shows that 49 59 at and 4 5 at fe was detected on the more bright and grey areas respectively it probably indicates the respective sediments surfaces with or without fe coating suggesting that the nanometer sized hfo heterogeneously precipitated on a mineral grain in the reacted sediments although further characterization of the bright coating is needed in the future adsorption of the injected fe iii on the sediment surface was not likely to occur here under the system self buffered neutral ph conditions fig 1 because fe iii precipitates out of solutions at ph 4 stefaÃ¤nsson 2007 the dissolution of calcium carbonate in this study was further supported by the xrd analysis fig 4 compares the collected xrd patterns between the untreated and the treated sediments collected from column 1mg 1 the comparison illustrated the disappearance of calcite indicated by the strongest calcite peak at 29 4 2Î¸ after the column reaction process no significant changes in other minerals were observed this is consistent with the si and al signals presented in fig 2 where very limited si with initial dissolution up to 1 5 mmol l and almost no detectable al were observed in the effluent solutions 3 1 4 long term stability of precipitated ferric oxide after hfo in situ precipitation the stability of the precipitated hfo was tested through the extended agw leaching up to 135 pv the flow velocity for the agw leaching was the same as the velocity used for ferric solution injection on each column 2 0 21 4 m day fig 5 shows that very limited fe was detected in the flushing effluent except for the first two pore volumes which mainly resulted from the remaining ferric solution in the pores after the injection stopped the fe mass balance calculation indicated that only 1 62 wt and 3 16 wt of the injected fe was leached out of the columns 1mg 1 and 1mg 2 after 45 and 135 pv of agw flushing respectively 3 2 io3 immobilization using in situ precipitated hfo 3 2 1 io3 source area remediation evaluation to evaluate source area remediation of io3 in aqueous solution and in precipitates as described in section 2 3 three 1d column injection steps were conducted for the pre equilibration step 12 pv of agw was injected into the untreated sediment fig 6 a shows that the effluent io3 concentrations were initially very high 2000 Î¼g l and decreased to 5 Î¼g l by 11 5 pv indicating high natural and anthropogenic iodine 127 in the sediments the fast iodine release might result from the injection water being a different ph relative to the sediment however the iodine concentration rebound after the 72 h stop flow event and the later tailing phase also indicated slow desorption or dissolution kinetics for the io3 100 Î¼g l injection step which was used to evaluate io3 behavior in this pre equilibrated untreated sediment fig 6 b shows that the io3 breakthrough occurred at an average of 4 5 pv indicating minimal sorption of the injected io3 in the untreated sediments following the io3 injection step in the 1mg 2 column described above section 2 3 io3 source area treatment was approximated by the simultaneous injection of the 0 1 m acidic ferric solution with 100 Î¼g l io3 into the untreated sediment column where adsorption co precipitation of io3 with the generated hfo was expected the resulted hfo precipitation at this step is described in section 3 1 fig 6 c shows a reduced io3 concentration profile in the column effluent indicating the occurrence of io3 incorporation as the in situ hfo precipitated the results show the io3 concentration ratio of the effluent vs injected c c0 ranged from 0 53 0 77 under the injection average linear velocity of 3 1 m day table 1 the injection was stopped after 8 pv when the effluent solution color turned brown considering the much elevated solution ionic strength is in this system resulting from mineral dissolution during the acidic ferric solution injection see section 3 1 1 the adsorption contribution in the total io3 immobilization here could be limited because low io3 adsorption on hfo was expected under high is conditions wang et al 2019 therefore co precipitation could be the dominant process here for the io3 immobilization however further investigation is needed to identify the respective contributions from the adsorption and co precipitation processes 3 2 2 hfo permeable reactive barrier capture of io3 for the prb test hfo was first precipitated in the 1mg 1 column through the acidic ferric solution injection 8 8 pv followed by agw ph 7 9 flushing to return the column ph from the acidic solution injection leaded acidic condition to neutral however the effluent ph was still of 4 5 even after 45 5 pv agw flushing under this weak acidic condition an io3 solution of 100 Î¼g l was injected at an average linear velocity of 8 3 m day no io3 breakthrough was observed until 174 pv during which the effluent solution ph was kept nearly constant with an average value of ph 4 7 fig 7 this result indicated that the io3 transport was strongly retarded through adsorption onto the hfo amended sediments in the column unfortunately it is not possible to directly compare this io3 transport behavior with the one conducted with the untreated sediments section 3 2 1 because of the different ph conditions solution ph could strongly impact io3 adsorption onto hfo where higher io3 adsorption was expected at lower ph conditions wang et al 2019 the effluent solution ph dramatically increased to ph 7 9 within several pore volumes after 174 pv correspondingly the effluent io3 concentration increased up to a maximum value of 571 5 Î¼g l this high effluent io3 concentration 100 Î¼g l suggested that a certain amount of the earlier adsorbed io3 desorbed and was released back into the solution at the elevated ph conditions this breakthrough curve shape is characteristic of ion exchange and may indicate that initially h saturated sites with io3 sorption under acidic conditions were exchanged by ca2 mg2 and to a lesser extent na and k in the agw by 174 pv after which the ph 7 9 solution exhibits less io3 sorption the io3 back release process continued until the end of the io3 injection at 238 pv where the effluent io3 concentration was of 131 1 Î¼g l close to but still higher than the injected io3 concentration of 100 Î¼g l the 328 h stop flow event conducted at 221 pv resulted in io3 concentration rebound up to 258 9 Î¼g l indicating a slow release of the adsorbed io3 from the hfo amended sediments in terms of io3 immobilization the prb performance here illustrates two phases i initially strong adsorption at low ph conditions resulted from acidic ferric solution injection for hfo prb formation and ii latterly partial release of sorbed io3 from prb along with the neutralization process of the acidified groundwater plume although certain amount of pre adsorbed io3 releasing back into solutions at the later phase the high sorptive capacity of hfo for io3 with an adsorption distribution coefficient kd of near 1000 ml g at neutral ph in a synthesized ground water system wang et al 2019 could still enable high efficient io3 removal from the ground water plumes especially at low io3 concentrations 3 2 3 desorption of io3 from hfo amended sediments leaching studies were conducted using agw for more than 100 pv after the io3 injection in both the prb 1mg 1 and source term columns 1mg 2 the effluent io3 concentrations along the leaching time were illustrated in fig 8 for the source term column 1mg 2 fig 8a after the initial 3 pv leaching the effluent io3 concentration was rapidly decreased to a tailing level of 1 8 Î¼g l indicating a strong retention of io3 through hfo io3 adsorption co precipitation processes in the case of the prb column 1mg 1 fig 8 b shows a continuous relatively slow desorption release of io3 over the entire leaching process including a concentration rebound signal after the 160 h stop flow event conducted at the 103 pv leaching however a direct comparison between the two column leaching processes is not possible since the effluent solution ph from the source term column was still lower than 5 0 after more than 120 pv leaching with agw ph 7 9 whereas the leaching on the prb column was conducted under neutral conditions during the entire leaching process 3 2 4 iodine mass balance the iodine mass balance in the two reacted glass columns 1mg 1 and 1mg 2 was calculated after experiments and the results are listed in table 2 for each column two sediment samples were collected from different column locations 0 10 and 56 72 cm from column inlet and the extracted averaged io3 concentration was used for the total io3 mass calculation although the mass recovery was relatively poor 140 the percentage of the immobilized io3 was calculated based on the koh kno3 fusion extracted io3 on the treated sediments with consideration of the extracted io3 amount from the untreated sediments thus the results are likely reliable the results indicated that after over 100 pv leaching about 48 9 and 41 3 of injected io3 was still sequestrated in the hfo amended prb and source term columns respectively however more io3 release will be expected over the extended leaching process 4 conclusions a new practical approach for in situ hfo precipitation was developed through single injection of an acidic ferric solution into the sediments under field scale conditions at the hanford site self ph buffering of the injected acidic ferric solution due to mineral calcite dissolution leads to hfo precipitation under neutral ph conditions in this study up to 12 mg g fe as hfo successfully precipitated in hanford sediments under 0 1 m ferric solution injection under moderate flow rates hfo was evenly distributed within the tested 1 to 3 m long sediment matrix and remobilization of the neoformed hfo precipitates was limited 3 16 wt after over100 pv of flushing indicating the precipitated hfo is stable in the ph buffered sediments the transport of io3 in the hfo amended sediments was strongly retarded through both adsorption and co precipitation processes for source area treatment the simultaneous injection of 100 Î¼g l io3 with the ph 1 5 ferric iron solution resulted in co precipitation of 23 to 47 of the io3 likely within hfo there may be additional decrease in io3 leaching release from precipitates in the sediments due to the hfo coating on the surfaces of the iodine contaminated sediment phases as a prb injection of the 100 Î¼g l io3 solution into hfo modified sediments showed complete io3 removal for 174 pv due to the strong adsorption at low ph i e high io3 sorption in the ph 1 5 to 5 0 sediment although certain amounts of io3 desorbed and released back into solution at elevated ph conditions later the high adsorption capacity of io3 on hfo at neutralized ph conditions still enables to immobilize certain amounts of io3 in terms of field scale application the 174 pv of capacity to adsorb 100 of the io3 is significant as this could last years to a decade in hanford groundwater in addition the fraction of io3 that remained immobile up to 50 after 174 to 350 pv including the exhaustive agw desorption phase is significant in these experiments that lasted several weeks it is likely caused by io3 incorporation into hfo at field scale over longer time scales it is likely that the fraction of io3 incorporated into hfo would be greater considering the relative high flow speeds used in the experiments much higher fraction and longer iodine retention should be expected in slow moving groundwater systems more development is needed before field scale implementation to further evaluate the long term performance of io3 capture as well as side effects of the injection while the reversible adsorption of iodine on hfo might

1469,a practical approach for in situ hydrous ferric oxide hfo precipitation was developed for iodine immobilization under field scale conditions at the hanford site a series of 1d meter long bench top column experiments packed with hanford sediments was conducted with a single acidic ferric solution 0 1 m ph 1 5 injection because carbonate and clay minerals are widely present in sediments self ph buffering of the injected acidic ferric solution occurred due to mineral dissolution leading to hfo precipitation under a neutral condition up to 12 mg g fe as hfo successfully precipitated and evenly distributed in the column sediments and the remobilization of the neoformed hfo precipitates was limited 3 16 wt after over 100 pore volumes pv of flushing the transport of iodate io3 in the hfo amended sediments was strongly retarded through both adsorption and co precipitation processes however reversible adsorption of iodine on hfo was observed which might limit its application to slow moving groundwater systems keywords hfo in situ precipitation iodate sorption co precipitation leaching 1 introduction radionuclides and metals can be an environmental concern in soil and groundwater due to recalcitrance toxicity and mobility in the environment whereas traditional pump and treat approaches can be costly and produce high concentration wastes ex situ in situ remediation approaches can be advantageous because they can limit site disruption lower costs and secondary waste generation reduce worker exposure and treat at depth or under obstructed sites doe 1994 although nanoparticle injections for in situ remediation can be prepared above ground using particle stabilizing techniques that prevent particle aggregation and improve soil deliverability without losing reactivity liu et al 2015 reactive materials can also be formed in situ martin and kempton 2000 xie et al 2015 in situ technologies have the potential to provide treatment with minimal long term operational requirements and to stabilize contaminants that may slowly diffuse out of low permeability zones after active pump and treat applications have ceased fe oxides and hydroxides hereafter referred to as fe oxides are good sorbents of anionic species due to the high point of zero charge harrison and berkheiser 1982 schwertmann and taylor 1977 jain et al 1999 kosmulski 2009 li and kaplan 2012 past studies have demonstrated high extent of iodine adsorption on fe oxides especially on hfo ferrihydrite whitehead 1974 neal and truesdale 1976 machesky et al 1989 nagata and fukushi 2010 wang et al 2019 hfo is cost effective non hazardous and exhibits a large surface area and high adsorptive capacity making it a promising material for the remediation of subsurface iodine fe oxide formation for contaminant remediation has been demonstrated in several laboratory studies by alternating injections of ferrous fe and oxidant solutions or aerated water into an aquifer where fe ii will be oxidized to fe iii and directly precipitated as fe oxides in the sediment matrix doe 1994 martin and kempton 2000 roberts et al 2004 stollenwerk et al 2008 hu 2010 xie et al 2015 due to the large surface area of the fe oxide particles concentrations of the target contaminants in groundwater will be reduced by increased adsorption and co precipitation martin and kempton 2000 demonstrated this approach in the laboratory by injecting ferrous sulfate and oxygen solution into a sand packed column retarding the transport of chromium and arsenic hu 2010 and abia 2011 also demonstrated arsenic removal with fe oxide coatings on sand grains the procedure involved sequential injection of acidified fe ii solution deoxygenated water and oxidant alkalinity supply mixture into sand packed columns the advective diffusive transport of the two reagents in porous media created a reaction zone where fe ii was oxidized and precipitated as fe oxides on the surfaces of the sand grain the injection of the deoxygenated water provided a buffer zone to avoid clogging due to the rapid precipitation of fe oxides formed upon direct contact between the two chemical reagents at the field scale sheffer et al 2010 reported a pilot study to assess an in situ arsenic remediation treatment by injecting an acidified hydrated ferrous chloride hcl and fecl2 4h2o solution ph of 3 5 into an essentially oxygen saturated aquifer to create a filter zone around the injection well and the results showed a 50 reduction in arsenic concentration an hfo chemical barrier was created for uranium remediation doe 1994 in situ injection approaches can be costly involving two to three chemical reagents with multiple injection procedures thereby limiting the practical application of this technology in addition the oxidation of fe ii to fe oxides has to be carefully controlled through a water buffer zone to avoid immediate precipitation at the injection inlets where clogging might occur stollenwerk et al 2008 sheffer et al 2010 although the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii has been observed at ph levels of 4 10 cornell and schwertmann 2003 the oxidation of fe ii to fe oxides also produces protons thereby lowering the solution ph alba ii 2011 many metals or radionuclides are redox active and so the aqueous solubility depends on the chemical oxidation states injection of oxidants can favor the immobilization of some contaminants but increase the mobility of other co located contaminants such as cr se u and tc which have lower solubility in their reduced species therefore a new approach to in situ fe oxides formation is needed to simplify the injection and eliminate oxidant input although numerous studies have documented an in situ approach for arsenic chromium and uranium immobilization to the authors knowledge no in situ approach has been applied to iodine immobilization the goal of this study is to identify a practical approach for in situ hfo precipitation for iodine immobilization under field scale conditions at the hanford site located in southeastern washington state instead of fe ii and oxidant solutions single injection of acidic fe no3 3 solution was first tested in bench scale column experiments for hfo precipitation since carbonate and clay minerals are widely present in sediments self ph buffering of the injected acidic fe iii solution will occur due to mineral dissolution leading to hfo precipitation under neutral ph conditions this hypothesis is supported by the observed ph neutralization and zonation that occurred at hanford site resulting from historical acidic and alkaline subsurface waste discharges wan et al 2004 szecsody et al 2013 deutsch and pavish 2013 wang et al 2017 this paper presents the results of column experiments that evaluated a new hfo solution injection for iodine immobilization under different conditions these 1d 1 to 3 m long column experiments were carried out using hanford sediments and artificial groundwater agw that mimicked the geochemical signature of hanford groundwater hfo precipitation was tested under different flow rates io3 was injected into the hfo laden sediment column to capture it within the sediments through adsorption or was injected together with the hfo forming solution acidic fe iii into the iodine laden sediment column to test the iodine hfo co precipitation effects effluent ph and cations were monitored for elevated concentrations of ca al si and sr which were expected to increase due to mineral dissolution szecsody et al 2013 and thereby impact iodine adsorption and co precipitation due to the elevated ionic strength the precipitated fe content in the hfo laden sediments was determined using acid extraction techniques and the mineralogy phases were analyzed using x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds leaching was also performed to determine the neoformed hfo stability in the sediments and to test the long term retention capacity of the adsorbed and co precipitated iodine in fe oxide within the sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 hanford fine sand hfs hanford fine sand hfs collected at a near surface burial ground excavation at 218 e 12b was used in these column experiments hfs is composed of the silty sand facies from the hanford formation in the hanford 200 area and contains 0 23 wt gravel 72 61 wt sand and 27 16 wt silt and clay serne et al 2008 the sediments were sieved to remove the size fraction greater than 2 mm prior to experiments the hfs is typical of hanford formation sediments and contains quartz k na feldspar and smectite along with illite and chlorite as the dominant mineral phases with a low calcium carbonate content 1 75 wt as identified by mineralogical analysis in serne et al 2008 2 1 2 preparation of acidic ferric solution and io3 solution ferric nitrate fe no3 3 9 h2o 99 sigma aldrich was used as the fe iii source for ferric solution preparation briefly 80 089 g of fe no3 3 9 h2o was dissolved into 1 l of agw ph 7 9 at room temperature resulting in a brown colored acidic 0 1 m fe iii solution with a ph value of 1 5 sodium iodate 99 acros organics corp was dissolved into agw to make an io3 solution for the adsorption co precipitation experiments the concentration of the prepared io3 solution was of 100 Î¼g l based on certain iodine plume conditions in the field truex et al 2015 in addition one io3 solution 100 Î¼g l was prepared in the 0 1 m fe iii solution matrix to test the io3 co precipitation with the produced fe oxides the agw recipe is listed in the supporting information table s1 2 2 in situ hfo precipitation hfo in situ precipitation experiments were conducted in four 1d columns packed with hfs sediments including two glass columns of 1 cm id 100 cm length and two pvc columns of 1 5 cm id 300 cm length the glass column enables visible observation of the in situ hfo precipitation as well as its distribution within the columns the two glass columns were also used for io3 remediation experiments in a reasonable laboratory experimental time scale the injecting amendment at a field scale length was accomplished by evaluating the spatial distribution of hfo precipitation in the two 3 m scale pvc columns briefly 823 861 g and 118 119 g of hfs was dry packed into the 3 m pvc named as 3mp and 1 m glass named as 1mg columns leading to a porosity of 0 41 0 42 and 0 30 0 32 respectively a narrow range of solid to solution ratio of 3 8 5 1 was achieved in all the tested columns the four packed columns were saturated through pumping agw into the columns where the column porosity was determined based on the pumped agw mass balance after column saturation the prepared 0 1 m acidic fe iii solution was pumped into the columns at a controlled flow rate using a syringe pump for the in situ hfo precipitation for the two 3mp columns a constant average linear flow velocity of 2 0 or 21 4 m day corresponding to a solution residence time of 35 5 and 3 4 h respectively was applied to mimic a single well injection time scale to a 10 to 15 m radius for the two 1mg columns a single constant average linear flow velocity of 3 1 3 3 m day leading to a solution residence time of 7 3 7 6 h was used for the ferric solution delivery the effluent ph was monitored during the entire reaction process by an accumet ph meter the injection was stopped when the effluent solution color turned brown where an effluent solution ph of 4 0 was normally observed after the 0 1 m fe iii injection each column except 1mg 2 column was flushed with agw under the same flow velocity as used for ferric solution injection to test the stability of the in situ precipitated hfo in the column sediments through a fe mass balance calculation effluent samples were collected and analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes for fe ca si sr and al concentrations all the column experimental setup and flow conditions are listed in table 1 2 3 iodine immobilization and leaching the io3 transport and immobilization experiments were conducted with the two glass columns described above the performance of the in situ precipitated hfo for io3 immobilization in this study was evaluated under two scenarios 1 injecting io3 spiked acidic ferric solution into io3 contaminated sediments column 1mg 2 in table 1 to mimic a remediation scenario within the iodine plumes source term in the subsurface and 2 injecting io3 solution into the hfo laden sediments column 1mg 1 in table 1 where the newly precipitated hfo served as a permeable reactive barrier prb because natural and anthropogenic iodine 127 as io3 and iodide i in the hfs sediments is present as aqueous adsorbed and one or more precipitate phases including fe oxides and calcite the performance of the hfo precipitated sediments was also tested against untreated sediments to evaluate source area remediation of io3 in aqueous solution and in precipitates three 1d column injection experimental steps were conducted a pre equilibration of the sediment b injection of aqueous io3 into untreated sediment and c simultaneous injection of aqueous io3 and the ph 1 5 ferric iron solution into sediment briefly for the pre equilibration step agw was injected at an average liner velocity of 3 1 m day table 1 into the untreated sediment packed in the column 1mg 2 and the effluent io3 concentrations were monitored the agw injection including a 72 h stop flow event was not stopped until the effluent iodine concentration showing a tailing phase after that an io3 solution of 100 Î¼g l was injected into the column at an average linear velocity of 7 7 m day to evaluate io3 behavior in this pre equilibrated untreated sediment this injection step was designed for two purposes 1 determine the io3 transport behavior in the untreated sediments to compare with the io3 transport in the hfo laden sediments and 2 generate an io3 contaminated source zone relevant to field conditions the injection of the 100 Î¼g l io3 solution at this step also including an 84 h stop flow event was not stopped until the io3 concentration of 100 Î¼g l in the effluent solution was observed finally the injection of a 100 Î¼g l io3 spiked 0 1 m fe iii solution at an average liner velocity of 3 1 m day was conducted for the hfo io3 co precipitation this step injection was stopped after the effluent solution color turned brown to test the prb scenario an io3 solution of 100 Î¼g l in agw was injected at a constant average linear velocity of 8 3 m day into the 1mg 1 column after the acidic ferric solution injection for hfo precipitation and the followed agw flushing this extended agw flushing 45 5 pv before the io3 injection enabled the elimination of any potential hfo colloid particle facilitated io3 transport for both the source term and prb columns after the io3 uptake procedures leaching was immediately performed using neutral agw to evaluate the long term retention capacity of the adsorbed and co precipitated iodine in hfo within the sediments the leaching used the same flow velocity as for the io3 uptake process and extended to more than 100 pv the iodine concentrations in the effluent samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms all iodine column experimental conditions applied in this study are listed in table 1 2 4 solid characterization 2 4 1 fe and io3 extraction after the entire column experimental procedures the fe contents mg g in the treated sediments collected at five column locations for each column was determined using 8 m hno3 acid extraction demirkanli et al 2018 detailed sample location is presented in table s2 the in situ precipitated fe content was calculated by subtracting the extracted fe in the untreated hfs samples from that of each hfo amended sample briefly triplicate extraction vials containing 2 g of air dried solid sample plus 6 ml 8 m hno3 solution was cooked for 3 h at 95 c in a heating box after cooling to room temperature the supernatant was passed a 0 45 Î¼m filter and analyzed for fe concentrations using icp oes the solution volume was determined by reactor mass balance combined with the solution density measurement and the final extracted fe mass was calculated in addition to extraction using 8 m hno3 extractions with 0 5 m hcl or 1 m cacl2 in an anaerobic chamber were also conducted for the exchangeable fe ii contents demirkanli et al 2018 fe ii concentration in the extracted solution was determined using hach 8147 method by reaction with ferrozine in addition to fe iodine concentrations in the treated and untreated sediment samples were extracted by the koh kno3 fusion method geiszler 2016 for mass balance calculation to identify the final immobilized iodine percentage after the experiments the immobilized io3 percentage was calculated as io3 extracted from the reacted sediments io3 extracted from the untreated sediments the total injected io3 100 the detailed calculation terms are listed in table 2 2 4 2 xrd and sem eds characterization powder xrd was used to identify the precipitated fe oxide mineral phases as well as any potential mineral changes in the sediments before and after the treatment with the acidic ferric solution selected treated sediment samples were also characterized using sem coupled with eds to identify crystal geomorphology and to look for relatively high fe content domains in the treated sediments which may reflect the hfo precipitation detailed characterization methods for xrd and sem eds are provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ hfo precipitation 3 1 1 aqueous measurements during ferric fe injection and hfo precipitation the in situ hfo precipitation was identified in the two transparent glass columns through visibly significant color changes in the packed sediment where the grayish hfs sediment matrix turned brown indicating the precipitation of hfo fig s1 as expected self ph buffering of the injected acidic ferric solution occurred leading to nearly 100 of the injected fe precipitating out of the solution in the column fig 1 fig 1 a clearly illustrates that the injected acidic solution ph 1 5 was immediately buffered to above ph 6 ph 5 5 in 3mp 2 column after the first pore volume effluent ph 7 9 the relatively higher ph from the first pore volume resulted from the agw column saturation injection before the acidic ferric solution fe signals in all the column effluents were near or under the icp oes detection limit 41 1 Î¼g l indicating the fe precipitation in the columns under neutralized ph conditions in all the columns the effluent solution turned brown in color after about 6 5 8 5 pv accompanied by a dramatic decrease of effluent ph to 4 and an increase of fe concentrations this indicated that the injected acidic ferric solution overwhelmed the hfs acid neutralization capacity and the injection ceased the ph self buffering of the injected ferric solution in the columns mainly resulted from calcite carbonate dissolution fig 2 shows the measured concentrations of ca si sr and al in the effluents during the acidic ferric solution injection as expected carbonate dissolution in hfs sediments was rapid where the ca concentration in all tested columns was dramatically increased to 120 mmol l after the first pore volume and a concentration plateau was maintained during the entire ferric solution injection process the elevated ca concentration and the constant concentration plateau indicated a dominant carbonate dissolution process because the cation exchangeable ca is much smaller for hanford sediments szecsody et al 2013 the carbonate dissolution was also indicated by the continuous gas bubbles observed in the effluents this is because the carbonate concentrations were well above aqueous carbonate solubility which resulted in most carbonate outgassing as co2 gas in contrast the limited increases of si and al concentrations in the effluent fig 2 suggests limited dissolution of clay minerals in the sediment 3 1 2 ferric iron precipitates in sediments by fe extraction the in situ precipitated hfo mass in the columns was quantified by the total ferric iron extracted with 8 m hno3 minus the background ferric iron determined in the untreated sediments fig 3 shows the fe contents extracted from the treated samples and compared with the values from the untreated hfs indicating a relative constant value 10 12 mg g of the maximum precipitated fe concentration determined among all the tested columns despite the differences in the column lengths 1 or 3 m and the ferric solution injection rates 2 0 21 4 m day in the 1 m glass columns fig 3a the precipitated hfo was nearly evenly distributed within the entire columns with the precipitated fe contents of 5 3 10 6 mg g for the two 3 m pvc columns fig 3b higher hfo precipitation occurred in the middle of the columns 6 94 12 02 mg g at 72 5 232 5 cm with less mass 3 98 4 63 mg g and limited mass 0 40 0 85 mg g precipitated at the column inlet 0 10 cm or outlet areas 290 300 cm respectively column 3mp 2 demonstrated an increasing trend in hfo precipitation along the direction of flow this might be due to the high injection velocity 21 4 m day applied on this column the resulting residence time 3 4 h may hinder local ph buffering under a relative high flow through velocity the sediments near the column inlet had the potential for more mineral dissolution due to the continuous flow of the low ph solution therefore hfo precipitation occurred farther from the inlet where solution ph was near neutralized in addition to the total fe extraction fe ii extraction using 0 5 m hcl was also conducted on the reacted sediments collected from columns 3mp 1 3mp 2 and 1mg 1 at the same locations described above the detailed extraction results are presented in fig s2 with extracted fe ii values of 0 49 0 77 mg g as expected no significant fe ii difference between the untreated and column treated sediments was observed and the extracted fe ii contents were nearly constant among the samples collected at different column locations these results indicated that no significant fe ii containing minerals in the sediments were dissolved which had no impact on iodine transport these results were further confirmed by the 1 m cacl2 extraction where no significant ion exchangeable fe ii was observed data not shown 3 1 3 xrd and sem eds analysis no hfo phases could be identified in the xrd analysis fig 4 this is because of the poor crystalline phase of hfo combined with the low concentrations of the resulted hfo precipitates in the treated sediment 10 mg g i e 1 wt which is lower than the xrd detection limit 5 10 wt for hfo meanwhile the xrd pattern also did not show any other fe oxides goethite magnetite hematite lepidocrocite or akageneite which requires much less concentration contents in the samples due to the well crystalized features although not identified in the xrd analysis the formation of hfo is evidenced by the color changes of the packed sediments after the column treatment see section 3 1 1 considering the common laboratory synthetic route method for hfo which is through hydrolysis of acid fe iii solutions by raising the solution ph to ca neutral with alkali schwertmann and cornell 1991 the hfo precipitation herein was much likely where the injected acidic fe iii solution neutralized through the ph self buffering process which is analogous to the route hfo synthesis pathway the chemical composition analysis through sem eds provided strong evidence for hfo precipitation fig 4 fig 4 shows that 49 59 at and 4 5 at fe was detected on the more bright and grey areas respectively it probably indicates the respective sediments surfaces with or without fe coating suggesting that the nanometer sized hfo heterogeneously precipitated on a mineral grain in the reacted sediments although further characterization of the bright coating is needed in the future adsorption of the injected fe iii on the sediment surface was not likely to occur here under the system self buffered neutral ph conditions fig 1 because fe iii precipitates out of solutions at ph 4 stefaÃ¤nsson 2007 the dissolution of calcium carbonate in this study was further supported by the xrd analysis fig 4 compares the collected xrd patterns between the untreated and the treated sediments collected from column 1mg 1 the comparison illustrated the disappearance of calcite indicated by the strongest calcite peak at 29 4 2Î¸ after the column reaction process no significant changes in other minerals were observed this is consistent with the si and al signals presented in fig 2 where very limited si with initial dissolution up to 1 5 mmol l and almost no detectable al were observed in the effluent solutions 3 1 4 long term stability of precipitated ferric oxide after hfo in situ precipitation the stability of the precipitated hfo was tested through the extended agw leaching up to 135 pv the flow velocity for the agw leaching was the same as the velocity used for ferric solution injection on each column 2 0 21 4 m day fig 5 shows that very limited fe was detected in the flushing effluent except for the first two pore volumes which mainly resulted from the remaining ferric solution in the pores after the injection stopped the fe mass balance calculation indicated that only 1 62 wt and 3 16 wt of the injected fe was leached out of the columns 1mg 1 and 1mg 2 after 45 and 135 pv of agw flushing respectively 3 2 io3 immobilization using in situ precipitated hfo 3 2 1 io3 source area remediation evaluation to evaluate source area remediation of io3 in aqueous solution and in precipitates as described in section 2 3 three 1d column injection steps were conducted for the pre equilibration step 12 pv of agw was injected into the untreated sediment fig 6 a shows that the effluent io3 concentrations were initially very high 2000 Î¼g l and decreased to 5 Î¼g l by 11 5 pv indicating high natural and anthropogenic iodine 127 in the sediments the fast iodine release might result from the injection water being a different ph relative to the sediment however the iodine concentration rebound after the 72 h stop flow event and the later tailing phase also indicated slow desorption or dissolution kinetics for the io3 100 Î¼g l injection step which was used to evaluate io3 behavior in this pre equilibrated untreated sediment fig 6 b shows that the io3 breakthrough occurred at an average of 4 5 pv indicating minimal sorption of the injected io3 in the untreated sediments following the io3 injection step in the 1mg 2 column described above section 2 3 io3 source area treatment was approximated by the simultaneous injection of the 0 1 m acidic ferric solution with 100 Î¼g l io3 into the untreated sediment column where adsorption co precipitation of io3 with the generated hfo was expected the resulted hfo precipitation at this step is described in section 3 1 fig 6 c shows a reduced io3 concentration profile in the column effluent indicating the occurrence of io3 incorporation as the in situ hfo precipitated the results show the io3 concentration ratio of the effluent vs injected c c0 ranged from 0 53 0 77 under the injection average linear velocity of 3 1 m day table 1 the injection was stopped after 8 pv when the effluent solution color turned brown considering the much elevated solution ionic strength is in this system resulting from mineral dissolution during the acidic ferric solution injection see section 3 1 1 the adsorption contribution in the total io3 immobilization here could be limited because low io3 adsorption on hfo was expected under high is conditions wang et al 2019 therefore co precipitation could be the dominant process here for the io3 immobilization however further investigation is needed to identify the respective contributions from the adsorption and co precipitation processes 3 2 2 hfo permeable reactive barrier capture of io3 for the prb test hfo was first precipitated in the 1mg 1 column through the acidic ferric solution injection 8 8 pv followed by agw ph 7 9 flushing to return the column ph from the acidic solution injection leaded acidic condition to neutral however the effluent ph was still of 4 5 even after 45 5 pv agw flushing under this weak acidic condition an io3 solution of 100 Î¼g l was injected at an average linear velocity of 8 3 m day no io3 breakthrough was observed until 174 pv during which the effluent solution ph was kept nearly constant with an average value of ph 4 7 fig 7 this result indicated that the io3 transport was strongly retarded through adsorption onto the hfo amended sediments in the column unfortunately it is not possible to directly compare this io3 transport behavior with the one conducted with the untreated sediments section 3 2 1 because of the different ph conditions solution ph could strongly impact io3 adsorption onto hfo where higher io3 adsorption was expected at lower ph conditions wang et al 2019 the effluent solution ph dramatically increased to ph 7 9 within several pore volumes after 174 pv correspondingly the effluent io3 concentration increased up to a maximum value of 571 5 Î¼g l this high effluent io3 concentration 100 Î¼g l suggested that a certain amount of the earlier adsorbed io3 desorbed and was released back into the solution at the elevated ph conditions this breakthrough curve shape is characteristic of ion exchange and may indicate that initially h saturated sites with io3 sorption under acidic conditions were exchanged by ca2 mg2 and to a lesser extent na and k in the agw by 174 pv after which the ph 7 9 solution exhibits less io3 sorption the io3 back release process continued until the end of the io3 injection at 238 pv where the effluent io3 concentration was of 131 1 Î¼g l close to but still higher than the injected io3 concentration of 100 Î¼g l the 328 h stop flow event conducted at 221 pv resulted in io3 concentration rebound up to 258 9 Î¼g l indicating a slow release of the adsorbed io3 from the hfo amended sediments in terms of io3 immobilization the prb performance here illustrates two phases i initially strong adsorption at low ph conditions resulted from acidic ferric solution injection for hfo prb formation and ii latterly partial release of sorbed io3 from prb along with the neutralization process of the acidified groundwater plume although certain amount of pre adsorbed io3 releasing back into solutions at the later phase the high sorptive capacity of hfo for io3 with an adsorption distribution coefficient kd of near 1000 ml g at neutral ph in a synthesized ground water system wang et al 2019 could still enable high efficient io3 removal from the ground water plumes especially at low io3 concentrations 3 2 3 desorption of io3 from hfo amended sediments leaching studies were conducted using agw for more than 100 pv after the io3 injection in both the prb 1mg 1 and source term columns 1mg 2 the effluent io3 concentrations along the leaching time were illustrated in fig 8 for the source term column 1mg 2 fig 8a after the initial 3 pv leaching the effluent io3 concentration was rapidly decreased to a tailing level of 1 8 Î¼g l indicating a strong retention of io3 through hfo io3 adsorption co precipitation processes in the case of the prb column 1mg 1 fig 8 b shows a continuous relatively slow desorption release of io3 over the entire leaching process including a concentration rebound signal after the 160 h stop flow event conducted at the 103 pv leaching however a direct comparison between the two column leaching processes is not possible since the effluent solution ph from the source term column was still lower than 5 0 after more than 120 pv leaching with agw ph 7 9 whereas the leaching on the prb column was conducted under neutral conditions during the entire leaching process 3 2 4 iodine mass balance the iodine mass balance in the two reacted glass columns 1mg 1 and 1mg 2 was calculated after experiments and the results are listed in table 2 for each column two sediment samples were collected from different column locations 0 10 and 56 72 cm from column inlet and the extracted averaged io3 concentration was used for the total io3 mass calculation although the mass recovery was relatively poor 140 the percentage of the immobilized io3 was calculated based on the koh kno3 fusion extracted io3 on the treated sediments with consideration of the extracted io3 amount from the untreated sediments thus the results are likely reliable the results indicated that after over 100 pv leaching about 48 9 and 41 3 of injected io3 was still sequestrated in the hfo amended prb and source term columns respectively however more io3 release will be expected over the extended leaching process 4 conclusions a new practical approach for in situ hfo precipitation was developed through single injection of an acidic ferric solution into the sediments under field scale conditions at the hanford site self ph buffering of the injected acidic ferric solution due to mineral calcite dissolution leads to hfo precipitation under neutral ph conditions in this study up to 12 mg g fe as hfo successfully precipitated in hanford sediments under 0 1 m ferric solution injection under moderate flow rates hfo was evenly distributed within the tested 1 to 3 m long sediment matrix and remobilization of the neoformed hfo precipitates was limited 3 16 wt after over100 pv of flushing indicating the precipitated hfo is stable in the ph buffered sediments the transport of io3 in the hfo amended sediments was strongly retarded through both adsorption and co precipitation processes for source area treatment the simultaneous injection of 100 Î¼g l io3 with the ph 1 5 ferric iron solution resulted in co precipitation of 23 to 47 of the io3 likely within hfo there may be additional decrease in io3 leaching release from precipitates in the sediments due to the hfo coating on the surfaces of the iodine contaminated sediment phases as a prb injection of the 100 Î¼g l io3 solution into hfo modified sediments showed complete io3 removal for 174 pv due to the strong adsorption at low ph i e high io3 sorption in the ph 1 5 to 5 0 sediment although certain amounts of io3 desorbed and released back into solution at elevated ph conditions later the high adsorption capacity of io3 on hfo at neutralized ph conditions still enables to immobilize certain amounts of io3 in terms of field scale application the 174 pv of capacity to adsorb 100 of the io3 is significant as this could last years to a decade in hanford groundwater in addition the fraction of io3 that remained immobile up to 50 after 174 to 350 pv including the exhaustive agw desorption phase is significant in these experiments that lasted several weeks it is likely caused by io3 incorporation into hfo at field scale over longer time scales it is likely that the fraction of io3 incorporated into hfo would be greater considering the relative high flow speeds used in the experiments much higher fraction and longer iodine retention should be expected in slow moving groundwater systems more development is needed before field scale implementation to further evaluate the long term performance of io3 capture as well as side effects of the injection while the reversible adsorption of iodine on hfo might limit its application to slow moving groundwater systems such as in vadose zones and in aquifers with slow water migration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
