6760,most water conservation policies will target agriculture the largest human consumptive use and that concentrating the marginal i e least productive uses of the resource adaptation to irrigation rationing policies at the micro level will have an impact on agricultural outputs and propagate to the rest of the economic sectors at a regional and supra regional macro scale as the economy transitions towards new equilibrium commodity prices the relevant prices for agriculture will change and this will in turn affect irrigators decisions this paper proposes an iterative coupling between a decentralized non parametric positive multi attribute utility programming representation of irrigators and a regionally calibrated computable general equilibrium model to assess interlinkages i e two way feedbacks between the micro and macro economy results from an application to irrigation water charges in the murcia region in spain show that the coupled micro macro model yields lower

introduction water crises are consistently identified as one of the greatest global threats in terms of impact wef 2018 2017 2016 2015 conventional responses to this challenge have relied on water infrastructures to expand the supply base randall 1981 yet as provisioning costs escalate and supply becomes inelastic policy makers are constrained to adapt withdrawals to the limited resources available oecd 2015 most water conservation policies will target agriculture the largest human consumptive use and that concentrating the marginal i e least productive uses of the resource adaptation to water rationing policies at the micro level will have an impact on agricultural outputs and propagate to the rest of the economic sectors at a regional and supra regional macro scale as the economy transitions towards new equilibrium commodity prices the relevant prices for agriculture will change and this will in turn affect irrigators decisions to the best of our knowledge this micro macro interlinkage has not been explored thus far in the literature assessment of water rationing policies typically relies on stand alone micro graveline 2016 or macro economic models hertel and liu 2016 sometimes coupled with hydrologic models i e hydroeconomic developing a holistic approach to represent and understand micro macro interlinkages under a single integrated modeling framework is challenging since micro and macro economic models follow their own complex optimization procedures and making them compatible will demand oversimplification e g piecewise functions harou et al 2009 pindyck 2015 against this background research has resorted to modular approaches that make use of a sequential process to represent complex micro macroeconomic dynamics while ensuring model completeness carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 pérez blanco et al 2016b however this approach does not address the interdependency between the outputs of micro and macro economic models which may raise consistency issues pindyck 2015 to bridge this gap this paper proposes an iterative coupling process between a micro and a macro economic model to improve the analysis of water policy implementation at the microeconomic scale there is a multi factor non linear positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model calibrated for representative agricultural water users gómez limón et al 2016 gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 while at the macroeconomic scale there is a regionally calibrated computable general equilibrium cge model bosello and standardi 2015 carrera et al 2015 as happens with other micro economic calibrated models for water allocation in agricultural production prices are exogenous in the pmaup model graveline 2016 while prices are endogenous in the cge model its adjustment dynamics rely on the existence of full fledged input markets that are not consistent with most water allocation regimes worldwide where historical rights and queuing are used to allocate available resources grafton et al 2011 and prices represent administrative charges to partially recover the cost of conveying water to users gomez et al 2017 the use of a modular approach to represent micro macroeconomic feedbacks allows us to reconcile the market adjustment dynamics of cge models with actual water abstraction licensing policies existing in most regions worldwide while consistently linking a common set of agricultural commodity prices between the pmaup and cge models methods are illustrated with a hypothetical water charging policy in the murcia region in southeastern spain which encompasses most of the water scarce and drought prone segura river basin 2 case study area murcia spreads over an area of 11 313 km2 and has a population of 1 5 million inhabitants the gdp per capita is eur 19 089 eurostat 2016 the region of murcia is highly dependent on agriculture which represents 4 4 of regional gdp and 10 4 of regional employment as compared to 2 3 and 4 at a national level food industry and tourism closely connected to the agricultural sector account for 4 5 and 5 6 of the gdp respectively ine 2017 relevant water policy impacts on and feedbacks from the output of economic sectors in the region can be anticipated from this sectorial gdp distribution the region is located within and encompasses most of the absolute water scarce segura river basin since the 1950s the segura river basin has heavily invested in water infrastructures including the construction of water wells desalination plants wastewater treatment plants and an inter basin transfer from the tagus river basin located 272 km away the largest water infrastructure in spain yet the segura river basin is now a closed basin srba 2015a water works have failed to meaningfully expand the supply base and this inelastic supply is increasingly insufficient to meet growing demand particularly from agriculture which now represents 86 of the 1829 million cubic meters withdrawn annually this has resulted in a water exploitation index ratio of withdrawals to renewable resources including transfers and non conventional wastewater and desalination resources of 1 15 the second largest in europe srba 2015a agricultural water use rights in the segura river basin are allotted to agricultural water demand units awdu awdus are the representative agent in the pmaup model and comprise irrigation communities that share a common water source and have similar administrative and hydrological characteristics srba 2015a in this study we focus on the 55 awdus of the segura river basin located within the boundaries of the region of murcia see fig 1 the most important irrigated crops in these awdus are vegetables and fruits which represent more than 95 of gross value added gva in 2013 followed by wheat 0 6 other cereals 2 2 and other crops 1 8 looking at the distribution of gva between irrigated and non irrigated land in murcia s awdus wheat and other cereals have relatively low irrigation shares 19 and 11 respectively while vegetables and fruits are mostly irrigated average water charges in the segura river basin equal eur 0 09 m3 the largest in spain although there is considerable heterogeneity values range from eur 0 36 m3 for desalinated water and eur 0 22 m3 for water served from the tagus segura water transfer to eur 0 m3 in awdus supplied with groundwater srba 2015a charges are insufficient to recover the costs stemming from water works investments cost recovery ratios range between 54 08 for surface water to 80 82 for the tagus segura water transfer let alone environmental and resource costs pérez blanco et al 2015 following eu guidelines ec 2015a 2015b 2009 the segura river basin authority is now in the process of designing transformative changes to the water allocation regime in which agricultural water charging is expected to play a central role segura river basin authority and ministry of agriculture food and environment of spain 2016 srba 2015a 3 methods the proposed analysis is a comparative static exercise based on the implementation of an iterative feedback process between the pmaup and cge models as illustrated in fig 2 using gva and prices as coupling variables for selected agricultural commodities two are the main advantages of this approach i the macroeconomic price coherence added to the microeconomic system and ii the inclusion of the microeconomic model attributes to the macroeconomic model analysis first the pmaup model is updated with a coherent set of agricultural prices from the cge model providing an economy wide feedback from a water policy being evaluated in the microeconomic model pmaup secondly the cge model assessment of the policy can be extended considering the specific attributes from the pmaup model in the feedback process this approach develops synergies between a partial and general equilibrium model by exploiting the detailed formulation of the first and the propagation mechanisms of the second therefore including second order effects in water policy assessments these methods are illustrated simulating a series of incremental water charges initially assessed with the pmaup model and then extended with the cge feedbacks on commodity price changes following the implementation of the water charging policy the iterative feedback process works following three steps fig 2 step 1 sets the water charge step 2 runs the pmaup model considering the policy shock whose solution provides changes in gva of agricultural activities in step 3 the variations of value added are fed into the cge model as productivity shocks affecting primary factors in the agricultural sector in this way the cge model is solved considering pmaup inputs and provides a new set of prices which are coherent with economy wide general equilibrium effects of the water charge implemented in step 1 changes in crops prices in the region are then fed back to the pmaup model to initialize again step 2 thus changes in crops prices are used by the pmaup to calculate updated productivity shocks feeding the cge to produce the next iterative solution steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence for the changes of both value added in the pmaup model and crops prices in the cge model is reached convergence is assumed to be achieved when the sum over all crop sectors of the absolute value of the differences between the current and the previous iterations for the changes in crops prices in the cge and gva in the pmaup model expressed in percentage points is below a pre established tolerance threshold 1 ideally the tolerance level could be set to 0 which indicates the last two solutions are identical for computational reasons the tolerance level in this paper has been set to 0 00001 percentage points which still provides a solution close to the solution that could be obtained with a threshold equal to 0 1 a major challenge in coupling models relates to their convergence in the literature convergence is typically assessed empirically hasegawa et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2009 in doing so coupled models follow a trial and error approach to e g fine tune key coupling parameters or discard conflicting modules agents e g cge regions that may prevent convergence ronneberger et al 2009 therefore in our coupled pmaup cge model there are some specific elements or characteristics that should be considered in the design of the coupling procedure first the most relevant decision variables should be governed by the most appropriate model i the pmaup model decides the crop portfolio allocation based on the different attributes and on the price information feedback from the cge model while ii the cge model produces the economy wide effects and corresponding price changes in the rest of the economy following the gva changes from the pmaup model second the crop portfolio allocation must consider the physical and institutional rigidities specific to each case study and this is satisfied by using microeconomic data with a fine spatial detail in our example awdus to calibrate the pmaup model and run simulations this implies that the crop portfolio has additional constraints derived from the institutional and agroecological structure of the case study area reflected in the input data third while the timespan of the simulation exercise could add some flexibility to these physical constraints because of medium to long run investments sticking to the short term as we do in our water charging example addresses this point fourth water charges should be applied within a feasible range to avoid cases in which high water charges could increase costs in such a way that the crop portfolio is limited to very few crops as a first step to confirm the empirical convergence between the models data values translated between the models must be verified hasegawa et al 2016 in our paper methods to verify convergence are presented in section 4 2 following a similar approach to that of hasegawa et al 2016 and ronneberger et al 2009 it is also possible to explore convergence more generally through a convergence test convergence tests aim to assess the response of the coupled system to a series of shocks to then audit its convergence behavior in succeeding iterations ronneberger et al 2009 in our paper this is done in section 5 by applying incremental water charges to the coupled system in addition to this empirical analysis it is also of value to assess convergence beyond a specific simulation or set of simulations to this end in annex 2 we assess convergence through a simplified dynamic system model representing the pmaup cge coupling framework considering the selected convergence variables in each model of the framework this coupling methodology allows evaluating the macroeconomic propagation of the water policy by exploiting interactions between the micro and the macro model it also opens the possibility to run sensitivity analyses and shed light on adjustments to the initial policy to correct and improve the initial set of policy objectives as compared to studies relying on stand alone macroeconomic models the use of a coupled micro macroeconomic model allows for a more accurate representation of the physical and institutional rigidities characterizing most water allocation regimes through feedbacks between the microeconomic and macroeconomic models this iterative coupling approach also offers advantages compared to the analyses exploring the sequential coupling between microeconomic and macroeconomic models which represent only the first stage steps 1 3 of the described coupling process disregarding circular feedbacks with the microeconomic model while conventional macroeconomic models sequential micro macroeconomic models and iterative micro macroeconomic models provide similar outputs namely the economy wide effects of a specific policy or impact carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 pérez blanco et al 2016b the first two produce only an initial estimation of impacts effects based on results from other models disregarding the final outcome once the full feedback is taken into account 3 1 the microeconomic model positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup 3 1 1 background and model choice in a typical microeconomic model the rational agent an irrigator or other representative agent decides on crop mix and timing water application and investments in capital stock to optimize farm performance with respect to single or multiple objectives within a domain defined by a number of constraints literature often simplifies this complex decision process by representing each possible combination of crops timing water application and capital as a separate crop with unique features so that the optimization problem is reduced to a decision on the crop portfolio within a domain graveline 2016 applied models to simulate farmer s behavior often assume that farmers are profit maximizers and equate utility to profit although empirical research shows this approach usually leads to significant divergence between observed and simulated behavior grames et al 2016 more robust theoretical frameworks model agent s responses by means of maximizing a utility function where profits are the relevant attribute as in expected utility von neumann and morgenstern 1953 and positive mathematical programming howitt 1995 since the 1970s a growing research body known as the theory of planned behavior tpb disputes that farmers behavior can be modeled by maximizing profits or by a utility function where profits are the single relevant objective and argues that farmers behavior is driven by multiple and often conflicting attributes related to their socioeconomic cultural and natural situation including but not limited to profit ajzen 1991 gassman et al 2009 harman et al 1972 harper and eastman 1980 smith and capstick 1976 according to the tpb observed choices are governed by farmers attitudes towards their behavior where attitudes represent a summary of psychological evaluations based on agent s beliefs about the goodness or badness of an outcome which can be typically associated to a particular attribute gómez limón et al 2016 for example it would be reasonable to think that the decision of whether to plant a high risk high gain crop portfolio is associated to agent s attitudes towards higher profit goodness but also higher risk and or management complexity badness if farmers attitudes and beliefs concerning multiple attributes govern decision making modeling farmers behavior requires the consideration of a multi attribute utility function where relevant attributes are represented keeney and raiffa 1993 the microeconomic model used in this paper builds on the axioms of revealed preference houthakker 1950 samuelson 1938 to elicit a multi attribute objective function that is both consistent with an observed and finite set of choices and prices afriat 1967 diewert 1973 and the foundations of the tpb ajzen 1991 ajzen and fishbein 2000 the theory of revealed preference originates in samuelson s 1938 pure theory of consumer behavior where he derives testable implications of rational consumption behavior and demand for two different budget sets without the need to postulate a utility function to represent agent s preferences giving rise to the weak axiom of revealed preference samuelson 1948 1938 houthakker 1950 introduced the strong axiom of revealed preference sarp which uses transitivity to derive testable implications of rational consumption for any budget set and establishes a close link between the axioms about demand and those about preferences by showing that in order to satisfy sarp demand functions must be the observable result of the optimization of preferences subject to agent s budgetary constraint while the theoretical foundation for revealed preference theory provided by houthakker 1950 and samuelson 1948 1938 assumes a complete description of a demand system that gives quantities as a function of every possible budget and price the key development in applied revealed preference research is offered by afriat 1967 who develops a utility function consistent with agent s choices from an observed finite dataset of prices and choices thus providing the basis to estimate aggregate consumer demand functions christensen et al 1975 deaton 1986 revealed preference is becoming an increasingly relevant applied economics tool in areas as disparate as public goods research

relevant in the calibration of multi attribute utility models positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup models that build on the axioms of revealed preference have been used to elicit farmers

where x r n is the decision variable a vector representing the land share devoted to each individual crop x i i 1 n note that each crop i has a unique combination of attributes z x attached the rationale of agent s choices is explained by the provision of utility relevant attributes attributes are dimensionless quantities being the result of dividing the value they attain in the model when the utility function is maximized by their observed values attributes are defined so that more is better i e increasing the provision of one attribute improves agent s utility provided the provision of the remaining attributes is kept constant convexity holds i e increasing the provision of a given attribute will result in the reduction of another attribute if there is no tradeoff the choice becomes irrelevant and one of the attributes can be discarded the relevance each attribute has on agents decisions is determined by agents attitudes läpple and kelley 2013 poppenborg and koellner 2013 following the axioms of revealed preference it is possible to calibrate a utility function that captures these attitudes or preferences from realized agents choices and the resultant provision of attributes in doing so the pmaup model follows a positive approach i e the optimal solution to the problem above should match or at least be as close as possible to the observed crop portfolio x the calibration of the pmaup model thus aims to elicit an objective function that is consistent with x o and the choice domain f x and the detailed process is described in annex i 3 1 3 data agents in the pmaup model are the 55 agricultural water demand units awdus of the segura river basin located within the boundaries of the region of murcia the calibration year observed crop portfolio x o is 2013 data used in the pmaup model is conditional on the finite attribute set considered in the model calibration we explore five attributes based on a literature review on multi attribute utility functions bergevoet et al 2004 binswanger 1982 chung and lee 2009 delforce and hardaker 1985 gómez limón and riesgo 2004 hazell and scandizzo 1977a b just 1975 läpple and kelley 2013 lynne 1995 poppenborg and koellner 2013 rausser and yassour 1981 rodrigues et al 2013 attributes include profit z 1 risk avoidance z 2 total labor avoidance z 3 hired labor avoidance z 4 and direct costs avoidance per unit of revenue z 5 all attributes are quantities of dimension one and increasing their provision has a positive impact on the objective function more is better there is no risk of correlation among attributes since the outcome of the utility function is an ordinal value edgeworth 1881 this means that the model is not concerned about total utility or levels of utility but rather about ranking alternative decisions so that they are coherent with observed choices a detailed description of the attributes follows profit z 1 is the only variable explaining agent s behavior and response in single attribute models it is measured as the per hectare expected gross margin π i 6 z 1 x i x i π i risk avoidance z 2 the crop portfolio choice is comparable to a decision on a portfolio of financial assets in which the agent must balance assets with low expected return and risk say treasury bonds or subsidized crops and assets with high expected return and volatility say stock shares or vegetables the portfolio composition will depend on agent s attitudes towards profit and risk the utility relevance of risk has been repeatedly reported in the literature and is represented in this application of the model through risk avoidance z 2 7 z 2 x x τ v c v π x x x τ v c v π x x where v c v π x is the variance and covariance matrix of z 1 x and v c v π x is the variance and covariance matrix of z 1 x being x the crop portfolio with the highest possible risk within the domain it is possible that risk aversion and profit maximization alone are insufficient to explain observed agent s behavior rodrigues et al 2013 if this were the case we should witness a relevant distance between the realized and observed crop portfolio vectors meaning additional attributes are necessary to achieve an accurate representation of agent s behavior and response literature suggests the third most relevant attribute in explaining agent s behavior and response relates to management complexity chung and lee 2009 gómez limón and berbel 2000 gonçalves et al 2007 the main challenge in measuring management complexity resides in the qualitative nature of the attribute which may complicate its measurement and demand the use of proxy variables following pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 three attributes capturing management complexity aversion or management easiness are considered total labor avoidance hired labor avoidance and direct costs avoidance total labor avoidance z 3 including family and hired labor represents the effort to produce each crop in terms of working hours 8 z 3 x

the direct costs per unit of revenue incurred in the production of the crop portfolio x d x i x i d i are the direct costs per unit of revenue incurred in the production of the crop portfolio x with the highest direct costs to revenue ratio within the domain and d i are the direct costs per unit of revenue and hectare of crop i the model is flexible and could be used to explore additional attributes using the same calibration method explained above for example it could be informative to explore the role of climate weather and market forecasts on agents behavior this is nonetheless limited by the availability of data which ultimately constrains the use of additional attributes in our case study area it should be noted that the inclusion of additional attributes does not guarantee more accurate calibration and results only if attributes are relevant in explaining agents decisions errors will be reduced and accuracy improved data collection aims at supplying the necessary information to quantify the attributes listed above land use data per crop is obtained at a municipal level for the calibration year from región de murcia 2015 and disaggregated at an awdu

ciscar et al 2011 and global scale hertel 1997 lenzen et al 2012 2013 the two most commonly used models to assess the economy wide impacts of environmental changes and policies are computable general equilibrium cge and input output io models io models reflect the economic interdependencies between sectors and regions within an economy through intermediate supply and final demand based on linear relations koks and thissen 2016 linear io models applied to water typically combine input output matrices and water accounts and apply a structural decomposition analysis that disaggregates the effects of a given shock on economic outputs and water use at different levels from urban wang et al 2009 to multi regional wan et al 2016 due to their descriptive nature researchers have frequently resorted to io models to determine which sectors consume more water both directly and indirectly bogra et al 2016 estimate their productivity apparent and induced duarte et al 2002 assess their exposure and vulnerability to shortages zhao et al 2015 and support the design of water and agricultural policy gonzález 2011 llop 2008 even though much progress has been made in io models to assess the economic impacts of natural disasters and environmental changes they still insufficiently tackle two major issues i the fact that a disruption such as a drought is most often a shock in the supply side of the production chain which cannot be modeled using conventional io analysis ii the absence of price changes in the io approach can limit the analysis of substitution possibilities between different economic activities and would prevent the possibility of coupling with microeconomic or bottom up models through price feedbacks within a macro economic framework cge models capture these feedback effects from the macroeconomic context on the sectors and markets initially affected by the policy or shock rose 2009 in doing so they avoid double counting issues that often affect conventional partial equilibrium assessments pauw et al 2011 in cge models agent behavior is calibrated from observed economic flows registered in social accounting matrices these models often follow a walrasian framework where investments are saving driven and agents minimize private expenditure to attain a given utility level bosello et al 2014 parrado and de cian 2014 cge models have a long tradition in assessing agricultural water management in this framework competition for water can be represented either implicitly irrigated land which itself embodies water or explicitly the latter approach is used e g by darwin et al 1995 who explicitly represent water in a cge framework relying on available estimations in the us to assign a price and value share to water replication of this approach elsewhere can be challenging due to limited information on use value and prices even more important recent research rightly claims that the shadow price of water must correspond to the gap between irrigated and rainfed production to pay for the returns to water accordingly in berrittella et al 2007 irrigated land production is represented using a nested constant elasticity of substitution ces function in which water and other inputs enter in a fixed proportion water demand responds to a water rent which in turn derives from supply constraints calzadilla et al 2011 use a more flexible three level ces production function which allows for different degrees of substitutability between inputs at each level and permits two ways of reallocating water substituting other inputs for water and reducing demand for water intensive products yet since rainfed and irrigated production appear as part of the same aggregate national production function it is not possible to stop irrigating an area in favor of rainfed agriculture a major weakness that complicates policy assessment e g irrigation restrictions this shortcoming is addressed in taheripour et al 2013 s global model which makes the irrigated and rainfed production functions operate independently by allowing for competition for resources at two layers competition for water within river basins and competition for land within agro ecological zones a similar approach has been extensively explored at a regional and country level as well dixon et al 2012 2011 tirado et al 2010 two major issues are typically identified in cge water policy modeling i limited spatial detail hertel and liu 2016 and ii the fact that the adjustment dynamics of the model relies on the existence of full fledged commodity markets a prerequisite that does not reflect the specificity of water allocation regimes perhaps with the exception of the water markets of australia chile and the semi arid states of western us oecd 2015 the regionalization of the cge model allows us to increase the spatial detail of the macro economic tool and provide a more realistic level of granularity for coupling it with the microeconomic pmaup model while ensuring micro and macro economic modeling consistency 3 2 2 theoretical structure the cge model used in this study is a regionalized nuts2 3 the nomenclature des unités territoriales

spain the rest of eu28 and the rest of the world as shown in table 1 there are 8 crop sectors in the cge model database which will be used to map and aggregate data from the pmaup model the most

contrary labor and capital are perfectly mobile across sectors within a region land supply at the sectoral level is modelled through a constant elasticity of transformation cet which allocates the exogenous overall regional land to agricultural sectors according to sector specific land rents this implies that land can be shifted from one crop use to another depending of the land rent offered by each crop the first order conditions of the cet function for land are obtained from the following maximization problem 14 m a x w f j s j agr w f j s q f j s f l a n d j a g r i c u l t u r e s e c t

gtap model which are not differentiated by region 3 2 3 data the model is calibrated on a regionalized version of the gtap 8 1 database narayanan et al 2012 which is a collection of social accounting matrices sams for 57 economic sectors and 134 countries regions of the world for the base year 2007 to regionalize the national sam of spain in the gtap database into the 17 nuts 2 regions we use information coming from the spanish regional accounting instituto nacional de estadística ine 2017 ine provides some additional detail on both capital and labor but at the expense of a less refined sectoral resolution especially in some industrial sectors for some manufacturing activities we refer to structural business statistics eurostat 2016 because they have a richer detail of these sectors for the agricultural economic components of value added we mainly rely on the economic accounts for agriculture eurostat 2016 because the information has a good level of sectoral resolution and is already standardized across the eu nuts regions practically the first operation of the regionalization consists in matching the gtap sectoral detail with that of our data sources then for each sector the regional shares of value added and accordingly of labor capital land and natural resources are applied to the corresponding gtap value for spain in order to distribute this value across the different sub national units a challenging task to be achieved in the database construction is the derivation of the sub national domestic demand and trade with other regions within the country these data are often missing and need to be computed using different techniques we adopt the so called simple locations quotients slqs bonfiglio 2008 bonfiglio and chelli 2008 miller and blair 2009 slqs provide a measure of the sectoral specialization in the regional economy and starting from this it is possible to determine the domestic demand and aggregate demand for imports then a gravitational approach in line with dixon et al 2012 and wittwer and horridge 2010 is implemented to split the bilateral trade flows across sub national regions an exhaustive description of the methodology can be found in bosello and standardi 2015 4 implementing the iterative micro macroeconomic feedback 4 1 the water policy shock in step 1 of the iterative process water charges g are increased for every agent in the microeconomic model while in step 2 the utility maximizing crop portfolio x g p 0 and related utility u g p 0 and gva v a g p 0 are estimated using the calibrated objective functions the gva is a function of the gross margin z 1 g p 0 and hired labor z 4 g p 0 and can be obtained as follows 21 v a g p 0 f z 1 g p 0 z 4 g p 0 where p 0 represents the initial set of crop prices the resulting gva before v a o p 0 and after the policy shock v a g p 0 provide the rate of change that is translated as a shock on the productivity of primary factors thus the productivity shock γ g p 0 j for each crop sector j is calculated as the percentage change of gva carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 22 γ g p 0 j γ j v a g p 0 j v a 0 p 0 j 1 100 where γ j is a fixed coefficient that captures the fraction of the gva of crop sector j in murcia that is produced within the awdus of the region whose value is obtained as the ratio of gva in the awdus to total gva in murcia for crop j for the base year 2007 observed values in step 3 the productivity shock γ g p 0 j is uniformly applied to primary factors f used by each crop crop category j of the murcia region s mur in the cge model therefore the productivity shock corresponding to a given water charge from the policy introduces the variations of gva from the pmaup model in the cge framework 23 v a g p 0 j m u r f γ g p 0 j v f j m u r σ j f l a n d l a b o r c a p i t a l j a g r i c u l t u r a l c r o p s 4 2 the price feedback as mentioned in the description of the cge model all prices change to clear markets when supply equals demand the updated crop prices are then fed to the pmaup model in the next iteration repeating step 2 these updated prices p 1 will affect the provision of attributes that are derived from every possible crop portfolio decision this will result in a new optimal solution to the problem in eqs 1 to 5 agents will choose to plant a new utility maximizing crop portfolio x g p 1 which in turn will lead to an updated gva v a g p 1 the latter can be obtained as follows 24 v a g p 1 f z 1 g p 1 z 4 g p 1 where p 1 represents the updated crop prices set provided by the cge model in iteration 1 next we repeat the process above to obtain the updated gva values to calculate the new productivity shock that will feed the cge γ g p 1 in step 3 25 γ g p 1 j γ j v a g p 1 j v a 0 p 0 j 1 100 again the updated productivity shock γ g p 1 is applied to primary factors f used by each crop j of the murcia region s mur in the cge model 26 v a g p 1 j m u r f γ g p 1 j v f j m u r σ j f l a n d l a b o r c a p i t a l j a g r i c u l t u r a l c r o p s the process is repeated until the sum over all crop sectors of the absolute value of the differences between the current and the previous iterations for the changes in crops prices in the cge and gross value added in the pmaup model is below 0 00001 where convergence between the two models is assumed this process following the description of fig 2 has been used to test different water charge values to provide insights about the advantages of considering the micro macro feedbacks within water policy assessment 5 results a series of simulations are run in which water charges in murcia are progressively increased in every awdu from eur 0 05 m3 to eur 0 30 m3 at eur 0 05 intervals this is a feasible range for the proposed analysis representing an average increase between 55 6 and 333 the average water charge in the segura river basin is eur 0 09 m3 agents reassess their crop portfolio decisions according to their objective function and the new water charge higher water charges typically reduce utility and depress income and gva in irrigated agriculture through reduced labor inputs z 4 and profit z 1 the inclusion of crop prices feedbacks from the macroeconomic model results in updated adaptation strategies defined by new crop portfolio decisions 5 1 agents adaptive responses in the coupled pmaup cge framework fig 3 shows the impact of higher water charges on land use allocation for the main crop categories cultivated in murcia wheat other cereals and vegetables and fruits distinguishing between irrigated and rainfed crops there is a substitution of irrigated cultivars for rainfed ones wheat and other cereals with rainfed cereals other than wheat being preferred over the latter in the case of wheat the increase in the use of rainfed land partially mitigates the loss of irrigated land devoted to wheat between 41 for a water charge increase of eur 0 05 m3 and 63 for eur 0 3 m3 in the case of other cereals irrigated land reduction is more than compensated by rainfed land increases resulting in rainfed land for other cereals increasing above the reduction of irrigated land by 1 water charge increase of eur 0 05 m3 and 118 eur 0 3 m3 vegetables and fruits i e irrigated only crops show a steady land use share until a water charge increase of eur 0 15 m3 beyond this point they start being replaced by rainfed crops other cereals this is explained because vegetables and fruits are high value added crops able to absorb the burden of higher water charges up to a charge increase of eur 0 15 m3 yet after this threshold farmers are constrained to reduce the surface allotted to these crops fig 4 shows the effects of higher water charges on gva produced by the pmaup model including feedbacks from the cge model for wheat other cereals and vegetables and fruits as expected the impact of the policy is higher in water intensive crops such as vegetables and fruits which show a steady reduction of gva along with increasing water charges aggregate gva losses range from 5 with a water charge of eur 0 05 m3 to 25 when the water charge is eur 0 30 m3 interestingly wheat and other cereals show some resilience to higher water charges when water prices go above eur 0 15 m3 and eur 0 10 m3 respectively the fact that cereals can revert gva losses at water charges above eur 0 10 m3 other cereals and eur 0 15 m3 wheat is explained by the substitution of irrigated land that becomes financially unsustainable under the new water charges e g vegetables by rainfed land which mitigates gva losses in the wheat and other cereals crop categories see also what happened with land use as explained in fig 3 note that the contribution of wheat and other cereals to aggregate gva is marginal as shown in fig 4 where aggregate gva losses almost match gva losses in the vegetables and fruits category when the reduction of gva from the pmaup model is reproduced in the cge model agricultural commodity prices increase not only because water charges increase production costs but also because now there is an induced scarcity of irrigated commodities due to farmers decision to produce less water intensive crops in the pmaup model as shown in fig 5 this scarcity is explained because population does not change when the water charge is imposed and households demand is determined by population and their budgets which do not change significantly in the short run either since the demand for agricultural commodities as well as food is relatively inelastic prices in the cge model increase to clear agricultural markets following a reduction in the supply of agricultural commodities because of the significant gap between the expected profit of irrigated and rainfed crops in murcia water demand shows an inelastic response to incremental charges in our simulations see fig 6 a the maximum amount of water consumption i e evaporation and transpiration from the field that can be conserved for other uses according to our simulations is 126 8 million m3 or 10 6 of initial water consumption x axis fig 6b following a charge increase of 0 30 euro m3 333 on the other hand the inelastic response to incremental charges suggests a high ability to pay that can underpin more ambitious cost recovery a charge increase of 0 05 euro m3 55 6 increases tariff revenue 4 the tariff revenue is the total amount of money collected through the water policy and is obtained as the volume of water consumption m3 times the average water charge euro m3 4 by 64 2 million euro 51 9 while a charge increase of 0 30 euro m3 333 increases tariff revenue by 355 6 million euro 287 3 recall that water infrastructures cost recovery ratios in the segura river basin range from 54 08 to 80 82 as mentioned in section 2 fig 6b shows the tariff revenue predicted by the coupled pmaup cge model and sums it to the foregone gva to produce a measure of the economic efficiency loss from the water charging policy using market values only i e the environmental and other benefits of the charging policy through water conservation are not accounted for 5 2 pmaup cge v pmaup differences in describing farmers adaptive responses when higher crop prices are fed back to the pmaup model the reduction in the expected profit z 1 of irrigated crops is mitigated and farmers will reassess their initial decision following the iterative micro macro feedback described in section 4 fig 7 shows the percentage difference in gva between the solution including the iterative feedbacks from the cge model and the isolated one step solution of the pmaup model the most relevant effect is that gva in vegetables and fruits categories which represent more than 95 of the gva in the baseline does not decrease as much in the coupled pmaup cge as the stand alone pmaup model would predict overall the coupled iterative process yields a gva that is between 0 4 and 4 2 higher than the solution of the pmaup model without considering micro macro feedbacks gva losses a measure of water overallocation abatement costs are between 9 6 and 12 2 higher in the stand alone pmaup model than in the coupled pmaup cge model note that in other micro macro economic coupled models where price feedbacks are not considered the effect is typically the contrary impacts on the agricultural sector of the case study area at a microeconomic level are amplified at a macroeconomic scale pérez blanco et al 2016b this dichotomy is largely explained by the inelastic demand for agricultural goods which suggests households will be willing to pay a higher price for agricultural commodities following a hypothetical water charge that increases production costs and reduces supply thus balancing and eventually reversing the negative impact on gva caused by yield reduction through price increases while this effect is evident for irrigated crops there is an ambiguous impact for wheat and other cereals that can be irrigated or rainfed in this case gva estimations in the coupled pmaup cge model fluctuate around the value predicted by the pmaup model although the adjustment dynamics differ fig 8 shows the differences in water conservation and revenue raising between the pmaup cge coupled framework and the stand alone pmaup model by crop category in stacked columns while the total amount is represented by the black thick line the relatively higher expected profit attribute z 1 in the pmaup of irrigated crops in the pmaup cge framework typically increases water consumption as compared to the stand alone pmaup model albeit only marginally values range from 0 01 to 0 14 and the amount of water conserved in the pmaup and coupled pmaup cge remains similar around 1 difference yet the decomposition of water conservation by crop category provides relevant insights fig 8a for instance at an incremental water charge of eur 0 05 m3 the category other cereals reduces water consumption by more than 2 5 million m3 in the coupled pmaup cge model as compared to the pmaup model a reduction that is almost compensated by a comparable increase in water consumption by vegetables fruits and other crops incremental water charges above eur 0 10 m3 result in higher water consumption values in the coupled pmaup cge framework as compared to the stand alone pmaup model particularly by wheat at eur 0 15 m3 vegetables and fruits above eur 0 10 m3 and other cereals above eur 0 20 m3 these results highlight the importance of including the price feedback from the cge model in the pmaup model which affects farmers decisions and produces a reallocation of water consumption among agricultural activities crops on the other hand the tariff revenue predicted by the pmaup cge framework is typically higher than that of the pmaup model fig 8b mainly because of the higher water consumption by vegetables fruits and wheat in the coupled model differences in tariff revenue predictions of both models like those in water consumption conservation are small from 0 01 to 0 14 higher in the coupled pmaup cge model note that charges are applied to withdrawals instead of consumption the ratio of consumption to withdrawals differs among awdus due to asymmetries in irrigation technology adoption and this explains differences in the tariff revenue and water conservation structure the comparable tariff revenue in both models along with lower significant gva loss estimates in the coupled pmaup cge model result in a lower economic efficiency loss in murcia s markets up to 65 lower in the pmaup cge as compared to the stand alone pmaup model fig 9 b for incremental charges above eur 0 10 m3 we observe a tradeoff between economic and environmental performance since the lower economic efficiency loss predicted by the pmaup cge model comes at the expense of reduced water conservation as compared to the pmaup model on the contrary incremental charges up to eur 0 10 m3 could lead to comparable slightly higher conservation in the coupled model fig 9a this would be the outcome of shifting irrigated cereals and other crops to rainfed agriculture as shown before in fig 8a 6 discussion applicability and limitations of the model results from the coupled pmaup cge model presented in this paper suggest that micro macro feedbacks have a meaningful impact on two fundamental economic variables that determine policy performance i price feedbacks from the cge model affect economic efficiency e g mitigating efficiency losses from irrigation restriction through higher crop prices that partially compensate the negative effects on revenue of yield reduction ii changes in economic efficiency following policy implementation also conditions effectiveness more resilient economies with relatively low efficiency losses may be less responsive to policy stimuli which may hamper the effect of policy interventions on the quantitative and or qualitative status of the environmental asset the analysis of the case study in the murcia region in spain confirms the relevance of accounting for micro macroeconomic feedbacks in environmental policy modeling and water policy modeling in particular results suggest that policy simulations using stand alone microeconomic models with exogenous prices may underestimate the adaptive capacity of irrigators and overestimate policy abatement costs in the case of water charges in the murcia region up to 12 2 for a 30 eurocents m3 incremental water charge the same applies for sequential non recursive coupled models that disregard micro macroeconomic price feedbacks in such models macroeconomic simulations tend to amplify economic impacts as compared to microeconomic estimations carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 pérez blanco et al 2016b pérez blanco and standardi 2019 while in our pmaup cge model macroeconomic simulations mitigate economic impacts as compared to microeconomic estimations the assessment of policy effectiveness may be also affected by model choice and although our results show a marginal incidence on water conservation up to 0 14 less water conserved in the coupled pmaup cge model as compared to the stand alone microeconomic pmaup model there is a relevant reallocation of water resources among crops once we introduce the cge price feedback in the pmaup model the dynamics explaining these outcomes work as follows 1 higher water charges increase production costs at a farm level and reduce supply of water intensive commodities at a macro level 2 given the relatively inelastic household demand for food the scarcity of water intensive commodities results in relatively higher commodity prices and a higher expected income in the micro macro model as compared to the micro model 3 irrigators adapt to the higher expected income of water intensive commodities in the coupled model this leads to a reorganization of the crop portfolio which mitigates gva and economic efficiency losses and can result in slightly lower comparable or higher water conservation depending on price feedbacks from the cge model while micro macro feedback links are relevant for policy modeling design and implementation our approach is one among many possible model settings and modeling alternatives worth exploring in what follows we identify and discuss what we see as critical aspects to enhance applicability and address limitations of micro macro coupled models detail due to their very nature and objective as accurate yet as simple as possible representations of reality models cannot incorporate all the details of complex human and or water systems yet there are several improvements that can be made towards delivering a socio ecologic model that can assess the adjustment dynamics of complex socio ecologic systems in economic terms the model could explore alternative and or complementary coupling variables for example the current version of the model follows the conventional micro to macro link that uses gva as the coupling variable yet some cge models now incorporate information on land use distribution per crop category sometimes at a regional level which could be used as an alternative coupling variable e g reproducing the micro crop portfolio in the macro model also the price feedback we introduce in our iterative framework could be expanded to consider not only output prices i e crop prices but also input prices e g labor in ecologic terms factors such as climatic and hydrologic changes should be considered for example hydrologic aspects could be incorporated through the extension of the current framework to include a hydrologic module that accounts for multi directional two way feedbacks between human human micro macroeconomic and human water hydro micro macroeconomic systems simplicity as noted above there are alternatives available to make our modeling framework encompass more systems and details within each system however scientists working at the human water interface need to bear in mind that models are ultimately tools to inform policy decisions and that policy makers are not necessarily knowledgeable about economic hydrologic and or hydroeconomic modeling for example while having exogenous prices in microeconomic models may limit our understanding of the system dynamics and our ability to accurately represent actual efficiency and effectiveness performance of a given policy this assumption is reasonable where that policy affects an area with limited incidence on commodity markets and prices e g a policy targeting a small number of segura river basin s awdus in less economically relevant upstream areas conversely policies working at a large scale and looking at variables that can be adequately represented in a macroeconomic framework can go without a detailed microeconomic or ecological model although this is typically not the case of water resources management this simplifies modeling and makes it easier for non modelers such as policy makers to improve their understanding of the system dynamics thus contributing to better informed decisions modeling errors the modeling framework presented here can be used to identify optimal agricultural water conservation policies including economy wide interlinkages and using a consolidative modeling approach to abatement cost effectiveness analysis contingent on the existence of a known set of possible states and related probabilities whether this standard consolidative modeling approach should be applied where estimations on policy performance are sensitive to simplifications and mathematical assumptions about the probability of the states e g future water availability and demands is nonetheless debatable critically complex adaptive socio ecological systems such as human water systems are characterized by positive feedbacks micro macroeconomic but also between human and ecological systems non mechanistic dynamics and multiple equilibria which call for the use of exploratory modeling methods and heuristics with the objective of seeking for robust rather than optimal solutions anderies et al 2004 to this end the modeling framework above needs to be expanded to carry out experiments with ensembles of one varying initial states and forcings or multiple multi model socio ecologic models to assess the implications of different assumptions about the system s and select those policies that produce acceptable outcomes in most models and scenario simulations static robustness cloke et al 2013 in economic terms the inclusion of alternative pmaup and cge model settings and that of alternative models at a micro and macro economic level could be explored to create an exploratory ensemble framework modeling efforts should be complemented with measures of transaction costs that allow a complete cost effectiveness analysis and facilitate the identification and avoidance of irreversible path dependence adaptation strategies adaptive robustness garrick 2015 heuristics a close involvement and interaction with stakeholders notably policy makers is critical to design credible and relevant policy scenarios develop appropriate and understandable methods deliver results gather feedback jointly evaluate criteria for policy performance assessment and catalyze policy implementation stakeholder engagement is particularly relevant to understand and manage uncertainty in policy design and for research results appropriation uncertainty constrains policy makers to complement the mechanistic deductive approach of conventional scientific analysis e g cost effectiveness with expert knowledge and opinion using heuristic methods where the objective is to avoid unfavorable contingencies i e robustness strengthening science policy synergies underpins the provision and appropriation of relevant information to stakeholders ensuring that policy responses are supported by sound science recommendations and empirically based expert discussions to this end a co development approach can be followed to engage key stakeholders in a process that 1 provides an assessment framework that enables the appropriation of solutions by stakeholders 2 improves understanding and management of uncertainty and 3 catalyzes informed cost effective feasible and robust policies the exact way this process should be implemented and funded is out of the scope of this paper but we foresee at least two alternatives the first one involves public institutions e g regional authorities establishing an open interactive decision support system for all interested agents to use the coupling framework and to provide relevant feedback in the process the other alternative involves a subscription service based on georeferenced information that provides a set of scenario analyses to institutions farmers and other interested stakeholders thus turning all interested groups into customers that contribute financially to the further development and maintenance of the service conventional business and marketing strategy however the imitation of conventional business and marketing strategies may be not or less suitable for the provision of water resources management services such as the service described here first the value of the service is only revealed when the users customers realize the cost saving or value added potentials which they may obtain from exploiting the service for the adoption of the policy second users of water resources management services are an integral component of value creation by complementing the service with own products e g river basins own hydrological models in a future hydro micro macroeconomic model and knowledge meaning that if key stakeholders decide not to participate relevant feedback to fine tune the service will be lost prahalad and ramaswamy 2004 an open co development process that engages all relevant stakeholders in a constructive dialogue is more likely to contribute to the design and delivery of an effective service that bridges gaps in existing hydro economic services 7 conclusions feedbacks between micro and macro economic systems are relevant and should not be neglected yet conventional abatement costs analysis still relies on micro or macro economic models sometimes coupled with hydrological models i e hydroeconomic where micro and macro economic models interact a one way micro to macro economic information flow is predominant hence failing to capture proper interlinkages two way feedbacks between human human micro macroeconomic and human water systems hydro micro macroeconomic that shape abatement costs neglecting these interlinkages in complex human water systems is likely to result in inaccurate system robustness and resilience modeling maladaptation and ineffective policies as a first step this paper adopts a modular approach to supply two way connections between micro and macro economic modules enabling system functionalities potentially not achievable by isolated modules models these modules are interconnected through an iterative coupling framework that makes them mutually consistent enabling also the provision of a replicable and flexible framework results from an application to irrigation water charges in the murcia region in spain show that the coupled micro macro model yields significantly lower abatement costs as compared to the stand alone micro model acknowledgements the research leading to these results has received funding from the european union s horizon 2020

minimize the distance between observed and simulated decisions a marginal rate of transformation the efficient frontier represents the maximum value of attribute z p x the economic agent can attain for a given value of attribute z k x p k within the space of feasible decisions f x real life efficient frontiers cannot be analytically defined using a closed function instead numerical methods through an optimization procedure are typically used as follows ai 2 m a x z p x x ai 3 s t z k x c k p c 0 1 ai 4 0 x i 1 ai 5 i 1 n x i 1 ai 6 x f x where c 0 1 is a finite set that determines the values of attribute z k for which the values of attribute z p are projected recall attributes are values of dimension one solving the optimization problem above we obtain an efficient frontier in the two dimensional space which can be defined as τ z p z k x where x is the set of crop choices delivering a provision of attributes z p z k along the frontier a number of alternatives exist to reveal the landing point at which the m r t k p equals the m r s k p amador et al 1998 andré et al 2010 and sumpsi et al 1997 maximize each attribute separately within the domain to calculate the pay off matrix i e the maximum value each attribute can attain within the domain and approximate the efficient frontier through a hyper plane connecting two efficient points included in the pay off matrix segment formed by points a and b in two dimensions in fig a1 case 1 andré and riesgo 2007 project the observed choice to the closest efficient point x i e along the actual frontier which is then used as a reference point to obtain a compromise set consisting of a set of efficient points in the vicinity the compromise set is interpreted as the fraction of the efficient frontier where the utility function is maximized then the landing area or tangency point for the indifference curve is obtained by regressing a hyper plane from the compromise set segment formed by points a and b in fig a1 case

the two points to approximate the efficient frontier segment formed by points a and b in fig a1 case 3 since efficient frontiers are convex the hyper planes connecting efficient points will not belong to the actual efficient set x and will lead to approximation errors distance between the segment ab and x in fig a1 this paper follows the method proposed by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 case 3 which minimizes the approximation error for the database of the case study area pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 through the projection of the observed crop portfolio τ z p z k x o to the

functions varian 1982 presented a way to describe the entire set of utility functions consistent with observed preferences while varian 1983 obtained bounds on specific functional forms in the case of the multi attribute pmaup model presented here the information provided by the m r t k p and m r s k p makes feasible the elicitation of the parameters of a multi attribute utility function consistent with observed choices within the domain f x for a given functional form considered in this application the utility function adopts a cobb douglas specification as compared to alternative additive or multiplicative additive specifications a cobb douglas function offers the advantages of decreasing marginal utility for each attribute and the existence of a global optimum inada 1963 and provides a

important to acknowledge that utility function parameters are not absolute values since choices are constrained by the domain for example agents with a high α 1 value where the domain restricts profitable crop portfolios may display lower profit than others with a lower α 1 value and less constraining domain annex ii simplified dynamic system representing the coupling framework to analyze the convergence potential of the coupling framework we use a simplified linear dynamic system of two differential equations as the main elements of the system considering one single commodity which for the sake of simplicity could represent aggregated agricultural output each model in the coupling procedure is represented by a differential equation that summarizes its behavior in the following notation the dot over each variable represents the evolution of the variable or its derivative with respect to time while each model at the initial stage is in equilibrium the coupling procedure means that the information exchanged between models will shift them away from their initial equilibrium until they find another one in which both models will converge as explained in the methods section the first shock is the increase in water charges in the pmaup model which will in turn produce a change in gross value added gva that will be fed to the cge model then the cge model will produce a change in prices to clear all markets and the new prices will be fed back to the pmaup model the process will iterate until a new equilibrium is found the first equation represents the microeconomic model pmaup that produces as the main output the gva g the evolution of gva g is a function of the agricultural commodity price p minus the initial equilibrium price p0 and an additional water charge t the additional water charge t reduces gva through increased production costs parameter a1 represents the velocity of adjustment for gva in the system aii 1 g a 1 p p 0 t a 1 p 0 0 eq aii 1 evaluates the changes in the price of the commodity with respect to the initial equilibrium price value p0 indicating that if prices are higher than a threshold set by the initial price plus the additional water charge then gva will increase but if prices fall below that threshold then gva will decrease if the water charge t is exogenously raised then the model will shift from its initial equilibrium and gva will decrease due to increased production costs the second equation represents the macroeconomic feedback on prices from the market equilibrium derived from the cge model with the commodity price p as the main output in this equation the evolution of the price level p depends on the equilibrium condition indicating that supply ys equals demand yd therefore if supply falls below demand prices should increase to reflect the scarcity of the commodity conversely if supply is greater than demand then prices should fall to clear the market parameter a2 is the velocity of adjustment of prices in the system aii 2 p a 2 y d y s a 2 0 supply ys is represented in eq aii 3 stating that the production of the commodity is directly proportional to gva and this relationship is determined by parameter b 1 0 while demand yd is an inversely proportional function of the price level as represented in eq aii 4 aii 3 y s b 1 g b 1 0 aii 4 y d c 1 c 2 p c 1 c 2 0 substituting eq aii 3 and eq aii 4 in eq aii 2 we obtain a two differential equations system aii 5 g a 1 p p 0 t p a 2 c 1 c 2 p b 1 g the equilibrium of the system is reached where both g 0 and p 0 i e where aii 6 g o a 1 p p 0 t 0 aii 7 p 0 a 2

c 2 p b 1 g the jacobian matrix of the two equation system is useful to demonstrate the stability of the system considering the values of its determinant δ and its trace τ aii 11 j g g g p p g p p 0 a

represented in fig a2 the evolution of the system depends on the flexibility of each one of its components in this case the paump and cge models each model has its own set of assumptions that lead to a specific parametrization however when two models are used in a coupling framework each one must be adapted according to the characteristics of the other one in order to exchange information consistently either by fine tuning some parameters or by adjusting conflicting modules this is in accordance with the existing studies discussing the convergence of land use and cge models hasegawa et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2009 as described in the methods section for example since the pmaup model computes the changes in gva considering the agricultural production process in a more refined way that the cge model then the cge model has been adapted to use that input by changing the specification of the agricultural production process so to follow the trends derived from the pmaup model the convergence trajectory of the system following an exogenous water charge shock can be represented as the black thick curve in fig a2 the process would start at some point at the bottom left quadrant i where gva and production decreases g 0 due to the water charge consequently prices would increase p 0 to clear the market and the system would move to its equilibrium point while the simplified dynamic system representing the coupling procedure of two models is stable as demonstrated in eq aii 12 if the two models are not adapted for the information exchange depending on the variables and parameters of each model then achieving convergence would be more difficult since the models would produce larger changes in each iteration step which could imply fluctuations of both g and p moving along the four quadrants identified in fig a2 for instance beginning in the bottom left quadrant i and following an increase in the water charge the trajectory could move to the upper left quadrant ii where gva increases driven by higher prices next the trajectory would move to the upper right quadrant iii in which due to the increase in gva and production there is an excess of supply which is cleared in the market by lowering prices with lower prices the next effect is the reduction in the gva shown in the bottom right quadrant iv this evolution would in any case end up in the equilibrium point as demonstrated above given the stable nature of the system this linear dynamic model is intended to analyze the main dynamics of the coupling process using a simplistic representation of the coupling framework that focuses on the most important variables and using a representative commodity its objective is to help understand the dynamics of the coupling process and to provide insights on the key coupling variables and their dynamics that can then be extended to the case of multiple markets 
6760,most water conservation policies will target agriculture the largest human consumptive use and that concentrating the marginal i e least productive uses of the resource adaptation to irrigation rationing policies at the micro level will have an impact on agricultural outputs and propagate to the rest of the economic sectors at a regional and supra regional macro scale as the economy

a decentralized non parametric positive multi attribute utility programming representation of irrigators and a regionally calibrated computable general equilibrium model to assess interlinkages i e

introduction water crises are consistently identified as one of the greatest global threats in terms of impact wef 2018 2017 2016 2015 conventional responses to this challenge have relied on water infrastructures to expand the supply base randall 1981 yet as provisioning costs escalate and supply becomes inelastic policy makers are constrained to adapt withdrawals to the limited resources available oecd 2015 most water conservation policies will target agriculture the largest human consumptive use and that concentrating the marginal i e least productive uses of the resource adaptation to water rationing policies at the micro level will have an impact on agricultural outputs and propagate to the rest of the economic sectors at a regional and supra regional macro scale as the economy transitions towards new equilibrium commodity prices the relevant prices for agriculture will change and this will in turn affect irrigators decisions to the best of our knowledge this micro macro interlinkage has not been explored thus far in the literature assessment of water rationing policies typically relies on stand alone micro graveline 2016 or macro economic models hertel and liu 2016 sometimes coupled with hydrologic models i e hydroeconomic developing a holistic approach to represent and understand micro macro interlinkages under a single integrated modeling framework is challenging since micro and macro economic models follow their own complex optimization procedures and making them compatible will demand oversimplification e g piecewise functions harou et al 2009 pindyck 2015 against this background research has resorted to modular approaches that make use of a sequential process to represent complex micro macroeconomic dynamics while ensuring model completeness carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 pérez blanco et al 2016b however this approach does not address the interdependency between the outputs of micro and macro economic models which may raise consistency issues pindyck 2015 to bridge this gap this paper proposes an iterative coupling process between a micro and a macro economic model to improve the analysis of water policy implementation at the microeconomic scale there is a multi factor non linear positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup model calibrated for representative agricultural water users gómez limón et al 2016 gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 while at the macroeconomic scale there is a regionally calibrated computable general equilibrium cge model bosello and standardi 2015 carrera et al 2015 as happens with other micro economic calibrated models for water allocation in agricultural production prices are exogenous in the pmaup model graveline 2016 while prices are endogenous in the cge model its adjustment dynamics rely on the existence of full fledged input markets that are not consistent with most water allocation regimes worldwide where historical rights and queuing are used to allocate available resources grafton et al 2011 and prices represent administrative charges to partially recover the cost of conveying water to users gomez et al 2017 the use of a modular approach to represent micro macroeconomic feedbacks allows us to reconcile the market adjustment dynamics of cge models with actual water abstraction licensing policies existing in most regions worldwide while consistently linking a common set of agricultural commodity prices between the pmaup and cge models methods are illustrated with a hypothetical water charging policy in the murcia region in southeastern spain which encompasses most of the water scarce and drought prone segura river basin 2 case study area murcia spreads over an area of 11 313 km2 and has a population of 1 5 million inhabitants the gdp per capita is eur 19 089 eurostat 2016 the region of murcia is highly dependent on agriculture which represents 4 4 of regional gdp and 10 4 of regional employment as compared to 2 3 and 4 at a national level food industry and tourism closely connected to the agricultural sector account for 4 5 and 5 6 of the gdp respectively ine 2017 relevant water policy impacts on and feedbacks from the output of economic sectors in the region can be anticipated from this sectorial gdp distribution the region is located within and encompasses most of the absolute water scarce segura river basin since the 1950s the segura river basin has heavily invested in water infrastructures including the construction of water wells desalination plants wastewater treatment plants and an inter basin transfer from the tagus river basin located 272 km away the largest water infrastructure in spain yet the segura river basin is now a closed basin srba 2015a water works have failed to meaningfully expand the supply base and this inelastic supply is increasingly insufficient to meet growing demand particularly from agriculture which now represents 86 of the 1829 million cubic meters withdrawn annually this has resulted in a water exploitation index ratio of withdrawals to renewable resources including transfers and non conventional wastewater and desalination resources of 1 15 the second largest in europe srba 2015a agricultural water use rights in the segura river basin are allotted to agricultural water demand units awdu awdus are the representative agent in the pmaup model and comprise irrigation communities that share a common water source and have similar administrative and hydrological characteristics srba 2015a in this study we focus on the 55 awdus of the segura river basin located within the boundaries of the region of murcia see fig 1 the most important irrigated crops in these awdus are vegetables and fruits which represent more than 95 of gross value added gva in 2013 followed by wheat 0 6 other cereals 2 2 and other crops 1 8 looking at the distribution of gva between irrigated and non irrigated land in murcia s awdus wheat and other cereals have relatively low irrigation shares 19 and 11 respectively while vegetables and fruits are mostly irrigated average water charges in the segura river basin equal eur 0 09 m3 the largest in spain although there is considerable heterogeneity values range from eur 0 36 m3 for desalinated water and eur 0 22 m3 for water served from the tagus segura water transfer to eur 0 m3 in awdus supplied with groundwater srba 2015a charges are insufficient to recover the costs stemming from water works investments cost recovery ratios range between 54 08 for surface water to 80 82 for the tagus segura water transfer let alone environmental and resource costs pérez blanco et al 2015 following eu guidelines ec 2015a 2015b 2009 the segura river basin authority is now in the process of designing transformative changes to the water allocation regime in which agricultural water charging is expected to play a central role segura river basin authority and ministry of agriculture food and environment of spain 2016 srba 2015a 3 methods the proposed analysis is a comparative static exercise based on the implementation of an iterative feedback process between the pmaup and cge models as illustrated in fig 2 using gva and prices as coupling variables for selected agricultural commodities two are the main advantages of this approach i the macroeconomic price coherence added to the microeconomic system and ii the inclusion of the microeconomic model attributes to the macroeconomic model analysis first the pmaup model is updated with a coherent set of agricultural prices from the cge model providing an economy wide feedback from a water policy being evaluated in the microeconomic model pmaup secondly the cge model assessment of the policy can be extended considering the specific attributes from the pmaup model in the feedback process this approach develops synergies between a partial and general equilibrium model by exploiting the detailed formulation of the first and the propagation mechanisms of the second therefore including second order effects in water policy assessments these methods are illustrated simulating a series of incremental water charges initially assessed with the pmaup model and then extended with the cge feedbacks on commodity price changes following the implementation of the water charging policy the iterative feedback process works following three steps fig 2 step 1 sets the water charge step 2 runs the pmaup model considering the policy shock whose solution provides changes in gva of agricultural activities in step 3 the variations of value added are fed into the cge model as productivity shocks affecting primary factors in the agricultural sector in this way the cge model is solved considering pmaup inputs and provides a new set of prices which are coherent with economy wide general equilibrium effects of the water charge implemented in step 1 changes in crops prices in the region are then fed back to the pmaup model to initialize again step 2 thus changes in crops prices are used by the pmaup to calculate updated productivity shocks feeding the cge to produce the next iterative solution steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence for the changes of both value added in the pmaup model and crops prices in the cge model is reached convergence is assumed to be achieved when the sum over all crop sectors of the absolute value of the differences between the current and the previous iterations for the changes in crops prices in the cge and gva in the pmaup model expressed in percentage points is below a pre established tolerance threshold 1 ideally the tolerance level could be set to 0 which indicates the last two solutions are identical for computational reasons the tolerance level in this paper has been set to 0 00001 percentage points which still provides a solution close to the solution that could be obtained with a threshold equal to 0 1 a major challenge in coupling models relates to their convergence in the literature convergence is typically assessed empirically hasegawa et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2009 in doing so coupled models follow a trial and error approach to e g fine tune key coupling parameters or discard conflicting modules agents e g cge regions that may prevent convergence ronneberger et al 2009 therefore in our coupled pmaup cge model there are some specific elements or characteristics that should be considered in the design of the coupling procedure first the most relevant decision variables should be governed by the most appropriate model i the pmaup model decides the crop portfolio allocation based on the different attributes and on the price information feedback from the cge model while ii the cge model produces the economy wide effects and corresponding price changes in the rest of the economy following the gva changes from the pmaup model second the crop portfolio allocation must consider the physical and institutional rigidities specific to each case study and this is satisfied by using microeconomic data with a fine spatial detail in our example awdus to calibrate the pmaup model and run simulations this implies that the crop portfolio has additional constraints derived from the institutional and agroecological structure of the case study area reflected in the input data third while the timespan of the simulation exercise could add some flexibility to these physical constraints because of medium to long run investments sticking to the short term as we do in our water charging example addresses this point fourth water charges should be applied within a feasible range to avoid cases in which high water charges could increase costs in such a way that the crop portfolio is limited to very few crops as a first step to confirm the empirical convergence between the models data values translated between the models must be verified hasegawa et al 2016 in our paper methods to verify convergence are presented in section 4 2 following a similar approach to that of hasegawa et al 2016 and ronneberger et al 2009 it is also possible to explore convergence more generally through a convergence test convergence tests aim to assess the response of the coupled system to a series of shocks to then audit its convergence behavior in succeeding iterations ronneberger et al 2009 in our paper this is done in section 5 by applying incremental water charges to the coupled system in addition to this empirical analysis it is also of value to assess convergence beyond a specific simulation or set of simulations to this end in annex 2 we assess convergence through a simplified dynamic system model representing the pmaup cge coupling framework considering the selected convergence variables in each model of the framework this coupling methodology allows evaluating the macroeconomic propagation of the water policy by exploiting interactions between the micro and the macro model it also opens the possibility to run sensitivity analyses and shed light on adjustments to the initial policy to correct and improve the initial set of policy objectives as compared to studies relying on stand alone macroeconomic models the use of a coupled micro macroeconomic model allows for a more accurate representation of the physical and institutional rigidities characterizing most water allocation regimes through feedbacks between the microeconomic and macroeconomic models this iterative coupling approach also offers advantages compared to the analyses exploring the sequential coupling between microeconomic and macroeconomic models which represent only the first stage steps 1 3 of the described coupling process disregarding circular feedbacks with the microeconomic model while conventional macroeconomic models sequential micro macroeconomic models and iterative micro macroeconomic models provide similar outputs namely the economy wide effects of a specific policy or impact carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 pérez blanco et al 2016b the first two produce only an initial estimation of impacts effects based on results from other models disregarding the final outcome once the full feedback is taken into account 3 1 the microeconomic model positive multi attribute utility programming pmaup 3 1 1 background and model choice in a typical microeconomic model the rational agent an irrigator or other representative agent decides on crop mix and timing water application and investments in capital stock to optimize farm performance with respect to single or multiple objectives within a domain defined by a number of constraints literature often simplifies this complex decision process by representing each possible combination of crops timing water application and capital as a separate crop with unique features so that the optimization problem is reduced to a decision on the crop portfolio within a domain graveline 2016 applied models to simulate farmer s behavior often assume that farmers are profit maximizers and equate utility to profit although empirical research shows this approach usually leads to significant divergence between observed and simulated behavior grames et al 2016 more robust theoretical frameworks model agent s responses by means of maximizing a utility function where profits are the relevant attribute as in expected utility von neumann and morgenstern 1953 and positive mathematical programming howitt 1995 since the 1970s a growing research body known as the theory of planned behavior tpb disputes that farmers behavior can be modeled by maximizing profits or by a utility function where profits are the single relevant objective and argues that farmers behavior is driven by multiple and often conflicting attributes related to their socioeconomic cultural and natural situation including but not limited to profit ajzen 1991 gassman et al 2009 harman et al 1972 harper and eastman 1980 smith and capstick 1976 according to the tpb observed choices are governed by farmers attitudes towards their behavior where attitudes represent a summary of psychological evaluations based on agent s beliefs about the goodness or badness of an outcome which can be typically associated to a particular attribute gómez limón et al 2016 for example it would be reasonable to think that the decision of whether to plant a high risk high gain crop portfolio is associated to agent s attitudes towards higher profit goodness but also higher risk and or management complexity badness if farmers attitudes and beliefs concerning multiple attributes govern decision making modeling farmers behavior requires the consideration of a multi attribute utility function where relevant attributes are represented keeney and raiffa 1993 the microeconomic model used in this paper builds on the axioms of revealed preference houthakker 1950 samuelson 1938 to elicit a multi attribute objective function that is both consistent with an observed and finite set of choices and prices afriat 1967 diewert 1973 and the foundations of the tpb ajzen 1991 ajzen and fishbein 2000 the theory of revealed preference originates in samuelson s 1938 pure theory of consumer behavior where he derives testable implications of rational consumption behavior and demand for two different budget sets without the need to postulate a utility function to represent agent s preferences giving rise to the weak axiom of revealed preference samuelson 1948 1938 houthakker 1950 introduced the strong axiom of revealed preference sarp which uses transitivity to derive testable implications of rational consumption for any budget set and establishes a close link between the axioms about demand and those about preferences by showing that in order to satisfy sarp demand functions must be the observable result of the optimization of preferences subject to agent s budgetary constraint while the theoretical foundation for revealed preference theory provided by houthakker 1950 and samuelson 1948 1938 assumes a complete description of a demand system that gives quantities as a function of every possible budget and price the key development in applied revealed preference research is offered by afriat 1967 who develops a utility function consistent with agent s choices from an observed finite dataset of prices and choices thus providing the basis to estimate aggregate consumer demand functions christensen et al 1975 deaton 1986 revealed preference is becoming an increasingly relevant applied economics tool in areas as disparate as public goods research

where x r n is the decision variable a vector representing the land share devoted to each individual crop x i i 1 n note that each crop i has a unique combination of attributes z x attached the rationale of agent s choices is explained by the provision of utility relevant attributes attributes are dimensionless quantities being the result of dividing the value they attain in the model when the utility function is maximized by their observed values attributes are defined so that more is better i e increasing the provision of one attribute improves agent s utility provided the provision of the remaining attributes is kept constant convexity holds i e increasing the provision of a given attribute will result in the reduction of another attribute if there is no tradeoff the choice becomes irrelevant and one of the attributes can be discarded the relevance each attribute has on agents decisions is determined by agents attitudes läpple and kelley 2013 poppenborg and koellner 2013 following the axioms of revealed preference it is possible to calibrate a utility function that captures these attitudes or preferences from realized agents choices and the resultant provision of attributes in doing so the pmaup model follows a positive approach i e the optimal solution to the problem above should match or at least be as close as possible to the observed crop portfolio x the calibration of the pmaup model thus aims to elicit an objective function that is consistent with x o and the choice domain f x and the detailed process is described in annex i 3 1 3 data agents in the pmaup model are the 55 agricultural water demand units awdus of the segura river basin located within the boundaries of the region of murcia the calibration year observed crop portfolio x o is 2013 data used in the pmaup model is conditional on the finite attribute set considered in the model calibration we explore five attributes based on a literature review on multi attribute utility functions bergevoet et al 2004 binswanger 1982 chung and lee 2009 delforce and hardaker 1985 gómez limón and riesgo 2004 hazell and scandizzo 1977a b just 1975 läpple and kelley 2013 lynne 1995 poppenborg and koellner 2013 rausser and yassour 1981 rodrigues et al 2013 attributes include profit z 1 risk avoidance z 2 total labor avoidance z 3 hired labor avoidance z 4 and direct costs avoidance per unit of revenue z 5 all attributes are quantities of dimension one and increasing their provision has a positive impact on the objective function more is better there is no risk of correlation among attributes since the outcome of the utility function is an ordinal value edgeworth 1881 this means that the model is not concerned about total utility or levels of utility but rather about ranking alternative decisions so that they are coherent with observed choices a detailed description of the attributes follows profit z 1 is the only variable explaining agent s behavior and response in single attribute models it is measured as the per hectare expected gross margin π i 6 z 1 x i x i π i risk avoidance z 2 the crop portfolio choice is comparable to a decision on a portfolio of financial assets in which the agent must balance assets with low expected return and risk say treasury bonds or subsidized crops and assets with high expected return and volatility say stock shares or vegetables the portfolio composition will depend on agent s attitudes towards profit and risk the utility relevance of risk has been repeatedly reported in the literature and is represented in this application of the model through risk avoidance z 2 7 z 2 x x τ v c v π x x x τ v c v π x x where v c v π x is the variance and covariance matrix of z 1 x and v c v π x is the variance and covariance matrix of z 1 x being x the crop portfolio with the highest possible risk within the domain it is possible that risk aversion and profit maximization alone are insufficient to explain observed agent s behavior rodrigues et al 2013 if this were the case we should witness a relevant distance between the realized and observed crop portfolio vectors meaning additional attributes are necessary to achieve an accurate representation of agent s behavior and response literature suggests the third most relevant attribute in explaining agent s behavior and response relates to management complexity chung and lee 2009 gómez limón and berbel 2000 gonçalves et al 2007 the main challenge in measuring management complexity resides in the qualitative nature of the attribute which may complicate its measurement and demand the use of proxy variables following pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 three attributes capturing management complexity aversion or management easiness are considered total

attributes using the same calibration method explained above for example it could be informative to explore the role of climate weather and market forecasts on agents behavior this is nonetheless limited by the availability of data which ultimately constrains the use of additional attributes in our case study area it should be noted that the inclusion of additional attributes does not guarantee more accurate calibration and results only if attributes are relevant in explaining agents decisions errors will be reduced and accuracy improved data collection aims at supplying the necessary information to quantify the attributes listed above land use data per crop is obtained at a municipal level for the calibration year from región de murcia 2015 and disaggregated at an awdu

ciscar et al 2011 and global scale hertel 1997 lenzen et al 2012 2013 the two most commonly used models to assess the economy wide impacts of environmental changes and policies are computable general equilibrium cge and input output io models io models reflect the economic interdependencies between sectors and regions within an economy through intermediate supply and final demand based on linear relations koks and thissen 2016 linear io models applied to water typically combine input output matrices and water accounts and apply a structural decomposition analysis that disaggregates the effects of a given shock on economic outputs and water use at different levels from urban wang et al 2009 to multi regional wan et al 2016 due to their descriptive nature researchers have frequently resorted to io models to determine which sectors consume more water both directly and indirectly bogra et al 2016 estimate their productivity apparent and induced duarte et al 2002 assess their exposure and vulnerability to shortages zhao et al 2015 and support the design of water and agricultural policy gonzález 2011 llop 2008 even though much progress has been made in io models to assess the economic impacts of natural disasters and environmental changes they still insufficiently tackle two major issues i the fact that a disruption such as a drought is most often a shock in the supply side of the production chain which cannot be modeled using conventional io analysis ii the absence of price changes in the io approach can limit the analysis of substitution possibilities between different economic activities and would prevent the possibility of coupling with microeconomic or bottom up models through price feedbacks within a macro economic framework cge models capture these feedback effects from the macroeconomic context on the sectors and markets initially affected by the policy or shock rose 2009 in doing so they avoid double counting issues that often affect conventional partial equilibrium assessments pauw et al 2011 in cge models agent behavior is calibrated from observed economic flows registered in social accounting matrices these models often follow a walrasian framework where investments are saving driven and agents minimize private expenditure to attain a given utility level bosello et al 2014 parrado and de cian 2014 cge models have a long tradition in assessing agricultural water management in this framework competition for water can be represented either implicitly irrigated land which itself embodies water or explicitly the latter approach is used e g by darwin et al 1995 who explicitly represent water in a cge framework relying on available estimations in the us to assign a price and value share to water replication of this approach elsewhere can be challenging due to limited information on use value and prices even more important recent research rightly claims that the shadow price of water must correspond to the gap between irrigated and rainfed production to pay for the returns to water accordingly in berrittella et al 2007 irrigated land production is represented using a nested constant elasticity of substitution ces function in which water and other inputs enter in a fixed proportion water demand responds to a water rent which in turn derives from supply constraints calzadilla et al 2011 use a more flexible three level ces production function which allows for different degrees of substitutability between inputs at each level and permits two ways of reallocating water substituting other inputs for water and reducing demand for water intensive products yet since rainfed and irrigated production appear as part of the same aggregate national production function it is not possible to stop irrigating an area in favor of rainfed agriculture a major weakness that complicates policy assessment e g irrigation restrictions this shortcoming is addressed in taheripour et al 2013 s global model which makes the irrigated and rainfed production functions operate independently by allowing for competition for resources at two layers competition for water within river basins and competition for land within agro ecological zones a similar approach has been extensively explored at a regional and country level as well dixon et al 2012 2011 tirado et al 2010 two major issues are typically identified in cge water policy modeling i limited spatial detail hertel and liu 2016 and ii the fact that the adjustment dynamics of the model relies on the existence of full fledged commodity markets a prerequisite that does not reflect the specificity of water allocation regimes perhaps with the exception of the water markets of australia chile and the semi arid states of western us oecd 2015 the regionalization of the cge model allows us to increase the spatial detail of the macro economic tool and provide a more realistic level of granularity for coupling it with the microeconomic pmaup model while ensuring micro and macro economic modeling consistency 3 2 2 theoretical structure the cge model used in this study is a regionalized nuts2 3 the nomenclature des unités territoriales

production and primary factor allocation following market price signals the regionalized database has been aggregated for the present analysis including 15 economic sectors and the 17 nuts2 regions of spain the rest of eu28 and the rest of the world as shown in table 1 there are 8 crop sectors in the cge model database which will be used to map and aggregate data from the pmaup model the most

and the extractive sector 10 demands natural resources gva is modelled via a constant elasticity of substitution ces function which allows some degree of substitution between the existing primary factors formally the ces function depends on v f primary factors with sector specific elasticity of substitution σ j input augmenting or biased technical change is represented with the parameter γ f j

contrary labor and capital are perfectly mobile across sectors within a region land supply at the sectoral level is modelled through a constant elasticity of transformation cet which allocates the exogenous overall regional land to agricultural sectors according to sector specific land rents this implies that land can be shifted from one crop use to another depending of the land rent offered by each crop the first order conditions of the cet function for land are obtained from the following maximization problem 14 m a x w f j s j agr w f j s q f j s f l a n d j a g r i c u l t u r e s e c t

government consumption and savs savings in region s and parameters ω are the associated budget shares the macro economic closure assumes international mobility of investments a global bank collects global savings and allocates regional investments this implies that trade imbalances in each region equal the difference between regional savings and investments all produced commodities can be traded at the international and intra national level with imperfect substitution between products coming from different spatial units countries and or regions according to the standard armington assumption armington 1969 this is done by including an upper bundle between domestic and imported goods and a lower bundle to source imports from all sources in the upper level demand for any commodity is broken in two parts using a ces function d d j s and d m j s which are the domestic demand and the aggregate demand for imported products in regions s and sector j respectively for each economic sector a representative household government or firm minimize the total expenditure under the ces constraint on domestic and imported goods 17 m i n d d j s d m j s p d d j s d d j s p d m j s d m j s 18 s t d

respectively the armington elasticity in the upper level σ j up captures the imperfect substitution between domestic and imported commodities in the lower level the aggregate amount of imports d m j s are sourced from the country or the sub country region of origin the representative agent in each region and sector minimizes the expenditure for imports under a constant ratio of elasticities of

gtap model which are not differentiated by region 3 2 3 data the model is calibrated on a regionalized version of the gtap 8 1 database narayanan et al 2012 which is a collection of social accounting matrices sams for 57 economic sectors and 134 countries regions of the world for the base year 2007 to regionalize the national sam of spain in the gtap database into the 17 nuts 2 regions we use information coming from the spanish regional accounting instituto nacional de estadística ine 2017 ine provides some additional detail on both capital and labor but at the expense of a less refined sectoral resolution especially in some industrial sectors for some manufacturing activities we refer to structural business statistics eurostat 2016 because they have a richer detail of these sectors for the agricultural economic components of value added we mainly rely on the economic accounts for agriculture eurostat 2016 because the information has a good level of sectoral resolution and is already standardized across the eu nuts regions practically the first operation of the regionalization consists in matching the gtap sectoral detail with that of our data sources then for each sector the regional shares of value added and accordingly of labor capital land and natural resources are applied to the corresponding gtap value for spain in order to distribute this value across the different sub national units a challenging task to be achieved in the database construction is the derivation of the sub national domestic demand and trade with other regions within the country these data are often missing and need to be computed using different techniques we adopt the so called simple locations quotients slqs bonfiglio 2008 bonfiglio and chelli 2008 miller and blair 2009 slqs provide a measure of the sectoral specialization in the regional economy and starting from this it is possible to determine the domestic demand and aggregate demand for imports then a gravitational approach in line with dixon et al 2012 and wittwer and horridge 2010 is implemented to split the bilateral trade flows across sub national regions an exhaustive description of the methodology can be found in bosello and standardi 2015 4 implementing the iterative micro macroeconomic feedback 4 1 the water policy shock in step 1 of the iterative process water charges g are increased for every agent in the microeconomic model while in step 2 the utility maximizing crop portfolio x g p 0 and related utility u g p 0 and gva v a g p 0 are estimated using the calibrated objective functions the gva is a function of the gross margin z 1 g p 0 and hired labor z 4 g p 0 and can be obtained as follows 21 v a g p 0 f z 1 g p 0 z 4 g p 0 where p 0 represents the initial set of crop prices the resulting gva before v a o p 0 and after the policy shock v a g p 0 provide the rate of change that is translated as a shock on the productivity of primary factors thus the productivity shock γ g p 0 j for each crop sector j is calculated as the percentage change of gva carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 22 γ g p 0 j γ j v a g p 0 j v a 0 p 0 j 1 100 where γ j is a fixed coefficient that captures the fraction of the gva of crop sector j in murcia that is produced within the awdus of the region whose value is obtained as the ratio of gva in the awdus to total gva in murcia for crop j for the base year 2007 observed values in step 3 the productivity shock γ g p 0 j is uniformly applied to primary factors f used by each crop crop category j of the murcia region s mur in the cge model therefore the productivity shock corresponding to a given water charge from the policy introduces the variations of gva from the pmaup model in the cge framework 23 v a g p 0 j m u r f γ g p 0 j v f j m u r σ j f l a n d l a b o r c a p i t a l j a g r i c u l t u r a l c r o p s 4 2 the price feedback as mentioned in the description of the cge model all prices change to clear markets when supply equals demand the updated crop prices are then fed to the pmaup model in the next iteration repeating step 2 these updated prices p 1 will affect the provision of attributes that are derived from every possible crop portfolio decision this will result in a new optimal solution to the problem in eqs 1 to 5 agents will choose to plant a new utility maximizing crop portfolio x g p 1 which in turn will lead to an updated gva v a g p 1 the latter can be obtained as follows 24 v a g p 1 f z 1 g p 1 z 4 g p 1 where p 1 represents the updated crop prices set provided by the cge model in iteration 1 next we repeat the process above to obtain the updated gva values to calculate the new productivity shock that will feed the cge γ g p 1 in step 3 25 γ g p 1 j γ j v a g p 1 j v a 0 p 0 j 1 100 again the updated productivity shock γ g p 1 is applied to primary factors f used by each crop j of the murcia region s mur in the cge model 26 v a g p 1 j m u r f γ g p 1 j v f j m u r σ j f l a n d l a b o r c a p i t a l j a g r i c u l t u r a l c r o p s the process is repeated until the sum over all crop sectors of the absolute value of the differences between the current and the previous iterations for the changes in crops prices in the cge and gross value added in the pmaup model is below 0 00001 where convergence between the two models is assumed this process following the description of fig 2 has been used to test different water charge values to provide insights about the advantages of considering the micro macro feedbacks within water policy assessment 5 results a series of simulations are run in which water charges in murcia are progressively increased in every awdu from eur 0 05 m3 to eur 0 30 m3 at eur 0 05 intervals this is a feasible range for the proposed analysis representing an average increase between 55 6 and 333 the average water charge in the segura river basin is eur 0 09 m3 agents reassess their crop portfolio decisions according to their objective function and the new water charge higher water charges typically reduce utility and depress income and gva in irrigated agriculture through reduced labor inputs z 4 and profit z 1 the inclusion of crop prices feedbacks from the macroeconomic model results in updated adaptation strategies defined by new crop portfolio decisions 5 1 agents adaptive responses in the coupled pmaup cge framework fig 3 shows the impact of higher water charges on land use allocation for the main crop categories cultivated in murcia wheat other cereals and vegetables and fruits distinguishing between irrigated and rainfed crops there is a substitution of irrigated cultivars for rainfed ones wheat and other cereals with rainfed cereals other than wheat being preferred over the latter in the case of wheat the increase in the use of rainfed land partially mitigates the loss of irrigated land devoted to wheat between 41 for a water charge increase of eur 0 05 m3 and 63 for eur 0 3 m3 in the case of other cereals irrigated land reduction is more than compensated by rainfed land increases resulting in rainfed land for other cereals increasing above the reduction of irrigated land by 1 water charge increase of eur 0 05 m3 and 118 eur 0 3 m3 vegetables and fruits i e irrigated only crops show a steady land use share until a water charge increase of eur 0 15 m3 beyond this point they start being replaced by rainfed crops other cereals this is explained because vegetables and fruits are high value added crops able to absorb the burden of higher water charges up to a charge increase of eur 0 15 m3 yet after this threshold farmers are constrained to reduce the surface allotted to these crops fig 4 shows the effects of higher water charges on gva produced by the pmaup model including feedbacks from the cge model for wheat other cereals and vegetables and fruits as expected the impact of the policy is higher in water intensive crops such as vegetables and fruits which show a steady reduction of gva along with increasing water charges aggregate gva losses range from 5 with a water charge of eur 0 05 m3 to 25 when the water charge is eur 0 30 m3 interestingly wheat and other cereals show some resilience to higher water charges when water prices go above eur 0 15 m3 and eur 0 10 m3 respectively the fact that cereals can revert gva losses at water charges above eur 0 10 m3 other cereals and eur 0 15 m3 wheat is explained by the substitution of irrigated land that becomes financially unsustainable under the new water charges e g vegetables by rainfed land which mitigates gva losses in the wheat and other cereals crop categories see also what happened with land use as explained in fig 3 note that the contribution of wheat and other cereals to aggregate gva is marginal as shown in fig 4 where aggregate gva losses almost match gva losses in the vegetables and fruits category when the reduction of gva from the pmaup model is reproduced in the cge model agricultural commodity prices increase not only because water charges increase production costs but also because now there is an induced scarcity of irrigated commodities due to farmers decision to produce less water intensive crops in the pmaup model as shown in fig 5 this scarcity is explained because population does not change when the water charge is imposed and households demand is determined by population and their budgets which do not change significantly in the short run either since the demand for agricultural commodities as well as food is relatively inelastic prices in the cge model increase to clear agricultural markets following a reduction in the supply of agricultural commodities because of the significant gap between the expected profit of irrigated and rainfed crops in murcia water demand shows an inelastic response to incremental charges in our simulations see fig 6 a the maximum amount of water consumption i e evaporation and transpiration from the field that can be conserved for other uses according to our simulations is 126 8 million m3 or 10 6 of initial water consumption x axis fig 6b following a charge increase of 0 30 euro m3 333 on the other hand the inelastic response to incremental charges suggests a high ability to pay that can underpin more ambitious cost recovery a charge increase of 0 05 euro m3 55 6 increases tariff revenue 4 the tariff revenue is the total amount of money collected through the water policy and is obtained as the volume of water consumption m3 times the average water charge euro m3 4 by 64 2 million euro 51 9 while a charge increase of 0 30 euro m3 333 increases tariff revenue by 355 6 million euro 287 3 recall that water infrastructures cost recovery ratios in the segura river basin range from 54 08 to 80 82 as mentioned in section 2 fig 6b shows the tariff revenue predicted by the coupled pmaup cge model and sums it to the foregone gva to produce a measure of the economic efficiency loss from the water charging policy using market values only i e the environmental and other benefits of the charging policy through water conservation are not accounted for 5 2 pmaup cge v pmaup differences in describing farmers adaptive responses when higher crop prices are fed back to the pmaup model the reduction in the expected profit z 1 of irrigated crops is mitigated and farmers will reassess their initial decision following the iterative micro macro feedback described in section 4 fig 7 shows the percentage difference in gva between the solution including the iterative feedbacks from the cge model and the isolated one step solution of the pmaup model the most relevant effect is that gva in vegetables and fruits categories which represent more than 95 of the gva in the baseline does not decrease as much in the coupled pmaup cge as the stand alone pmaup model would predict overall the coupled iterative process yields a gva that is between 0 4 and 4 2 higher than the solution of the pmaup model without considering micro macro feedbacks gva losses a measure of water overallocation abatement costs are between 9 6 and 12 2 higher in the stand alone pmaup model than in the coupled pmaup cge model note that in other micro macro economic coupled models where price feedbacks are not considered the effect is typically the contrary impacts on the agricultural sector of the case study area at a microeconomic level are amplified at a macroeconomic scale pérez blanco et al 2016b this dichotomy is largely explained by the inelastic demand for agricultural goods which suggests households will be willing to pay a higher price for agricultural commodities following a hypothetical water charge that increases production costs and reduces supply thus balancing and eventually reversing the negative impact on gva caused by yield reduction through price increases while this effect is evident for irrigated crops there is an ambiguous impact for wheat and other cereals that can be irrigated or rainfed in this case gva estimations in the coupled pmaup cge model fluctuate around the value predicted by the pmaup model although the adjustment dynamics differ fig 8 shows the differences in water conservation and revenue raising between the pmaup cge coupled framework and the stand alone pmaup model by crop category in stacked columns while the total amount is represented by the black thick line the relatively higher expected profit attribute z 1 in the pmaup of irrigated crops in the pmaup cge framework typically increases water consumption as compared to the stand alone pmaup model albeit only marginally values range from 0 01 to 0 14 and the amount of water conserved in the pmaup and coupled pmaup cge remains similar around 1 difference yet the decomposition of water conservation by crop category provides relevant insights fig 8a for instance at an incremental water charge of eur 0 05 m3 the category other cereals reduces water consumption by more than 2 5 million m3 in the coupled pmaup cge model as compared to the pmaup model a reduction that is almost compensated by a comparable increase in water consumption by vegetables fruits and other crops incremental water charges above eur 0 10 m3 result in higher water consumption values in the coupled pmaup cge framework as compared to the stand alone pmaup model particularly by wheat at eur 0 15 m3 vegetables and fruits above eur 0 10 m3 and other cereals above eur 0 20 m3 these results highlight the importance of including the price feedback from the cge model in the pmaup model which affects farmers decisions and produces a reallocation of water consumption among agricultural activities crops on the other hand the tariff revenue predicted by the pmaup cge framework is typically higher than that of the pmaup model fig 8b mainly because of the higher water consumption by vegetables fruits and wheat in the coupled model differences in tariff revenue predictions of both models like those in water consumption conservation are small from 0 01 to 0 14 higher in the coupled pmaup cge model note that charges are applied to withdrawals instead of consumption the ratio of consumption to withdrawals differs among awdus due to asymmetries in irrigation technology adoption and this explains differences in the tariff revenue and water conservation structure the comparable tariff revenue in both models along with lower significant gva loss estimates in the coupled pmaup cge model result in a lower economic efficiency loss in murcia s markets up to 65 lower in the pmaup cge as compared to the stand alone pmaup model fig 9 b for incremental charges above eur 0 10 m3 we observe a tradeoff between economic and environmental performance since the lower economic efficiency loss predicted by the pmaup cge model comes at the expense of reduced water conservation as compared to the pmaup model on the contrary incremental charges up to eur 0 10 m3 could lead to comparable slightly higher conservation in the coupled model fig 9a this would be the outcome of shifting irrigated cereals and other crops to rainfed agriculture as shown before in fig 8a 6 discussion applicability and limitations of the model results from the coupled pmaup cge model presented in this paper suggest that micro macro feedbacks have a meaningful impact on two fundamental economic variables that determine policy performance i price feedbacks from the cge model affect economic efficiency e g mitigating efficiency losses from irrigation restriction through higher crop prices that partially compensate the negative effects on revenue of yield reduction ii changes in economic efficiency following policy implementation also conditions effectiveness more resilient economies with relatively low efficiency losses may be less responsive to policy stimuli which may hamper the effect of policy interventions on the quantitative and or qualitative status of the environmental asset the analysis of the case study in the murcia region in spain confirms the relevance of accounting for micro macroeconomic feedbacks in environmental policy modeling and water policy modeling in particular results suggest that policy simulations using stand alone microeconomic models with exogenous prices may underestimate the adaptive capacity of irrigators and overestimate policy abatement costs in the case of water charges in the murcia region up to 12 2 for a 30 eurocents m3 incremental water charge the same applies for sequential non recursive coupled models that disregard micro macroeconomic price feedbacks in such models macroeconomic simulations tend to amplify economic impacts as compared to microeconomic estimations carrera et al 2015 koks et al 2015 pérez blanco et al 2016b pérez blanco and standardi 2019 while in our pmaup cge model macroeconomic simulations mitigate economic impacts as compared to microeconomic estimations the assessment of policy effectiveness may be also affected by model choice and although our results show a marginal incidence on water conservation up to 0 14 less water conserved in the coupled pmaup cge model as compared to the stand alone microeconomic pmaup model there is a relevant reallocation of water resources among crops once we introduce the cge price feedback in the pmaup model the dynamics explaining these outcomes work as follows 1 higher water charges increase production costs at a farm level and reduce supply of water intensive commodities at a macro level 2 given the relatively inelastic household demand for food the scarcity of water intensive commodities results in relatively higher commodity prices and a higher expected income in the micro macro model as compared to the micro model 3 irrigators adapt to the higher expected income of water intensive commodities in the coupled model this leads to a reorganization of the crop portfolio which mitigates gva and economic efficiency losses and can result in slightly lower comparable or higher water conservation depending on price feedbacks from the cge model while micro macro feedback links are relevant for policy modeling design and implementation our approach is one among many possible model settings and modeling alternatives worth exploring in what follows we identify and discuss what we see as critical aspects to enhance applicability and address limitations of micro macro coupled models detail due to their very nature and objective as accurate yet as simple as possible representations of reality models cannot incorporate all the details of complex human and or water systems yet there are several improvements that can be made towards delivering a socio ecologic model that can assess the adjustment dynamics of complex socio ecologic systems in economic terms the model could explore alternative and or complementary coupling variables for example the current version of the model follows the conventional micro to macro link that uses gva as the coupling variable yet some cge models now incorporate information on land use distribution per crop category sometimes at a regional level which could be used as an alternative coupling variable e g reproducing the micro crop portfolio in the macro model also the price feedback we introduce in our iterative framework could be expanded to consider not only output prices i e crop prices but also input prices e g labor in ecologic terms factors such as climatic and hydrologic changes should be considered for example hydrologic aspects could be incorporated through the extension of the current framework to include a hydrologic module that accounts for multi directional two way feedbacks between human human micro macroeconomic and human water hydro micro macroeconomic systems simplicity as noted above there are alternatives available to make our modeling framework encompass more systems and details within each system however scientists working at the human water interface need to bear in mind that models are ultimately tools to inform policy decisions and that policy makers are not necessarily knowledgeable about economic hydrologic and or hydroeconomic modeling for example while having exogenous prices in microeconomic models may limit our understanding of the system dynamics and our ability to accurately represent actual efficiency and effectiveness performance of a given policy this assumption is reasonable where that policy affects an area with limited incidence on commodity markets and prices e g a policy targeting a small number of segura river basin s awdus in less economically relevant upstream areas conversely policies working at a large scale and looking at variables that can be adequately represented in a macroeconomic framework can go without a detailed microeconomic or ecological model although this is typically not the case of water resources management this simplifies modeling and makes it easier for non modelers such as policy makers to improve their understanding of the system dynamics thus contributing to better informed decisions modeling errors the modeling framework presented here can be used to identify optimal agricultural water conservation policies including economy wide interlinkages and using a consolidative modeling approach to abatement cost effectiveness analysis contingent on the existence of a known set of possible states and related probabilities whether this standard consolidative modeling approach should be applied where estimations on policy performance are sensitive to simplifications and mathematical assumptions about the probability of the states e g future water availability and demands is nonetheless debatable critically complex adaptive socio ecological systems such as human water systems are characterized by positive feedbacks micro macroeconomic but also between human and ecological systems non mechanistic dynamics and multiple equilibria which call for the use of exploratory modeling methods and heuristics with the objective of seeking for robust rather than optimal solutions anderies et al 2004 to this end the modeling framework above needs to be expanded to carry out experiments with ensembles of one varying initial states and forcings or multiple multi model socio ecologic models to assess the implications of different assumptions about the system s and select those policies that produce acceptable outcomes in most models and scenario simulations static robustness cloke et al 2013 in economic terms the inclusion of alternative pmaup and cge model settings and that of alternative models at a micro and macro economic level could be explored to create an exploratory ensemble framework modeling efforts should be complemented with measures of transaction costs that allow a complete cost effectiveness analysis and facilitate the identification and avoidance of irreversible path dependence adaptation strategies adaptive robustness garrick 2015 heuristics a close involvement and interaction with stakeholders notably policy makers is critical to design credible and relevant policy scenarios develop appropriate and understandable methods deliver results gather feedback jointly evaluate criteria for policy performance assessment and catalyze policy implementation stakeholder engagement is particularly relevant to understand and manage uncertainty in policy design and for research results appropriation uncertainty constrains policy makers to complement the mechanistic deductive approach of conventional scientific analysis e g cost effectiveness with expert knowledge and opinion using heuristic methods where the objective is to avoid unfavorable contingencies i e robustness strengthening science policy synergies underpins the provision and appropriation of relevant information to stakeholders ensuring that policy responses are supported by sound science recommendations and empirically based expert discussions to this end a co development approach can be followed to engage key stakeholders in a process that 1 provides an assessment framework that enables the appropriation of solutions by stakeholders 2 improves understanding and management of uncertainty and 3 catalyzes informed cost effective feasible and robust policies the exact way this process should be implemented and funded is out of the scope of this paper but we foresee at least two alternatives the first one involves public institutions e g regional authorities establishing an open interactive decision support system for all interested agents to use the coupling framework and to provide relevant feedback in the process the other alternative involves a subscription service based on georeferenced information that provides a set of scenario analyses to institutions farmers and other interested stakeholders thus turning all interested groups into customers that contribute financially to the further development and maintenance of the service conventional business and marketing strategy however the imitation of conventional business and marketing strategies may be not or less suitable for the provision of water resources management services such as the service described here first the value of the service is only revealed when the users customers realize the cost saving or value added potentials which they may obtain from exploiting the service for the adoption of the policy second users of water resources management services are an integral component of value creation by complementing the service with own products e g river basins own hydrological models in a future hydro micro macroeconomic model and knowledge meaning that if key stakeholders decide not to participate relevant feedback to fine tune the service will be lost prahalad and ramaswamy 2004 an open co development process that engages all relevant stakeholders in a constructive dialogue is more likely to contribute to the design and delivery of an effective service that bridges gaps in existing hydro economic services 7 conclusions feedbacks between micro and macro economic systems are relevant and should not be neglected yet conventional abatement costs analysis still relies on micro or macro economic models sometimes coupled with hydrological models i e hydroeconomic where micro and macro economic models interact a one way micro to macro economic information flow is predominant hence failing to capture proper interlinkages two way feedbacks between human human micro macroeconomic and human water systems hydro micro macroeconomic that shape abatement costs neglecting these interlinkages in complex human water systems is likely to result in inaccurate system robustness and resilience modeling maladaptation and ineffective policies as a first step this paper adopts a modular approach to supply two way connections between micro and macro economic modules enabling system functionalities potentially not achievable by isolated modules models these modules are interconnected through an iterative coupling framework that makes them mutually consistent enabling also the provision of a replicable and flexible framework results from an application to irrigation water charges in the murcia region in spain show that the coupled micro macro model yields significantly lower abatement costs as compared to the stand alone micro model acknowledgements the research leading to these results has received funding from the european union s horizon 2020

matrix i e the maximum value each attribute can attain within the domain and approximate the efficient frontier through a hyper plane connecting two efficient points included in the pay off matrix segment formed by points a and b in two dimensions in fig a1 case 1 andré and riesgo 2007 project the observed choice to the closest efficient point x i e along the actual frontier which is then used as a reference point to obtain a compromise set consisting of a set of efficient points in the vicinity the compromise set is interpreted as the fraction of the efficient frontier where the utility function is maximized then the landing area or tangency point for the indifference curve is obtained by regressing a hyper plane from the compromise set segment formed by points a and b in fig a1 case

the two points to approximate the efficient frontier segment formed by points a and b in fig a1 case 3 since efficient frontiers are convex the hyper planes connecting efficient points will not belong to the actual efficient set x and will lead to approximation errors distance between the segment ab and x in fig a1 this paper follows the method proposed by gutiérrez martín and gómez 2011 case 3 which minimizes the approximation error for the database of the case study area pérez blanco and gutiérrez martín 2017 through the projection of the observed crop portfolio τ z p z k x o to the

tangency points for the calibration of the utility function b marginal rate of substitution several valid functional forms can be used in the calibration for the case of single attribute utility functions varian 1982 presented a way to describe the entire set of utility functions consistent with observed preferences while varian 1983 obtained bounds on specific functional forms in the case of the multi attribute pmaup model presented here the information provided by the m r t k p and m r s k p makes feasible the elicitation of the parameters of a multi attribute utility function consistent with observed choices within the domain f x for a given functional form considered in this application the utility function adopts a cobb douglas specification as compared to alternative additive or multiplicative additive specifications a cobb douglas function offers the advantages of decreasing marginal utility for each attribute and the existence of a global optimum inada 1963 and provides a

important to acknowledge that utility function parameters are not absolute values since choices are constrained by the domain for example agents with a high α 1 value where the domain restricts profitable crop portfolios may display lower profit than others with a lower α 1 value and less constraining domain annex ii simplified dynamic system representing the coupling framework to analyze the convergence potential of the coupling framework we use a simplified linear dynamic system of two differential equations as the main elements of the system considering one single commodity which for the sake of simplicity could represent aggregated agricultural output each model in the coupling procedure is represented by a differential equation that summarizes its behavior in the following notation the dot over each variable represents the evolution of the variable or its derivative with respect to time while each model at the initial stage is in equilibrium the coupling procedure means that the information exchanged between models will shift them away from their initial equilibrium until they find another one in which both models will converge as explained in the methods section the first shock is the increase in water charges in the pmaup model which will in turn produce a change in gross value added gva that will be fed to the cge model then the cge model will produce a change in prices to clear all markets and the new prices will be fed back to the pmaup model the process will iterate until a new equilibrium is found the first equation represents the microeconomic model pmaup that produces as the main output the gva g the evolution of gva g is a function of the agricultural commodity price p minus the initial equilibrium price p0 and an additional water charge t the additional water charge t reduces gva through increased production costs parameter a1 represents the velocity of adjustment for gva in the system aii 1 g a 1 p p 0 t a 1 p 0 0 eq aii 1 evaluates the changes in the price of the commodity with respect to the initial equilibrium price value p0 indicating that if prices are higher than a threshold set by the initial price plus the additional water charge then gva will increase but if prices fall below that threshold then gva will decrease if the water charge t is exogenously raised then the model will shift from its initial equilibrium and gva will decrease due to increased production costs the second equation represents the macroeconomic feedback on prices from the market equilibrium derived from the cge model with the commodity price p as the main output in this equation the evolution of the price level p depends on the equilibrium condition indicating that supply ys equals demand yd therefore if supply falls below demand prices should increase to reflect the scarcity of the commodity conversely if supply is greater than demand then prices should fall to clear the market parameter a2 is the velocity of adjustment of prices in the system aii 2 p a 2 y d y s a 2 0 supply ys is represented in eq aii 3 stating that the production of the commodity is directly proportional to gva and this relationship is determined by parameter b 1 0 while demand yd is an inversely proportional function of the price level as represented in eq aii 4 aii 3 y s b 1 g b 1 0 aii 4 y d c 1 c 2 p c 1 c 2 0 substituting eq aii 3 and eq aii 4 in eq aii 2 we obtain a two differential equations system aii 5 g a 1 p p 0 t p a 2 c 1 c 2 p b 1 g the equilibrium of the system is reached where both g 0 and p 0 i e where aii 6 g o a 1 p p 0 t 0 aii 7 p 0 a 2 c 1 c 2 p b 1 g 0 with the equilibrium point in aii 8 p p 0 t g c 1 c 2 p 0 t b 1 eqs aii 6 and aii 7 also give the curves to identify the stationary point in a phase diagram aii 9 p p 0 t aii 10 c 1 c 2 p b 1 g the jacobian matrix of the two equation system is useful to demonstrate the stability of the system considering the values of its determinant δ and its trace τ aii 11 j g g g p p g p p 0 a 1 a 2 b 1 a 2 c 2 aii 12 δ a 1 a 2 b 1 0 τ a 2 c 2 0 given that the determinant δ is positive and the trace τ negative the equilibrium point is a stable one with the phase diagram of the system represented in fig a2 the evolution of the system depends on the flexibility of each one of its components in this case the paump and cge models each model has its own set of assumptions that lead to a specific parametrization however when two models are used in a coupling framework each one must be adapted according to the characteristics of the other one in order to exchange information consistently either by fine tuning some parameters or by adjusting conflicting modules this is in accordance with the existing studies discussing the convergence of land use and cge models hasegawa et al 2016 ronneberger et al 2009 as described in the methods section for example since the pmaup model computes the changes in gva considering the agricultural production process in a more refined way that the cge model then the cge model has been adapted to use that input by changing the specification of the agricultural production process so to follow the trends derived from the pmaup model the convergence trajectory of the system following an exogenous water charge shock can be represented as the black thick curve in fig a2 the process would start at some point at the bottom left quadrant i where gva and production decreases g 0 due to the water charge consequently prices would increase p 0 to clear the market and the system would move to its equilibrium point while the simplified dynamic system representing the coupling procedure of two models is stable as demonstrated in eq aii 12 if the two models are not adapted for the information exchange depending on the variables and parameters of each model then achieving convergence would be more difficult since the models would produce larger changes in each iteration step which could imply fluctuations of both g and p moving along the four quadrants identified in fig a2 for instance beginning in the bottom left quadrant i and following an increase in the water charge the trajectory could move to the upper left quadrant ii where gva increases driven by higher prices next the trajectory would move to the upper right quadrant iii in which due to the increase in gva and production there is an excess of supply which is cleared in the market by lowering prices with lower prices the next effect is the reduction in the gva shown in the bottom right quadrant iv this evolution would in any case end up in the equilibrium point as demonstrated above given the stable nature of the system this linear dynamic model is intended to analyze the main dynamics of the coupling process using a simplistic representation of the coupling framework that focuses on the most important variables and using a representative commodity its objective is to help understand the dynamics of the coupling process and to provide insights on the key coupling variables and their dynamics that can then be extended to the case of multiple markets

kitanidis editor in chief with the assistance of jian luo associate editor hydrogeological conceptual models are collections of hypotheses describing the understanding of groundwater systems and they are considered one of the major sources of uncertainty in groundwater flow and transport modelling a common method for characterizing the conceptual uncertainty is the multi model approach where alternative plausible conceptual models are developed and evaluated this review aims to give an overview of how multiple alternative models have been developed tested and used for predictions in the multi model approach in international literature and to identify the remaining challenges the review shows that only a few guidelines for developing the multiple conceptual models exist and these are rarely followed the challenge of generating a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive range of plausible models is yet to be solved regarding conceptual model testing the reviewed studies show that a challenge remains in finding data that is both suitable to discriminate between conceptual models and relevant to the model objective we argue that there is a need for a systematic approach to conceptual model building where all aspects of conceptualization relevant to the study objective are covered for each conceptual issue identified alternative models representing hypotheses that are mutually exclusive should be defined using a systematic hypothesis based approach increases the transparency in the modelling workflow and therefore the confidence in the final model predictions while also anticipating conceptual surprises while the focus of this review is on hydrogeological applications the concepts and challenges concerning model building and testing are applicable to spatio temporal dynamical environmental systems models in general keywords conceptual models model evaluation model rejection multi model framework conceptual model uncertainty 1 introduction groundwater model conceptualization is a crucial first step in groundwater model development anderson et al 2015a it provides a systematic internally consistent overview of system boundaries properties and processes relevant to the research question bridging the gap between hydrogeological characterization and groundwater modelling as the conceptualization is related to the fundamentals of the problem definition it is considered one of the major sources of uncertainty in numerical groundwater modelling gupta et al 2012 estimating parameters through calibration with an inadequate conceptual model may lead to biased parameter values doherty and welter 2010 biased parameter values are especially problematic when extrapolating to predictions that are of a different type than the calibration data represent a different stress regime or have a longer timeframe than the calibration period white et al 2014 not accounting for conceptual model uncertainty can potentially greatly underestimate total uncertainty and give false confidence in model results as vividly illustrated in bredehoeft 2005 to develop conceptual models two major approaches have been traditionally applied i the consensus model approach brassington and younger 2010 and ii the multi model approach neuman and wierenga 2003 fig 1 the development of conceptual models is based on the available geological and hydrological information which are observed data such as water levels borehole information and tracer concentrations but often also include a component of soft knowledge such as geological insights or expert interpretation in the single consensus conceptual model approach all available observations and knowledge is iteratively integrated into a single conceptual model barnett et al 2012 izady et al 2014 providing a staircase of confidence gedeon et al 2013 in this case the conceptual model represents the current consensus on system behaviour brassington and younger 2010 as illustrated in schwartz et al 2017 conceptual model uncertainty is generally accounted for in the consensus approach by increasing the complexity of the model increasing complexity effectively turns conceptual model uncertainty into parameter uncertainty by adding more processes to the model and or increasing resolution in space and time increasing the degrees of freedom means that non uniqueness increases which is often balanced through optimal model complexity favouring the simplest model that can adequately reproduce historical conditions young et al 1996 the main advantage is that it comprehensively captures conceptual issues in the model the main drawback is that models quickly become intractable and too computationally demanding to carry out parameter inference another mechanism that is often applied to account for conceptual uncertainty is conservatism favouring the conceptualization that will result in the largest impact wingefors et al 1999 although inherently biased the main advantage is that introducing conservative assumptions make the problem tractable and provides confidence that the simulated impacts are not underestimated the largest drawback however is that conservative assumptions depend on the type of impact investigated may not be internally consistent and can lead to missed opportunities freedman et al 2017 the alternative to the consensus approach is the multi model approach in which an ensemble of different conceptualizations is considered throughout the model process in parallel rather than sequentially this approach reflects that the hydrogeological functioning of an aquifer system can be interpreted in different ways especially if the available data is scarce anderson et al 2015a beven 2002 neuman and wierenga 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 in the multi model approach the aim is not to find the single best model but to find an ensemble of alternative conceptual models each with a different hypothesis on system behaviour as depicted in fig 1 this is also an iterative process in which conceptual models are removed from the ensemble when they are falsified by increased knowledge or data and where conceptual models are added when new data or insights prompt the development of a new hypothesis on model behaviour in the consensus approach once committed to a particular conceptualization there is considerable inertia to change it as this would often involve a complete overhaul of the numerical model ferré 2017 however in the multi model approach given alternative conceptual models are developed and evaluated in parallel it aids in solving the problem of conceptual surprises bredehoeft 2005 as they are sought out even though the multi model approach is less prone to conceptual surprises than the consensus approach it is not exempt from it using statistical terminology as explained by neuman 2003 both the consensus approach and the multi model approach are prone to type i errors underestimating model uncertainty by undersampling the model space and type ii errors relying on invalid model s however by using the multi model approach we are less likely to commit either this paper aims to provide an overview of the current status of the international literature on using multiple conceptual models in groundwater modelling reviews of the multi model approach to date such as diks and vrugt 2010 schöniger et al 2014 and singh et al 2010 mainly focus on the evaluation of multiple models and summarising of model results much less attention has been devoted to approaches that systematically develop and test different conceptual models this review is therefore organized around the following four research questions 1 what is conceptual model uncertainty 2 how are alternative conceptualizations developed 3 how can alternative conceptualizations be tested 4 how are different conceptualizations used for predictions each section provides an overview of approaches in published studies summarized in tables a 1 and a 2 and remaining challenges while this review will focus on applications in a hydrogeological context the concepts and challenges concerning model building and testing are applicable to spatio temporal dynamical environmental systems models in general 2 what is conceptual model uncertainty anderson and woessner 1992 and meyer and gee 1999 define a conceptual model as a pictorial qualitative description of the groundwater system in terms of its hydrogeological units system boundaries including time varying inputs and outputs and hydraulic as well as transport properties including their spatial variability the conceptual model is often seen as a hypothesis or a combination of hypotheses for the aspects of the groundwater system that are relevant to the model objective table a 1 provides a review of internationally peer reviewed publications that explicitly consider hydrogeological conceptual model uncertainty these 59 studies have been identified from the google scholar database where the search term groundwater model is combined with conceptual model uncertainty structural model uncertainty alternative conceptual models or multi model approach only studies that include alternative conceptual models developed for groundwater modelling for the purpose of either increasing system understanding or characterizing conceptual uncertainty have been included this list is considered to be representative of the treatment of conceptual model uncertainty through the multi model approach in groundwater research in the last two decades it is beyond the scope of this review to address the consensus conceptual model building approach for each study table a 1 provides a short summary of the alternative conceptualizations whether or not the objectives are explicitly defined and which aspects of the conceptualization are considered in this section we discuss what is included in model conceptualization how this needs to be linked to the objective of the modelling and the linguistic ambiguity in discussing conceptual model uncertainty 2 1 conceptual model aspects gupta et al 2012 outlines five formal stages in the model building process i conceptual physical structure ii conceptual process structure iii spatial variability structure iv equation structure and v computational structure the first two steps are part of the conceptual model the third and fourth are part of the mathematical model and the last step is the computational model this review will focus on the first two steps as well as the spatial variability structure fig 2 the latter is included in our discussion of aspects of conceptualization as some studies in table a 1 consider alternative models of the spatial variability structure as conceptual uncertainty the conceptual physical structure captures the hydrostratigraphy as well as the horizontal and vertical extent of the system respectively a watershed divide and an impermeable bottom boundary in fig 2 the conceptual physical structure further defines the hydrostratigraphic units and their extent the barriers and or conduits to groundwater flow faults and the compartmentalisation of the groundwater system into aquifers and aquitards the spatial variability structure is the description of the time invariant hydraulic properties of the system and their spatial variability magnifying glass in fig 2 the conceptual process structure contains the boundary conditions that are time variant such as heads and fluxes in and out of the system these can be externally controlled and largely independent from the groundwater system dynamics e g rainfall pumping rates drainage levels for mine dewatering lateral zero flow boundary or internally controlled and largely dependent on the groundwater system dynamics e g surface water groundwater interaction evapotranspiration 2 2 modelling objective despite being identified as the crucial first step in any modelling study anderson et al 2015a barnett et al 2012 brassington and younger 2010 only 33 out of 59 studies explicitly define the purpose or objective of the model in the introduction of their paper this is especially relevant as some conceptualization aspects such as detailed description of spatial variability of hydraulic properties might be important to one type of prediction e g travel time distribution but might be less relevant to another type of prediction e g hydraulic head distribution refsgaard et al 2012 zhou and herath 2016 alternative conceptualizations are for instance directly linked to model objectives when multiple conceptual models are developed to increase system understanding passadore et al 2011 or aid in water management strategy højberg and refsgaard 2005 many of the studies in which a model objective is not explicitly defined are focused on method development such as combining model averaging techniques rojas et al 2008 comparing ranking strategies foglia et al 2007 or model selection poeter and anderson 2005 2 3 linguistic uncertainty there is considerable linguistic ambiguity in describing the uncertainty of groundwater system conceptualization a prime example is the term structural uncertainty which can indicate uncertainty in geological structure as in refsgaard et al 2012 or can indicate the number and type of processes represented in the numerical model as exemplified in clark et al 2008 furthermore as argued in nearing et al 2016 any adequate model should encode all uncertainties to consider i e the known unknowns the name multi model approach is therefore somewhat misleading the multiple models in the multi model approach are samples of the overall plausible model choices that should characterize the conceptual uncertainty this is no different than sampling parameters over a feasible range to characterize the parameter uncertainty in this definition the multiple models in the multi model approach therefore only represent a single model characterizing known unknowns the linguistic uncertainty has led to a wide variation in what is considered to be conceptual model uncertainty table a 1 this varies from changing the hydraulic conductivity zonation extent and number carrera and neuman 1986 foglia et al 2007 lee et al 1992 meyer et al 2007 poeter and anderson 2005 to considering different process representations altman et al 1996 aphale and tonjes 2017 classifications of sources of uncertainty such as presented in walker et al 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 or vrugt 2016 often distinguish between model structure uncertainty incomplete understanding and simplified description of modelled processes parameter uncertainty parameter values and input uncertainty including scenario uncertainty external driving forces in groundwater model conceptualization the distinction between these classes is not well defined for example should changing the spatial variability structure of hydraulic conductivity such as in castro and goblet 2003 rogiers et al 2014 or linde et al 2015a be considered conceptual or parameter uncertainty suzuki et al 2008 provides a more pragmatic classification in which differentiation is made between first order uncertainties conceptual and lower order uncertainties lower order uncertainties are aleatory and can be modelled stochastically while conceptual uncertainties are epistemic and are characterized by alternative models common in both the consensus model approach and the multi model approach is that lower order uncertainties are modelled stochastically within each conceptualization for example hermans et al 2015 uses different training images to describe spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity with multiple point geostatistics this can be considered a first order uncertainty the lower order uncertainty is then the stochastic realisations of each training image likewise changing the boundary from a no flow to a head dependent boundary in mechal et al 2016 is first order uncertainty while changing the value of the head dependent boundary in aphale and tonjes 2017 is considered a characterization of lower order uncertainty 2 4 summary of what is considered conceptual model uncertainty groundwater system conceptualization is a collection of hypotheses describing the understanding of the different aspects of the groundwater system that are important to the modelling objective conceptual model uncertainty is the uncertainty due to the limited data and knowledge about a groundwater system it is the first order epistemic uncertainty that is generally considered reducible but cannot be characterized by continuously varying a variable linguistic ambiguity and vague definitions of what constitutes conceptual uncertainty however hinders transparent discussions of this major source of uncertainty we will therefore adopt the terminology of suzuki et al 2008 and focus on first order uncertainty 3 how are different conceptualizations developed not only is there a wide variety of conceptual model aspects there is also a wide variety of ways to generate different conceptualizations table a 1 generating different conceptualizations has not received much attention in the literature and guidance is likewise limited neuman and wierenga 2003 discuss different approaches in developing alternative conceptualization and suggest building alternative models until no other plausible explanations can be identified similar to this approach refsgaard et al 2012 introduced the concept of the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive mece criterion to hydrogeology in order to be mutually exclusive conceptual models have to be completely disjoint and represent independent hypotheses in order to be collectively exhaustive the entire range of plausible conceptual models needs to be defined including the unknown unknown plausible models the unknown unknowns are the conceptual models that current data has not yet uncovered and will lead to conceptual surprises if they are it has been acknowledged by several authors that defining a collectively exhaustive range is impossible in practice e g ferré 2017 hunt and welter 2010 refsgaard et al 2012 while the concepts and advice in neuman and wierenga 2003 and refsgaard et al 2012 are sound and highly relevant few of the studies in table a 1 adhere to them from the studies of table a 1 three main strategies are identified in developing alternative conceptualizations i varying complexity ii alternative interpretations and iii hypothesis testing these strategies are illustrated in fig 3 in the varying complexity strategy alternative models are generated by gradually increasing or decreasing the complexity of the same base conceptualization in fig 3 this is illustrated by describing the hydraulic property variability in an aquifer system either as i homogeneous units ii zonation or iii a spatially continuous parameterization the adequate complexity is typically evaluated based on the modelling goal höge et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 the available data schöniger et al 2015 or the informative model complexity freedman et al 2017 the underlying base conceptualization is not questioned and it is often implicitly assumed that all conflict between observed and simulated data is due to the inability to capture the full complexity of the groundwater system in the numerical model the varying complexity strategy does not fit well in the mece paradigm as different levels of complexity in implementing the same conceptualization do not ensure mutually exclusive hypotheses the alternative interpretation strategy consists of generating an ensemble of conceptualizations by different interpretations fig 3 illustrates this as two different hydrostratigraphic interpretations of the same borehole data set independent by being interpreted by different teams who have no knowledge about the each other s interpretation e g harrar et al 2003 hills and wierenga 1994 compared to the varying complexity strategy the alternative interpretation strategy has the advantage that the ensemble can include very different base conceptualizations e g refsgaard et al 2006 however the conceptualizations may end up being very similar and it is difficult to ensure that independent interpretations are mutually exclusive in the hypothesis testing strategy as advocated by beven 2018 an ensemble of models is generated by stating different hypotheses about the system rather than multiple teams formulating their best interpretation of the same data in the alternative interpretation strategy the hypothesis testing strategy involves the same team aiming to maximise the difference between alternative conceptualizations while still adhering to the same dataset in fig 3 this is exemplified through the presence or absence of a palaeovalley in two alternative conceptualizations both alternatives are consistent with the borehole data but the interpretation with the palaeovalley present may be considered less likely the chances are slim that such a vastly different conceptualization would be part of an ensemble generated through the alternative interpretation strategy where only the most likely model is sought none of the three strategies guarantees that the ensemble of models developed is collectively exhaustive but it is more likely for hypothesis testing to generate an ensemble of mutually exclusive models the next sections review model building approaches and are structured around the three key components of the conceptual model illustrated in fig 2 conceptual physical structure section 3 1 spatial variability structure section 3 2 and conceptual process structure section 3 3 the focus is on different approaches to building multiple conceptual models within these three aspects and how the different strategies to multi model building have been applied fig 3 finally section 3 4 discusses assigning prior probabilities to alternative models 3 1 conceptual physical structure table a 1 lists several examples where the conceptual physical structure of conceptual models has been tested through the alternative interpretation and the hypothesis testing strategy using an alternative interpretation strategy approach five alternative hydrostratigraphic models were generated by five different hydro geologists in the study by seifert et al 2012 resulting in different number of layers proportions of sand and clay in the quaternary sequence and the location of a limestone surface using the hypothesis testing strategy troldborg et al 2007 developed three different models by assuming different depositional histories and thereby different number of layers in the models while it is possible to test a global geometrical hypothesis about the conceptual physical structure e g troldborg et al 2007 it is more common to test specific geometrical features through local hypotheses a local hypothesis can for instance test the presence of a palaeovalley seifert et al 2008 the connection between two aquifers la vigna et al 2014 or the extent of an aquifer aphale and tonjes 2017 if one of the hypotheses is falsified in these studies the system understanding will improve in regards to that specific feature 3 2 spatial variability structure spatial variability structure is the component of the conceptual model that is most often included in a multi model approach because hydraulic and transport properties are often scale dependent and the adequate level of complexity depends on the modelling purpose the description of properties is often tested by developing models with the varying complexity strategy the strategy is applied either through dividing the study area into different zones of homogeneous hydraulic conductivities so alternative representations can be generated by combining the different zones e g foglia et al 2007 or by representing the geology in different conceptual models as homogenous layered zoned or as heterogeneous e g schöniger et al 2015 in the intraval las cruces trench experiment five different modelling teams developed unsaturated zone flow and transport models using the alternative interpretation strategy hills and wierenga 1994 despite differences between the models such as isotropic anisotropic and spatially uniform heterogeneous soil properties none of the models was clearly superior considering several performance criteria geostatistical variogram based approaches facilitate the stochastic generation of many pixel based k realizations based on the same data and assumptions to characterize the lower order uncertainty hypothesis testing strategy has been applied assuming different variogram models to represent the k variation within the system samper and neuman 1989 ye et al 2004 rather than defining different facies variogram pham and tsai 2015 2016 used three different variogram based geostatistical approaches indicator kriging indicator zonation and general parameterization elshall et al 2013 to describe the variation between clay and sand units as smooth or sharp in the multipoint geostatistics approach mps strebelle 2002 different conceptualizations can be represented by adopting different training images using the hypothesis testing strategy studies that have applied the mps approach using more than one training image in groundwater modelling are still rare but include studies by he et al 2014 hermans et al 2015 and linde et al 2015a groundwater flow through fractured rock aquifers complicates the conceptualization as the groundwater flow occurs through both matrix and fractures selroos et al 2002 considered e g stochastic continuum models and discrete fracture networks as alternative conceptualizations of fractured rock in sweden the models were shown to have different results in terms of solute transport behaviour 3 3 conceptual process structure the conceptual process structure is the component in the conceptual model that is considered least in the multi model approaches in the analysed studies table a 1 according to gupta et al 2012 this lack of attention in literature is mainly due to the process description typically being assumed to be complete however as illustrated by examples in bredehoeft 2005 conceptual surprises might also occur for the conceptual process structure as well as for the other components of the conceptual model among the many boundary conditions imposed on a groundwater model groundwater recharge is by far the one that has received most attention in the literature a number of methods exist for calculating groundwater recharge that take into account different sources of information doble and crosbie 2017 scanlon et al 2002 which can lead to different estimates of recharge when used in an alternative interpretation strategy approach ye et al 2010 used the maxey eakin method the chloride mass balance method and the net infiltration method to derive different estimates of recharge to assess the conceptual uncertainty each of the different interpretation methods resulted in a different spatial distribution of recharge different levels of model complexity have often been used across different spatial scales such as for groundwater recharge estimation doble and crosbie 2017 models range from simplified heuristic models at a global scale döll and fiedler 2008 simple 1 d bucket models for regional scale areas flint et al 2000 to more complex numerical solutions of richards equation at the field scale leterme et al 2012 neto et al 2016 nettasana 2012 tested the complexity of zonation of recharge by defining recharge based only on soil type in one model and in another model both on soil type and land use the hypothesis testing approach for recharge estimation mainly focuses on a specific feature kikuchi et al 2015 rojas et al 2010a aphale and tonjes 2017 investigate the effect of a landfill on local recharge with three different hypotheses hypothesis testing for lateral boundary conditions has been applied to lateral exchange fluxes with adjacent aquifers lukjan et al 2016 mechal et al 2016 nettasana 2012 kikuchi et al 2015 test the existence of underflow through a subsurface zone into an adjacent basin 3 4 assigning a prior probability a crucial aspect in any bayesian modelling approach is assigning the prior probabilities this prior is based on an initial understanding of the probability of a model related to the alternative models and is updated when additional data is introduced in the model testing step section 4 the assigned prior for the reviewed studies are presented in the first column of table a 2 in order to be objective and unbiased different conceptual models are often considered to be equally likely uninformed by data or knowledge from the 26 studies in table a 2 that assign a prior probability 21 use a uniform and thus uninformed prior probability prior probabilities do however have a large influence on the posterior probability if the data used for updating the prior has limited information content rojas et al 2009 showed that including proper prior knowledge about the conceptualizations increased predictive performance when compared to assigning uninformed priors additionally uninformed priors are not consistent with the hypothesis testing approach as shown in fig 3c if no other palaeovalleys were observed in the area the palaeovalley hypothesis would be possible but unlikely a uniform prior probability would assign each hypothesis equal likelihood which would not be appropriate in the reviewed studies the prior has been based on expert opinion data consistency and model complexity for instance using expert opinion in the study by ye et al 2008 the prior probability was based on expert s belief in alternative recharge models considering the consistency with available data and knowledge systematic expert elicitation is a well established technique in environmental risk assessment and modelling krueger et al 2012 to formalize expert belief into model priors there are however few published studies on expert elicitation in groundwater conceptualization context elshall and tsai 2014 used data consistency to inform the prior probability by basing it on calibration of hydrofacies using lithological data finally using model complexity to inform the prior in the study by ye et al 2005 higher probabilities were assigned to favour models with fewer parameters this was also suggested by rojas et al 2010a as a means of penalizing increased complexity nearing et al 2016 argues that assignment of probabilities should not be based on a single component of the model but rather be based on the whole model in the reviewed literature the priors have however only been based on individual components 3 5 remaining challenges the review of studies in table a 1 has shown that alternative models have been developed either by i varying complexity of model description ii making alternative interpretations or iii stating different hypotheses about the groundwater system the goal of the multi model development process is to define a mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive range of models in which the true unknown model exists and where the risk of uncovering a conceptual surprise is zero this is obviously unattainable and we therefore discuss the remaining challenges next first table a 1 shows that studies typically focus on exploring different hypotheses for a single aspect of the model conceptual physical conceptual process spatial variability structure only 5 out of 59 papers consider all three aspects simultaneously aphale and tonjes 2017 foglia et al 2013 mechal et al 2016 rojas et al 2010a ye et al 2010 for the range of models to be collectively exhaustive all conceptually uncertain aspects have to be considered second the study objective is not always considered when alternative models are developed for the multi model approach table a 1 models should encapsulate the behaviour that is important to the modelling objective jakeman et al 2006 and the same should be true when characterizing conceptual uncertainty on the other hand what may seem like inconsequential choices in model construction may be important to predictions foglia et al 2013 to avoid ignoring the inconsequential model choices the model objective should be used to guide the development of alternative models this does imply that ensembles are not necessarily the same for all model objectives haitjema 2005 third alternative conceptual models are not always defined as mutually exclusive i e if model a is true models b and c are false falsification which is welcomed in the multi model approach beven 2018 will increase system understanding beven and young 2013 but how much will depend on how the conceptual models are defined in the alternative interpretation and varying complexity strategy the models are not necessarily mutually exclusive in the sense that they do not represent different ideas about the groundwater system in the varying complexity approach alternative models are generated based on the same conceptual model represented in different complexities a risk in the alternative interpretation strategy is that alternative models are almost identical in terms of understanding of the groundwater system fourth the way the alternative models are developed does not always reduce the risk of conceptual surprises using the alternative interpretation strategy many groups will come up with what they believe to be the most likely model e g seifert et al 2012 using the varying complexity strategy only the complexity and not conceptual ideas will be tested it is therefore unlikely that a conceptual surprise will be found before one is surprised in both alternative interpretation and varying complexity strategy last when assigning priors to a range of models that we cannot ensure are collectively exhaustive how do we account for unknown unknowns the sum of prior probabilities for the ensemble of models always add up to one in the reviewed studies thereby assuming a collectively exhaustive range of models have been defined as discussed already this is extremely difficult to ensure so an approach to assign priors that accounts for unknown unknowns remains a challenge the hypothesis testing strategy seems to be the only model development strategy that can ensure the models developed are mutually exclusive however hypotheses might still overlap for example bresciani et al 2018 test three hypotheses to explain mountain range recharge to a basin aquifer governed either by i mountain front recharge ii mountain block recharge or iii both mountain front recharge and mountain block recharge some might argue that the third hypothesis overlaps to some extent with the other two violating the mutually exclusive principle however only including the two first hypotheses claiming they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive would set up a false dilemma as parts of both hypotheses can be correct at the same time it is thereby not always possible to state mutually exclusive hypotheses in hydrogeology where the answer will be boolean true or false for instance connectivity or no connectivity between aquifers troldborg et al 2010 sometimes the mutually exclusive hypotheses will have to be stated as endmembers e g mountain front recharge and mountain block recharge and the answer will be somewhere in between guillaume et al 2016 discuss two methods to accommodate the conceptual surprises in the model development process adopting adaptive management and applying models that explore the unknown in the first approach management plans are kept open towards change and the iterative modelling process illustrated in fig 1 is a part of the modelling plan the second method anticipates surprises by placing fewer restrictions on what is considered possible by stating bold hypotheses about a system ensures that system understanding can progress caers 2018 a bold hypothesis around recharge inflows from faults and deep fissures connected to an adjacent aquifer is tested by rojas et al 2010a the available data did not give reason to reject either of the models to achieve an increase in system understanding but the alternatives were bold we argue that by being forced to be bold when developing hypotheses the risk of rejecting plausible models by omission and adopting an invalid range of models is greatly reduced however defining bold hypotheses does not preclude rejecting plausible models by omission hunt and welter 2010 suggest to use terminology that recognize the existence of these unknown unknowns by presenting results with a specification of which aspects of the model that has been considered thereby enhancing transparency an approach that aims at directly identifying unknown unknowns through bold hypotheses taking into account the largest possible range of the conceptual uncertainty have not been applied yet and remain a subject for further research 4 how are different conceptualizations tested after developing a set of conceptual models the models should be tested to establish to what degree they are consistent with the available data and knowledge neuman and wierenga 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 groundwater models used for safety assessment of nuclear waste repositories for instance have been subject of considerable validation efforts hassan 2003 rogiers et al 2014 tsang 1987 1991 model testing and validation covers the same model evaluation process in which models are confronted with new data however the term validation is avoided in this review as models can never be proven correct konikow and bredehoeft 1992 also there is no internationally agreed definition of validation which has led several organizations to develop their own operational definitions of validation perko et al 2009 finally validation encourages testing to have a positive result oreskes et al 1994 that is models are not expected to be wrong as falsification is important in order to advance our understanding of a system beven 2018 the term model testing is preferred here models are rejected if they are found to be inconsistent with data in a bayesian context however a conceptual model can never be completely rejected its probability can only be greatly reduced as there is a risk of eliminating models that could turn out to be good representations when new data is introduced guillaume et al 2016 suggest to keep rejection decisions temporary to be able to return to otherwise excluded models the models that are consistent with observational data are however only conditionally validated because they have not been proven to be inconsistent with data yet beven and young 2013 oreskes et al 1994 testing of conceptual models is not always done as part of the multi model approach to groundwater modelling pfister and kirchner 2017 in table a 2 only 30 out of 59 studies applied some form of model testing however model testing presents three major advantages first systematically developing and testing conceptual models will allow one to explain why no other conceptual models are plausible neuman and wierenga 2003 and thereby reducing the risk of adopting an invalid range of models through systematic documentation and rejection of conceptual models the modelling workflow becomes transparent and traceable potentially avoiding court cases challenging the validity of conceptual models in the impact assessment of the carmichael coalmine in queensland australia available geological and hydrological data allowed for at least one other conceptualization of ecological and culturally significant springs that could potentially be impacted by the coalmine currell et al 2017 however a conceptual model leading to an acceptably low modelled impact on the springs was adopted which lead to the approval of the mine a systematic model development and testing approach for conceptual modelling through the multi model approach would be able to shed light on this type of confirmation bias second model testing can lead to uncovering of unknown unknowns bredehoeft 2005 not many papers exist that actually reject all of the initial conceptual models or hypotheses about a groundwater system and come up with new plausible explanations which renders this advantage of the model testing procedure somewhat invisible beven 2018 there are however a few examples where models are conditionally validated after ad hoc modifications to the model e g krabbenhoft and anderson 1986 nishikawa 1997 woolfenden 2008 ad hoc modifications are slight changes applied to a current model in order to explain conflicting data but without falsifying the model as a whole for example sanford buapeng 1996 developed a steady state groundwater flow model for the bangkok area which was falsified by apparent groundwater ages an ad hoc modification that assumed groundwater velocities were higher during the last glacial maximum yielded a simulated apparent age closer to the observations thereby conditionally validating the model with the ad hoc modification ad hoc hypotheses are sometimes criticized as they make models unfalsifiable and knowledge does not progress through modifications caers 2018 however their existence illustrate the difficulty of developing a collectively exhaustive range of models initially and model testing is imperative if we want to uncover this third bayesian multi model approaches benefit from allowing their prior probabilities to be updated because it dilutes the effect of the choice of priors rojas et al 2009 it is here worth mentioning that most of the studies in table a 2 that apply a bayesian approach update the prior probability using criteria based weights section 5 1 while only eight studies apply a model testing procedure in the subsequent sections data relevant to conceptual model testing section 4 1 steps undertaken when testing conceptual models section 4 2 and the remaining challenges within model testing 4 3 are discussed table a 2 presents an overview of the model testing applied in the studies identified using the multi model approach section 2 4 1 conceptual model testing data three basic requirements for the nature of the data used for model testing are typically discussed i it should be different from the data used for developing the conceptual models tarantola 2006 ii it should be different from the data used for calibrating the model neuman and wierenga 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 and iii it should depend on the modelling purpose beven 2018 4 1 1 model testing data and model building data tarantola 2006 distinguishes between a priori information used to develop hypotheses and observations used to test models post hoc theorizing failing to separate model development and testing data and accepting the resulting model might lead to models being conditionally validated due to circular reasoning e g the model should look this way to explain the data and the model is true because it explains the data another reason for keeping those two groups of data separate is to avoid underestimating conceptual uncertainty by using geophysical skytem data to both build a training image conceptual model and as soft constraint as part of a multiple point geostatistics algorithm he et al 2014 demonstrated that this over conditioning lead to an underestimation of uncertainty 4 1 2 model testing data and model calibration data testing data should also be different from calibration data to avoid that the conditional confirmation becomes an extension of the calibration neuman and wierenga 2003 in a review of handling geological uncertainty refsgaard et al 2012 highlighted that it is possible to compensate for conceptual errors in groundwater flow models by calibrating parameters to fit the solution the best test for any conceptualization involves comparison of model predictions to observations outside the calibration base cross validation techniques standard practice in statistical inference are underutilised in groundwater modelling methodologies that minimize error variance provide some safeguard against calibration induced acceptance of improper conceptualizations kohavi 1995 moore and doherty 2005 tonkin et al 2007 4 1 3 model testing data and the modelling objective refsgaard et al 2012 further concluded that models that perform well according to one dataset might not perform well according to another dataset this suggests that updating of prior probability should preferably be based upon the data type that the models are to make predictions about davis et al 1991 argues that testing model performance outside areas relevant to the model objective can lead to rejection of models that might actually be fit for purpose however in many instances the data type that the models are used to make predictions about such as groundwater fluxes or water balances may not be directly available jakeman et al 2006 on the other hand rojas et al 2010b showed that by introducing more and more data in a multi model approach they were able to further and further discriminate between retained conceptual models suggesting the more diverse and numerous data that are used for testing the more confidence in the conceptualization 4 2 conceptual model testing steps in the previous discussion the type and nature of auxiliary data to test conceptual models were introduced but how should such data be incorporated to undertake a conceptual model testing exercise neuman and wierenga 2003 introduced a three step workflow for testing and updating prior probability of alternative conceptual models table 1 in addition to these three steps a fourth step the post audit anderson and woessner 1992 will be reviewed here 4 2 1 model testing step 1 the first step in the neuman and wierenga 2003 guideline is referred to as avoid conflict with data where the model evaluation happens before the conceptual models are converted into mathematical models in doing so the conceptual models can be compared quantitatively or qualitatively with data without parameters compensating for a wrong conceptualization table a 2 suggests this model testing step is rarely applied which is not necessarily true as the evaluation of conceptual models happens outside of a numerical groundwater model it is probably preceding the workflow in many of the studies as part of the hydrogeological investigation but not explicitly reported on in the review by linde et al 2015b a workflow of corroboration and rejection is presented that focuses on the integration of geophysical data in hydrogeological modelling for example synthetic geophysical data may be generated from different conceptual models and subsequently compared with observed geophysical data hermans et al 2015 the prior probability of each conceptual model is then updated based on the difference between observed and simulated geophysical data in this model testing step however the model evaluation does not have to be qualitative for example hydraulic head and electrical conductivity data may be used to distinguish between hypotheses about whether mountain front and mountain block recharge was dominating as a recharge mechanism to basin aquifers bresciani et al 2018 4 2 2 model testing step 2 the second step in which data is introduced to test alternative conceptual models is called preliminary mathematical model testing meyer et al 2007 neuman and wierenga 2003 nishikawa 1997 a similar modelling step is suggested by la vigna et al 2014 where for each alternative conceptual model a simple numerical model is set up and compared with testing data hydraulic head the advantage of applying this model testing step is that spending time on setting up complex mathematical models for poor conceptual models is avoided 4 2 3 model testing step 3 the third model testing step in neuman and wierenga 2003 is called confirm model here the mathematical model is set up in its most complex form as a numerical model comprises a description of the groundwater system as a whole all assumptions and the interaction of assumptions are tested at once models are then rejected either due to 1 unrealistic parameter values 2 wrongly predicted state variables or 3 non convergence sun and yeh 1985 showed that the optimized parameters cannot be separated from the parameter structure on which they are based on this means if the conceptual model is incorrect so are the estimated parameter values therefore calibrated hydraulic conductivity values are often compared with independently measured values from pumping tests e g engelhardt et al 2014 harrar et al 2003 mechal et al 2016 poeter and anderson 2005 to check whether parameter estimates are realistic unfortunately scale effects may impede direct comparison depending on the quality and representativeness of the data they may or may not be able to discriminate between alternative models as was demonstrated by engelhardt et al 2014 and mechal et al 2016 for calibrated hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values respectively on the other hand in the synthetic study by poeter and anderson 2005 13 out of 61 models were rejected because the calibrated hydraulic conductivity of a low conductivity zone exceeded the conductivity of what was considered a high conductivity zone apart from comparing calibrated parameter values with observations the predicted system variables can be compared with observations such as hydraulic head stream discharge tracer concentrations etc in some multi model studies the number of models are limited and the comparison of simulated and observed values can happen manually for instance castro and goblet 2003 could reject all but one conceptual model by manual comparison of the direct simulation of 4he concentrations with observed data however in cases where the lower order uncertainty is characterized within each conceptualization automatic procedures are necessary to efficiently search for models that match field data rogiers et al 2014 rojas et al 2010b c a schöniger et al 2015 zeng et al 2015 for instance rojas et al 2008 used the importance sampling technique generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 to sample combinations of parameter sets and conceptual models and reject models according to an acceptance threshold for the misfit between simulated and observed model predictions finally non convergence of the groundwater model can indicate an error in the conceptual model anderson et al 2015b the interaction of assumptions that lead to groundwater models not converging has in many studies been regarded as sufficient evidence of conceptual model invalidity aphale and tonjes 2017 poeter and anderson 2005 in rojas et al 2008 the models that did not meet the convergence acceptance criteria were assigned a likelihood of zero eliminating their contribution to the model ensemble predictive distribution however conceptual models that do not converge may potentially be valid if no effort towards making them converge is made the effort towards making a model converge in the consensus approach will probably be larger than in the multi model approach as there will still be other models left in the latter approach 4 2 4 model testing step 4 the last model testing step considered in this review is the post audit the post audit is performed years after the end of the modelling process evaluating forecasts of the model on newly collected data anderson and woessner 1992 summarize some modelling studies that have used post audits while bredehoeft 2005 focussed on identifying the conceptual surprises that occurred in these modelling studies as a result of a post audit the advantage of the post audit is that the model testing data is by default independent from the model development data satisfying one of the basic requirements of model testing data section 4 1 however it is inconvenient to rely on this type of model testing as there may potentially be a long waiting period from the end of the model process until new data is collected 4 3 remaining challenges this review has shown that models can be tested in at least four different steps in the modelling process i as a conceptual model ii as a simple numerical model iii as a complex numerical model and iv as a complex numerical model years after development in each step the prior probability can be updated and sometimes models can be rejected based on lack of support by observation of state variables parameters or because the model did not converge identifying suitable data for model testing remains challenging first in theory the notion that testing data should be independent is sound but in practice the separation of data is difficult many studies rely on ranking criteria to update the prior probability which we will discuss in section 5 1 rather than updating prior probability based on data that is independent of the model development in using all data when developing models it is no surprise that the models actually fit data post hoc theorizing can easily result in undersampling of the model space kerr 1998 as an initial range of plausible models will be accepted because of circular reasoning without looking for other plausible models however in many studies independent data might not be available and saving some data for the model testing process is a trade off between being able to define a more complete model and being able to test assumptions cross validation can partly address this issue during inference or calibration but will remain impractical in the conceptualization phase model testing step 1 as biases towards existing but unavailable data might be made second in theory the data used for model testing should depend on the model objective in order to not extrapolate when making predictions a challenge arises when having to ensure that the model found fit for purpose for one dataset e g hydraulic head will also be fit for purpose to predict another dataset e g concentrations for example the alternative models developed by castro and goblet 2003 all performed well when calibrated with hydraulic head however all but one model was rejected when tracer data was introduced sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can potentially be used to identify which parameters are relevant to the predictions and to what extent they can be constrained by the available data third the information content in the model testing data is in many studies relatively limited e g rojas et al 2010c the information content of model testing data relates to the amount and type of data available but also the uncertainty of the data for example as discussed in relation to comparing calibrated hydraulic conductivity values to observed hydraulic conductivity values in section 4 2 such comparison can be unreliable the consequence of only limited information content in the model testing data is that discrimination among alternative models often cannot be made seifert et al 2008 in addition in a bayesian context the consequence of limited information content in the testing data is that the prior probability will have a large influence on the posterior probability e g rojas et al 2009 another challenge relates to when a model can be considered falsified models are groups of hypotheses rather than a single hypothesis in itself and many other assumptions are made in groundwater models such as model code and the characterization of lower order uncertainty the model prediction thereby depends on many interactions of independent hypotheses and assumptions inconsistencies between model and data should therefore not necessarily be attributed to a single hypothesis and result in the falsification of that hypothesis pfister and kirchner 2017 to accommodate these challenges a more systematic approach to model development and testing is needed where parts of the available data are used only for model testing ideally the data selected for model testing should depend on the model objective and the information content should be large enough to discriminate between models there is thereby an opportunity for systematic quantitative or qualitative assessment prior to study i which aspects of the model will be relevant to the objectives and ii what data are needed to distinguish between hypotheses 5 how are different conceptualizations used for predictions what has emerged from several of the studies so far in this review is that multiple plausible models may coexist for a given study area so how are predictions made with multiple models for some studies e g foglia et al 2013 one model the most likely based on the highest support in data is selected for predictive purposes section 4 1 while other studies e g tsai and li 2008 focus on ensemble predictions based on all plausible models section 4 2 a modelling step that receives increasing attention in the literature is the identification of additional data needs in order to be able to discriminate between the alternative conceptual models e g kikuchi et al 2015 section 4 3 the last four columns in table a 2 present an overview of approaches being adopted when making predictions with multiple models as mentioned in the introduction several literature reviews diks and vrugt 2010 schöniger et al 2014 singh et al 2010 have already focussed on the model prediction and evaluation aspect of the multi model approach it is therefore not the aim to give a comprehensive review here but to give a general overview of the most often applied approaches and instead focus on how the model development approach discussed in section 3 affects the predictions 5 1 model weighing and selection techniques model weighing and selection techniques rank models according to how well they fit data where the models with the lowest rank or weight have least support in the data the purpose of ranking is to select the best model but for many of the studies in table a 2 ranking also provides weights for a model averaging technique section 5 2 for an excellent review of model selection techniques the reader is referred to schöniger et al 2014 in selecting between models two principles often receive attention the principle of parsimony favouring the simplest model and the principle of maximum likelihood favouring the model that gives the highest chance to facts we have observed however the principle of consistency favouring models that do not contradict any effects we know is even more important to consider when choosing between models martinez and gupta 2011 the most commonly applied ranking techniques in the analysed studies in table a 2 are the information criteria including akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1973 corrected aic aicc sugiura 1978 hurvich and tsai 1989 bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and kashyap information criterion kic neuman 2003 and glue the ranking from the information criteria depends on an error term representing model fit to observations and a penalty term that penalizes model complexity in glue the ranking is only based on an error term 5 2 model averaging techniques model averaging techniques seek to summarize the results from the multiple model approach into an optimal prediction and a single measure of the total uncertainty by averaging the posterior distributions raftery et al 2005 this posterior is obtained through an averaging approach that weighs the different model predictions according to the weight they obtained from the testing or ranking combined with a prior probability of the individual models for excellent summaries of model averaging techniques the reader is referred to diks and vrugt 2010 and singh et al 2010 the most commonly applied approach to averaging predictions of conceptually different hydrogeological models is bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 the averaged predictions from multiple models have been shown to be more robust and less biased than the prediction from a single model vrugt and robinson 2007 furthermore they produce a more realistic and reliable description of the predictive uncertainty rojas et al 2010a the bayesian model evidence is sometimes approximated with the information criteria to reduce computational effort constituting the maximum likelihood bma mlbma approach suggested by neuman 2003 given many of the information criteria are developed as model selection criteria they tend to assign a large weight to only a few models e g nettasana 2012 rojas et al 2010c ye et al 2010 which is the main drawback of the mlbma approach this leads to the introduction of a statistical scaling factor to the information criteria tsai and li 2008 leading to a flatter weight distribution among the alternative models one of the disadvantages of the averaging procedures is that the system details of how each conceptual model affects the prediction is lost gupta et al 2012 to solve this problem tsai and elshall 2013 suggested the hierarchal bma h bma approach where the individual conceptual model components are evaluated through a bma tree in the bma tree model components are organized at separate levels and the contribution of uncertainty of each aspect to the total uncertainty is quantified by separating the uncertain model components in a bma tree the different aspects can be prioritized and provide an understanding of the uncertainty propagation through each uncertain aspect in the conceptual model 5 3 identify additional data needs refining the prediction made by multiple models may sometimes be necessary in order to decrease the range of model predictions considering too many conceptual models one may lose the purpose of model development because it indicates high model prediction uncertainty bredehoeft 2005 højberg and refsgaard 2005 therefore some studies have focussed on identifying additional data needs that could potentially discriminate between alternative conceptual models to reduce conceptual uncertainty e g kikuchi et al 2015 pham and tsai 2015 2016 the goal of collecting new data is not to confirm existing conceptual models but to be able to discriminate between them kikuchi et al 2015 offers a short review of optimal design studies in hydrogeology that attempt to identify the optimal measurement sets for monitoring networks to maximize a data utility function for a few studies conceptual model discrimination is the design objective knopman et al 1991 knopman and voss 1988 1989 usunoff et al 1992 yakirevich et al 2013 but this approach has yet not received much attention in hydrogeology according to kikuchi et al 2015 identifying additional data needs will guide the post audit activity section 4 2 and the use of these data for model testing will ensure the data is independent from the model development data 5 4 remaining challenges this review shows that current studies often either used criteria based weights either to identify the most plausible models or to provide weights for a model averaging technique the current methods are generally limited by what is attainable through the model development approach the main limitations and thereby consequences of the model development approach for current methods on making predictions with multiple conceptualizations are discussed next first we can never make sure that we have developed a collectively exhaustive range of conceptual models e g ferré 2017 hunt and welter 2010 nearing and gupta 2018 as discussed in section 3 but the prediction methods and the approaches in identifying additional data types rely on this undersampling the model space will lead to underestimation of the prediction uncertainty in the model averaging approaches furthermore by focussing the collection of additional data on data that can discriminate between currently known conceptualizations it is assumed that we already know all plausible conceptualizations a challenge remains in directing additional data collection towards uncovering unknown unknown plausible conceptual models second we can never make sure that the adopted range of models developed is valid type ii error e g nearing and gupta 2018 nevertheless both the bma and the criteria based model weighing techniques rely on the best approximation of reality being in the ensemble in the model selection approaches we can therefore never make sure that the best approximation of reality is selected as it will always be conditional on the developed range of models in the model averaging approaches adopting an invalid range of models leads to biased predictions which remains a challenge third in bma it is assumed that models are mutually exclusive so that none of the predictions are given a higher weight following almost identical models give similar predictions not having mutually exclusive models gives a false sense of confidence in the modelling results as a large number of alternative models considered will give the impression that a large range of the model space has been uncovered fourth the criteria based model weighing techniques rely only on the principle of parsimony and the principle of maximum likelihood while the principle of consistency is disregarded through calibration through the calibration step the model is trained to compensate for a possible conceptual error through biased parameters refsgaard et al 2012 white et al 2014 and the principle of consistency is therefore not taken into account criteria based model weighing techniques use the same data twice in the modelling process which as discussed in section 4 1 leads to circular reasoning giving a false confidence in the result also inconsistent assumptions in the conceptual model cannot be identified without introducing new data but in the criteria based model weighing techniques models are readily rejected through zero weight as they tend to inflate the weights of a few best models e g ye et al 2010 the models that best compensate for conceptual errors through biased parameters are then combined to make predictions through model averaging where it is claimed that conceptual model uncertainty is taken into account however given the biased parameters of the models circular reasoning and rejection of plausible models this result may be both biased and over conservative last the model averaging techniques assume that a single result is valid however if the range of plausible model are mutually exclusive they might lead to distinctly different predictions one model might have a distinctly different prediction than the ensemble average or the probability mass may concentrate in multiple areas this is the case for the synthetic example in the study by kikuchi et al 2015 where the spring flow depletion prediction is bimodal in this case the average prediction is an outlier to where the probability mass is concentrated the average prediction of an ensemble especially bi or multi modally distributed ensembles may not be a valid model outcome winter and nychka 2010 it is therefore preferable to summarise ensembles through more robust metrics such as percentiles e g 5th 50th and 95th as these will always be actual results made by a model suggestions on solving the remaining challenges in relation to populating the model space first second third point has already been discussed in section 3 5 the challenges mentioned in the remaining two points occur because of the reliance on methods that assume a single best model can be found a way forward to accommodate these challenges could be full probabilistic approaches transdimensional inference methods have been applied in geophysics e g ray and key 2012 and reservoir geology e g sambridge et al 2006 for similar problems in these approaches e g reversible jump markov chain monte carlo green 1995 sampling occurs within the same dimension conceptual model but also between dimensions conceptual models exploring both the conceptual model space and the parameter space 6 conclusion a review of 59 studies applying the multi model approach for hydrogeological conceptual model development has shown the following 1 a significant linguistic uncertainty still exists of what is considered conceptual uncertainty there is a need for more consistent terminology 2 current studies in conceptual model uncertainty often only focus on a single or limited set of conceptualization issues there is a need for a systematic conceptualization approach to ensure all aspects of conceptualization are covered and documented 3 current studies rarely consider the objective of the model before developing alternative models for the multi model approach the objective of the model should have an influence on both the model development and the data used for model testing 4 for each conceptual issue identified alternative conceptual models should be formulated as hypotheses which at least in theory can be refuted hypothesis testing especially bold hypothesis testing is essential to increase system understanding and avoiding conceptual surprises 5 in bayesian inference with multiple models informed priors are recommend especially if the information content in the hypothesis testing data is low 6 the current multi model prediction methods assume that there is a single outcome of the modelling process and that the developed models are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive presenting results requires a shift in mentality towards presenting ranges and acknowledging that unknown unknowns exist the multi model approach is superior to the consensus approach as it is transparent and accounts for conceptual uncertainty however to benefit fully from the multi model

kitanidis editor in chief with the assistance of jian luo associate editor hydrogeological conceptual models are collections of hypotheses describing the understanding of groundwater systems and they are considered one of the major sources of uncertainty in groundwater flow and transport modelling a common method for characterizing the conceptual uncertainty is the multi model approach where alternative plausible conceptual models are developed and evaluated this review aims to give an overview of how multiple alternative models have been developed tested and used for predictions in the multi model approach in international literature and to identify the remaining challenges the review shows that only a few guidelines for developing the multiple conceptual models exist and these are rarely followed the challenge of generating a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive range of plausible models is yet to be solved regarding conceptual model testing the reviewed studies show that a challenge remains in finding data that is both suitable to discriminate between conceptual models and relevant to the model objective we argue that there is a need for a systematic approach to conceptual model building where all aspects of conceptualization relevant to the study objective are covered for each conceptual issue identified alternative models representing hypotheses that are mutually exclusive should be defined using a systematic hypothesis based approach increases the transparency in the modelling workflow and therefore the confidence in the final model predictions while also anticipating conceptual surprises while the focus of this review is on hydrogeological applications the concepts and challenges concerning model building and testing are applicable to spatio temporal dynamical environmental systems models in general keywords conceptual models model evaluation model rejection multi model framework conceptual model uncertainty 1 introduction groundwater model conceptualization is a crucial first step in groundwater model development anderson et al 2015a it provides a systematic internally consistent overview of system boundaries properties and processes relevant to the research question bridging the gap between hydrogeological characterization and groundwater modelling as the conceptualization is related to the fundamentals of the problem definition it is considered one of the major sources of uncertainty in numerical groundwater modelling gupta et al 2012 estimating parameters through calibration with an inadequate conceptual model may lead to biased parameter values doherty and welter 2010 biased parameter values are especially problematic when extrapolating to predictions that are of a different type than the calibration data represent a different stress regime or have a longer timeframe than the calibration period white et al 2014 not accounting for conceptual model uncertainty can potentially greatly underestimate total uncertainty and give false confidence in model results as vividly illustrated in bredehoeft 2005 to develop conceptual models two major approaches have been traditionally applied i the consensus model approach brassington and younger 2010 and ii the multi model approach neuman and wierenga 2003 fig 1 the development of conceptual models is based on the available geological and hydrological information which are observed data such as water levels borehole information and tracer concentrations but often also include a component of soft knowledge such as geological insights or expert interpretation in the single consensus conceptual model approach all available observations and knowledge is iteratively integrated into a single conceptual model barnett et al 2012 izady et al 2014 providing a staircase of confidence gedeon et al 2013 in this case the conceptual model represents the current consensus on system behaviour brassington and younger 2010 as illustrated in schwartz et al 2017 conceptual model uncertainty is generally accounted for in the consensus approach by increasing the complexity of the model increasing complexity effectively turns conceptual model uncertainty into parameter uncertainty by adding more processes to the model and or increasing resolution in space and time increasing the degrees of freedom means that non uniqueness increases which is often balanced through optimal model complexity favouring the simplest model that can adequately reproduce historical conditions young et al 1996 the main advantage is that it comprehensively captures conceptual issues in the model the main drawback is that models quickly become intractable and too computationally demanding to carry out parameter inference another mechanism that is often applied to account for conceptual uncertainty is conservatism favouring the conceptualization that will result in the largest impact wingefors et al 1999 although inherently biased the main advantage is that introducing conservative assumptions make the problem tractable and provides confidence that the simulated impacts are not underestimated the largest drawback however is that conservative assumptions depend on the type of impact investigated may not be internally consistent and can lead to missed opportunities freedman et al 2017 the alternative to the consensus approach is the multi model approach in which an ensemble of different conceptualizations is considered throughout the model process in parallel rather than sequentially this approach reflects that the hydrogeological functioning of an aquifer system can be interpreted in different ways especially if the available data is scarce anderson et al 2015a beven 2002 neuman and wierenga 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 in the multi model approach the aim is not to find the single best model but to find an ensemble of alternative conceptual models each with a different hypothesis on system behaviour as depicted in fig 1 this is also an iterative process in which conceptual models are removed from the ensemble when they are falsified by increased knowledge or data and where conceptual models are added when new data or insights prompt the development of a new hypothesis on model behaviour in the consensus approach once committed to a particular conceptualization there is considerable inertia to change it as this would often involve a complete overhaul of the numerical model ferré 2017 however in the multi model approach given alternative conceptual models are developed and evaluated in parallel it aids in solving the problem of conceptual surprises bredehoeft 2005 as they are sought out even though the multi model approach is less prone to conceptual surprises than the consensus approach it is not exempt from it using statistical terminology as explained by neuman 2003 both the consensus approach and the multi model approach are prone to type i errors underestimating model uncertainty by undersampling the model space and type ii errors relying on invalid model s however by using the multi model approach we are less likely to commit either this paper aims to provide an overview of the current status of the international literature on using multiple conceptual models in groundwater modelling reviews of the multi model approach to date such as diks and vrugt 2010 schöniger et al 2014 and singh et al 2010 mainly focus on the evaluation of multiple models and summarising of model results much less attention has been devoted to approaches that systematically develop and test different conceptual models this review is therefore organized around the following four research questions 1 what is conceptual model uncertainty 2 how are alternative conceptualizations developed 3 how can alternative conceptualizations be tested 4 how are different conceptualizations used for predictions each section provides an overview of approaches in published studies summarized in tables a 1 and a 2 and remaining challenges while this review will focus on applications in a hydrogeological context the concepts and challenges concerning model building and testing are applicable to spatio temporal dynamical environmental systems models in general 2 what is conceptual model uncertainty anderson and woessner 1992 and meyer and gee 1999 define a conceptual model as a pictorial qualitative description of the groundwater system in terms of its hydrogeological units system boundaries including time varying inputs and outputs and hydraulic as well as transport properties including their spatial variability the conceptual model is often seen as a hypothesis or a combination of hypotheses for the aspects of the groundwater system that are relevant to the model objective table a 1 provides a review of internationally peer reviewed publications that explicitly consider hydrogeological conceptual model uncertainty these 59 studies have been identified from the google scholar database where the search term groundwater model is combined with conceptual model uncertainty structural model uncertainty alternative conceptual models or multi model approach only studies that include alternative conceptual models developed for groundwater modelling for the purpose of either increasing system understanding or characterizing conceptual uncertainty have been included this list is considered to be representative of the treatment of conceptual model uncertainty through the multi model approach in groundwater research in the last two decades it is beyond the scope of this review to address the consensus conceptual model building approach for each study table a 1 provides a short summary of the alternative conceptualizations whether or not the objectives are explicitly defined and which aspects of the conceptualization are considered in this section we discuss what is included in model conceptualization how this needs to be linked to the objective of the modelling and the linguistic ambiguity in discussing conceptual model uncertainty 2 1 conceptual model aspects gupta et al 2012 outlines five formal stages in the model building process i conceptual physical structure ii conceptual process structure iii spatial variability structure iv equation structure and v computational structure the first two steps are part of the conceptual model the third and fourth are part of the mathematical model and the last step is the computational model this review will focus on the first two steps as well as the spatial variability structure fig 2 the latter is included in our discussion of aspects of conceptualization as some studies in table a 1 consider alternative models of the spatial variability structure as conceptual uncertainty the conceptual physical structure captures the hydrostratigraphy as well as the horizontal and vertical extent of the system respectively a watershed divide and an impermeable bottom boundary in fig 2 the conceptual physical structure further defines the hydrostratigraphic units and their extent the barriers and or conduits to groundwater flow faults and the compartmentalisation of the groundwater system into aquifers and aquitards the spatial variability structure is the description of the time invariant hydraulic properties of the system and their spatial variability magnifying glass in fig 2 the conceptual process structure contains the boundary conditions that are time variant such as heads and fluxes in and out of the system these can be externally controlled and largely independent from the groundwater system dynamics e g rainfall pumping rates drainage levels for mine dewatering lateral zero flow boundary or internally controlled and largely dependent on the groundwater system dynamics e g surface water groundwater interaction evapotranspiration 2 2 modelling objective despite being identified as the crucial first step in any modelling study anderson et al 2015a barnett et al 2012 brassington and younger 2010 only 33 out of 59 studies explicitly define the purpose or objective of the model in the introduction of their paper this is especially relevant as some conceptualization aspects such as detailed description of spatial variability of hydraulic properties might be important to one type of prediction e g travel time distribution but might be less relevant to another type of prediction e g hydraulic head distribution refsgaard et al 2012 zhou and herath 2016 alternative conceptualizations are for instance directly linked to model objectives when multiple conceptual models are developed to increase system understanding passadore et al 2011 or aid in water management strategy højberg and refsgaard 2005 many of the studies in which a model objective is not explicitly defined are focused on method development such as combining model averaging techniques rojas et al 2008 comparing ranking strategies foglia et al 2007 or model selection poeter and anderson 2005 2 3 linguistic uncertainty there is considerable linguistic ambiguity in describing the uncertainty of groundwater system conceptualization a prime example is the term structural uncertainty which can indicate uncertainty in geological structure as in refsgaard et al 2012 or can indicate the number and type of processes represented in the numerical model as exemplified in clark et al 2008 furthermore as argued in nearing et al 2016 any adequate model should encode all uncertainties to consider i e the known unknowns the name multi model approach is therefore somewhat misleading the multiple models in the multi model approach are samples of the overall plausible model choices that should characterize the conceptual uncertainty this is no different than sampling parameters over a feasible range to characterize the parameter uncertainty in this definition the multiple models in the multi model approach therefore only represent a single model characterizing known unknowns the linguistic uncertainty has led to a wide variation in what is considered to be conceptual model uncertainty table a 1 this varies from changing the hydraulic conductivity zonation extent and number carrera and neuman 1986 foglia et al 2007 lee et al 1992 meyer et al 2007 poeter and anderson 2005 to considering different process representations altman et al 1996 aphale and tonjes 2017 classifications of sources of uncertainty such as presented in walker et al 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 or vrugt 2016 often distinguish between model structure uncertainty incomplete understanding and simplified description of modelled processes parameter uncertainty parameter values and input uncertainty including scenario uncertainty external driving forces in groundwater model conceptualization the distinction between these classes is not well defined for example should changing the spatial variability structure of hydraulic conductivity such as in castro and goblet 2003 rogiers et al 2014 or linde et al 2015a be considered conceptual or parameter uncertainty suzuki et al 2008 provides a more pragmatic classification in which differentiation is made between first order uncertainties conceptual and lower order uncertainties lower order uncertainties are aleatory and can be modelled stochastically while conceptual uncertainties are epistemic and are characterized by alternative models common in both the consensus model approach and the multi model approach is that lower order uncertainties are modelled stochastically within each conceptualization for example hermans et al 2015 uses different training images to describe spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity with multiple point geostatistics this can be considered a first order uncertainty the lower order uncertainty is then the stochastic realisations of each training image likewise changing the boundary from a no flow to a head dependent boundary in mechal et al 2016 is first order uncertainty while changing the value of the head dependent boundary in aphale and tonjes 2017 is considered a characterization of lower order uncertainty 2 4 summary of what is considered conceptual model uncertainty groundwater system conceptualization is a collection of hypotheses describing the understanding of the different aspects of the groundwater system that are important to the modelling objective conceptual model uncertainty is the uncertainty due to the limited data and knowledge about a groundwater system it is the first order epistemic uncertainty that is generally considered reducible but cannot be characterized by continuously varying a variable linguistic ambiguity and vague definitions of what constitutes conceptual uncertainty however hinders transparent discussions of this major source of uncertainty we will therefore adopt the terminology of suzuki et al 2008 and focus on first order uncertainty 3 how are different conceptualizations developed not only is there a wide variety of conceptual model aspects there is also a wide variety of ways to generate different conceptualizations table a 1 generating different conceptualizations has not received much attention in the literature and guidance is likewise limited neuman and wierenga 2003 discuss different approaches in developing alternative conceptualization and suggest building alternative models until no other plausible explanations can be identified similar to this approach refsgaard et al 2012 introduced the concept of the mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive mece criterion to hydrogeology in order to be mutually exclusive conceptual models have to be completely disjoint and represent independent hypotheses in order to be collectively exhaustive the entire range of plausible conceptual models needs to be defined including the unknown unknown plausible models the unknown unknowns are the conceptual models that current data has not yet uncovered and will lead to conceptual surprises if they are it has been acknowledged by several authors that defining a collectively exhaustive range is impossible in practice e g ferré 2017 hunt and welter 2010 refsgaard et al 2012 while the concepts and advice in neuman and wierenga 2003 and refsgaard et al 2012 are sound and highly relevant few of the studies in table a 1 adhere to them from the studies of table a 1 three main strategies are identified in developing alternative conceptualizations i varying complexity ii alternative interpretations and iii hypothesis testing these strategies are illustrated in fig 3 in the varying complexity strategy alternative models are generated by gradually increasing or decreasing the complexity of the same base conceptualization in fig 3 this is illustrated by describing the hydraulic property variability in an aquifer system either as i homogeneous units ii zonation or iii a spatially continuous parameterization the adequate complexity is typically evaluated based on the modelling goal höge et al 2018 zeng et al 2015 the available data schöniger et al 2015 or the informative model complexity freedman et al 2017 the underlying base conceptualization is not questioned and it is often implicitly assumed that all conflict between observed and simulated data is due to the inability to capture the full complexity of the groundwater system in the numerical model the varying complexity strategy does not fit well in the mece paradigm as different levels of complexity in implementing the same conceptualization do not ensure mutually exclusive hypotheses the alternative interpretation strategy consists of generating an ensemble of conceptualizations by different interpretations fig 3 illustrates this as two different hydrostratigraphic interpretations of the same borehole data set independent by being interpreted by different teams who have no knowledge about the each other s interpretation e g harrar et al 2003 hills and wierenga 1994 compared to the varying complexity strategy the alternative interpretation strategy has the advantage that the ensemble can include very different base conceptualizations e g refsgaard et al 2006 however the conceptualizations may end up being very similar and it is difficult to ensure that independent interpretations are mutually exclusive in the hypothesis testing strategy as advocated by beven 2018 an ensemble of models is generated by stating different hypotheses about the system rather than multiple teams formulating their best interpretation of the same data in the alternative interpretation strategy the hypothesis testing strategy involves the same team aiming to maximise the difference between alternative conceptualizations while still adhering to the same dataset in fig 3 this is exemplified through the presence or absence of a palaeovalley in two alternative conceptualizations both alternatives are consistent with the borehole data but the interpretation with the palaeovalley present may be considered less likely the chances are slim that such a vastly different conceptualization would be part of an ensemble generated through the alternative interpretation strategy where only the most likely model is sought none of the three strategies guarantees that the ensemble of models developed is collectively exhaustive but it is more likely for hypothesis testing to generate an ensemble of mutually exclusive models the next sections review model building approaches and are structured around the three key components of the conceptual model illustrated in fig 2 conceptual physical structure section 3 1 spatial variability structure section 3 2 and conceptual process structure section 3 3 the focus is on different approaches to building multiple conceptual models within these three aspects and how the different strategies to multi model building have been applied fig 3 finally section 3 4 discusses assigning prior probabilities to alternative models 3 1 conceptual physical structure table a 1 lists several examples where the conceptual physical structure of conceptual models has been tested through the alternative interpretation and the hypothesis testing strategy using an alternative interpretation strategy approach five alternative hydrostratigraphic models were generated by five different hydro geologists in the study by seifert et al 2012 resulting in different number of layers proportions of sand and clay in the quaternary sequence and the location of a limestone surface using the hypothesis testing strategy troldborg et al 2007 developed three different models by assuming different depositional histories and thereby different number of layers in the models while it is possible to test a global geometrical hypothesis about the conceptual physical structure e g troldborg et al 2007 it is more common to test specific geometrical features through local hypotheses a local hypothesis can for instance test the presence of a palaeovalley seifert et al 2008 the connection between two aquifers la vigna et al 2014 or the extent of an aquifer aphale and tonjes 2017 if one of the hypotheses is falsified in these studies the system understanding will improve in regards to that specific feature 3 2 spatial variability structure spatial variability structure is the component of the conceptual model that is most often included in a multi model approach because hydraulic and transport properties are often scale dependent and the adequate level of complexity depends on the modelling purpose the description of properties is often tested by developing models with the varying complexity strategy the strategy is applied either through dividing the study area into different zones of homogeneous hydraulic conductivities so alternative representations can be generated by combining the different zones e g foglia et al 2007 or by representing the geology in different conceptual models as homogenous layered zoned or as heterogeneous e g schöniger et al 2015 in the intraval las cruces trench experiment five different modelling teams developed unsaturated zone flow and transport models using the alternative interpretation strategy hills and wierenga 1994 despite differences between the models such as isotropic anisotropic and spatially uniform heterogeneous soil properties none of the models was clearly superior considering several performance criteria geostatistical variogram based approaches facilitate the stochastic generation of many pixel based k realizations based on the same data and assumptions to characterize the lower order uncertainty hypothesis testing strategy has been applied assuming different variogram models to represent the k variation within the system samper and neuman 1989 ye et al 2004 rather than defining different facies variogram pham and tsai 2015 2016 used three different variogram based geostatistical approaches indicator kriging indicator zonation and general parameterization elshall et al 2013 to describe the variation between clay and sand units as smooth or sharp in the multipoint geostatistics approach mps strebelle 2002 different conceptualizations can be represented by adopting different training images using the hypothesis testing strategy studies that have applied the mps approach using more than one training image in groundwater modelling are still rare but include studies by he et al 2014 hermans et al 2015 and linde et al 2015a groundwater flow through fractured rock aquifers complicates the conceptualization as the groundwater flow occurs through both matrix and fractures selroos et al 2002 considered e g stochastic continuum models and discrete fracture networks as alternative conceptualizations of fractured rock in sweden the models were shown to have different results in terms of solute transport behaviour 3 3 conceptual process structure the conceptual process structure is the component in the conceptual model that is considered least in the multi model approaches in the analysed studies table a 1 according to gupta et al 2012 this lack of attention in literature is mainly due to the process description typically being assumed to be complete however as illustrated by examples in bredehoeft 2005 conceptual surprises might also occur for the conceptual process structure as well as for the other components of the conceptual model among the many boundary conditions imposed on a groundwater model groundwater recharge is by far the one that has received most attention in the literature a number of methods exist for calculating groundwater recharge that take into account different sources of information doble and crosbie 2017 scanlon et al 2002 which can lead to different estimates of recharge when used in an alternative interpretation strategy approach ye et al 2010 used the maxey eakin method the chloride mass balance method and the net infiltration method to derive different estimates of recharge to assess the conceptual uncertainty each of the different interpretation methods resulted in a different spatial distribution of recharge different levels of model complexity have often been used across different spatial scales such as for groundwater recharge estimation doble and crosbie 2017 models range from simplified heuristic models at a global scale döll and fiedler 2008 simple 1 d bucket models for regional scale areas flint et al 2000 to more complex numerical solutions of richards equation at the field scale leterme et al 2012 neto et al 2016 nettasana 2012 tested the complexity of zonation of recharge by defining recharge based only on soil type in one model and in another model both on soil type and land use the hypothesis testing approach for recharge estimation mainly focuses on a specific feature kikuchi et al 2015 rojas et al 2010a aphale and tonjes 2017 investigate the effect of a landfill on local recharge with three different hypotheses hypothesis testing for lateral boundary conditions has been applied to lateral exchange fluxes with adjacent aquifers lukjan et al 2016 mechal et al 2016 nettasana 2012 kikuchi et al 2015 test the existence of underflow through a subsurface zone into an adjacent basin 3 4 assigning a prior probability a crucial aspect in any bayesian modelling approach is assigning the prior probabilities this prior is based on an initial understanding of the probability of a model related to the alternative models and is updated when additional data is introduced in the model testing step section 4 the assigned prior for the reviewed studies are presented in the first column of table a 2 in order to be objective and unbiased different conceptual models are often considered to be equally likely uninformed by data or knowledge from the 26 studies in table a 2 that assign a prior probability 21 use a uniform and thus uninformed prior probability prior probabilities do however have a large influence on the posterior probability if the data used for updating the prior has limited information content rojas et al 2009 showed that including proper prior knowledge about the conceptualizations increased predictive performance when compared to assigning uninformed priors additionally uninformed priors are not consistent with the hypothesis testing approach as shown in fig 3c if no other palaeovalleys were observed in the area the palaeovalley hypothesis would be possible but unlikely a uniform prior probability would assign each hypothesis equal likelihood which would not be appropriate in the reviewed studies the prior has been based on expert opinion data consistency and model complexity for instance using expert opinion in the study by ye et al 2008 the prior probability was based on expert s belief in alternative recharge models considering the consistency with available data and knowledge systematic expert elicitation is a well established technique in environmental risk assessment and modelling krueger et al 2012 to formalize expert belief into model priors there are however few published studies on expert elicitation in groundwater conceptualization context elshall and tsai 2014 used data consistency to inform the prior probability by basing it on calibration of hydrofacies using lithological data finally using model complexity to inform the prior in the study by ye et al 2005 higher probabilities were assigned to favour models with fewer parameters this was also suggested by rojas et al 2010a as a means of penalizing increased complexity nearing et al 2016 argues that assignment of probabilities should not be based on a single component of the model but rather be based on the whole model in the reviewed literature the priors have however only been based on individual components 3 5 remaining challenges the review of studies in table a 1 has shown that alternative models have been developed either by i varying complexity of model description ii making alternative interpretations or iii stating different hypotheses about the groundwater system the goal of the multi model development process is to define a mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive range of models in which the true unknown model exists and where the risk of uncovering a conceptual surprise is zero this is obviously unattainable and we therefore discuss the remaining challenges next first table a 1 shows that studies typically focus on exploring different hypotheses for a single aspect of the model conceptual physical conceptual process spatial variability structure only 5 out of 59 papers consider all three aspects simultaneously aphale and tonjes 2017 foglia et al 2013 mechal et al 2016 rojas et al 2010a ye et al 2010 for the range of models to be collectively exhaustive all conceptually uncertain aspects have to be considered second the study objective is not always considered when alternative models are developed for the multi model approach table a 1 models should encapsulate the behaviour that is important to the modelling objective jakeman et al 2006 and the same should be true when characterizing conceptual uncertainty on the other hand what may seem like inconsequential choices in model construction may be important to predictions foglia et al 2013 to avoid ignoring the inconsequential model choices the model objective should be used to guide the development of alternative models this does imply that ensembles are not necessarily the same for all model objectives haitjema 2005 third alternative conceptual models are not always defined as mutually exclusive i e if model a is true models b and c are false falsification which is welcomed in the multi model approach beven 2018 will increase system understanding beven and young 2013 but how much will depend on how the conceptual models are defined in the alternative interpretation and varying complexity strategy the models are not necessarily mutually exclusive in the sense that they do not represent different ideas about the groundwater system in the varying complexity approach alternative models are generated based on the same conceptual model represented in different complexities a risk in the alternative interpretation strategy is that alternative models are almost identical in terms of understanding of the groundwater system fourth the way the alternative models are developed does not always reduce the risk of conceptual surprises using the alternative interpretation strategy many groups will come up with what they believe to be the most likely model e g seifert et al 2012 using the varying complexity strategy only the complexity and not conceptual ideas will be tested it is therefore unlikely that a conceptual surprise will be found before one is surprised in both alternative interpretation and varying complexity strategy last when assigning priors to a range of models that we cannot ensure are collectively exhaustive how do we account for unknown unknowns the sum of prior probabilities for the ensemble of models always add up to one in the reviewed studies thereby assuming a collectively exhaustive range of models have been defined as discussed already this is extremely difficult to ensure so an approach to assign priors that accounts for unknown unknowns remains a challenge the hypothesis testing strategy seems to be the only model development strategy that can ensure the models developed are mutually exclusive however hypotheses might still overlap for example bresciani et al 2018 test three hypotheses to explain mountain range recharge to a basin aquifer governed either by i mountain front recharge ii mountain block recharge or iii both mountain front recharge and mountain block recharge some might argue that the third hypothesis overlaps to some extent with the other two violating the mutually exclusive principle however only including the two first hypotheses claiming they are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive would set up a false dilemma as parts of both hypotheses can be correct at the same time it is thereby not always possible to state mutually exclusive hypotheses in hydrogeology where the answer will be boolean true or false for instance connectivity or no connectivity between aquifers troldborg et al 2010 sometimes the mutually exclusive hypotheses will have to be stated as endmembers e g mountain front recharge and mountain block recharge and the answer will be somewhere in between guillaume et al 2016 discuss two methods to accommodate the conceptual surprises in the model development process adopting adaptive management and applying models that explore the unknown in the first approach management plans are kept open towards change and the iterative modelling process illustrated in fig 1 is a part of the modelling plan the second method anticipates surprises by placing fewer restrictions on what is considered possible by stating bold hypotheses about a system ensures that system understanding can progress caers 2018 a bold hypothesis around recharge inflows from faults and deep fissures connected to an adjacent aquifer is tested by rojas et al 2010a the available data did not give reason to reject either of the models to achieve an increase in system understanding but the alternatives were bold we argue that by being forced to be bold when developing hypotheses the risk of rejecting plausible models by omission and adopting an invalid range of models is greatly reduced however defining bold hypotheses does not preclude rejecting plausible models by omission hunt and welter 2010 suggest to use terminology that recognize the existence of these unknown unknowns by presenting results with a specification of which aspects of the model that has been considered thereby enhancing transparency an approach that aims at directly identifying unknown unknowns through bold hypotheses taking into account the largest possible range of the conceptual uncertainty have not been applied yet and remain a subject for further research 4 how are different conceptualizations tested after developing a set of conceptual models the models should be tested to establish to what degree they are consistent with the available data and knowledge neuman and wierenga 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 groundwater models used for safety assessment of nuclear waste repositories for instance have been subject of considerable validation efforts hassan 2003 rogiers et al 2014 tsang 1987 1991 model testing and validation covers the same model evaluation process in which models are confronted with new data however the term validation is avoided in this review as models can never be proven correct konikow and bredehoeft 1992 also there is no internationally agreed definition of validation which has led several organizations to develop their own operational definitions of validation perko et al 2009 finally validation encourages testing to have a positive result oreskes et al 1994 that is models are not expected to be wrong as falsification is important in order to advance our understanding of a system beven 2018 the term model testing is preferred here models are rejected if they are found to be inconsistent with data in a bayesian context however a conceptual model can never be completely rejected its probability can only be greatly reduced as there is a risk of eliminating models that could turn out to be good representations when new data is introduced guillaume et al 2016 suggest to keep rejection decisions temporary to be able to return to otherwise excluded models the models that are consistent with observational data are however only conditionally validated because they have not been proven to be inconsistent with data yet beven and young 2013 oreskes et al 1994 testing of conceptual models is not always done as part of the multi model approach to groundwater modelling pfister and kirchner 2017 in table a 2 only 30 out of 59 studies applied some form of model testing however model testing presents three major advantages first systematically developing and testing conceptual models will allow one to explain why no other conceptual models are plausible neuman and wierenga 2003 and thereby reducing the risk of adopting an invalid range of models through systematic documentation and rejection of conceptual models the modelling workflow becomes transparent and traceable potentially avoiding court cases challenging the validity of conceptual models in the impact assessment of the carmichael coalmine in queensland australia available geological and hydrological data allowed for at least one other conceptualization of ecological and culturally significant springs that could potentially be impacted by the coalmine currell et al 2017 however a conceptual model leading to an acceptably low modelled impact on the springs was adopted which lead to the approval of the mine a systematic model development and testing approach for conceptual modelling through the multi model approach would be able to shed light on this type of confirmation bias second model testing can lead to uncovering of unknown unknowns bredehoeft 2005 not many papers exist that actually reject all of the initial conceptual models or hypotheses about a groundwater system and come up with new plausible explanations which renders this advantage of the model testing procedure somewhat invisible beven 2018 there are however a few examples where models are conditionally validated after ad hoc modifications to the model e g krabbenhoft and anderson 1986 nishikawa 1997 woolfenden 2008 ad hoc modifications are slight changes applied to a current model in order to explain conflicting data but without falsifying the model as a whole for example sanford buapeng 1996 developed a steady state groundwater flow model for the bangkok area which was falsified by apparent groundwater ages an ad hoc modification that assumed groundwater velocities were higher during the last glacial maximum yielded a simulated apparent age closer to the observations thereby conditionally validating the model with the ad hoc modification ad hoc hypotheses are sometimes criticized as they make models unfalsifiable and knowledge does not progress through modifications caers 2018 however their existence illustrate the difficulty of developing a collectively exhaustive range of models initially and model testing is imperative if we want to uncover this third bayesian multi model approaches benefit from allowing their prior probabilities to be updated because it dilutes the effect of the choice of priors rojas et al 2009 it is here worth mentioning that most of the studies in table a 2 that apply a bayesian approach update the prior probability using criteria based weights section 5 1 while only eight studies apply a model testing procedure in the subsequent sections data relevant to conceptual model testing section 4 1 steps undertaken when testing conceptual models section 4 2 and the remaining challenges within model testing 4 3 are discussed table a 2 presents an overview of the model testing applied in the studies identified using the multi model approach section 2 4 1 conceptual model testing data three basic requirements for the nature of the data used for model testing are typically discussed i it should be different from the data used for developing the conceptual models tarantola 2006 ii it should be different from the data used for calibrating the model neuman and wierenga 2003 refsgaard et al 2006 and iii it should depend on the modelling purpose beven 2018 4 1 1 model testing data and model building data tarantola 2006 distinguishes between a priori information used to develop hypotheses and observations used to test models post hoc theorizing failing to separate model development and testing data and accepting the resulting model might lead to models being conditionally validated due to circular reasoning e g the model should look this way to explain the data and the model is true because it explains the data another reason for keeping those two groups of data separate is to avoid underestimating conceptual uncertainty by using geophysical skytem data to both build a training image conceptual model and as soft constraint as part of a multiple point geostatistics algorithm he et al 2014 demonstrated that this over conditioning lead to an underestimation of uncertainty 4 1 2 model testing data and model calibration data testing data should also be different from calibration data to avoid that the conditional confirmation becomes an extension of the calibration neuman and wierenga 2003 in a review of handling geological uncertainty refsgaard et al 2012 highlighted that it is possible to compensate for conceptual errors in groundwater flow models by calibrating parameters to fit the solution the best test for any conceptualization involves comparison of model predictions to observations outside the calibration base cross validation techniques standard practice in statistical inference are underutilised in groundwater modelling methodologies that minimize error variance provide some safeguard against calibration induced acceptance of improper conceptualizations kohavi 1995 moore and doherty 2005 tonkin et al 2007 4 1 3 model testing data and the modelling objective refsgaard et al 2012 further concluded that models that perform well according to one dataset might not perform well according to another dataset this suggests that updating of prior probability should preferably be based upon the data type that the models are to make predictions about davis et al 1991 argues that testing model performance outside areas relevant to the model objective can lead to rejection of models that might actually be fit for purpose however in many instances the data type that the models are used to make predictions about such as groundwater fluxes or water balances may not be directly available jakeman et al 2006 on the other hand rojas et al 2010b showed that by introducing more and more data in a multi model approach they were able to further and further discriminate between retained conceptual models suggesting the more diverse and numerous data that are used for testing the more confidence in the conceptualization 4 2 conceptual model testing steps in the previous discussion the type and nature of auxiliary data to test conceptual models were introduced but how should such data be incorporated to undertake a conceptual model testing exercise neuman and wierenga 2003 introduced a three step workflow for testing and updating prior probability of alternative conceptual models table 1 in addition to these three steps a fourth step the post audit anderson and woessner 1992 will be reviewed here 4 2 1 model testing step 1 the first step in the neuman and wierenga 2003 guideline is referred to as avoid conflict with data where the model evaluation happens before the conceptual models are converted into mathematical models in doing so the conceptual models can be compared quantitatively or qualitatively with data without parameters compensating for a wrong conceptualization table a 2 suggests this model testing step is rarely applied which is not necessarily true as the evaluation of conceptual models happens outside of a numerical groundwater model it is probably preceding the workflow in many of the studies as part of the hydrogeological investigation but not explicitly reported on in the review by linde et al 2015b a workflow of corroboration and rejection is presented that focuses on the integration of geophysical data in hydrogeological modelling for example synthetic geophysical data may be generated from different conceptual models and subsequently compared with observed geophysical data hermans et al 2015 the prior probability of each conceptual model is then updated based on the difference between observed and simulated geophysical data in this model testing step however the model evaluation does not have to be qualitative for example hydraulic head and electrical conductivity data may be used to distinguish between hypotheses about whether mountain front and mountain block recharge was dominating as a recharge mechanism to basin aquifers bresciani et al 2018 4 2 2 model testing step 2 the second step in which data is introduced to test alternative conceptual models is called preliminary mathematical model testing meyer et al 2007 neuman and wierenga 2003 nishikawa 1997 a similar modelling step is suggested by la vigna et al 2014 where for each alternative conceptual model a simple numerical model is set up and compared with testing data hydraulic head the advantage of applying this model testing step is that spending time on setting up complex mathematical models for poor conceptual models is avoided 4 2 3 model testing step 3 the third model testing step in neuman and wierenga 2003 is called confirm model here the mathematical model is set up in its most complex form as a numerical model comprises a description of the groundwater system as a whole all assumptions and the interaction of assumptions are tested at once models are then rejected either due to 1 unrealistic parameter values 2 wrongly predicted state variables or 3 non convergence sun and yeh 1985 showed that the optimized parameters cannot be separated from the parameter structure on which they are based on this means if the conceptual model is incorrect so are the estimated parameter values therefore calibrated hydraulic conductivity values are often compared with independently measured values from pumping tests e g engelhardt et al 2014 harrar et al 2003 mechal et al 2016 poeter and anderson 2005 to check whether parameter estimates are realistic unfortunately scale effects may impede direct comparison depending on the quality and representativeness of the data they may or may not be able to discriminate between alternative models as was demonstrated by engelhardt et al 2014 and mechal et al 2016 for calibrated hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values respectively on the other hand in the synthetic study by poeter and anderson 2005 13 out of 61 models were rejected because the calibrated hydraulic conductivity of a low conductivity zone exceeded the conductivity of what was considered a high conductivity zone apart from comparing calibrated parameter values with observations the predicted system variables can be compared with observations such as hydraulic head stream discharge tracer concentrations etc in some multi model studies the number of models are limited and the comparison of simulated and observed values can happen manually for instance castro and goblet 2003 could reject all but one conceptual model by manual comparison of the direct simulation of 4he concentrations with observed data however in cases where the lower order uncertainty is characterized within each conceptualization automatic procedures are necessary to efficiently search for models that match field data rogiers et al 2014 rojas et al 2010b c a schöniger et al 2015 zeng et al 2015 for instance rojas et al 2008 used the importance sampling technique generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 to sample combinations of parameter sets and conceptual models and reject models according to an acceptance threshold for the misfit between simulated and observed model predictions finally non convergence of the groundwater model can indicate an error in the conceptual model anderson et al 2015b the interaction of assumptions that lead to groundwater models not converging has in many studies been regarded as sufficient evidence of conceptual model invalidity aphale and tonjes 2017 poeter and anderson 2005 in rojas et al 2008 the models that did not meet the convergence acceptance criteria were assigned a likelihood of zero eliminating their contribution to the model ensemble predictive distribution however conceptual models that do not converge may potentially be valid if no effort towards making them converge is made the effort towards making a model converge in the consensus approach will probably be larger than in the multi model approach as there will still be other models left in the latter approach 4 2 4 model testing step 4 the last model testing step considered in this review is the post audit the post audit is performed years after the end of the modelling process evaluating forecasts of the model on newly collected data anderson and woessner 1992 summarize some modelling studies that have used post audits while bredehoeft 2005 focussed on identifying the conceptual surprises that occurred in these modelling studies as a result of a post audit the advantage of the post audit is that the model testing data is by default independent from the model development data satisfying one of the basic requirements of model testing data section 4 1 however it is inconvenient to rely on this type of model testing as there may potentially be a long waiting period from the end of the model process until new data is collected 4 3 remaining challenges this review has shown that models can be tested in at least four different steps in the modelling process i as a conceptual model ii as a simple numerical model iii as a complex numerical model and iv as a complex numerical model years after development in each step the prior probability can be updated and sometimes models can be rejected based on lack of support by observation of state variables parameters or because the model did not converge identifying suitable data for model testing remains challenging first in theory the notion that testing data should be independent is sound but in practice the separation of data is difficult many studies rely on ranking criteria to update the prior probability which we will discuss in section 5 1 rather than updating prior probability based on data that is independent of the model development in using all data when developing models it is no surprise that the models actually fit data post hoc theorizing can easily result in undersampling of the model space kerr 1998 as an initial range of plausible models will be accepted because of circular reasoning without looking for other plausible models however in many studies independent data might not be available and saving some data for the model testing process is a trade off between being able to define a more complete model and being able to test assumptions cross validation can partly address this issue during inference or calibration but will remain impractical in the conceptualization phase model testing step 1 as biases towards existing but unavailable data might be made second in theory the data used for model testing should depend on the model objective in order to not extrapolate when making predictions a challenge arises when having to ensure that the model found fit for purpose for one dataset e g hydraulic head will also be fit for purpose to predict another dataset e g concentrations for example the alternative models developed by castro and goblet 2003 all performed well when calibrated with hydraulic head however all but one model was rejected when tracer data was introduced sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can potentially be used to identify which parameters are relevant to the predictions and to what extent they can be constrained by the available data third the information content in the model testing data is in many studies relatively limited e g rojas et al 2010c the information content of model testing data relates to the amount and type of data available but also the uncertainty of the data for example as discussed in relation to comparing calibrated hydraulic conductivity values to observed hydraulic conductivity values in section 4 2 such comparison can be unreliable the consequence of only limited information content in the model testing data is that discrimination among alternative models often cannot be made seifert et al 2008 in addition in a bayesian context the consequence of limited information content in the testing data is that the prior probability will have a large influence on the posterior probability e g rojas et al 2009 another challenge relates to when a model can be considered falsified models are groups of hypotheses rather than a single hypothesis in itself and many other assumptions are made in groundwater models such as model code and the characterization of lower order uncertainty the model prediction thereby depends on many interactions of independent hypotheses and assumptions inconsistencies between model and data should therefore not necessarily be attributed to a single hypothesis and result in the falsification of that hypothesis pfister and kirchner 2017 to accommodate these challenges a more systematic approach to model development and testing is needed where parts of the available data are used only for model testing ideally the data selected for model testing should depend on the model objective and the information content should be large enough to discriminate between models there is thereby an opportunity for systematic quantitative or qualitative assessment prior to study i which aspects of the model will be relevant to the objectives and ii what data are needed to distinguish between hypotheses 5 how are different conceptualizations used for predictions what has emerged from several of the studies so far in this review is that multiple plausible models may coexist for a given study area so how are predictions made with multiple models for some studies e g foglia et al 2013 one model the most likely based on the highest support in data is selected for predictive purposes section 4 1 while other studies e g tsai and li 2008 focus on ensemble predictions based on all plausible models section 4 2 a modelling step that receives increasing attention in the literature is the identification of additional data needs in order to be able to discriminate between the alternative conceptual models e g kikuchi et al 2015 section 4 3 the last four columns in table a 2 present an overview of approaches being adopted when making predictions with multiple models as mentioned in the introduction several literature reviews diks and vrugt 2010 schöniger et al 2014 singh et al 2010 have already focussed on the model prediction and evaluation aspect of the multi model approach it is therefore not the aim to give a comprehensive review here but to give a general overview of the most often applied approaches and instead focus on how the model development approach discussed in section 3 affects the predictions 5 1 model weighing and selection techniques model weighing and selection techniques rank models according to how well they fit data where the models with the lowest rank or weight have least support in the data the purpose of ranking is to select the best model but for many of the studies in table a 2 ranking also provides weights for a model averaging technique section 5 2 for an excellent review of model selection techniques the reader is referred to schöniger et al 2014 in selecting between models two principles often receive attention the principle of parsimony favouring the simplest model and the principle of maximum likelihood favouring the model that gives the highest chance to facts we have observed however the principle of consistency favouring models that do not contradict any effects we know is even more important to consider when choosing between models martinez and gupta 2011 the most commonly applied ranking techniques in the analysed studies in table a 2 are the information criteria including akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1973 corrected aic aicc sugiura 1978 hurvich and tsai 1989 bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and kashyap information criterion kic neuman 2003 and glue the ranking from the information criteria depends on an error term representing model fit to observations and a penalty term that penalizes model complexity in glue the ranking is only based on an error term 5 2 model averaging techniques model averaging techniques seek to summarize the results from the multiple model approach into an optimal prediction and a single measure of the total uncertainty by averaging the posterior distributions raftery et al 2005 this posterior is obtained through an averaging approach that weighs the different model predictions according to the weight they obtained from the testing or ranking combined with a prior probability of the individual models for excellent summaries of model averaging techniques the reader is referred to diks and vrugt 2010 and singh et al 2010 the most commonly applied approach to averaging predictions of conceptually different hydrogeological models is bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 the averaged predictions from multiple models have been shown to be more robust and less biased than the prediction from a single model vrugt and robinson 2007 furthermore they produce a more realistic and reliable description of the predictive uncertainty rojas et al 2010a the bayesian model evidence is sometimes approximated with the information criteria to reduce computational effort constituting the maximum likelihood bma mlbma approach suggested by neuman 2003 given many of the information criteria are developed as model selection criteria they tend to assign a large weight to only a few models e g nettasana 2012 rojas et al 2010c ye et al 2010 which is the main drawback of the mlbma approach this leads to the introduction of a statistical scaling factor to the information criteria tsai and li 2008 leading to a flatter weight distribution among the alternative models one of the disadvantages of the averaging procedures is that the system details of how each conceptual model affects the prediction is lost gupta et al 2012 to solve this problem tsai and elshall 2013 suggested the hierarchal bma h bma approach where the individual conceptual model components are evaluated through a bma tree in the bma tree model components are organized at separate levels and the contribution of uncertainty of each aspect to the total uncertainty is quantified by separating the uncertain model components in a bma tree the different aspects can be prioritized and provide an understanding of the uncertainty propagation through each uncertain aspect in the conceptual model 5 3 identify additional data needs refining the prediction made by multiple models may sometimes be necessary in order to decrease the range of model predictions considering too many conceptual models one may lose the purpose of model development because it indicates high model prediction uncertainty bredehoeft 2005 højberg and refsgaard 2005 therefore some studies have focussed on identifying additional data needs that could potentially discriminate between alternative conceptual models to reduce conceptual uncertainty e g kikuchi et al 2015 pham and tsai 2015 2016 the goal of collecting new data is not to confirm existing conceptual models but to be able to discriminate between them kikuchi et al 2015 offers a short review of optimal design studies in hydrogeology that attempt to identify the optimal measurement sets for monitoring networks to maximize a data utility function for a few studies conceptual model discrimination is the design objective knopman et al 1991 knopman and voss 1988 1989 usunoff et al 1992 yakirevich et al 2013 but this approach has yet not received much attention in hydrogeology according to kikuchi et al 2015 identifying additional data needs will guide the post audit activity section 4 2 and the use of these data for model testing will ensure the data is independent from the model development data 5 4 remaining challenges this review shows that current studies often either used criteria based weights either to identify the most plausible models or to provide weights for a model averaging technique the current methods are generally limited by what is attainable through the model development approach the main limitations and thereby consequences of the model development approach for current methods on making predictions with multiple conceptualizations are discussed next first we can never make sure that we have developed a collectively exhaustive range of conceptual models e g ferré 2017 hunt and welter 2010 nearing and gupta 2018 as discussed in section 3 but the prediction methods and the approaches in identifying additional data types rely on this undersampling the model space will lead to underestimation of the prediction uncertainty in the model averaging approaches furthermore by focussing the collection of additional data on data that can discriminate between currently known conceptualizations it is assumed that we already know all plausible conceptualizations a challenge remains in directing additional data collection towards uncovering unknown unknown plausible conceptual models second we can never make sure that the adopted range of models developed is valid type ii error e g nearing and gupta 2018 nevertheless both the bma and the criteria based model weighing techniques rely on the best approximation of reality being in the ensemble in the model selection approaches we can therefore never make sure that the best approximation of reality is selected as it will always be conditional on the developed range of models in the model averaging approaches adopting an invalid range of models leads to biased predictions which remains a challenge third in bma it is assumed that models are mutually exclusive so that none of the predictions are given a higher weight following almost identical models give similar predictions not having mutually exclusive models gives a false sense of confidence in the modelling results as a large number of alternative models considered will give the impression that a large range of the model space has been uncovered fourth the criteria based model weighing techniques rely only on the principle of parsimony and the principle of maximum likelihood while the principle of consistency is disregarded through calibration through the calibration step the model is trained to compensate for a possible conceptual error through biased parameters refsgaard et al 2012 white et al 2014 and the principle of consistency is therefore not taken into account criteria based model weighing techniques use the same data twice in the modelling process which as discussed in section 4 1 leads to circular reasoning giving a false confidence in the result also inconsistent assumptions in the conceptual model cannot be identified without introducing new data but in the criteria based model weighing techniques models are readily rejected through zero weight as they tend to inflate the weights of a few best models e g ye et al 2010 the models that best compensate for conceptual errors through biased parameters are then combined to make predictions through model averaging where it is claimed that conceptual model uncertainty is taken into account however given the biased parameters of the models circular reasoning and rejection of plausible models this result may be both biased and over conservative last the model averaging techniques assume that a single result is valid however if the range of plausible model are mutually exclusive they might lead to distinctly different predictions one model might have a distinctly different prediction than the ensemble average or the probability mass may concentrate in multiple areas this is the case for the synthetic example in the study by kikuchi et al 2015 where the spring flow depletion prediction is bimodal in this case the average prediction is an outlier to where the probability mass is concentrated the average prediction of an ensemble especially bi or multi modally distributed ensembles may not be a valid model outcome winter and nychka 2010 it is therefore preferable to summarise ensembles through more robust metrics such as percentiles e g 5th 50th and 95th as these will always be actual results made by a model suggestions on solving the remaining challenges in relation to populating the model space first second third point has already been discussed in section 3 5 the challenges mentioned in the remaining two points occur because of the reliance on methods that assume a single best model can be found a way forward to accommodate these challenges could be full probabilistic approaches transdimensional inference methods have been applied in geophysics e g ray and key 2012 and reservoir geology e g sambridge et al 2006 for similar problems in these approaches e g reversible jump markov chain monte carlo green 1995 sampling occurs within the same dimension conceptual model but also between dimensions conceptual models exploring both the conceptual model space and the parameter space 6 conclusion a review of 59 studies applying the multi model approach for hydrogeological conceptual model development has shown the following 1 a significant linguistic uncertainty still exists of what is considered conceptual uncertainty there is a need for more consistent terminology 2 current studies in conceptual model uncertainty often only focus on a single or limited set of conceptualization issues there is a need for a systematic conceptualization approach to ensure all aspects of conceptualization are covered and documented 3 current studies rarely consider the objective of the model before developing alternative models for the multi model approach the objective of the model should have an influence on both the model development and the data used for model testing 4 for each conceptual issue identified alternative conceptual models should be formulated as hypotheses which at least in theory can be refuted hypothesis testing especially bold hypothesis testing is essential to increase system understanding and avoiding conceptual surprises 5 in bayesian inference with multiple models informed priors are recommend especially if the information content in the hypothesis testing data is low 6 the current multi model prediction methods assume that there is a single outcome of the modelling process and that the developed models are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive presenting results requires a shift in mentality towards presenting ranges and acknowledging that unknown unknowns exist the multi model approach is superior to the consensus approach as it is transparent and accounts for conceptual uncertainty however to benefit fully from the multi model approach challenges remain in being more systematic in regards to both developing and testing alternative models declaration of interests none acknowledgement the authors would like to thank russell

6762,until now limited attention has been afforded to the role of and challenges faced by women involved in water diplomacy in addition to research being at an early stage it is mainly focused on addressing the challenges imposed by gender inequality thus very few applicable policy recommendations have emerged in this field to date this paper will explore and identify current challenges that face the women interested in attaining high level positions in water diplomacy in three arab countries in which hydropolitics prevails including jordan lebanon and the state of palestine female experts working on water related issues were surveyed and interviewed to ascertain key qualitative issues perceptions and various challenges the focus of the paper was to identify the additional skills to be developed and acquired for these women to better qualify as water diplomats both nationally and globally in addition the paper explores how to better equip women as leaders in the attainment of the sustainable development goals especially goal 5 on gender equality and goal 6 on clean water and sanitation in their national water sectors the results provide a basic and initial mapping of current challenges and makes recommendations that would assist in the empowerment of those women in water diplomacy decision making positions in the regions investigated specifically as well as globally keywords women empowerment water diplomacy decision makers sdgs lebanon palestine jordan challenges peace security 1 introduction 1 1 rationale for women water diplomacy water and peace security linking of concepts globally and nationally the united nations and its member states as well as an array of actors recognize the role of preventive diplomacy in mitigating and or limiting the escalation of disputes between the parties un 2011 p2 the tendency in modern diplomacy is to take preventive measures and use different vehicles of peace including that of natural resources to foster cooperation and eliminate potential contributors to conflict diplomacy itself has evolved and it is now multidimensional and multi lateral petrovsky 1998 diplo pamment 2017 among the new trends in diplomacy is the emergence of more specialized forms that require diplomats to gain expertise in specialized fields including water energy and agriculture due to increasing global governance and international cooperation ton 2015 in 2017 the security council held a briefing on preventive diplomacy and transboundary waters emphasizing the role of water diplomacy and cooperation in conflict prevention mr guterres emphasized that water security and peace are inextricably linked unsg 2017 water diplomacy one of many forms of preventive diplomacy includes all measures by state and non state actors that can be undertaken to prevent or peacefully resolve emerging conflicts and facilitate cooperation related to water availability allocation or use between and within states and public and private stakeholders however theoretical foundations to cooperation over shared resources and best approaches to implement water diplomacy in practice are still weakly developed concepts and approaches such as multi level water adaptive water governance a mutual gains approach and instruments for benefit sharing need to be further developed and made operational huntijens et al 2016 in relation and in july 2013 the foreign affairs council of the european union eu adopted conclusions on eu water diplomacy to proactively engage in transboundary water security challenges and recognized the importance of the 1992 united national economic commission for europe water convention unece and the 1997 united nations convention on the non navigational uses of international water courses unwc council of european union 2013 more recently november 2018 the council recognized the direct impacts of water scarcity on eu peace and national security most notably through migration flows council of european union 2018 the statistics to date are alarming on future water shortages including predictions that by 2050 at least one in four people will be living in a country that is affected by chronic or recurrent freshwater shortages wwdr 2016 on a more positive note the benefits of transboundary water cooperation and its potential role as a bridge to peace is widely documented and researched jägerskog 2007 phillips et al 2006 wolf 2009 earle et al 2010 zeitoun et al 2017 in recognition of the role of water in peacebuilding in 2015 fifteen 15 co convening countries launched the global high level panel on water and peace in geneva the latter produced the report a matter of survival with concrete implementable recommendations to transform water from a source of potential crisis to an instrument of cooperation and peace gwh 2017 similarly in spring 2016 the united nations secretary general and president of the world bank group convened a high level panel on water hlpw consisting of 11 sitting heads of state and government and one special adviser to provide the leadership required to champion a comprehensive inclusive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources and improving water and sanitation related services hlpw 2018a b 1 2 current status of women involvement in water diplomacy and decision making the linkages between women peace and security have been increasingly recognized within the past two decades on the 31st october 2000 the united nations security council adopted resolution 1325 on women peace and security acknowledging the essential role women play in peacebuilding conflict management and sustaining security s res 1325 it was the first international policy mechanism explicitly recognizing the gendered nature of war and peace processes according to ambassador anwarul k chowdhury who was president of the un security council in 2000 and shared his disappointment about the record of implementation of unsc resolution 1325 after one decade chowdhury 2010 although 7 other resolutions were adopted in what came to be known as the women peace and security wps agenda fig 1 yet the progress made to date is still slow unwomen 2012 with the intention of bringing water diplomacy peace and women together and during the 60th session of the un commission on the status of women in march 2016 the permanent mission of the netherlands to the un in new york and the women for water partnership and partners hosted a side event on women s role in water diplomacy as key for empowerment the latter focused on the acknowledgment of women as leaders experts partners on equal footing and agents of change in the water sustainable development nexus and called for the inclusion of women at all levels in the decision making process wfwp 2016 in the subsequent years the discussions were further taken forward and recommendations were fed into the upcoming world water forums of korea and brazil csw60 csw61 according to the un world water development report on water and jobs of 2016 there was a significant positive contribution to the economy by women in formal high level positions yet 15 national human resources assessments found an average of 17 of staff of the water sector to be female iwa 2014a in addition the global recognition for the involvement of women and gender issues in water management is more at the national level given that international law is silent on gender issues in terms of transboundary water management it is expected that the institutions built upon its principles would also recognize less the role of women and gender issues earle bazilli 2013 p116 during the same year and at the international symposium on water diplomacy the session on the role of women in water diplomacy emphasized the need to encourage environments in which women feel confident about talking and contributing to the decision making process siwi 2016 around the same time the first un women forum held during the budapest water summit 2016 highlighted the need to recognize women as agents of change in the decision making realm rather than simply as a vulnerable water user group budapest 2016 clearly there has been a definite progress in terms of placing women water and peace on the agenda of important global forums however there remains a large untapped potential and role for women to play in national regional and global peacebuilding with water as a possible vehicle among others this is supported by one of the recommendations of a joint unep unwomen 2013 report on unlocking the peacebuilding potential of women in terms of water resources management in conflict areas it proposes to include women and gender specialists early on in peace negotiations in a variety of positions as negotiators as expert advisors and as civil society observers and in mediation support teams as well as supporting their capacity to engage effectively in these processes 1 3 why this paper this paper will explore and identify current challenges that women experts interested in attaining high level positions in water diplomacy face in three arab countries in which hydropolitics prevails including jordan lebanon and the state of palestine the paper will first present the geographic background and the different sections of the questionnaire that was formulated and shared with women experts working on water related issues to ascertain key qualitative issues perceptions and various challenges in the subsequent sections the results of the various parts of the questionnaire will be presented and a discussion will follow the focus of the paper is to identify the additional skills that these women would need to develop and acquire to better qualify as water diplomats both locally and globally in addition the paper explores ow to better equip women as leaders in the attainment of the sustainable development goals especially goal 5 on gender equality and goal 6 on clean water and sanitation in their national water sectors the results provide a basic and initial mapping of current challenges and make recommendations that would assist in the empowerment of those women in water diplomacy decision making positions in the regions investigated specifically as well as globally the geographical scope of this paper is the arab levant lebanon palestine and jordan are part of the eastern mediterranean region and share the same language similar societal cultures and regional challenges we as authors recognize the social political and institutional barriers to women s advancement in water diplomacy related fields globally and in lebanon jordan and palestine specifically and emphasize that it is incumbent on all members of society to address gender equality issues and associated repercussions we believe that overcoming the individual shortcomings will improve women s standing vis à vis the societal and institutional obstacles and the claims used against having women on the water negotiating tables both nationally and globally therefore we have decided in this paper to address the current limited role of women in water diplomacy and decision making roles from a different angle by addressing the individual social and technical shortcomings that influence and or hinder professional women from attainment of professional women of being members and or leading of water negotiating teams that are often the boys club carmi 2017 we strongly believe that given the appropriate capacity building and right opportunities more women decision makers will be involved in transboundary water management in the 3 chosen countries the choice of the particular countries for this paper was based on the expertise of the 3 authors themselves having been involved in different capacities and levels of water diplomacy more importantly the jordan river basin to which the 3 countries are among the 5 riparians is one of the most researched basins in the world phillips et al 2007a b zoubi 2014 different modalities of cooperation have been proposed from as early as the 1950s yet today a basin wide agreement has not been reached hence the jordan river basin provides a good example of how different levels of water diplomacy can play s in peacebuilding in the shared transboundary river basin there are clearly opportunities to use the untapped potential of women water professionals in negotiations on transboundary water resources another reason that supported our decision was the presence of national women governance structures including the palestinian ministry of women s affairs as a full fledged ministry the jordanian national committee for women as an inter ministerial committee and the national committee for lebanese women as a commission under the authority of the prime minister as a first important cornerstone towards gender mainstreaming in those government policies although these institutions are vulnerable to shifts in priorities and budget reshuffling in comparison with other ministries escwa 2016a b yet there exists at least a framework for women empowerment generally that could be used for water diplomacy more specifically 1 4 why arab women their current status in decision making although in the arab world there is a patriarchal influence on norms and customs escwa 2017c p vii that also influences stereotypes of the role of women joseph 1996 yet there are many promising developments that pave the way for a more effective role for women in decision making as a first step the arab countries have ratified the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women cedaw in addition and in 2013 the league of arab states adopted a regional strategy on the women peace and security wps and a regional

materialized ipu 2015 going from an average of 4 3 in 1995 to 16 1 by 2015 in comparison to a world average of 22 1 in 2015 fig 2 1 5 why should more women be involved women should be more involved in decision making on water issues not because of quotas or to claim gender equality per se women are needed side by side to men in all various tracks of negotiations by virtue of the added benefits including but not limited to inclusiveness ensuring equality and human rights in peace agreements the linkage between sustainable peace and inclusion of women is supported by research which has shown that peace agreements are more likely to be reached and be sustainable when women are included maoz 2009 a policy brief by feron clingendael 2015 argues that the inclusion of gender issues in peace negotiations is a key to success of both pre and post reconciliation and negotiation processes the conference on women water and peace held in istanbul in 2016 highlighted the added value of women negotiators alsayegh 2016 we as authors acknowledge that one must be careful of making generalizations about what characteristics or traits women bring to the table that men don t and vice versa from a behavioral perspective and according to de janasz a professor of leadership and organizational development women are more competent in integrative negotiations which calls for a concern for people sensitivity to emotions and nonverbal messages and better listening skills de janasz et al 2015 men and women do negotiate differently yet both sides exhibit valuable behaviors that the other gender could benefit from borrowing conti 2016 examples from modern history testify to the added value of women negotiators generally monica mcwilliams co founder of the northern ireland women s coalition and one of the two women to sit at the multi party peace negotiations talks about the contribution they made to civic rights equality and ensuring the rights of victims to the conflict in the conclusion of the 1998 belfast good friday agreement mcwilliams 2015 senator george mitchell acknowledged that one of the factors that led to an agreement was the emergence of women as a political force mitchell 1999 unfortunately in spite of the evidence above the statistics to date with regard to women involvement in the implementation of the women peace security agenda and in related negotiations are quite discouraging an open letter to un member states mentioned that only 11 out of 70 members of the restructured high peace council in afghanistan are women ngo working group on wps 2017 according to unwomen 2012 a sample of 31 major peace processes between 1992 and 2011 reveals that only 4 per cent of signatories 2 4 per cent of chief mediators 3 7 per cent of witnesses and 9 per cent of negotiators are women even at the yearly world economic forum and per its global gender gap report gender parity still exists even if gap is slowly shortening hutt 2016 2 methods a short questionnaire was developed to map the main challenges facing women and various factors political societal technical and others that limit more major role for women in water diplomacy and decision making the total number of questions was 19 12 were closed questions 2 open questions and the rest combined the questionnaire was designed to provide specific insights into four main issues 1 their current status in the water sector in their national countries 2 the main challenges and factors limiting their role 3 their understanding of the definition and the role of water diplomacy and 4 linkages between the sustainable development goal 6 and sustainable development goal 5 in their daily work if applicable the questionnaire was shared electronically with a total of 55 women working in the water sector in the three selected countries for this mapping the water sector includes all stakeholders in line ministries universities ngos and partners in palestine in particular the snowball sample was used in which the questionnaires were first sent to the palestinian water authority female professionals and additional ones sent to their own counterparts the total number of respondents was 33 i e 60 12 from jordan 6 from lebanon and 15 from palestine the selection of the sample group was based on the expertise and experience of the authors each in her home country with the main female actors in the water sector from different age groups different institutions and different lengths of work experience in the water field all of the female respondents who answered the questionnaire were offered confidentiality should she choose to the intention of the questionnaire was not to provide a statistically representative sample but to provide an indicative understanding of the role of women in the three countries in water diplomacy and decision making realm the closed questions for palestine and jordan were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences spss software spss while the open ended responses were qualitatively analyzed to provide more in depth and narrative explanations of the responses and contributions of the respondents given time limitations it had not been possible to conduct the same kind of analysis in lebanon instead interviews conducted with key water experts in the sector a total of nine interviews with senior experts and directors at the governmental level and university were undertaken the interviews were based on the questions of the questionnaire with a few additional ones appendix a al sayegh chose the interviewees based on the scope needed and her own experience in palestine the respondents were invited to a round table to discuss the preliminary findings and to exchange it was equally informative for both the respondents and the palestinian author as it provided an opportunity for clarification and elaboration on certain questions and choice of answers 3 results and discussion 3 1 current status the main responses to the first part of the questionnaire that addressed the current status of the female respondents working in the water sector are summarized in figs 3 and 4 for palestine and jordan questionnaire respondents the term water sector as used for the purposes of this mapping exercise refers to water related jobs including those at the line ministry prime minister s office line ngos and or line universities in palestine as seen in fig 3 the highest percentage of females working on water related issues was of the age group of 30 39 with work experience of 11 20 years 50 of whom are government employees two thirds of the respondents hold a master s degree and are in management positions the highest ratio of male female in workplace as perceived by the respondents the respondents personal input on what the percentage is was less than 10 in jordan fig 4 the highest percentage of females working on water related issues was in the age group of 40 49 with work experience under 10 years three quarters of whom are government employees it is important to note that the experience referred to is that within the water sector only some of the respondents in jordan were previously working in other fields and joined the sector within the last decade almost 60 of them hold a bachelor s degree and the majority hold senior management positions the highest ratio of male female in workplace as perceived by the respondents was in the range of 25 50 in lebanon the female professionals interviewed working on water related issues were spread evenly between the two age groups of 30 39 and 40 70 percent of whom are government employees the majority hold a master s degree and are equally involved in senior e management positions and or are heads of department the highest perception of the ratio of male female was less than 20 at government level although this ratio was perceived to be higher by interviewees from intergovernmental organizations and universities the main message to be concluded from the first part of the questionnaire is the need for sex disaggregated data given that the data is variable an argument that has been made globally by different women related and non related institutions unesco 2015 another key message is that there is a good potential and room for the inclusion and active participation of more female experts into the world of water diplomacy in the 3 countries in order for readers of this article to have a better background and smoother understanding of the dimension and context for women in the three countries the next paragraphs present a brief country sector profile limited by the availability of data in jordan young women currently comprise only 13 of the economically active population while they are more educated than their male counterparts they still experience twice the amount of difficulty in finding a job hashemite kingdom of jordan statement 2017 this was confirmed by a gender assessment that of the water sector in 2012 showing similar observations usaid 2011 gender policies are in place but are not implemented women are represented in several committees are qualified but not directly in water management furthermore they are not given the opportunity to practice their knowledge in the water sector which is still considered a male dominated world a change in the attitude of both women and men is imperative if gender roles and responsibilities are to be understood in integrated water resources management iwrm in lebanon and at the ministry of energy and water moew there are seven women as heads of departments three women engineers as heads of services within the water establishments while most water quality officers and laboratory analysts are women fakih 2018 one of the interviewees in lebanon is a member at the national commission for lebanese women nclw the latter s mission is to empower women to reach decision making positions she emphasized that women are more present in the second tier of decision making positions adding that three quarters of the ministers advisors are women as this current generation of male decision makers retire there will arise more opportunities for gender equality that are based on merit and not merely gender in palestine a preliminary study was conducted on the role of women in leadership and decision making positions in the environment sector mainly in water and solid waste management state of palestine 2010 this study highlighted the poor representation of women according to which only 11 of second tier decision making positions in service provider institutions were held by women in comparison only four 4 of the second tier higher management positions in the official palestinian institutes of relevance were held by women although they represent 30 of the workforce there on the positive note this preliminary study led to the formulation of a strategy to empower women in leadership positions in water and solid waste sectors at the palestinian water authority women make up 30 of the staff and hold around 36 5 of decision making positions personal communication next section the second part 2 of the questionnaire is meant to identify the main challenges encountered by the female respondents and their own interpretation and perception of the make female ration in their workplaces as seen in fig 5 below the two main factors contributing to the male female ratio in the workplace in both jordan and palestine include having a patriarchal society and the dominant strong negative perceptions of female decision makers by patriarchal society we are referring to one that consists of a male dominated power structure throughout organized society and in individual relationships napikoski 2017 and there are many examples documented globally that speak to the challenges of being females in a patriarchal society in relation to the negative perceptions of female decisions makers women who work in the political sector in the middle east are often subjected to ill intentioned rumors slander and scandals which negatively affect their image before the public as well as their families karama 2009 women s leadership capacities are often doubted by a significant share of women swmena 2011 when former secretary of state madeleine albright spoke about being a woman and a diplomat in an interview one of the main challenges she stated she faced was the criticism she received from women and the feelings of guilt she was made to feel both these factors are inter related since the female perceptions are also inherently influenced by dominant patriarchal views adopted by females themselves towards other females holding senior position the clichés are strong and perceptions towards women need to be changed siwi 2016 the challenge of male dominance is not limited to this part of the world it resonates globally as well an annual participant at the world economic forum highlights the slowly increasing participation of women at 18 percent in 2016 however this has helped elevate the discourse on gender disparity metcalf kupres 2016 in addition to the above two limiting factors it was interesting to examine the various other factors that influence the acceptance of s female water experts of positions that require more decision making and involvement in official water diplomacy negotiations according to the responses summarized in fig 6 the predominant factor is the lack of opportunity both in palestine and jordan interestingly the difference between the respondents in the two neighboring similar culture countries was that in palestine the factors of highest ranking were mainly what one could term as external ones either lack of opportunity 50 or lack of support from peer 41 while in jordan they were more of what one could identify as internal or personal factors including motherhood lack of confidence fear and lack of comprehensive skills the questionnaire also examined whether respondents were willing to relocate for work and to work longer hours both in jordan and palestine more than 65 of the respondents expressed their willingness to both relocation or longer working hours that might be required for more senior positions if one were to search for stereotypes of working women one can easily reference many cases where women are unjustifiably excluded a new negotiation research study finds that female negotiators as well as racial minorities are likely to face bias in negotiations for employment even before they have a chance to begin bargaining shonk 2016 similarly in lebanon the male dominance patriarchal society is one of the main limiting factors quoting an interviewee she said if there are women in high level positions they are subject to sextortion or they have to use their feminism to be or stay in decision making positions the term sextortion was coined by the international association of women judges and refers to the abuse of power to obtain a sexual benefit or advantage it is a problem all over the world with far reaching costs in terms of physical and mental health and human dignity iawj 2012 at the local level water sector sextortion is common for delivery of water services getting water meters installed getting permits and avoiding cutting off water services sde 2017 sida 2017 however it is not easy to find documentation of sextortion for being promoted as a female to higher positions in the water sector and water diplomacy careers in order to surmount those challenges and bridge the gap between males and females the respondents were given options to define in their views a variety of skills they feel they need to develop and7or acquire to be more in the decision making processes of water diplomacy the respondents in palestine and jordan were majorly confident about their own skills 93 and 75 respectively however an examination of a following question on needed skills gave room for controversy clearly there are cross interlinkages that need to be used to serve the higher good see fig 7 during the roundtable discussion with some of the palestinian female respondents the latter clarified that their understanding of skills was in reference to their technical expertise this explains the over estimation of the percentage vis à vis overall skills they feel are needed for a water diplomacy related position this was further supported by the need for further skills while the majority around 80 85 of respondents felt that they had the needed technical skills they also acknowledged the need to develop and brush up on their diplomatic and international relation skills their knowledge of legal instruments and access to political guidance in lebanon and according to the interviewees there are fewer women who studied the traditionally male dominated fields of specialization like engineering this trend still continues even if at a slowly decreasing rate among the opinions shared was that there is no difference between women and men in terms of diplomacy and that women are sometimes considered better negotiators as they are better listeners the main challenge according to the personal experience of one of the interviewees is for women to build on their technical expertise through capacity building programs and training another senior water engineer who has been working in the water sector for almost two decades called on other women to focus on leadership positions when women gain experience at the technical level they can be involved at the diplomatic level a woman s perseverance logic and patience will help her to reach her goals women my advice to you is do not be afraid and focus on leadership positions part 3 of questionnaire definition and role of water diplomacy water diplomacy is often defined differently depending on different factors including but not limited to the political context and the specific purposes for which it is used in the questionnaire the related question was open ended and female respondents chose one or more definition s fig 8 below summarizes the respondents understanding of the definition and role of water diplomacy looking at fig 8 above water diplomacy is perceived mainly as a high level dialogue among states on water issues it is also considered to be an effective tool for peacebuilding and or an attempt to progress under conditions of political deadlock the perceived role s of water diplomacy is are highly reflective of the dominance of hydropolitics in the region in the management of transboundary water resources wolf 1995 and explains why water is one of the core issues in permanent status negotiations among the palestinians and the israelis it is well acknowledged that water is life and that securing water rights and control and management of water resources is an important pillar of viable sovereign states nad 2018 the definitions chosen by the jordanian water experts reflects the experience of jordan as a sovereign state with access and control of its national resources and a 1994 peace agreement with israel that included a water sharing agreement from the transboundary jordan river basin the jordan israel peace treaty annex ii both as an effective tool in peace building 32 and as an exercise of benefit sharing among riparian countries 23 in comparison the palestinian water experts given the denial of control and access to water resources and driven by the limitations of a water allocation interim agreement with israel look less favorably to water diplomacy as an effective tool in peace building 17 and more as a means to progress in the face of political deadlock these differences are in line with the global discussion with regard to the definition of water diplomacy with different meanings to different actors molnar et al 2017 p 26 in lebanon the interviewees emphasized the need to agree on a definition of water diplomacy that ensures dialogue negotiation and reconciling conflicting interests among riparian states prior to assessing women s role in water diplomacy one interviewee believes that water diplomacy is a political issue and in general the role of women in politics in lebanon in particular is very limited in her words water diplomacy is a transboundary issue but for the time being with no relations with israel and a complicated situation in syria diplomacy is far away despite the fact that water diplomacy is not a luxury but a catalyst for peace adding that we tried through the blue peace initiative sfg 2011 to advocate for a water consortium for 5 countries lebanon syria iraq jordan and turkey but we faced many obstacles due to difficult conditions in syria and iraq this re emphasizes the complexity of having an agreed upon definition of water diplomacy and the challenge that comes with it includes the identification of the potential roles for negotiators generally and female ones particularly 3 2 next section sdgs globally and regionally it is recognized that development is a main enabler of stability and hence is considered as another tool of preventive diplomacy there is also a consensus that all sustainable development goals sdgs have gender aspects and for nearly all development water is crucial in this initial mapping and due to limited scope and time constraint the inter relation of sdgs 5 and 6 were only considered this does not in any way exclude the interlinkages to other sdgs while it is not necessary for water diplomats to be working on the attainment of sdgs the inclusion of sdgs 5 and 6 in this mapping exercise has been undertaken from the perspective that development is another form of preventive diplomacy and could be coupled with water diplomacy towards stability peace and cooperation in the arab region since 2014 the arab forum for sustainable development is an annual high level regional platform where multiple stakeholders discuss coordination pathways for the implementation follow up and review of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the findings and recommendations conveying key messages from the region are usually submitted to and presented at the annual high level political forum hlpf convened under the auspices of the economic and social council ecosoc ensuring that arab countries have a voice at global level the 3 countries of focus in this paper have submitted their voluntary national reviews and are committed to conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national and sub national levels which are country led and country driven per paragraph 79 of the 2030 agenda the questionnaire included 4 questions on the inter linkages n of sdg 5 and sdg 6 one was closed while the remaining 3 were open fig 9 below encouragingly confirms the commitment to the interlinkages and understanding of the important role of the two specific sdgs in the related water issues both in jordan and palestine this according to the respondents whose work is related to sdgs is achieved through the integration of women s needs in the planning of projects plans and policies in which they themselves are engaged in in addition some are involved in programs of specific target indicators for gender mainstreaming in the water sector in question eighteen 18 of appendix a on requirements to engender sdg6 for real implementation different global approaches were proposed including the adoption of appropriate policies and legislative frameworks development of gender sensitive action plans and indicators and raising public awareness in particular of decision makers in addition and more specifically one expert opinion was that it is better to invest at present in ensuring adequate access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services in vulnerable communities in households schools places of employment hospitals for women and men based on quick assessments and a set of short gender sensitive consultations rather than spending scarce time and resources on additional large scale surveys and complex methodologies to compile national reports although it is recognized that gender and age disaggregated indicator methodologies and data collection efforts help to raise awareness but they should be pursued as the means and not as the goal of engendering sdg6 in relation one quote that was shared by a colleague from the unesco world water assessment programme wwap appropriately summarizes the different proposals water is not engendered is endangered the final question of this sdg related section was meant to provoke a reflection of mainly governmental actors on the value of cooperation with the private sector and or women civil society organizations to strengthen the linkage between sdg5 and sdg6 in palestine and jordan there was a general positive outlook fig 10 for this question the respondents were asked to elaborate on their choice those that were in favor of the need to cooperate with the private sector and the csos emphasized the need for the water sector and its related fields to include all key players to ensure inclusiveness and to have joint and continuous coordination efforts the experience of the csos offers more practical examples and reflects the women needs and interests it was mentioned that there are more women working in the private sector the latter being a significant employer of the labor force the capacity building offered and the increase in the percentage of women could encourage more public acceptance of the role of women in the sector both civil society organizations and the private sector have rich on ground experiences and active networks with the local communities and women groups the circular policy homes to social media to workplaces role of women is highly effective one interesting reflection of the respondent who disagreed with the need of engagement of the csos and private sector was that the government is responsible to lead on the implementation of the sustainable development goals and their interlinkages and hence the roles and mandates should be clearly defined and respected 3 3 final question of the questionnaire the final question was again an open question to allow those expert women in the water sector of the three countries that participated in this basic mapping to voice and share their thoughts and recommendations on their personal and their peer women water expert empowerment in terms of water diplomacy and water related decision making several highlighted that women along the spectrum from housekeepers to senior water experts are affected most by decisions made on water related issues there is definitely an unrealized potential for a more influential role for women that needs to be acknowledged in addition to the general recommendations in the next section under conclusions several interesting reflections and suggestions were made there is an added benefit to the ability of women to prioritize build trust and negotiate differently than men there is a need to link water issues with social ones and integrate women associations with water user associations to better reflect women interests and role it is rewarding to connect readily available cost effective technological solutions for water and sanitation with principles of gender equity there is a need to tackle the issue of nepotism in the water sector whereby skilled and capable people need to be at the relevant job regardless of being woman or man it was proposed to look into building water women informal groups along the concept of farmer to farmer schools and oxfam future pioneers water ambassadors initiative 3 4 limitations prior to the final conclusions and recommendations it is noteworthy to point out to some limitations based on this basic mapping exercise the literature in relation to the empowerment of the role of women in water diplomacy to date per our literature review is limited and has looked more into the challenges imposed by dominantly male driven societies and fields given the limited timeframe and manpower the analysis is indicative the interview analysis is based on the understanding and the interpretation of the interviewees the sample group was chosen initially from the governmental sector and their counterparts there is thus a possible over representation 4 conclusions and recommendations patriarchal societies related gender inequalities and customs place constraints on women and limit their ability to participate in decision making generally and on water issues more specifically given that water diplomacy requires the use of a combination of traditionally male dominated fields of specialization accordingly women are often isolated from the job market and lack access to technologies and training that provide opportunities for employment in the field of water diplomacy through capacity building and training women will be better equipped to use available instruments and institutions and act as agents of change in the water decision making realm it is imperative that women be empowered to take part in water related decisions on all levels this means enhancing women s civic and political participation strengthening the role of women in local economies and bolstering their efforts in society and the work place by tackling discrimination and marginalization and cultural attitudes building partnerships and supporting the innovations that will help women live up to their potential in addition it is important to institutionalize a gender responsive approach to peace and security to promote women s participation and leadership in peacebuilding and decision making to engage women in conflict prevention early warning and disaster risk reduction and finally to invest in their health education and economic empowerment to build stable societies considering that 60 80 of water related work at the ground level is undertaken by women un wwdr 2016 it is imperative that more women are involved in water management decision making processes gmi08 module 1 forum gender and iwrm although this paper provides only indicative ideas on the challenges experienced by a small sample of women professionals in relation to an enhanced role in decision making on water related issues it is nonetheless an important first step in the articulation of what is needed in the future to continue a more in depth analysis on this vital topic some suggestions for further research include to expand the number of female respondents in the target countries share the results of this basic mapping with the female respondents and formulate focus groups to discuss and expand the scope design a questionnaire targeting male respondents in the water sector on their perspective of empowering women in water diplomacy in their national countries assess the implementation of unscr 1325 in the target countries conduct a more in depth desk review of all jordanian lebanese and palestinian initiatives that involve women in water diplomacy expand the scope of inter relatedness of sdgs to include in addition to sdgs 5 6 at least sdgs 3 and 16 review the legislations and regulations governing the role of women in water diplomacy and prepare a policy brief linking sdg 5 and 6 in the arab region recommendations for women the most pertinent recommendation to women in the diplomacy world is captured in the words of susan jane le jeune d allegeershecque who was appointed british high commissioner to canada in august 2017 i think the most important is to believe that anything is possible i have met far too many young women who impose limitations on themselves through our exercise of basic mapping our literature review our interaction with our colleagues in water sector and its related fields we would like to make the following general and relevant recommendations towards empowering our role as women in water diplomacy in its various levels that also voices the proposals of our respondents and interviewees it is important to develop a global perspective to local issues through the down scaling to the local context of the principles needed to meet sdg5 and sdg6 collectively learn from other successful women initiate a campaign to lobby for governmental policy intervention led by universities and women movements to raise awareness and highlight the importance of the water related fields to attract more women to engage in line with sdgs given there is already a significant number of women engaged in international relations foreign missions international and national advocacy on water call for universities and schools to encourage and direct young women to pursue more science based degrees and to diversify specialization into other fields of water science beyond water engineering to include among others hydrology hydrogeology modeling lobby for an increased quota for women in the water sector request for more vocational training in water related disciplines and promote whenever possible for the inclusion of women at all levels of decision making in conclusion there is a lot of potential untapped one in female water professionals generally de silva et al 2018 and in the 3 target countries particularly which could be put to use to engage in more fruitful water negotiations both nationally and regionally it is a joint effort for men and women to enhance and empower the role of women in water diplomacy from where we stand women need to do their own homework to walk into and lead in the arena of water diplomacy and the time is ripe and it is now a questionnaire and interview questions 
6762,until now limited attention has been afforded to the role of and challenges faced by women involved in water diplomacy in addition to research being at an early stage it is mainly focused on addressing the challenges imposed by gender inequality thus very few applicable policy recommendations have emerged in this field to date this paper will explore and identify current challenges that face the women interested in attaining high level positions in water diplomacy in three arab countries in which hydropolitics prevails including jordan lebanon and the state of palestine female experts working on water related issues were surveyed and interviewed to ascertain key qualitative issues perceptions and various challenges the focus of the paper was to identify the additional skills to be developed and acquired for these women to better qualify as water diplomats both nationally and globally in addition the paper explores how to better equip women as leaders in the attainment of the sustainable development goals especially goal 5 on gender equality and goal 6 on clean water and sanitation in their national water sectors the results provide a basic and initial mapping of current challenges and makes recommendations that would assist in the empowerment of those women in water diplomacy decision making positions in the regions investigated specifically as well as globally keywords women empowerment water diplomacy decision makers sdgs lebanon palestine jordan challenges peace security 1 introduction 1 1 rationale for women water diplomacy water and peace security linking of concepts globally and nationally the united nations and its member states as well as an array of actors recognize the role of preventive diplomacy in mitigating and or limiting the escalation of disputes between the parties un 2011 p2 the tendency in modern diplomacy is to take preventive measures and use different vehicles of peace including that of natural resources to foster cooperation and eliminate potential contributors to conflict diplomacy itself has evolved and it is now multidimensional and multi lateral petrovsky 1998 diplo pamment 2017 among the new trends in diplomacy is the emergence of more specialized forms that require diplomats to gain expertise in specialized fields including water energy and agriculture due to increasing global governance and international cooperation ton 2015 in 2017 the security council held a briefing on preventive diplomacy and transboundary waters emphasizing the role of water diplomacy and cooperation in conflict prevention mr guterres emphasized that water security and peace are inextricably linked unsg 2017 water diplomacy one of many forms of preventive diplomacy includes all measures by state and non state actors that can be undertaken to prevent or peacefully resolve emerging conflicts and facilitate cooperation related to water availability allocation or use between and within states and public and private stakeholders however theoretical foundations to cooperation over shared resources and best approaches to implement water diplomacy in practice are still weakly developed concepts and approaches such as multi level water adaptive water governance a mutual gains approach and instruments for benefit sharing need to be further developed and made operational huntijens et al 2016 in relation and in july 2013 the foreign affairs council of the european union eu adopted conclusions on eu water diplomacy to proactively engage in transboundary water security challenges and recognized the importance of the 1992 united national economic commission for europe water convention unece and the 1997 united nations convention on the non navigational uses of international water courses unwc council of european union 2013 more recently november 2018 the council recognized the direct impacts of water scarcity on eu peace and national security most notably through migration flows council of european union 2018 the statistics to date are alarming on future water shortages including predictions that by 2050 at least one in four people will be living in a country that is affected by chronic or recurrent freshwater shortages wwdr 2016 on a more positive note the benefits of transboundary water cooperation and its potential role as a bridge to peace is widely documented and researched jägerskog 2007 phillips et al 2006 wolf 2009 earle et al 2010 zeitoun et al 2017 in recognition of the role of water in peacebuilding in 2015 fifteen 15 co convening countries launched the global high level panel on water and peace in geneva the latter produced the report a matter of survival with concrete implementable recommendations to transform water from a source of potential crisis to an instrument of cooperation and peace gwh 2017 similarly in spring 2016 the united nations secretary general and president of the world bank group convened a high level panel on water hlpw consisting of 11 sitting heads of state and government and one special adviser to provide the leadership required to champion a comprehensive inclusive and collaborative way of developing and managing water resources and improving water and sanitation related services hlpw 2018a b 1 2 current status of women involvement in water diplomacy and decision making the linkages between women peace and security have been increasingly recognized within the past two decades on the 31st october 2000 the united nations security council adopted resolution 1325 on women peace and security acknowledging the essential role women play in peacebuilding conflict management and sustaining security s res 1325 it was the first international policy mechanism explicitly recognizing the gendered nature of war and peace processes according to ambassador anwarul k chowdhury who was president of the un security council in 2000 and shared his disappointment about the record of implementation of unsc resolution 1325 after one decade chowdhury 2010 although 7 other resolutions were adopted in what came to be known as the women peace and security wps agenda fig 1 yet the progress made to date is still slow unwomen 2012 with the intention of bringing water diplomacy peace and women together and during the 60th session of the un commission on the status of women in march 2016 the permanent mission of the netherlands to the un in new york and the women for water partnership and partners hosted a side event on women s role in water diplomacy as key for empowerment the latter focused on the acknowledgment of women as leaders experts partners on equal footing and agents of change in the water sustainable development nexus and called for the inclusion of women at all levels in the decision making process wfwp 2016 in the subsequent years the discussions were further taken forward and recommendations were fed into the upcoming world water forums of korea and brazil csw60 csw61 according to the un world water development report on water and jobs of 2016 there was a significant positive contribution to the economy by women in formal high level positions yet 15 national human resources assessments found an average of 17 of staff of the water sector to be female iwa 2014a in addition the global recognition for the involvement of women and gender issues in water management is more at the national level given that international law is silent on gender issues in terms of transboundary water management it is expected that the institutions built upon its principles would also recognize less the role of women and gender issues earle bazilli 2013 p116 during the same year and at the international symposium on water diplomacy the session on the role of women in water diplomacy emphasized the need to encourage environments in which women feel confident about talking and contributing to the decision making process siwi 2016 around the same time the first un women forum held during the budapest water summit 2016 highlighted the need to recognize women as agents of change in the decision making realm rather than simply as a vulnerable water user group budapest 2016 clearly there has been a definite progress in terms of placing women water and peace on the agenda of important global forums however there remains a large untapped potential and role for women to play in national regional and global peacebuilding with water as a possible vehicle among others this is supported by one of the recommendations of a joint unep unwomen 2013 report on unlocking the peacebuilding potential of women in terms of water resources management in conflict areas it proposes to include women and gender specialists early on in peace negotiations in a variety of positions as negotiators as expert advisors and as civil society observers and in mediation support teams as well as supporting their capacity to engage effectively in these processes 1 3 why this paper this paper will explore and identify current challenges that women experts interested in attaining high level positions in water diplomacy face in three arab countries in which hydropolitics prevails including jordan lebanon and the state of palestine the paper will first present the geographic background and the different sections of the questionnaire that was formulated and shared with women experts working on water related issues to ascertain key qualitative issues perceptions and various challenges in the subsequent sections the results of the various parts of the questionnaire will be presented and a discussion will follow the focus of the paper is to identify the additional skills that these women would need to develop and acquire to better qualify as water diplomats both locally and globally in addition the paper explores ow to better equip women as leaders in the attainment of the sustainable development goals especially goal 5 on gender equality and goal 6 on clean water and sanitation in their national water sectors the results provide a basic and initial mapping of current challenges and make recommendations that would assist in the empowerment of those women in water diplomacy decision making positions in the regions investigated specifically as well as globally the geographical scope of this paper is the arab levant lebanon palestine and jordan are part of the eastern mediterranean region and share the same language similar societal cultures and regional challenges we as authors recognize the social political and institutional barriers to women s advancement in water diplomacy related fields globally and in lebanon jordan and palestine specifically and emphasize that it is incumbent on all members of society to address gender equality issues and associated repercussions we believe that overcoming the individual shortcomings will improve women s standing vis à vis the societal and institutional obstacles and the claims used against having women on the water negotiating tables both nationally and globally therefore we have decided in this paper to address the current limited role of women in water diplomacy and decision making roles from a different angle by addressing the individual social and technical shortcomings that influence and or hinder professional women from attainment of professional women of being members and or leading of water negotiating teams that are often the boys club carmi 2017 we strongly believe that given the appropriate capacity building and right opportunities more women decision makers will be involved in transboundary water management in the 3 chosen countries the choice of the particular countries for this paper was based on the expertise of the 3 authors themselves having been involved in different capacities and levels of water diplomacy more importantly the jordan river basin to which the 3 countries are among the 5 riparians is one of the most researched basins in the world phillips et al 2007a b zoubi 2014 different modalities of cooperation have been proposed from as early as the 1950s yet today a basin wide agreement has not been reached hence the jordan river basin provides a good example of how different levels of water diplomacy can play s in peacebuilding in the shared transboundary river basin there are clearly opportunities to use the untapped potential of women water professionals in negotiations on transboundary water resources another reason that supported our decision was the presence of national women governance structures including the palestinian ministry of women s affairs as a full fledged ministry the jordanian national committee for women as an inter ministerial committee and the national committee for lebanese women as a commission under the authority of the prime minister as a first important cornerstone towards gender mainstreaming in those government policies although these institutions are vulnerable to shifts in priorities and budget reshuffling in comparison with other ministries escwa 2016a b yet there exists at least a framework for women empowerment generally that could be used for water diplomacy more specifically 1 4 why arab women their current status in decision making although in the arab world there is a patriarchal influence on norms and customs escwa 2017c p vii that also influences stereotypes of the role of women joseph 1996 yet there are many promising developments that pave the way for a more effective role for women in decision making as a first step the arab countries have ratified the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women cedaw in addition and in 2013 the league of arab states adopted a regional strategy on the women peace and security wps and a regional action plan in 2015 escwa 2017a p 4 the beirut call for action summarizes the main recommendations of an international conference whose purpose was to engage international regional and national stakeholders in strategic dialogue on women peace and security in the arab region escwa et al 2016a b furthermore karama and its partners launched the arab regional network on women peace and security according to the inter parliamentary union 20 years after the beijing platform for action of 1995 the arab states women s political rights and opportunities have expanded but have not yet fully materialized ipu 2015 going from an average of 4 3 in 1995 to 16 1 by 2015 in comparison to a world average of 22 1 in 2015 fig 2 1 5 why should more women be involved women should be more involved in decision making on water issues not because of quotas or to claim gender equality per se women are needed side by side to men in all various tracks of negotiations by virtue of the added benefits including but not limited to inclusiveness ensuring equality and human rights in peace agreements the linkage between sustainable peace and inclusion of women is supported by research which has shown that peace agreements are more likely to be reached and be sustainable when women are included maoz 2009 a policy brief by feron clingendael 2015 argues that the inclusion of gender issues in peace negotiations is a key to success of both pre and post reconciliation and negotiation processes the conference on women water and peace held in istanbul in 2016 highlighted the added value of women negotiators alsayegh 2016 we as authors acknowledge that one must be careful of making generalizations about what characteristics or traits women bring to the table that men don t and vice versa from a behavioral perspective and according to de janasz a professor of leadership and organizational development women are more competent in integrative negotiations which calls for a concern for people sensitivity to emotions and nonverbal messages and better listening skills de janasz et al 2015 men and women do negotiate differently yet both sides exhibit valuable behaviors that the other gender could benefit from borrowing conti 2016 examples from modern history testify to the added value of women negotiators generally monica mcwilliams co founder of the northern ireland women s coalition and one of the two women to sit at the multi party peace negotiations talks about the contribution they made to civic rights equality and ensuring the rights of victims to the conflict in the conclusion of the 1998 belfast good friday agreement mcwilliams 2015 senator george mitchell acknowledged that one of the factors that led to an agreement was the emergence of women as a political force mitchell 1999 unfortunately in spite of the evidence above the statistics to date with regard to women involvement in the implementation of the women peace security agenda and in related negotiations are quite discouraging an open letter to un member states mentioned that only 11 out of 70 members of the restructured high peace council in afghanistan are women ngo working group on wps 2017 according to unwomen 2012 a sample of 31 major peace processes between 1992 and 2011 reveals that only 4 per cent of signatories 2 4 per cent of chief mediators 3 7 per cent of witnesses and 9 per cent of negotiators are women even at the yearly world economic forum and per its global gender gap report gender parity still exists even if gap is slowly shortening hutt 2016 2 methods a short questionnaire was developed to map the main challenges facing women and various factors political societal technical and others that limit more major role for women in water diplomacy and decision making the total number of questions was 19 12 were closed questions 2 open questions and the rest combined the questionnaire was designed to provide specific insights into four main issues 1 their current status in the water sector in their national countries 2 the main challenges and factors limiting their role 3 their understanding of the definition and the role of water diplomacy and 4 linkages between the sustainable development goal 6 and sustainable development goal 5 in their daily work if applicable the questionnaire was shared electronically with a total of 55 women working in the water sector in the three selected countries for this mapping the water sector includes all stakeholders in line ministries universities ngos and partners in palestine in particular the snowball sample was used in which the questionnaires were first sent to the palestinian water authority female professionals and additional ones sent to their own counterparts the total number of respondents was 33 i e 60 12 from jordan 6 from lebanon and 15 from palestine the selection of the sample group was based on the expertise and experience of the authors each in her home country with the main female actors in the water sector from different age groups different institutions and different lengths of work experience in the water field all of the female respondents who answered the questionnaire were offered confidentiality should she choose to the intention of the questionnaire was not to provide a statistically representative sample but to provide an indicative understanding of the role of women in the three countries in water diplomacy and decision making realm the closed questions for palestine and jordan were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences spss software spss while the open ended responses were qualitatively analyzed to provide more in depth and narrative explanations of the responses and contributions of the respondents given time limitations it had not been possible to conduct the same kind of analysis in lebanon instead interviews conducted with key water experts in the sector a total of nine interviews with senior experts and directors at the governmental level and university were undertaken the interviews were based on the questions of the questionnaire with a few additional ones appendix a al sayegh chose the interviewees based on the scope needed and her own experience in palestine the respondents were invited to a round table to discuss the preliminary findings and to exchange it was equally informative for both the respondents and the palestinian author as it provided an opportunity for clarification and elaboration on certain questions and choice of answers 3 results and discussion 3 1 current status the main responses to the first part of the questionnaire that addressed the current status of the female respondents working in the water sector are summarized in figs 3 and 4 for palestine and jordan questionnaire respondents the term water sector as used for the purposes of this mapping exercise refers to water related jobs including those at the line ministry prime minister s office line ngos and or line universities in palestine as seen in fig 3 the highest percentage of females working on water related issues was of the age group of 30 39 with work experience of 11 20 years 50 of whom are government employees two thirds of the respondents hold a master s degree and are in management positions the highest ratio of male female in workplace as perceived by the respondents the respondents personal input on what the percentage is was less than 10 in jordan fig 4 the highest percentage of females working on water related issues was in the age group of 40 49 with work experience under 10 years three quarters of whom are government employees it is important to note that the experience referred to is that within the water sector only some of the respondents in jordan were previously working in other fields and joined the sector within the last decade almost 60 of them hold a bachelor s degree and the majority hold senior management positions the highest ratio of male female in workplace as perceived by the respondents was in the range of 25 50 in lebanon the female professionals interviewed working on water related issues were spread evenly between the two age groups of 30 39 and 40 70 percent of whom are government employees the majority hold a master s degree and are equally involved in senior e management positions and or are heads of department the highest perception of the ratio of male female was less than 20 at government level although this ratio was perceived to be higher by interviewees from intergovernmental organizations and universities the main message to be concluded from the first part of the questionnaire is the need for sex disaggregated data given that the data is variable an argument that has been made globally by different women related and non related institutions unesco 2015 another key message is that there is a good potential and room for the inclusion and active participation of more female experts into the world of water diplomacy in the 3 countries in order for readers of this article to have a better background and smoother understanding of the dimension and context for women in the three countries the next paragraphs present a brief country sector profile limited by the availability of data in jordan young women currently comprise only 13 of the economically active population while they are more educated than their male counterparts they still experience twice the amount of difficulty in finding a job hashemite kingdom of jordan statement 2017 this was confirmed by a gender assessment that of the water sector in 2012 showing similar observations usaid 2011 gender policies are in place but are not implemented women are represented in several committees are qualified but not directly in water management furthermore they are not given the opportunity to practice their knowledge in the water sector which is still considered a male dominated world a change in the attitude of both women and men is imperative if gender roles and responsibilities are to be understood in integrated water resources management iwrm in lebanon and at the ministry of energy and water moew there are seven women as heads of departments three women engineers as heads of services within the water establishments while most water quality officers and laboratory analysts are women fakih 2018 one of the interviewees in lebanon is a member at the national commission for lebanese women nclw the latter s mission is to empower women to reach decision making positions she emphasized that women are more present in the second tier of decision making positions adding that three quarters of the ministers advisors are women as this current generation of male decision makers retire there will arise more opportunities for gender equality that are based on merit and not merely gender in palestine a preliminary study was conducted on the role of women in leadership and decision making positions in the environment sector mainly in water and solid waste management state of palestine 2010 this study highlighted the poor representation of women according to which only 11 of second tier decision making positions in service provider institutions were held by women in comparison only four 4 of the second tier higher management positions in the official palestinian institutes of relevance were held by women although they represent 30 of the workforce there on the positive note this preliminary study led to the formulation of a strategy to empower women in leadership positions in water and solid waste sectors at the palestinian water authority women make up 30 of the staff and hold around 36 5 of decision making positions personal communication next section the second part 2 of the questionnaire is meant to identify the main challenges encountered by the female respondents and their own interpretation and perception of the make female ration in their workplaces as seen in fig 5 below the two main factors contributing to the male female ratio in the workplace in both jordan and palestine include having a patriarchal society and the dominant strong negative perceptions of female decision makers by patriarchal society we are referring to one that consists of a male dominated power structure throughout organized society and in individual relationships napikoski 2017 and there are many examples documented globally that speak to the challenges of being females in a patriarchal society in relation to the negative perceptions of female decisions makers women who work in the political sector in the middle east are often subjected to ill intentioned rumors slander and scandals which negatively affect their image before the public as well as their families karama 2009 women s leadership capacities are often doubted by a significant share of women swmena 2011 when former secretary of state madeleine albright spoke about being a woman and a diplomat in an interview one of the main challenges she stated she faced was the criticism she received from women and the feelings of guilt she was made to feel both these factors are inter related since the female perceptions are also inherently influenced by dominant patriarchal views adopted by females themselves towards other females holding senior position the clichés are strong and perceptions towards women need to be changed siwi 2016 the challenge of male dominance is not limited to this part of the world it resonates globally as well an annual participant at the world economic forum highlights the slowly increasing participation of women at 18 percent in 2016 however this has helped elevate the discourse on gender disparity metcalf kupres 2016 in addition to the above two limiting factors it was interesting to examine the various other factors that influence the acceptance of s female water experts of positions that require more decision making and involvement in official water diplomacy negotiations according to the responses summarized in fig 6 the predominant factor is the lack of opportunity both in palestine and jordan interestingly the difference between the respondents in the two neighboring similar culture countries was that in palestine the factors of highest ranking were mainly what one could term as external ones either lack of opportunity 50 or lack of support from peer 41 while in jordan they were more of what one could identify as internal or personal factors including motherhood lack of confidence fear and lack of comprehensive skills the questionnaire also examined whether respondents were willing to relocate for work and to work longer hours both in jordan and palestine more than 65 of the respondents expressed their willingness to both relocation or longer working hours that might be required for more senior positions if one were to search for stereotypes of working women one can easily reference many cases where women are unjustifiably excluded a new negotiation research study finds that female negotiators as well as racial minorities are likely to face bias in negotiations for employment even before they have a chance to begin bargaining shonk 2016 similarly in lebanon the male dominance patriarchal society is one of the main limiting factors quoting an interviewee she said if there are women in high level positions they are subject to sextortion or they have to use their feminism to be or stay in decision making positions the term sextortion was coined by the international association of women judges and refers to the abuse of power to obtain a sexual benefit or advantage it is a problem all over the world with far reaching costs in terms of physical and mental health and human dignity iawj 2012 at the local level water sector sextortion is common for delivery of water services getting water meters installed getting permits and avoiding cutting off water services sde 2017 sida 2017 however it is not easy to find documentation of sextortion for being promoted as a female to higher positions in the water sector and water diplomacy careers in order to surmount those challenges and bridge the gap between males and females the respondents were given options to define in their views a variety of skills they feel they need to develop and7or acquire to be more in the decision making processes of water diplomacy the respondents in palestine and jordan were majorly confident about their own skills 93 and 75 respectively however an examination of a following question on needed skills gave room for controversy clearly there are cross interlinkages that need to be used to serve the higher good see fig 7 during the roundtable discussion with some of the palestinian female respondents the latter clarified that their understanding of skills was in reference to their technical expertise this explains the over estimation of the percentage vis à vis overall skills they feel are needed for a water diplomacy related position this was further supported by the need for further skills while the majority around 80 85 of respondents felt that they had the needed technical skills they also acknowledged the need to develop and brush up on their diplomatic and international relation skills their knowledge of legal instruments and access to political guidance in lebanon and according to the interviewees there are fewer women who studied the traditionally male dominated fields of specialization like engineering this trend still continues even if at a slowly decreasing rate among the opinions shared was that there is no difference between women and men in terms of diplomacy and that women are sometimes considered better negotiators as they are better listeners the main challenge according to the personal experience of one of the interviewees is for women to build on their technical expertise through capacity building programs and training another senior water engineer who has been working in the water sector for almost two decades called on other women to focus on leadership positions when women gain experience at the technical level they can be involved at the diplomatic level a woman s perseverance logic and patience will help her to reach her goals women my advice to you is do not be afraid and focus on leadership positions part 3 of questionnaire definition and role of water diplomacy water diplomacy is often defined differently depending on different factors including but not limited to the political context and the specific purposes for which it is used in the questionnaire the related question was open ended and female respondents chose one or more definition s fig 8 below summarizes the respondents understanding of the definition and role of water diplomacy looking at fig 8 above water diplomacy is perceived mainly as a high level dialogue among states on water issues it is also considered to be an effective tool for peacebuilding and or an attempt to progress under conditions of political deadlock the perceived role s of water diplomacy is are highly reflective of the dominance of hydropolitics in the region in the management of transboundary water resources wolf 1995 and explains why water is one of the core issues in permanent status negotiations among the palestinians and the israelis it is well acknowledged that water is life and that securing water rights and control and management of water resources is an important pillar of viable sovereign states nad 2018 the definitions chosen by the jordanian water experts reflects the experience of jordan as a sovereign state with access and control of its national resources and a 1994 peace agreement with israel that included a water sharing agreement from the transboundary jordan river basin the jordan israel peace treaty annex ii both as an effective tool in peace building 32 and as an exercise of benefit sharing among riparian countries 23 in comparison the palestinian water experts given the denial of control and access to water resources and driven by the limitations of a water allocation interim agreement with israel look less favorably to water diplomacy as an effective tool in peace building 17 and more as a means to progress in the face of political deadlock these differences are in line with the global discussion with regard to the definition of water diplomacy with different meanings to different actors molnar et al 2017 p 26 in lebanon the interviewees emphasized the need to agree on a definition of water diplomacy that ensures dialogue negotiation and reconciling conflicting interests among riparian states prior to assessing women s role in water diplomacy one interviewee believes that water diplomacy is a political issue and in general the role of women in politics in lebanon in particular is very limited in her words water diplomacy is a transboundary issue but for the time being with no relations with israel and a complicated situation in syria diplomacy is far away despite the fact that water diplomacy is not a luxury but a catalyst for peace adding that we tried through the blue peace initiative sfg 2011 to advocate for a water consortium for 5 countries lebanon syria iraq jordan and turkey but we faced many obstacles due to difficult conditions in syria and iraq this re emphasizes the complexity of having an agreed upon definition of water diplomacy and the challenge that comes with it includes the identification of the potential roles for negotiators generally and female ones particularly 3 2 next section sdgs globally and regionally it is recognized that development is a main enabler of stability and hence is considered as another tool of preventive diplomacy there is also a consensus that all sustainable development goals sdgs have gender aspects and for nearly all development water is crucial in this initial mapping and due to limited scope and time constraint the inter relation of sdgs 5 and 6 were only considered this does not in any way exclude the interlinkages to other sdgs while it is not necessary for water diplomats to be working on the attainment of sdgs the inclusion of sdgs 5 and 6 in this mapping exercise has been undertaken from the perspective that development is another form of preventive diplomacy and could be coupled with water diplomacy towards stability peace and cooperation in the arab region since 2014 the arab forum for sustainable development is an annual high level regional platform where multiple stakeholders discuss coordination pathways for the implementation follow up and review of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the findings and recommendations conveying key messages from the region are usually submitted to and presented at the annual high level political forum hlpf convened under the auspices of the economic and social council ecosoc ensuring that arab countries have a voice at global level the 3 countries of focus in this paper have submitted their voluntary national reviews and are committed to conduct regular and inclusive reviews of progress at the national and sub national levels which are country led and country driven per paragraph 79 of the 2030 agenda the questionnaire included 4 questions on the inter linkages n of sdg 5 and sdg 6 one was closed while the remaining 3 were open fig 9 below encouragingly confirms the commitment to the interlinkages and understanding of the important role of the two specific sdgs in the related water issues both in jordan and palestine this according to the respondents whose work is related to sdgs is achieved through the integration of women s needs in the planning of projects plans and policies in which they themselves are engaged in in addition some are involved in programs of specific target indicators for gender mainstreaming in the water sector in question eighteen 18 of appendix a on requirements to engender sdg6 for real implementation different global approaches were proposed including the adoption of appropriate policies and legislative frameworks development of gender sensitive action plans and indicators and raising public awareness in particular of decision makers in addition and more specifically one expert opinion was that it is better to invest at present in ensuring adequate access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation services in vulnerable communities in households schools places of employment hospitals for women and men based on quick assessments and a set of short gender sensitive consultations rather than spending scarce time and resources on additional large scale surveys and complex methodologies to compile national reports although it is recognized that gender and age disaggregated indicator methodologies and data collection efforts help to raise awareness but they should be pursued as the means and not as the goal of engendering sdg6 in relation one quote that was shared by a colleague from the unesco world water assessment programme wwap appropriately summarizes the different proposals water is not engendered is endangered the final question of this sdg related section was meant to provoke a reflection of mainly governmental actors on the value of cooperation with the private sector and or women civil society organizations to strengthen the linkage between sdg5 and sdg6 in palestine and jordan there was a general positive outlook fig 10 for this question the respondents were asked to elaborate on their choice those that were in favor of the need to cooperate with the private sector and the csos emphasized the need for the water sector and its related fields to include all key players to ensure inclusiveness and to have joint and continuous coordination efforts the experience of the csos offers more practical examples and reflects the women needs and interests it was mentioned that there are more women working in the private sector the latter being a significant employer of the labor force the capacity building offered and the increase in the percentage of women could encourage more public acceptance of the role of women in the sector both civil society organizations and the private sector have rich on ground experiences and active networks with the local communities and women groups the circular policy homes to social media to workplaces role of women is highly effective one interesting reflection of the respondent who disagreed with the need of engagement of the csos and private sector was that the government is responsible to lead on the implementation of the sustainable development goals and their interlinkages and hence the roles and mandates should be clearly defined and respected 3 3 final question of the questionnaire the final question was again an open question to allow those expert women in the water sector of the three countries that participated in this basic mapping to voice and share their thoughts and recommendations on their personal and their peer women water expert empowerment in terms of water diplomacy and water related decision making several highlighted that women along the spectrum from housekeepers to senior water experts are affected most by decisions made on water related issues there is definitely an unrealized potential for a more influential role for women that needs to be acknowledged in addition to the general recommendations in the next section under conclusions several interesting reflections and suggestions were made there is an added benefit to the ability of women to prioritize build trust and negotiate differently than men there is a need to link water issues with social ones and integrate women associations with water user associations to better reflect women interests and role it is rewarding to connect readily available cost effective technological solutions for water and sanitation with principles of gender equity there is a need to tackle the issue of nepotism in the water sector whereby skilled and capable people need to be at the relevant job regardless of being woman or man it was proposed to look into building water women informal groups along the concept of farmer to farmer schools and oxfam future pioneers water ambassadors initiative 3 4 limitations prior to the final conclusions and recommendations it is noteworthy to point out to some limitations based on this basic mapping exercise the literature in relation to the empowerment of the role of women in water diplomacy to date per our literature review is limited and has looked more into the challenges imposed by dominantly male driven societies and fields given the limited timeframe and manpower the analysis is indicative the interview analysis is based on the understanding and the interpretation of the interviewees the sample group was chosen initially from the governmental sector and their counterparts there is thus a possible over representation 4 conclusions and recommendations patriarchal societies related gender inequalities and customs place constraints on women and limit their ability to participate in decision making generally and on water issues more specifically given that water diplomacy requires the use of a combination of traditionally male dominated fields of specialization accordingly women are often isolated from the job market and lack access to technologies and training that provide opportunities for employment in the field of water diplomacy through capacity building and training women will be better equipped to use available instruments and institutions and act as agents of change in the water decision making realm it is imperative that women be empowered to take part in water related decisions on all levels this means enhancing women s civic and political participation strengthening the role of women in local economies and bolstering their efforts in society and the work place by tackling discrimination and marginalization and cultural attitudes building partnerships and supporting the innovations that will help women live up to their potential in addition it is important to institutionalize a gender responsive approach to peace and security to promote women s participation and leadership in peacebuilding and decision making to engage women in conflict prevention early warning and disaster risk reduction and finally to invest in their health education and economic empowerment to build stable societies considering that 60 80 of water related work at the ground level is undertaken by women un wwdr 2016 it is imperative that more women are involved in water management decision making processes gmi08 module 1 forum gender and iwrm although this paper provides only indicative ideas on the challenges experienced by a small sample of women professionals in relation to an enhanced role in decision making on water related issues it is nonetheless an important first step in the articulation of what is needed in the future to continue a more in depth analysis on this vital topic some suggestions for further research include to expand the number of female respondents in the target countries share the results of this basic mapping with the female respondents and formulate focus groups to discuss and expand the scope design a questionnaire targeting male respondents in the water sector on their perspective of empowering women in water diplomacy in their national countries assess the implementation of unscr 1325 in the target countries conduct a more in depth desk review of all jordanian lebanese and palestinian initiatives that involve women in water diplomacy expand the scope of inter relatedness of sdgs to include in addition to sdgs 5 6 at least sdgs 3 and 16 review the legislations and regulations governing the role of women in water diplomacy and prepare a policy brief linking sdg 5 and 6 in the arab region recommendations for women the most pertinent recommendation to women in the diplomacy world is captured in the words of susan jane le jeune d allegeershecque who was appointed british high commissioner to canada in august 2017 i think the most important is to believe that anything is possible i have met far too many young women who impose limitations on themselves through our exercise of basic mapping our literature review our interaction with our colleagues in water sector and its related fields we would like to make the following general and relevant recommendations towards empowering our role as women in water diplomacy in its various levels that also voices the proposals of our respondents and interviewees it is important to develop a global perspective to local issues through the down scaling to the local context of the principles needed to meet sdg5 and sdg6 collectively learn from other successful women initiate a campaign to lobby for governmental policy intervention led by universities and women movements to raise awareness and highlight the importance of the water related fields to attract more women to engage in line with sdgs given there is already a significant number of women engaged in international relations foreign missions international and national advocacy on water call for universities and schools to encourage and direct young women to pursue more science based degrees and to diversify specialization into other fields of water science beyond water engineering to include among others hydrology hydrogeology modeling lobby for an increased quota for women in the water sector request for more vocational training in water related disciplines and promote whenever possible for the inclusion of women at all levels of decision making in conclusion there is a lot of potential untapped one in female water professionals generally de silva et al 2018 and in the 3 target countries particularly which could be put to use to engage in more fruitful water negotiations both nationally and regionally it is a joint effort for men and women to enhance and empower the role of women in water diplomacy from where we stand women need to do their own homework to walk into and lead in the arena of water diplomacy and the time is ripe and it is now a questionnaire and interview questions 
6763,water and energy are considered as the two most important resources for human life and development and can be represented by the nexus for the cross sectional connection including water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation sectors in a cascade reservoir system in order to quantify interactions of the nexus a novel diagram according to water and energy flow in every sector was proposed in this paper and an optimal water energy nexus model was also developed for the efficiently and effectively cross sectoral coordinating the diagram based on the water and energy flow conceptual network according to our case study in the middle lower lancangjiang river basin the nexus varies with the external water demand water inflow conditions instream ecological water demand constraints and the requirements of the electronic grid in the system moreover the objective preferred by the decision maker only slightly influences the nexus results the proposed approaches including the water energy nexus diagram and its optimisation model are easily implemented and clearly visually illustrate the process of water and energy flow for every sector the results of our optimal nexus configuration in the case study not only demonstrate the sensitivity of the parameters and input variables but can also improve the understanding of the gap between current and optimal

stillwell et al 2011 shang et al 2016 al saidi and hefny 2018 the concepts of the nexus remain obscure wichelns 2017 saladini et al 2018 the prevailing understanding of the nexus concept is the interaction between the water and energy sectors lam et al 2017 moss et al 2017 in terms of the physical processes the energy and water sectors are closely connected moss et al 2017 energy consumption for water supply and wastewater treatment such as pumping processing and distribution mielke et al 2010 king et al 2013 as well as water consumption for producing energy such as hydropower carter 2010 endo et al 2015 moreover the turbine machine as an electric power generator or electric motor is often the specific form of the nexus however the nexus has also been defined as a process that allows for transitions and transformations across sectors howarth and monasterlo 2016 although the nexus involves exploring the direct parallel relationship between water and energy a substance or commodity by means of the complete supply chain and detailed process based evaluation is required to trace the energy and water flows separately in terms of the sectoral configuration chen and chen 2016 moreover in order to intertwine water and energy flows along international trade an energy water pathway nexus is proposed to identify the pair wise relationship between these duan and chen 2017 the process nexus consists not only of the transitions and transformations across the water and energy sectors but also other industry sectors through virtual water or indirect energy zimmermann 2001 hardy et al 2012 smajgl et al 2016 both water and energy are taken as the physical form of the nexus linking different sectors therefore the water energy nexus is considered as the nexus composed of water and energy directly and indirectly in this paper rather than the turbine machine and electric motor or other conversion technologies an integrative approach to water resources and energy management is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of the coupled natural human systems azhari and loudyi 2018 liu et al 2018 and the nexus approach has been taken into account owing to its linkages of different sectors siddiqi and anadon 2011 gwsp 2014 garcia and you 2016 but limited studies have been reported on quantifying and conceptualizing the relationships of nexus sectors based on water and energy flow zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019 and water quality issue referring to waste water treatment is often overlooked in the current water energy food nexus if the water and energy related systems are assumed to be represented as networks of nodes connections among them and boundary conditions inputs and outputs water and energy networks in these systems can be established used to determine which node is dominant and identify the water and energy relationship schramski et al 2006 li et al 2009 chen et al 2012 an element or component which will be represented as a node in the network in a system that consumes water or energy is treated as a sink and is taken as a source that can produce water or energy tsolas et al 2018 few of their water energy networks are conceptual network based on their physical and quantitative linkages owing to almost all sectors from the coupled natural human systems being related to water and energy the subsystems that are of most concern to the decision maker are also often studied separately a cascade reservoir system mainly composed of the water supplier wastewater treatment and reservoirs hydropower plants in a water basin is a typical water and energy network studies on this nexus have been done by the poor at the cascade reservoir scale jalilov et al 2018 terrapon pfaff et al 2018 therefore in this paper we focus on the water energy nexus in the cascade reservoir system and an integrated nexus approach with optimal cross sectoral coordination based on the conceptual water and energy network will be developed a more specific topic contained therein the conceptual and quantitative network representation of a water supply wastewater treatment hydropower generation for a cascade system and optimisation of the nexus toward minimising water shortages and maximising energy production to the external grid for integrated water resources and energy management the remainder of this paper is organised as follows the methodology for the representation and optimisation of the network of the water energy nexus in a cascade reservoir system is provided in section 2 the downstream of lancangjiang as our study area and dataset are introduced in section 3 in section 4 the results from the case studies study are discussed finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 network representation of water energy nexus for cascade reservoir system a cascade reservoir system can be divided into the water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation subsystems according to the water and energy flows these three subsystems interact with one another and form networks these networks are coupled because they comprise one or more processing nodes that exchange hydropower generation for water supply and wastewater treatment water supply for hydropower generation and wastewater treatment and wastewater treatment for water supply and hydropower generation the role of the water nexus is to extract water from the river as the external water resources input for the water supply and hydropower generation receive water from the water consumer for wastewater treatment receive water from wastewater treatment for hydropower generation and receive energy from hydropower generation plants for water supply and wastewater treatment the grid supplies and basin outlet are the nexus outputs taking a cascade reservoir system composed of six water supply agents wastewater treatment plants and six reservoirs as an example the notions and network of the nexus are illustrated in fig 1 the blue lines with arrows represent the water flow impacting the hydropower generation the black lines represent the wastewater transferred into the wastewater treatment plant the grey lines represent the treated water returned to the river and the red lines represent the energy network the water supply and wastewater treatment represent the energy consumption while the reservoirs represent the energy generation the water quality requirement in the river protection can be satisfied by waste treatment if sufficient energy is consumed water and energy flows exist in the networks both energy and water form the nexus of the water supply waste treatment and hydropower generation subsystems while the water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation are known as the nexus processing nodes these processing nodes can be further divided into water and energy sources or sinks table 1 a source receives an input and returns an output of the same type but of a greater quantity and or quality of water or energy a sink receives an input and returns an output of the same type but of lower quantity and or quality of water or energy a source can provide to multiple sinks and a sink can receive from multiple sources based on the water flow and energy network tsolas et al 2018 2 2 nexus optimisation for cascade reservoir system 2 2 1 water energy nexus diagram for cascade reservoir system three assumptions are made for the water energy nexus diagram of a cascade reservoir system as follows 1 the water supply obtains water from the reservoir upstream through energy consumption 2 wastewater treatment can clear the wastewater through energy consumption and no water loss occurs during the wastewater treatment process 3 as electric energy is formed in a grid all of the energy consumed in the region can be considered from hydropower generation if the amount of water supplied to water users is w the energy for extracting or pumping is expressed by f ws w the wastewater transported for treatment is denoted by αw where the parameter α is the coefficient of returned water the energy consumed by the wastewater treatment plant is determined by the amount of wastewater αw and target water quality c of the tail water and can be defined by fww αw c hydropower generation from the reservoir depends on the amount of water flow wr and rules of reservoir operation based on the characteristics ω and the amount of water is wr w 2 w αw according to the water balance equation the energy production is quantified as the hydropower generation function fr wr ω as the nexus of water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation are the water flow and energy flow and a 2d diagram can be constructed to illustrate the water and energy flows in the network based on the water energy diagram proposed by tsolas et al 2018 the cumulative water source is indicated by the x axis while the energy consumption is represented by the y axis the cumulative water source and energy consumption for every water supplier wastewater treatment and reservoir are presented in table 2 and can be represented by a diagram as illustrated in fig 2 the piecewise blue line represents the composite curve of the water supply the piecewise grey line represents the composite curve of the wastewater treatment and the piecewise red line represents the composite curve of the hydropower generation from the reservoir each composite curve consists of the contributions from individual sources or consumers for example the water supplier curve for the cascade reservoir system nexus the example employed in section 2 1 consists of six linear segments representing the six water suppliers a water source contributes to the positive x axis direction while a water sink contributes to the negative direction however an energy source contributes to the negative y axis direction while an energy sink contributes to the positive direction as the water supplier or the wastewater treatment is an energy sink from hydropower and a source for water from the river it is indicated by the blue or grey line in fig 2 the reservoir is a sink for water negative x axis direction and a source of energy positive y axis direction indicated by the red line in fig 2 according to the understanding of the concept of the water energy nexus in the introduction these three lines are the nexus of the water supplier wastewater treatment and reservoirs subsystems the slope of each linear segment of the water subsystem or energy subsystem curve indicates the energy consumption or production intensity of each water or energy source tsolas et al 2018 a steeper segment in grey and blue indicates greater energy consumption intensiveness of a water source for the water supplier and wastewater treatment plant moreover a steeper red line indicates greater energy production intensiveness of an energy source for the reservoir therefore the slopes reflect the efficiencies of the energy consumption of the water supplier wastewater treatment or production of the reservoir in the water energy nexus diagram the abscissa values of the water supplier and wastewater treatment curves blue and grey lines represent the total water production denoted by wi or wwi while their ordinate values represent the total energy requirements for all water suppliers and wastewater treatments denoted by ei or ewi the abscissa value of the energy production curve red line represents the total water consumption denoted by wri while its ordinate value represents the total energy production from all reservoirs denoted by eri as ww ew wr and er are not independent of one another and are related to w as indicated in table 2 the values of ei wwi ewi wri and eri vary with the value of w and are determined by the equations displayed in table 2 where i 6 the line shapes are also changed with the water supply and upstream water in the cascade reservoir system as an external input the amount of water production w from the water supplier varies with the water demand which is determined by the social economic development the amount of energy production from the reservoirs fluctuates with the inflow of the cascade reservoirs as boundary conditions therefore the lines representing the water energy nexus are dynamic with the water and energy production conditions and can be optimised under the maximisation objectives of water or energy production 2 2 2 water energy nexus optimisation the purpose of water and energy resource management is always to achieve the minimum energy consumption for the water supply and wastewater treatment or maximum water and energy production less water being supplied can lead to less wastewater being treated and also more water remaining in the river that can be converted to additional hydropower generation however more water supplied can increase the water production and then reduce water shortages but also leads to more energy consumption for the water supply and wastewater treatment and less water remaining in the reservoir for energy production furthermore the minimum water demands for domestic consumption industry agriculture and the environment should be satisfied for social stability and economic development the minimum probability of non failure of hydropower generation for the reservoir is often required in the reservoir operation the coefficients of energy consumers and producers are often found to differ in a cascade reservoir system therefore the nexus can be optimised by the objectives under the conditions of satisfying their constraints 1 objective functions i maximisation of net energy production 1 maximisation t e i 1 n f r w r i ω i i 1 n f ws w i ψ i 1 n f ww α i w i c i where fr fws and fww are the functions of hydropower generation in the ith reservoir or ith region based on the operation rules that is maintaining the water level at the upper limit to store as much water

is the second generation of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi objective optimisation problems srinivas and deb 1994 was developed to address computational complexity and provide an explicit mechanism for diversity preservation by deb et al 2000 2002 the nsga ii exhibits high performance and had been widely applied in the field of water resources engineering for example the design of water distribution networks atiquzzaman et al 2006 groundwater monitoring design reed and minsker 2004 watershed water quality management dorn and ranjithan 2003 calibration of hydrological models bekele and nicklow 2007 guo et al 2014 reservoir operation chang and chang 2009 and water allocation liu et al 2014 dai et al 2018 in order to evaluate the fitness functions based on the objective functions the initialised population with a size n the population represents the potential solutions wi is sent to the water and energy flow network simulation if all constraints are satisfied the solutions are then sorted according to the fast non dominated approach deb et al 2002 to identify the different pareto rank levels if the fitness values of two competing designs are equal the crowding distance of each individual is also calculated by the average euclidean distance in order to measure the closeness between an individual and its neighbours the generation reproduction based on binary tournament selection according to the rank and crowding distance is implemented to select the superior solutions among the existing population the selected population generates the offspring population by means of crossover and mutation operators this procedure will be continued for subsequent generations until the stopping criterion is met for further details on the nsga ii readers can refer to deb et al 2002 3 study area our study area is located in the middle and lower reaches of the lancangjiang river of the upper reaches of the mekong river in yunnan province china fig 3 six cascade reservoirs namely gongguoqiao xiaowan manwan dachaoshan nuozhadu and jinghong have been under operation in the area the total storage capacity of these six reservoirs is 42 96 billion m3 as indicated in table 3 the drainage area is 51 900 km2 from the gongguoqiao to jinghong reservoirs while the gongguoqiao reservoir has 97 200 km2 in its upstream reach the six cascade reservoirs are core components of the mainstream of the lancangjiang river hydropower base which is one of the 13 large hydropower bases in china at present zeng et al 2013 the study area exhibits a primarily subtropical climate with an annual precipitation ranging from 900 to 1700 mm the middle and lower reaches of the lancangjiang river cover six administrative prefectures or cities namely dali bai autonomous prefecture baoshan city lijiang city lincang city puer simao city and xishuanbana autonomous prefecture jinghong in yunnan province as the most developed area in the lancangjiang river basin over 85 of the total supplied water in the entire river basin has been utilised in our study area yunnan water conservation bureau 2010 furthermore the water flows through the outlet of the lancangjiang river basin and joins the mekong river as an international river and the water quantity and quality issues are of concern to the countries located downstream of the mekong river therefore it is significant to determine the water energy nexus for the water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation in this cascade reservoir system 4 results and discussion the study area is divided into six operational zones according the cascade reservoir distribution although agriculture is one of the most important sectors in water use most agricultural areas here are not irrigated by humans the returned water from agriculture is often directly discharged into rivers and no energy is found to been consumed however water demand from domesticity and industry often requires water to be pumped treated and distributed to every water user and the returned water is also transported to the sewage treatment plant to reduce contaminants before arriving at the river therefore a significant amount of energy should be provided for this water production process water demand in the six operational zones in future years 2020 and 2030 is presented in table 4 according the results from the comprehensive planning of water resources in yunnan province china gu and cui 2013 and water demand is assumed to be equal in every month for domesticity and industry sectors water demand for instream ecology was estimated by the tennant method indicated in table 4 the amount of wastewater discharged into the river is approximated by the coefficient method where the coefficient α is estimated by the quotient of discharged wastewater and supplied water from historical records yunnan water conservation bureau 2010 in order to simplify the description of the complex energy consumption during the water supply and wastewater treatment the coefficient method is also employed for these as one of the 13 large hydropower electricity bases in china zeng et al 2013 the electricity consumed in our study area is mainly dependent on hydropower moreover the energy consumption only results from hydropower energy generation according to the components of water cost prices in every operational zone and the electricity price the coefficients for the water supply and wastewater treatment energy consumption are determined by the energy cost in water prices divided by the electricity price indicated in table 4 in the proposed nsga ii for solving the water energy nexus optimisation model with multi objective functions the try and error method was adopted to determine the nsga ii parameters considering the convergence and its spread of the solution as criterion 2400 chromosomes more than 30 times number decision variables were generated using random sampling for 72 decision variables 6 variables per month and 12 months the objectives and constraints values were then computed using the equations from 1 to 2 and from 3 to 9 respectively the solutions 2400 chromosomes were then ranked by the fast non dominating sorting procedure through the elitism approach for speeding up the performance of the algorithm significantly and helping to prevent the loss of good solutions once they had been found all populations were compared with each other and the top 1000 chromosomes with better ranks were always selected to be the initial populations of parent solutions for nsga ii a maximum of 10 000 generations simulated binary crossover with a probability of 0 5 and polynomial mutation with a parameter distribution index of 20 and rate of 1 72 where 72 was the number of decision variables or chromosome length in the algorithm according to the nsga ii procedure the first front at the final generation which consisted of the non dominated solutions was considered as the pareto optimal front for the water and energy production objectives as the water energy nexus is influenced by the water demand and water flow as input boundary conditions we set three scenarios as indicated in table 5 scenario a represents the water demand in 2020 and the water inflow conditions in a very dry year the frequency is 99 in order to analyse the impact of increasing the water demand on the optimal results scenario b is set by adopting the water demand in 2030 and the water inflow conditions are the same as in scenario a scenario c is set for testing the effects of the water inflow on the nexus the optimal nexus model is formulated for monthly operation in our case study all the input and output of the model are also monthly and the values of objectives and their corresponding solutions in every month are summed to a year scale for the analysis discussion and implementation as there multi objectives exist in the water energy nexus optimisation problem its pareto optimal front consists of the non dominated solutions moreover the average value is analysed in our paper based on the optimal nexus model from eqs 1 9 the results are indicated by ① in table 6 and the optimal water supply is developed for every zone in order to analyse the effects of the water energy nexus model constraints on the water supply and energy production certain constraints in the optimal model are released for example the water demand for the ecology system in the stream indicated in eq 9 is released and its results are indicated by ② in table 6 furthermore ③ represents the optimal results from the water energy nexus model without the minimum requirement of hydropower generation for every hydropower generation plant indicated in eq 7 finally ④ represents the results from the model without the water demand for the stream ecology system and minimum requirement of hydropower generation as can be observed from table 6 the water supplies in zones i iii iv and vi were more stable than in zones ii and v owing to their water demand amounts increasing the water supply or demand in one zone and its standard deviation exhibits an increasing trend furthermore the total energy production is more stable than the water supply according the quotient of standard deviation and average often referred to as the coefficient of variation the water supply amount is increased significantly when the water demand increases as observed when comparing scenarios a and b the effect of increasing the water flow conditions on the water supply increase is not as strong as that when increasing the water demand conditions comparing scenarios a and c the main reason for this effect is the temporal distribution of the water flow as the water demand can easily be satisfied during the wet season for the large water inflow size even in the dry year p 99 the differences in the optimal water energy nexus results are mainly owing to the water inflow during the dry season however as illustrated in fig 4 no significant difference exists during the dry season from november to may in the following year while substantially more water inflow occurs in the wet season from june to october according the impacts of climate change on runoff in this study area high and concentrated runoff in wet seasons will increase and low but uniformly distributed runoff in dry seasons will decrease even though the annual runoff will increase in the future wen et al 2018 even the water inflow conditions increase under wet or flood scenarios e g p 75 at a year scale the optimal water energy nexus results are also mainly dependent on the water inflow during the dry season as a water demand constraint di exists in eq 8 the results from scenario b exhibit the most supplied water for the additional water demand in 2030 the installed capacity size of the hydropower generation nci is sufficiently large for the water inflow magnitude even for the wet season and the total energy production is mainly determined by the amount of water inflow during a year therefore we found that the highest energy production occurs in scenario c in general water supply consumes energy and water for energy production while the amount of water and energy consumed by wastewater treatment is dependent on the water supply amount therefore fewer water supplies will result in higher energy production as the water inflow conditions are the same for scenarios a and b more water supplied in scenario b less energy produced in scenario b shown in table 6 the differences in net energy production displayed in the pareto frontiers between scenarios a and b do not seem very large due to their same water inflow input but the differences between scenarios c and a or between scenarios c and b are large the differences can also be shown in the table 6 however the seemed little differences between scenarios a and b cannot be ignored on the one hand these little differences are mainly from the dry season energy supply is always required with high reliability as the water supply the hydropower as an adopter for the energy grid is always used for assuring the reliability on the other hand even 0 1 billion kwh net energy production from scenarios a ① and b ② in table 6 is really not small from the economic aspect if the electricity price is 0 1 dollar per kwh on average the prices of electricity from hydropower is often higher than average for its adaption of the peak demand there will be 10 million dollar per year in addition the hydropower generation controlled by reservoirs also affects the water supply if additional water is released for producing hydropower in the wet season for the high water head there could be a water shortage in the dry season moreover the water demand for industry and domesticity in every zone is not even distributed and the reservoir characteristics differ so the net energy production te and water shortages s exhibit interrelated conflict with one another the relationship between te and s from the pareto frontiers illustrated in fig 5 is positive indicating that increasing the water inflow scenario c can satisfy the lower water shortage and higher energy production fig 5 c however increasing the water demand can increase the water shortage and reduce the energy production at the same time comparing fig 5 a and b as the potential solutions were initiated by a stochastic process and required to be stratified by the model constraints the optimal results of the nexus from its pareto frontier are also affected by the constraint conditions if the constraint conditions of instream ecologic water demand di and firm power np are released or one is released the impacts are analysed in table 6 and fig 6 indicated by ② ③ and ④ if there is no instream ecologic water demand di or firm power constraint np the total water supply amount will be increased at the cost of the energy production in every scenario when additional water can be stored in the reservoir during the flood season more water will be supplied in the dry season or be released for hydropower generation if there are no np or di constraints however these two constraints are interrelated for example if the constraint di is satisfied that of np is also partially or totally satisfied and vice versa releasing one of these does not guarantee a lower water supply or total energy production than releasing both of them for example the results from scenario c furthermore the results of the water supply in regions ii and v with higher standard deviations are greater than the other four zones making the average results displayed in table 6 more unevenly distributed the relationship between te and s from the pareto frontiers based on the different constraints one two or none released are also presented in fig 6 the results from the nexus model without both the np and di constraints indicate a lower water shortage and less energy production in every scenarios indicated by ④ the results from the other three conditions are overlaid with one another indicated by ① ② and ③ the distribution range of the s and te is the largest in scenario c which is also consistent with the results in table 6 although the quantifiable relationship between the water supply and energy production based on the pareto frontier is highly useful for water resources managers the manner in which water and energy flow through the water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation sectors that is the water energy nexus is also significant for water resources and energy managers maximisation of the water and energy production in the pareto frontier for the multi objective problem is often the subject of focus zhai et al 2018 liu et al 2012 we will discuss the water energy nexus according to the diagram method introduced in fig 2 4 1 maximisation of water production or minimisation of water shortage in water energy nexus from multi objective optimisation the maximum values of water production or minimisation of water shortage on the pareto frontier for the water energy nexus were selected in the red solid rectangle box indicated in fig 5 their corresponding solutions are the amount of water supply wastewater treatment and energy consumption and production which are employed to obtain the water energy nexus diagram as illustrated in fig 7 as the values of water and energy production from supply or wastewater treatment differ substantially from those in hydropower generation plants reservoirs even when they are not in the same order of magnitude the water energy nexus diagram is separated into two figures one is for water supply and wastewater treatment while the other is for hydropower generation as the curve slope can indicate the energy consumption intensity for each water source indicated in fig 7 as a1 1 b1 1 and c1 1 every wastewater treatment has higher energy consumption intensity than every water supply moreover the highest slope among the six wastewater treatments is the vth one as the blue lines for the water supply resemble straight lines in fig 7 a1 1 b1 1 and c1 1 the slopes of the six water suppliers do not exhibit significant differences according to the process of determining the amount of energy consumption by water supply and wastewater treatment in our case study the coefficients for the energy consumed by the supplied water and by wastewater treatment as presented in table 4 are also the slopes of the curve lines indicated in fig 7 a1 1 b1 1 and c1 1 the ordinate values of the final wastewater treatment and water supply the vith one are the total energy consumptions while their corresponding abscissa values are the total water supply or water production for wastewater treatment the ordinate value of the vith wastewater treatment is higher than that of the vith water supplier even though its corresponding abscissa value is smaller this means that the energy consumed by wastewater treatment is higher than that of water supply however the amount of energy consumed by the water supply and wastewater treatment is very small compared to the energy production by the hydropower generation plants reservoirs fig 5 illustrates the maximisation of the water supply or production in the pareto frontier for the optimal multi objective water energy nexus problem where a significant amount of energy is generated even with the water demand increasing in 2030 under the very dry year indicated in fig 7 b1 2 the hydropower generation function fr is not only determined by the firm power and installed capacity of hydropower generation but also by the water head which is often dependent on the storage size three reservoir parameters namely the firm power installed capacity of hydropower generation and storage size are found to be largest in xiaowan reservoir ii and nuozhadu reservoir v from the table 3 and the hydropower generation efficiencies in the two reservoirs should be highest as the curve slopes in fig 7 a1 2 b1 2 and c1 2 represent the density or efficiency of energy production the slopes of reservoir ii xiaowan and v nuozhadu are also proven to be larger than the others the water energy nexus can provide cross sectoral connections in the form of water and energy the amount of water used for hydropower generation is substantially more than for water supply and wastewater treatment and the amount of energy produced by reservoirs is also more than the energy consumed by water supply and wastewater treatment however the efficiencies of energy production reservoirs slopes in fig 7 a1 2 b1 2 and c1 2 are lower than those of energy consumption for water supply and wastewater treatment particularly in the guoguoqiao manwan dachaoshan and jinghong reservoirs 4 2 maximisation of energy production in water energy nexus from multi objective optimisation the relationship between water shortage and energy production is positive while the relationship between water production for water supply and energy production is negative the maximisation values of the energy production in the pareto frontier of the water energy nexus in every scenario are selected in the red dashed elliptical box in fig 5 their corresponding water energy nexus diagrams are presented in fig 8 as the coefficients for energy consumed by supplied water and wastewater treatment are constants as indicated in table 4 in the optimal process the slopes of the water supply and wastewater treatment curves are the same in figs 7 and 8 the total amount of water production for water supply from the maximisation of water production is 41 64 million m3 for scenario a 44 62 million m3 for scenario b and 31 44 million m3 for scenario c which is more than that from the maximisation of energy production on the pareto frontier the water inflow from scenario c is higher than in the other two scenarios more water can be supplied or produced and the amount of water supply is relatively low fluctuating with the objective selection the water produced from wastewater treatment and the energy consumed by water supply and wastewater treatment are also lower based on the linear relationships illustrated in fig 9 the total differences in energy production from hydropower generation according to the two results on the pareto frontier are 81 19 million kwh for scenario a 80 30 million kwh for scenario b and 80 24 million kwh for scenario c these incremental energy amounts account for one third of the energy consumption by both water supply and wastewater treatment however incremental energy is gained at the cost of water supply production as there are no negative values in fig 9 every water production in the water supply and wastewater treatment when the maximum values of the water production are selected is higher than that obtained by selecting the maximum values of water production moreover the energy production from selecting the maximum values of energy production is higher than that from the maximum values of water production therefore the differences illustrated in fig 9 can aid decision makers and stakeholders in water energy management by means of these cross sectoral connections 5 conclusion in this paper we have developed an optimal water energy nexus model based on its diagram for a cascade reservoir system the nsga ii algorithm is employed to solve the optimal model taking the middle and lower reaches of the lancangjiang river basin as a case study both the water demand and inflow as the external and boundary conditions can affect the water energy nexus results the incremental water demand can increase the water supply while the incremental water inflow mainly increases the hydropower generation owing to the water inflow distribution therefore in order to match the water demand requirement for water supply or hydropower generation the water storage capacity is important for high water supply assurance and efficient energy production the sensitivities of the instream ecological water demand and firm power constraints are also analysed as the two constraints are interrelated only releasing both of them ensures an increased water supply at the cost of energy reduction in order to understand the water and energy flow cross sectors the water energy nexus is presented in the form of diagram water supply is taken as an energy and water sink but waste source while wastewater treatment is taken as an energy and waste sink but water source the reservoir for hydropower generation is considered as a water sink and energy source then a network representation of the water energy nexus in a cascade reservoir system can be obtained the optimal water energy nexus diagram is drawn based on the network representation and optimal results the wastewater treatment is a high energy consumption sector and the curve slopes are steeper than those of the other sectors the reservoir curve slope reflects the efficiency of the hydropower generation and reservoirs with larger storage sizes are found to have higher slopes the results from the pareto frontier for the water energy nexus according to the maximisation of the objectives demonstrate that the preferred objective can slightly influence the nexus results that is when maximising the water production the water supply amount in every zone is greater than that when maximising the energy production and vice versa although water supply and wastewater treatment consume energy these accounts for a small percentage of the total energy production from cascade reservoirs and most of the energy is transferred to the external grid system our case study cascade reservoir system is worth one of the 13 large hydropower bases in china at present the example and our case study for illustrating the proposed model refer to six operational zones and reservoirs but it is adaptive for the reader to add or reduce these according to the network representation in their research area even the coefficients for energy consumed by supplied water and wastewater treatment may vary with the type of instruments or amount of supplied or treatment water these are constant in our case study the results from the optimal water energy nexus still clearly visually illustrates the process of water and energy flows and their cross connections between every sector which can improve the understanding of the gap between current and optimal situations declaration of interest statement the authors

wastewater treatment and hydropower generation sectors in a cascade reservoir system in order to quantify interactions of the nexus a novel diagram according to water and energy flow in every sector was proposed in this paper and an optimal water energy nexus model was also developed for the efficiently and effectively cross sectoral coordinating the diagram based on the water and energy flow conceptual network according to our case study in the middle lower lancangjiang river basin the nexus varies with the external water demand water inflow conditions instream ecological water demand constraints and the requirements of the electronic grid in the system moreover the objective preferred by the decision maker only slightly influences the nexus results the proposed approaches including the water energy nexus diagram and its optimisation model are easily implemented and clearly visually illustrate the process of water and energy flow for every sector the results of our optimal nexus configuration in the case study not only demonstrate the sensitivity of the parameters and input variables but can also improve the understanding of the gap between current and optimal situations keywords water energy nexus optimisation water energy diagram cascade reservoir system nsga ii 1 introduction water and energy are two of the most basic resources for the preservation of life and social economic development ziogou and zachariadis 2017 azhari and loudyi 2018 increasing demands owing to significant population growth and rapid urbanization and inherent interactions of water and energy have led to an important field of research on the water energy nexus olsson 2012 he et al 2018 since the bonn 2011 conference on the water energy and food security nexus solutions for the green economy hoff 2011 scott et al 2011 the aim of the water energy nexus is to improve system efficiency and performance and pursue sustainability through holistic understanding and management of resources cai et al 2018 although there has been increasing interest in investigating the water energy nexus at the project urban country region and global scales in water and energy planning stillwell et al 2011 shang et al 2016 al saidi and hefny 2018 the concepts of the nexus remain obscure wichelns 2017 saladini et al 2018 the prevailing understanding of the nexus concept is the interaction between the water and energy sectors lam et al 2017 moss et al 2017 in terms of the physical processes the energy and water sectors are closely connected moss et al 2017 energy consumption for water supply and wastewater treatment such as pumping processing and distribution mielke et al 2010 king et al 2013 as well as water consumption for producing energy such as hydropower carter 2010 endo et al 2015 moreover the turbine machine as an electric power generator or electric motor is often the specific form of the nexus however the nexus has also been defined as a process that allows for transitions and transformations across sectors howarth and monasterlo 2016 although the nexus involves exploring the direct parallel relationship between water and energy a substance or commodity by means of the complete supply chain and detailed process based evaluation is required to trace the energy and water flows separately in terms of the sectoral configuration chen and chen 2016 moreover in order to intertwine water and energy flows along international trade an energy water pathway nexus is proposed to identify the pair wise relationship between these duan and chen 2017 the process nexus consists not only of the transitions and transformations across the water and energy sectors but also other industry sectors through virtual water or indirect energy zimmermann 2001 hardy et al 2012 smajgl et al 2016 both water and energy are taken as the physical form of the nexus linking different sectors therefore the water energy nexus is considered as the nexus composed of water and energy directly and indirectly in this paper rather than the turbine machine and electric motor or other conversion technologies an integrative approach to water resources and energy management is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of the coupled natural human systems azhari and loudyi 2018 liu et al 2018 and the nexus approach has been taken into account owing to its linkages of different sectors siddiqi and anadon 2011 gwsp 2014 garcia and you 2016 but limited studies have been reported on quantifying and conceptualizing the relationships of nexus sectors based on water and energy flow zhang et al 2018 li et al 2019 and water quality issue referring to waste water treatment is often overlooked in the current water energy food nexus if the water and energy related systems are assumed to be represented as networks of nodes connections among them and boundary conditions inputs and outputs water and energy networks in these systems can be established used to determine which node is dominant and identify the water and energy relationship schramski et al 2006 li et al 2009 chen et al 2012 an element or component which will be represented as a node in the network in a system that consumes water or energy is treated as a sink and is taken as a source that can produce water or energy tsolas et al 2018 few of their water energy networks are conceptual network based on their physical and quantitative linkages owing to almost all sectors from the coupled natural human systems being related to water and energy the subsystems that are of most concern to the decision maker are also often studied separately a cascade reservoir system mainly composed of the water supplier wastewater treatment and reservoirs hydropower plants in a water basin is a typical water and energy network studies on this nexus have been done by the poor at the cascade reservoir scale jalilov et al 2018 terrapon pfaff et al 2018 therefore in this paper we focus on the water energy nexus in the cascade reservoir system and an integrated nexus approach with optimal cross sectoral coordination based on the conceptual water and energy network will be developed a more specific topic contained therein the conceptual and quantitative network representation of a water supply wastewater treatment hydropower generation for a cascade system and optimisation of the nexus toward minimising water shortages and maximising energy production to the external grid for integrated water resources and energy management the remainder of this paper is organised as follows the methodology for the representation and optimisation of the network of the water energy nexus in a cascade reservoir system is provided in section 2 the downstream of lancangjiang as our study area and dataset are introduced in section 3 in section 4 the results from the case studies study are discussed finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 network representation of water energy nexus for cascade reservoir system a cascade reservoir system can be divided into the water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation subsystems according to the water and energy flows these three subsystems interact with one another and form networks these networks are coupled because they comprise one or more processing nodes that exchange hydropower generation for water supply and wastewater treatment water supply for hydropower generation and wastewater treatment and wastewater treatment for water supply and hydropower generation the role of the water nexus is to extract water from the river as the external water resources input for the water supply and hydropower generation receive water from the water consumer for wastewater treatment receive water from wastewater treatment for hydropower generation and receive energy from hydropower generation plants for water supply and wastewater treatment the grid supplies and basin outlet are the nexus outputs taking a cascade reservoir system composed of six water supply agents wastewater treatment plants and six reservoirs as an example the notions and network of the nexus are illustrated in fig 1 the blue lines with arrows represent the water flow impacting the hydropower generation the black lines represent the wastewater transferred into the wastewater treatment plant the grey lines represent the treated water returned to the river and the red lines represent the energy network the water supply and wastewater treatment represent the energy consumption while the reservoirs represent the energy generation the water quality requirement in the river protection can be satisfied by waste treatment if sufficient energy is consumed water and energy flows exist in the networks both energy and water form the nexus of the water supply waste treatment and hydropower generation subsystems while the water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation are known as the nexus processing nodes these processing nodes can be further divided into water and energy sources or sinks table 1 a source receives an input and returns an output of the same type but of a greater quantity and or quality of water or energy a sink receives an input and returns an output of the same type but of lower quantity and or quality of water or energy a source can provide to multiple sinks and a sink can receive from multiple sources based on the water flow and energy network tsolas et al 2018 2 2 nexus optimisation for cascade reservoir system 2 2 1 water energy nexus diagram for cascade reservoir system three assumptions are made for the water energy nexus diagram of a cascade reservoir system as follows 1 the water supply obtains water from the reservoir upstream through energy consumption 2 wastewater treatment can clear the wastewater through energy consumption and no water loss occurs during the wastewater treatment process 3 as electric energy is formed in a grid all of the energy consumed in the region can be considered from hydropower generation if the amount of water supplied to water users is w the energy for extracting or pumping is expressed by f ws w the wastewater transported for treatment is denoted by αw where the parameter α is the coefficient of returned water the energy consumed by the wastewater treatment plant is determined by the amount of wastewater αw and target water quality c of the tail water and can be defined by fww αw c hydropower generation from the reservoir depends on the amount of water flow wr and rules of reservoir operation based on the characteristics ω and the amount of water is wr w 2 w αw according to the water balance equation the energy production is quantified as the hydropower generation function fr wr ω as the nexus of water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation are the water flow and energy flow and a 2d diagram can be constructed to illustrate the water and energy flows in the network based on the water energy diagram proposed by tsolas et al 2018 the cumulative water source is indicated by the x axis while the energy consumption is represented by the y axis the cumulative water source and energy consumption for every water supplier wastewater treatment and reservoir are presented in table 2 and can be represented by a diagram as illustrated in fig 2 the piecewise blue line represents the composite curve of the water supply the piecewise grey line represents the composite curve of the wastewater treatment and the piecewise red line represents the composite curve of the hydropower generation from the reservoir each composite curve consists of the contributions from individual sources or consumers for example the water supplier curve for the cascade reservoir system nexus the example employed in section 2 1 consists of six linear segments representing the six water suppliers a water source contributes to the positive x axis direction while a water sink contributes to the negative direction however an energy source contributes to the negative y axis direction while an energy sink contributes to the positive direction as the water supplier or the wastewater treatment is an energy sink from hydropower and a source for water from the river it is indicated by the blue or grey line in fig 2 the reservoir is a sink for water negative x axis direction and a source of energy positive y axis direction indicated by the red line in fig 2 according to the understanding of the concept of the water energy nexus in the introduction these three lines are the nexus of the water supplier wastewater treatment and reservoirs subsystems the slope of each linear segment of the water subsystem or energy subsystem curve indicates the energy consumption or production intensity of each water or energy source tsolas et al 2018 a steeper segment in grey and blue indicates greater energy consumption intensiveness of a water source for the water supplier and wastewater treatment plant moreover a steeper red line indicates greater energy production intensiveness of an energy source for the reservoir therefore the slopes reflect the efficiencies of the energy consumption of the water supplier wastewater treatment or production of the reservoir in the water energy nexus diagram the abscissa values of the water supplier and wastewater treatment curves blue and grey lines represent the total water production denoted by wi or wwi while their ordinate values represent the total energy requirements for all water suppliers and wastewater treatments denoted by ei or ewi the abscissa value of the energy production curve red line represents the total water consumption denoted by wri while its ordinate value represents the total energy production from all reservoirs denoted by eri as ww ew wr and er are not independent of one another and are related to w as indicated in table 2 the values of ei wwi ewi wri and eri vary with the value of w and are determined by the equations displayed in table 2 where i 6 the line shapes are also changed with the water supply and upstream water in the cascade reservoir system as an external input the amount of water production w from the water supplier varies with the water demand which is determined by the social economic development the amount of energy production from the reservoirs fluctuates with the inflow of the cascade reservoirs as boundary conditions therefore the lines representing the water energy nexus are dynamic with the water and energy production conditions and can be optimised under the maximisation objectives of water or energy production 2 2 2 water energy nexus optimisation the purpose of water and energy resource management is always to achieve the minimum energy consumption for the water supply and wastewater treatment or maximum water and energy production less water being supplied can lead to less wastewater being treated and also more water remaining in the river that can be converted to additional hydropower generation however more water supplied can increase the water production and then reduce water shortages but also leads to more energy consumption for the water supply and wastewater treatment and less water remaining in the reservoir for energy production furthermore the minimum water demands for domestic consumption industry agriculture and the environment should be satisfied for social stability and economic development the minimum probability of non failure of hydropower generation for the reservoir is often required in the reservoir operation the coefficients of energy consumers and producers are often found to differ in a cascade reservoir system therefore the nexus can be optimised by the objectives under the conditions of satisfying their constraints 1 objective functions i maximisation of net energy production 1 maximisation t e i 1 n f r w r i ω i i 1 n f ws w i ψ i 1 n f ww α i w i c i where fr fws and fww are the functions of hydropower generation in the ith reservoir or ith region based on the operation rules that is maintaining the water level at the upper limit to store as much water

is the second generation of the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm for multi objective optimisation problems srinivas and deb 1994 was developed to address computational complexity and provide an explicit mechanism for diversity preservation by deb et al 2000 2002 the nsga ii exhibits high performance and had been widely applied in the field of water resources engineering for example the design of water distribution networks atiquzzaman et al 2006 groundwater monitoring design reed and minsker 2004 watershed water quality management dorn and ranjithan 2003 calibration of hydrological models bekele and nicklow 2007 guo et al 2014 reservoir operation chang and chang 2009 and water allocation liu et al 2014 dai et al 2018 in order to evaluate the fitness functions based on the objective functions the initialised population with a size n the population represents the potential solutions wi is sent to the water and energy flow network simulation if all constraints are satisfied the solutions are then sorted according to the fast non dominated approach deb et al 2002 to identify the different pareto rank levels if the fitness values of two competing designs are equal the crowding distance of each individual is also calculated by the average euclidean distance in order to measure the closeness between an individual and its neighbours the generation reproduction based on binary tournament selection according to the rank and crowding distance is implemented to select the superior solutions among the existing population the selected population generates the offspring population by means of crossover and mutation operators this procedure will be continued for subsequent generations until the stopping criterion is met for further details on the nsga ii readers can refer to deb et al 2002 3 study area our study area is located in the middle and lower reaches of the lancangjiang river of the upper reaches of the mekong river in yunnan province china fig 3 six cascade reservoirs namely gongguoqiao xiaowan manwan dachaoshan nuozhadu and jinghong have been under operation in the area the total storage capacity of these six reservoirs is 42 96 billion m3 as indicated in table 3 the drainage area is 51 900 km2 from the gongguoqiao to jinghong reservoirs while the gongguoqiao reservoir has 97 200 km2 in its upstream reach the six cascade reservoirs are core components of the mainstream of the lancangjiang river hydropower base which is one of the 13 large hydropower bases in china at present zeng et al 2013 the study area exhibits a primarily subtropical climate with an annual precipitation ranging from 900 to 1700 mm the middle and lower reaches of the lancangjiang river cover six administrative prefectures or cities namely dali bai autonomous prefecture baoshan city lijiang city lincang city puer simao city and xishuanbana autonomous prefecture jinghong in yunnan province as the most developed area in the lancangjiang river basin over 85 of the total supplied water in the entire river basin has been utilised in our study area yunnan water conservation bureau 2010 furthermore the water flows through the outlet of the lancangjiang river basin and joins the mekong river as an international river and the water quantity and quality issues are of concern to the countries located downstream of the mekong river therefore it is significant to determine the water energy nexus for the water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation in this cascade reservoir system 4 results and discussion the study area is divided into six operational zones according the cascade reservoir distribution although agriculture is one of the most important sectors in water use most agricultural areas here are not irrigated by humans the returned water from agriculture is often directly discharged into rivers and no energy is found to been consumed however water demand from domesticity and industry often requires water to be pumped treated and distributed to every water user and the returned water is also transported to the sewage treatment plant to reduce contaminants before arriving at the river therefore a significant amount of energy should be provided for this water production process water demand in the six operational zones in future years 2020 and 2030 is presented in table 4 according the results from the comprehensive planning of water resources in yunnan province china gu and cui 2013 and water demand is assumed to be equal in every month for domesticity and industry sectors water demand for instream ecology was estimated by the tennant method indicated in table 4 the amount of wastewater discharged into the river is approximated by the coefficient method where the coefficient α is estimated by the quotient of discharged wastewater and supplied water from historical records yunnan water conservation bureau 2010 in order to simplify the description of the complex energy consumption during the water supply and wastewater treatment the coefficient method is also employed for these as one of the 13 large hydropower electricity bases in china zeng et al 2013 the electricity consumed in our study area is mainly dependent on hydropower moreover the energy consumption only results from hydropower energy generation according to the components of water cost prices in every operational zone and the electricity price the coefficients for the water supply and wastewater treatment energy consumption are determined by the energy cost in water prices divided by the electricity price indicated in table 4 in the proposed nsga ii for solving the water energy nexus optimisation model with multi objective functions the try and error method was adopted to determine the nsga ii parameters considering the convergence and its spread of the solution as criterion 2400 chromosomes more than 30 times number decision variables were generated using random sampling for 72 decision variables 6 variables per month and 12 months the objectives and constraints values were then computed using the equations from 1 to 2 and from 3 to 9 respectively the solutions 2400 chromosomes were then ranked by the fast non dominating sorting procedure through the elitism approach for speeding up the performance of the algorithm significantly and helping to prevent the loss of good solutions once they had been found all populations were compared with each other and the top 1000 chromosomes with better ranks were always selected to be the initial populations of parent solutions for nsga ii a maximum of 10 000 generations simulated binary crossover with a probability of 0 5 and polynomial mutation with a parameter distribution index of 20 and rate of 1 72 where 72 was the number of decision variables or chromosome length in the algorithm according to the nsga ii procedure the first front at the final generation which consisted of the non dominated solutions was considered as the pareto optimal front for the water and energy production objectives as the water energy nexus is influenced by the water demand and water flow as input boundary conditions we set three scenarios as indicated in table 5 scenario a represents the water demand in 2020 and the water inflow conditions in a very dry year the frequency is 99 in order to analyse the impact of increasing the water demand on the optimal results scenario b is set by adopting the water demand in 2030 and the water inflow conditions are the same as in scenario a scenario c is set for testing the effects of the water inflow on the nexus the optimal nexus model is formulated for monthly operation in our case study all the input and output of the model are also monthly and the values of objectives and their corresponding solutions in every month are summed to a year scale for the analysis discussion and implementation as there multi objectives exist in the water energy nexus optimisation problem its pareto optimal front consists of the non dominated solutions moreover the average value is analysed in our paper based on the optimal nexus model from eqs 1 9 the results are indicated by ① in table 6 and the optimal water supply is developed for every zone in order to analyse the effects of the water energy nexus model constraints on the water supply and energy production certain constraints in the optimal model are released for example the water demand for the ecology system in the stream indicated in eq 9 is released and its results are indicated by ② in table 6 furthermore ③ represents the optimal results from the water energy nexus model without the minimum requirement of hydropower generation for every hydropower generation plant indicated in eq 7 finally ④ represents the results from the model without the water demand for the stream ecology system and minimum requirement of hydropower generation as can be observed from table 6 the water supplies in zones i iii iv and vi were more stable than in zones ii and v owing to their water demand amounts increasing the water supply or demand in one zone and its standard deviation exhibits an increasing trend furthermore the total energy production is more stable than the water supply according the quotient of standard deviation and average often referred to as the coefficient of variation the water supply amount is increased significantly when the water demand increases as observed when comparing scenarios a and b the effect of increasing the water flow conditions on the water supply increase is not as strong as that when increasing the water demand conditions comparing scenarios a and c the main reason for this effect is the temporal distribution of the water flow as the water demand can easily be satisfied during the wet season for the large water inflow size even in the dry year p 99 the differences in the optimal water energy nexus results are mainly owing to the water inflow during the dry season however as illustrated in fig 4 no significant difference exists during the dry season from november to may in the following year while substantially more water inflow occurs in the wet season from june to october according the impacts of climate change on runoff in this study area high and concentrated runoff in wet seasons will increase and low but uniformly distributed runoff in dry seasons will decrease even though the annual runoff will increase in the future wen et al 2018 even the water inflow conditions increase under wet or flood scenarios e g p 75 at a year scale the optimal water energy nexus results are also mainly dependent on the water inflow during the dry season as a water demand constraint di exists in eq 8 the results from scenario b exhibit the most supplied water for the additional water demand in 2030 the installed capacity size of the hydropower generation nci is sufficiently large for the water inflow magnitude even for the wet season and the total energy production is mainly determined by the amount of water inflow during a year therefore we found that the highest energy production occurs in scenario c in general water supply consumes energy and water for energy production while the amount of water and energy consumed by wastewater treatment is dependent on the water supply amount therefore fewer water supplies will result in higher energy production as the water inflow conditions are the same for scenarios a and b more water supplied in scenario b less energy produced in scenario b shown in table 6 the differences in net energy production displayed in the pareto frontiers between scenarios a and b do not seem very large due to their same water inflow input but the differences between scenarios c and a or between scenarios c and b are large the differences can also be shown in the table 6 however the seemed little differences between scenarios a and b cannot be ignored on the one hand these little differences are mainly from the dry season energy supply is always required with high reliability as the water supply the hydropower as an adopter for the energy grid is always used for assuring the reliability on the other hand even 0 1 billion kwh net energy production from scenarios a ① and b ② in table 6 is really not small from the economic aspect if the electricity price is 0 1 dollar per kwh on average the prices of electricity from hydropower is often higher than average for its adaption of the peak demand there will be 10 million dollar per year in addition the hydropower generation controlled by reservoirs also affects the water supply if additional water is released for producing hydropower in the wet season for the high water head there could be a water shortage in the dry season moreover the water demand for industry and domesticity in every zone is not even distributed and the reservoir characteristics differ so the net energy production te and water shortages s exhibit interrelated conflict with one another the relationship between te and s from the pareto frontiers illustrated in fig 5 is positive indicating that increasing the water inflow scenario c can satisfy the lower water shortage and higher energy production fig 5 c however increasing the water demand can increase the water shortage and reduce the energy production at the same time comparing fig 5 a and b as the potential solutions were initiated by a stochastic process and required to be stratified by the model constraints the optimal results of the nexus from its pareto frontier are also affected by the constraint conditions if the constraint conditions of instream ecologic water demand di and firm power np are released or one is released the impacts are analysed in table 6 and fig 6 indicated by ② ③ and ④ if there is no instream ecologic water demand di or firm power constraint np the total water supply amount will be increased at the cost of the energy production in every scenario when additional water can be stored in the reservoir during the flood season more water will be supplied in the dry season or be released for hydropower generation if there are no np or di constraints however these two constraints are interrelated for example if the constraint di is satisfied that of np is also partially or totally satisfied and vice versa releasing one of these does not guarantee a lower water supply or total energy production than releasing both of them for example the results from scenario c furthermore the results of the water supply in regions ii and v with higher standard deviations are greater than the other four zones making the average results displayed in table 6 more unevenly distributed the relationship between te and s from the pareto frontiers based on the different constraints one two or none released are also presented in fig 6 the results from the nexus model without both the np and di constraints indicate a lower water shortage and less energy production in every scenarios indicated by ④ the results from the other three conditions are overlaid with one another indicated by ① ② and ③ the distribution range of the s and te is the largest in scenario c which is also consistent with the results in table 6 although the quantifiable relationship between the water supply and energy production based on the pareto frontier is highly useful for water resources managers the manner in which water and energy flow through the water supply wastewater treatment and hydropower generation sectors that is the water energy nexus is also significant for water resources and energy managers maximisation of the water and energy production in the pareto frontier for the multi objective problem is often the subject of focus zhai et al 2018 liu et al 2012 we will discuss the water energy nexus according to the diagram method introduced in fig 2 4 1 maximisation of water production or minimisation of water shortage in water energy nexus from multi objective optimisation the maximum values of water production or minimisation of water shortage on the pareto frontier for the water energy nexus were selected in the red solid rectangle box indicated in fig 5 their corresponding solutions are the amount of water supply wastewater treatment and energy consumption and production which are employed to obtain the water energy nexus diagram as illustrated in fig 7 as the values of water and energy production from supply or wastewater treatment differ substantially from those in hydropower generation plants reservoirs even when they are not in the same order of magnitude the water energy nexus diagram is separated into two figures one is for water supply and wastewater treatment while the other is for hydropower generation as the curve slope can indicate the energy consumption intensity for each water source indicated in fig 7 as a1 1 b1 1 and c1 1 every wastewater treatment has higher energy consumption intensity than every water supply moreover the highest slope among the six wastewater treatments is the vth one as the blue lines for the water supply resemble straight lines in fig 7 a1 1 b1 1 and c1 1 the slopes of the six water suppliers do not exhibit significant differences according to the process of determining the amount of energy consumption by water supply and wastewater treatment in our case study the coefficients for the energy consumed by the supplied water and by wastewater treatment as presented in table 4 are also the slopes of the curve lines indicated in fig 7 a1 1 b1 1 and c1 1 the ordinate values of the final wastewater treatment and water supply the vith one are the total energy consumptions while their corresponding abscissa values are the total water supply or water production for wastewater treatment the ordinate value of the vith wastewater treatment is higher than that of the vith water supplier even though its corresponding abscissa value is smaller this means that the energy consumed by wastewater treatment is higher than that of water supply however the amount of energy consumed by the water supply and wastewater treatment is very small compared to the energy production by the hydropower generation plants reservoirs fig 5 illustrates the maximisation of the water supply or production in the pareto frontier for the optimal multi objective water energy nexus problem where a significant amount of energy is generated even with the water demand increasing in 2030 under the very dry year indicated in fig 7 b1 2 the hydropower generation function fr is not only determined by the firm power and installed capacity of hydropower generation but also by the water head which is often dependent on the storage size three reservoir parameters namely the firm power installed capacity of hydropower generation and storage size are found to be largest in xiaowan reservoir ii and nuozhadu reservoir v from the table 3 and the hydropower generation efficiencies in the two reservoirs should be highest as the curve slopes in fig 7 a1 2 b1 2 and c1 2 represent the density or efficiency of energy production the slopes of reservoir ii xiaowan and v nuozhadu are also proven to be larger than the others the water energy nexus can provide cross sectoral connections in the form of water and energy the amount of water used for hydropower generation is substantially more than for water supply and wastewater treatment and the amount of energy produced by reservoirs is also more than the energy consumed by water supply and wastewater treatment however the efficiencies of energy production reservoirs slopes in fig 7 a1 2 b1 2 and c1 2 are lower than those of energy consumption for water supply and wastewater treatment particularly in the guoguoqiao manwan dachaoshan and jinghong reservoirs 4 2 maximisation of energy production in water energy nexus from multi objective optimisation the relationship between water shortage and energy production is positive while the relationship between water production for water supply and energy production is negative the maximisation values of the energy production in the pareto frontier of the water energy nexus in every scenario are selected in the red dashed elliptical box in fig 5 their corresponding water energy nexus diagrams are presented in fig 8 as the coefficients for energy consumed by supplied water and wastewater treatment are constants as indicated in table 4 in the optimal process the slopes of the water supply and wastewater treatment curves are the same in figs 7 and 8 the total amount of water production for water supply from the maximisation of water production is 41 64 million m3 for scenario a 44 62 million m3 for scenario b and 31 44 million m3 for scenario c which is more than that from the maximisation of energy production on the pareto frontier the water inflow from scenario c is higher than in the other two scenarios more water can be supplied or produced and the amount of water supply is relatively low fluctuating with the objective selection the water produced from wastewater treatment and the energy consumed by water supply and wastewater treatment are also lower based on the linear relationships illustrated in fig 9 the total differences in energy production from hydropower generation according to the two results on the pareto frontier are 81 19 million kwh for scenario a 80 30 million kwh for scenario b and 80 24 million kwh for scenario c these incremental energy amounts account for one third of the energy consumption by both water supply and wastewater treatment however incremental energy is gained at the cost of water supply production as there are no negative values in fig 9 every water production in the water supply and wastewater treatment when the maximum values of the water production are selected is higher than that obtained by selecting the maximum values of water production moreover the energy production from selecting the maximum values of energy production is higher than that from the maximum values of water production therefore the differences illustrated in fig 9 can aid decision makers and stakeholders in water energy management by means of these cross sectoral connections 5 conclusion in this paper we have developed an optimal water energy nexus model based on its diagram for a cascade reservoir system the nsga ii algorithm is employed to solve the optimal model taking the middle and lower reaches of the lancangjiang river basin as a case study both the water demand and inflow as the external and boundary conditions can affect the water energy nexus results the incremental water demand can increase the water supply while the incremental water inflow mainly increases the hydropower generation owing to the water inflow distribution therefore in order to match the water demand requirement for water supply or hydropower generation the water storage capacity is important for high water supply assurance and efficient energy production the sensitivities of the instream ecological water demand and firm power constraints are also analysed as the two constraints are interrelated only releasing both of them ensures an increased water supply at the cost of energy reduction in order to understand the water and energy flow cross sectors the water energy nexus is presented in the form of diagram water supply is taken as an energy and water sink but waste source while wastewater treatment is taken as an energy and waste sink but water source the reservoir for hydropower generation is considered as a water sink and energy source then a network representation of the water energy nexus in a cascade reservoir system can be obtained the optimal water energy nexus diagram is drawn based on the network representation and optimal results the wastewater treatment is a high energy consumption sector and the curve slopes are steeper than those of the other sectors the reservoir curve slope reflects the efficiency of the hydropower generation and reservoirs with larger storage sizes are found to have higher slopes the results from the pareto frontier for the water energy nexus according to the maximisation of the objectives demonstrate that the preferred objective can slightly influence the nexus results that is when maximising the water production the water supply amount in every zone is greater than that when maximising the energy production and vice versa although water supply and wastewater treatment consume energy these accounts for a small percentage of the total energy production from cascade reservoirs and most of the energy is transferred to the external grid system our case study cascade reservoir system is worth one of the 13 large hydropower bases in china at present the example and our case study for illustrating the proposed model refer to six operational zones and reservoirs but it is adaptive for the reader to add or reduce these according to the network representation in their research area even the coefficients for energy consumed by supplied water and wastewater treatment may vary with the type of instruments or amount of supplied or treatment water these are constant in our case study the results from the optimal water energy nexus still clearly visually illustrates the process of water and energy flows and their cross connections between every sector which can improve the understanding of the gap between current and optimal situations declaration of interest statement the authors

6764,climatic warming has resulted in permafrost degradation and it is expected to alter the hydrological processes and hydraulic connectivity on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp some important and pending issues for understanding the hydrological processes in permafrost regions are how much melting water from thawing permafrost can feed the stream water and how the hydraulic connectivities will be altered under continual permafrost degradation in this study the source area of the yellow river locating on the northeast qtp was studied by using stable isotopic method and field hydrological observation results exhibited significant seasonal hydrological variations of stream water thermokarst lakes and ground ice hydrograph separation suggested that precipitation is the main contributor to stream water in ice free months accounting for 53 5 and 52 2 of the streams on average for the two branches respectively the second source is springs which contributed about 29 8 and 17 9 however the recharge from melting ice is also important it exported an average of 16 7 and 13 2 to the surface stream conceptual model and stable isotopes emphasized the remarkable hydraulic connectivities between the precipitation stream water thermokarst lakes spring and the near surface ground ice current findings provide a basic understanding of the log term hydrological processes under permafrost degradation and can offer an efficient way to assess future hydrological changes and water resource protection keywords permafrost hydrology hydraulic connectivities stable isotopes ground ice source

cryosphere rüggeberg et al 2008 permafrost has significantly altered the hydrothermal conditions runoff generation processes and hydrological cycles in cold regions liljedahl et al 2016 over the past 10 years permafrost has degraded substantially due to global warming ipcc 2014 permafrost degradation deepened the active layers increased the talik areas and melted the underground ice lawrence and slater 2005 wu and zhang 2010 degrading permafrost not only influenced the surface runoff and flow pathway of the suprapermafrost water yang et al 2011 quinton and baltzer 2013 rogger et al 2017 it also altered the recharge patterns and amounts of permafrost melting water sent to surface runoff cheng and jin 2013 zhang et al 2013 previous studies in high latitude regions have indicated that permafrost thaw has altered the hydrological connectivity connon et al 2014 influenced the stable isotopic hydrology in surface waters ala aho et al 2018a b and enhanced the recharge of sub permafrost water to surface water rogger et al 2017 the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is known as the asian tower xu et al 2008 the permafrost accounts for more than half of the total area of the plateau zhang et al 2000 in the past several decades the qtp experienced remarkable warming ran et al 2018 presented as rising of surface ground temperature wang et al 2008 and significant deepening of the active layer wu and zhang 2010 modeling results suggested that the air temperature on the qtp will increase more than 3 8 c at the end of the 21st century under the representative concentration pathways rcp 6 0 scenario ipcc 2013 resulting in a substantial reduction of the permafrost area on the qtp which was expected to have significant effects on the plateau s hydrological cycle and water balance xu et al 2014 recently researchers called attention to the importance of permafrost degradation on the surface hydrological processes of the qtp cuo et al 2015 and estimated the recharge ratios of melting ground ice to the lakes and rivers yang et al 2016 2017a zhang et al 2017 results suggested that permafrost degradation influenced the annual runoff changes of the qtp qin et al 2017 wang et al 2017a changed the hydrological connectivity between surface water and ground water ma et al 2017 and dramatically increased the surface runoff and base flow gao et al 2018a the source area of the yellow river sayr located at the northeast margin of the qtp is considered the main runoff generation and efficient water source regulator region jin et al 2009 the permafrost the seasonal frozen ground and the taliks have been alternatively distributed in the sayr fig 1 the harsh climate and enriched permafrost in sayr constituted a complex hydrological system and formed special hydrological cycle processes resulting in various groundwater types and the distinctive transformation processes of the four types of water precipitation surface water ground water supra permafrost water sub permafrost water and ground ice since the 1980s the air temperatures in the sayr have been rising at an average rate of 0 02 c yr jin et al 2009 which resulted in the increase of average active layer thickness from 1 8 m to 2 4 m between 1980 and 2006 luo et al 2014 and the decrease of permafrost area ratio by 1 1 per year in the sayr qin et al 2017 as a result of the permafrost degradation the supra permafrost water was reduced by about 1 5 108 m3 between 1989 and 2002 in the sayr peng et al 2003 which significantly depressed the groundwater table jin et al 2009 influenced the surface runoff and discharge behaviors wu et al 2018 wang et al 2018a and finally changed the allocation of water sources in the sayr previous studies mainly focused on large scales and most of them were qualitative analysis however hydrological study on small scale was little which will certainly has a beneficial effect on the comprehension of instantaneous feedback on permafrost degradation due to the severe environment and the lack of long term observation of hydrological data on a small catchment scale in the sayr the traditional observations and methods could not precisely determine how the permafrost degradation altered the hydrological processes and hydraulic connectivity the stable isotopic technique provides a useful and successfully applied tool for identifying hydrological processes in small basins in permafrost regions streletskiy et al 2015 throckmorton et al 2016 ala aho et al 2018b previous stable hydrology studies on the qtp constrained the hydrological processes related to permafrost degradation yang et al 2017a song et al 2017 identified the hydrological behavior of ground ice yang et al 2017b wang et al 2018b and clarified the hydrological connectivity between different water components yang et al 2017a ma et al 2017 however these studies have qualitatively assessed the role of existing and degrading permafrost on the annual runoff yield and hydrological processes a major knowledge gap still remains regarding how much melting water can export from thawing permafrost to feed the stream water and how the degrading permafrost change the hydrological connectivity the present study will attempt to address the following three questions by using stable isotopic methods and field investigations 1 illuminate the hydrological processes of the stream water thermokarst lakes and ground ice in the shuangchagou basin scg in the sayr 2 quantitatively estimate the recharge ratios of the precipitation spring and melting ground ice to the stream water 3 conceptually interpret the hydrological evolution on seasonal scale in the sayr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sayr is defined as the region included above duoshixia along the yellow river fig 1 with a total catchment area of 29 000 km2 luo et al 2011 it is located in the mosaic transition zones of seasonally frozen ground and discontinuous and continuous permafrost on the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau the elevation ranges between 4100 and 5442 m above sea level previous observations indicated that the mean annual air temperatures were lower than 4 c and the annual precipitation varied between 300 mm and 400 mm with most of precipitation 70 80 falling in the warm seasons numerous rivers and streams are included in the sayr with the majority of them distributed on the southern banks of the yellow river there are many lakes such as the sisters lakes galala co xingxinghai and the xingxiuhai lake clusters the majority of the lakes discharge fresh water to rivers the ngöring lake is the largest lake and the gyaring lake is the next largest lake jin et al 2009 fig 1 all of these lakes are fed by precipitation snowmelt and ice melt water rivers and groundwater rivers and lakes are important to the modulation of the hydrological processes and the water balance in the sayr the sayr presents various types of frozen ground including continuous discontinuous sporadic and isolated patches of permafrost as well as seasonally frozen ground and they experiences frequent transitions jin et al 2009 the permafrost thickness is less than 100 m and is generally warm 1 c with some exceptions on very high mountaintops luo et al 2012 the latest calculations suggest that the total amount of ground ice reserves between 3 m and 10 m in the sayr is approximately 49 62 km3 with higher ice contents near the permafrost table wang et al 2017b in this study the scg basin in the tangchama tcm region was selected to study the hydrological processes and hydraulic connections between different water components it is located between the ngöring lake and the gyaring lake fig 1 this region is the transition zone from the piedmont plain of the duoqu catchment to the lakeshore terrace and the plain of ngöring lake the mean annual air temperature was 4 3 c the permafrost developed in areas with plentiful vegetation and a deeper groundwater table permafrost thickness was about 20 40 m and the observed permafrost ground temperature was approximately 0 7 c according to our filed investigation achieved by hand dug and machine drilling the scg experimental basin was located in an ice rich permafrost region with the ice content of more than 60 it includes thermokarst lakes natural spring degrading permafrost and surface runoff which originated from the upstream hillside and was the confluence of natural spring precipitation and meltwater from permafrost ground ice plentiful of thermokarst lakes were distributed in scg basin they were almost shallower 1 m and smaller and were surrounded by alpine meadows field observations indicated that these shallower closed system lakes were mainly fed by precipitation and melting ice some of smaller lakes disappeared in the cold seasons and were showing in rainy seasons in our current research a total of 50 lakes near the scg streams 4 km south of two streams were investigated the landscape transition was remarkable in the scg which turned from a deserted steppe to an alpine meadow two streams were distributed in different ecosystems fig 2 the south branch located in the alpine swampy meadow with a length of 2 km fig 3 the source area was featured by a large flat swamp meadow with numerous thermokarst depressions which mainly accumulated precipitation and overflowed to form one of the source water of south branch and another source area of south branch is surface runoff generated via confluence of several natural springs the north branch is situated in the deserted steppe with a length of about 1 8 km fig 3 it originated from two kinds of surface runoff which were composed of an uphill exudative water flow and a confluence flow by alpine swamp meadow 2 2 stable isotope sampling and filed discharge monitor design due to the harsh environment continuous precipitation sampling work cannot be completed in the scg basin and precipitation samples were only obtained between july and september in 2014 during our fieldwork in order to represent the precipitation characteristics in this region and to clarify the hydraulic connections and recharge characteristics of the other water components the stable isotopic data of precipitation 2009 5 2010 5 in madoi county 120 km away from scg see fig 1 was used ren et al 2013 combined with our samples a total of 202 data points were compiled to reconstruct the local meteoric water line lmwl from 2014 to 2015 we completed the continuous sampling work for both two branches in different months the stream water samples for the two branches were collected on july 20 august 5 and october 9 2014 and more samples were consecutively collected on june 20 august 20 and september 20 2015 during every sampling campaign 20 water samples were obtained from upstream to downstream fig 2 the in situ measurement of the electrical conductivity ec was completed synchronously in addition the thermokarst lakes near the scg basin were investigated during three different months august and september in 2014 and july in 2015 in total 19 lakes were sampled in august 2014 21 lakes were investigated in september 2014 and 10 lakes were collected in july 2015 fig 2 thermokarst lake water samples were collected close to the center of each lake for isotope analysis all of the water samples were preserved in 30 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and kept cold at 4 c until analysis to better understand the influence of the thawing permafrost ground ice on the hydrological circulation in the scg basin the manual excavation work was carried out to obtain soil and ice samples the ground ice between 115 cm and 135 cm was mainly identified as segregated ice with ice contents of approximate 80 and the ice samples below 135 cm were of intrusive origin ice contents 70 fig 2 altogether 17 ground ice samples were obtained between 115 cm and 200 cm each ice sample was collected using disposable pe gloves to prevent contamination the outer layer of each ice sample was chipped off to avoid any mixing with neighbor ice or surplus water ground ice samples were preserved in hdpe bottles and kept frozen in order to continuously monitor the seasonal variations in stream water discharge a rectangular weir was setup at the confluence site of two branches an onset hobo u20 water level logger 0 05 accuracy was equipped and recorded at 30 min intervals discharge was calculated by using a standard equation for the dimension of the installed weir 2 3 data analysis stable isotope δ18o δd analyses of all samples were completed using an isotopic liquid water and water vapor analyzer l2130 i picarro usa with a wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy technique in the state key laboratory of frozen soil engineering chinese academy of sciences the results were expressed in relation to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical error was less than 0 08 for δ18o and 0 2 for δd before analysis every sample was filtered through 0 22 μm disposable membrane filters to remove impurities the ec analysis was completed during fieldwork using an hq40d portable meter hach usa with a precision of less than 0 5 2 4 hydrograph separation method hydrograph separation is popularly used to differentiate and estimate the contributions of diverse sources to a terminal water body uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 its appropriate application is mainly dependent on the steady state mass balance of water and tracers hoeg et al 2000 the stable isotopes combined with hydrochemical tracers ec were used as ideal tracers for hydrograph separation buttle 1994 maurya et al 2011 and were evaluated to be effective klaus and mcdonnell 2013 typically for isotope hydrograph separation it is assumed that each initial water individual recharging to a terminal water body is determined and shows significantly different isotopic values klaus and mcdonnell 2013 in order to evaluate the contributions of the different water components a few simple assumptions are made 1 the annual average values of δ18o and ec for the different water bodies contributing to the study streams stay essentially stable on a yearly scale 2 the observed temporal variations in these values in the stream water are naturally reflected in the temporal deviations in the parameters of the water components combining with the above assumptions and the mass balance conservation principle the following equations are used 1 s g p t 2 s g p 1 3 s δ s g δ g p δ p δ t 4 s e s g e g p e p e t here s g and p represent discharge in m3 s of the three contributive components of the spring s ground ice meltwater g and the precipitation p and the s g p dimensionless denote the discharge fraction ratio respectively which are defined as s s t g g t and p p t the variables δ and e stand for the δ18o in and the ec in μs cm of the three components thus combined the four equations 1 4 the contributing fractions of three components can be estimated as shown below 5 g δ t δ s e p e s δ p δ s e t e s δ g δ s e p e s δ p δ s e g e s 6 p δ t δ s e g e s δ g δ s e t e s δ p δ s e g e s δ g δ

hydrological regimes and flow conditions were delineated the south branch and the north branch of scg displayed significant seasonal variations in stream water conditions fig 3 which are dependent on the precipitation and air temperature changes in the scg a remarkable cutoff of the stream water in both two branches was shown in late june in 2015 fig 3 however the two branches displayed well flow conditions in late july with little zero flow happening by comparison the scg basin clearly exhibited different stream water conditions in early and late august in early august in 2014 the two branches dried up in the middle and lower reaches fig 3 due to the alternation of the source water and the vegetation cover however in late august in 2015 intermittent drying occurred in both branches fig 3 later by october in 2014 the two branches were all unblocked along the flow path fig 3 it is concluded that in june in 2015 the low air temperature with mean value of 3 9 c fig 4 and the higher precipitation 108 5 mm reduced the evaporation effect on the stream water in both branches these sites where the water continuously flows were covered by wetlands with well developed vegetation cover which increased the interception of precipitation to form surface runoff however the dried sections were covered by deserted steppe or barren ground and after experiencing a cold winter freeze drying decreased the moisture content of the seasonal freezing layer active layer and creates favorable conditions for the penetration of precipitation into the frozen sediments feldrnan 1988 thus the precipitation preferentially infiltrated into the seasonal freezing layer in july abundant precipitation fig 4 increased the recharge to the stream water the higher air temperature accelerated the thawing of the permafrost and the melting of the river ice and the spring ice cone which released melting water into the stream although a higher air temperature and rich precipitation were present in august significant cutoff of the water flow occurred this was due to the deepening of the active layer the filed results indicated that the thaw depths reached 110 cm in alpine meadow areas and about 94 cm in swamp meadow areas in scg basin the surface runoff would permeate into the active layer and be stored as supra permafrost water cheng and jin 2013 which resulted in the drying of the stream and the decrease of the discharge fig 4 another correlation analysis suggested that the water volumes in active layer were negatively related to the thaw depths above 70 cm and positive correlations were showing beneath 70 cm it is suggesting that the stream water entered into the active layer and penetrated downward gradually to the permafrost table during early october based on the field investigation and the ground temperature monitor the active layer reached to the maximum thawing depth luo et al 2018 and the soil moisture was higher or even saturated the rich precipitation and melting water of the ground ice permafrost significantly increased the recharge of the stream water in both branches fig 4 3 2 general stable isotopic distribution of different water components the stable isotopes of different water components are listed in table 1 noticeably the precipitation in the scg shows a wide range of stable isotopes resulting in a lmwl of δd 8 32δ18o 11 69 r2 0 96 the higher slope and intercept indicated that continental recycled moisture and westerlies would significantly influence the precipitation stable isotopes tian et al 2001 rhodes et al 2006 also a high lmwl slope can be caused by the lower temperature fig 4 in sayr ren et al 2013 the stream water in the scg exhibited significant seasonal deviations in both the south and north branches in comparison the thermokarst lakes presented more positive isotopic values mean δ18o 6 5 rather than the precipitation mean δ18o 9 9 and the stream water mean δ18o 11 2 for south branch 10 8 for north branch the ground ice sampled between 115 cm and 200 cm in the scg shows negative isotopic trends mean δ18o 13 6 than the stream waters the soil water showed similar isotopic ranges to the stream water 3 3 temporal variability of stable isotopes and ec of stream water in scg demonstrably no matter which branch it was measured in the δ18o of stream water displayed fluctuation trends in every month fig 4 we concluded that two main interpretations should be addressed 1 according to the field investigation the cutoff of the stream water was common fig 3 and from the previous cutoff site to the next flow site the discharge was small thus the stream water was susceptible to evaporation and resulting enrichment of heavier isotopic composition in remaining water which would exhibit positive isotopic signals 2 the isotopic negative precipitation and ice controlled the negative isotopes of the stream water in the thaw seasons the stream waters in the scg exhibited remarkable seasonal variations in stable isotopes due to the temporal differences in the air temperature and precipitation and the seasonal diversities in the recharge source water of stream generally in both 2014 and 2015 the δ18o of the stream water showed negative trends in july august and september and exhibited relatively positive values in june and october fig 4 this is due to the fact that from july to september the air temperature rose gradually and the snow begun to melt so the meltwater with negative isotopes mean δ18o 13 6 would replenish the stream water in addition temperature driven thawing permafrost ground ice also fed the stream water during this period in june and october the positive isotopes were controlled by air temperature and precipitation in june most of sections in two branches were dried up and the remaining water in stream suffered evaporation which resulted in more positive δ18o in the stream water in october the δ18o showed larger fluctuations in both branches fig 4 the negative δ18o in the source area of the stream was derived from the spring the subsequent positive values were influenced by evaporation and the negative trends in the middle and lower reaches might be attributed to the melting of the snow and ground ice the ec of the stream water varied between 50 μs cm and 571 μs cm in the south branch and ranged from 219 1 μs cm to 597 μs cm in north branch the plotted curves of the two branches exhibit similar trends and significant inverse trends between the ec and δ18o in both two branches are remarkable figs 5 and 6 the higher ecs in july august and september reflect the input of the ground ice and the spring which was enriched with dissolved solutes lamhonwah et al 2017 and the evaporation enrichment of dissolved solutes the higher ec in august in both two years exactly reflected the synergistic effect of ground ice spring input and evaporation enrichment on the stream hydrochemical concentration however the lower values in june and october are suggestive of the influence of precipitation especially the snow with low ec values additionally the fluctuations of the ec in each month are evident this is because of the stream water cutoff the subsequent evaporation and the mixing of different source water the higher ec mainly in july august and september was caused by mixing of source water with high concentration of dissolved solute i e ground ice spring and over flow from active layer and evaporative concentration of stream water which can also increase the ec of water contrarily the lower ec of stream water was mainly showing in june and october in june the snowmelt water with lower ec mainly replenished stream water and in october the autumn rain was the most important input water 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological processes and recharge sources of stream water in scg 4 1 1 determination of potential sources water of stream water in scg in order to accurately calculate the contribution ratios of different water components it is important to determine the source water of stream water in each month field investigations suggest that the potential sources of the stream water in the scg were composed of precipitation ground ice and spring water in june the air temperature was lower fig 4 the active layer was still frozen and the ground ice had not begun to melt thus only the precipitation and the spring could possibly recharge the stream however due to the differences in the ecosystem of the two branches the spring had different recharge characteristics for the south and north branches the north branch is mainly covered by desert steppe with low vegetation fig 2 and the insulation effect and the water interception for this branch are weak the overflow of the spring freezes into an ice cone during this cold period according to the field inspection most of stream water was cutoff and only small fractions of the water flow near the headwater area were observed in june in 2015 fig 3 additionally the average isotope of the north branch in june 9 1 61 2 was close to the summer precipitation value table 1 therefore the summer precipitation is the main source water for the north branch in june however the good cover of the alpine meadow in the south branches played an important role on keeping the ground warm and retaining the water of snowmelt and spring in earlier time therefore the spring and the precipitation were designed as the potential sources of the south branch in june in july august september and october the air temperature rose gradually with an increase of precipitation fig 4 the active layer thickness increased and the near surface ground ice began to melt the precipitation the meltwater of near surface ground ice and the spring are important recharge sources of the streamflow in the scg for these four months 4 1 2 hydrograph separation on the stream water in scg in order to clarify the recharge characteristics of stream waters in the scg the end member mix model was used to quantitatively determine the contribution ratios of the end member components precipitation meltwater of ground ice spring to the stream water in different months the δ18o and ec were designated as tracers the average values of the three end member components were used to decrease the uncertainties during hydrograph separation table 2 since all of the sampling work was conducted in the summer and most of the precipitation occurred in summer time fig 4 the average values in summer were designated as the precipitation end member values the average values of the stream water in both the south and north branches in different months were calculated table 2 it is clearly implied that the precipitation was the main contributor to the stream water in the scg during the study periods ranging between 40 35 and 100 in different months fig 7 table 3 the natural spring was the second source of the stream water however the contribution from the meltwater of near surface ground ice cannot be neglected this accounts for more than 20 of the total in august and september in early august the cutoff appeared in the middle and lower reaches this is because the spring can replenish the river in the upper reaches however recharge from the spring is limited in the middle and lower reaches due to the evaporation and infiltration the river showed evident cutoff in late august the precipitation increased and intermittent cutoff occurred figs 3 and 4 the field observation indicated that the cutoff sections were mainly covered by deserted steppe with low vegetation coverage and high soil permeability the stream water infiltrated into the active layer and was stored as supra permafrost water 4 1 3 the seasonal differences in contribution ratios of ground ice to streams it is clear that the meltwater from the ground ice contributed significantly to the stream water in both branches however the recharge ratios differed in different months fig 7 the melting of the ground ice displayed the maximum recharge volumes for the stream water in august which accounted for 24 31 31 90 of the total in contrast no contribution was identified in june in either of the branches the seasonal deviations in the recharge ratios of the ground ice were attributed to the differences in air temperature precipitation and vegetation coverage in june the relatively lower air temperature kept the active layer and near surface ground ice frozen and a larger amount of precipitation replenished the south and north branches in july about 5 38 17 5 of the inputs were from ground ice meltwater fig 7 due to the higher temperature induced thawing of the active layer and the following melting of the near surface ground ice however only 5 38 of the ground ice meltwater recharged to the south branch compared to 17 5 in the north branch fig 7 this was due to the differences in vegetation cover in the south branch the higher vegetation cover decreased the ground surface temperature and slowed the thaw rate of the active layer and subsequent melting of the near surface ground ice however in the north branch the low cover of deserted steppe was helpful in increasing ground temperature and the infiltration of the precipitation which both promoted the thaw of the active layer and the melting of ground ice in august the contribution of the ground ice meltwater increased significantly ranging from 24 31 to 31 9 mean ratio 27 94 fig 7 due to the substantial melting of the ground ice driven by the rising air temperature in this month the air temperature nearly reached the highest value in both years fig 4 and the thaw depth increased considerably thus the near surface ground ice would melt extensively to recharge the stream water in september and october the continuous melting of ground ice would replenish the stream water the gradual decrease in recharge volumes from august september and october reflected the differences in the amounts and covered depths of the remaining ice in august the uppermost ice would preferentially melt to recharge the stream however with the continuous melting of ice the top layer ice would melt out and the remaining ice in the deep layer began to melt to replenish the stream in september in october the low air temperature reduced the melting of the ice in the deep layer thus the recharge ratios declined from 27 94 in august to 5 67 fig 7 4 2 seasonal hydrological changes of thermokarst lakes in scg 4 2 1 seasonal evaporation variations of thermokarst lakes due to the climatic differences during the three months the evaporation degrees of lakes were varied the evaporation to inflow e i ratios and the d excess defined as d excess δd 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was usually used to reflect the evaporation characteristics of the lakes gibson et al 2017 narancic et al 2017 cui et al 2017 the e i ratios of the thermokarst lakes in the scg in july august and september were determined fig 8 a in order to identify the evaporation of the thermokarst lake fig 9 a the e i ratios in july ranged between 0 19 and 0 98 mean value 0 71 they were in the range of 0 44 0 96 mean value 0 64 in august and ranged from 0 003 to 0 43 mean value 0 09 in september the differences in the e i ratios in different months reflected the discrepancies in the evaporative influence on the lake water balance narancic et al 2017 the thermokarst lakes in september show strongly positive water balances and they showed the most evaporative control on the lakes in july the d excess displayed a similar trend during these three months fig 8b which is consistent with the e i fig 8 and δi results fig 9 the thermokarst lakes showed strongest evaporation in july due to low precipitation and high air temperature in contrast a higher precipitation and a lower air temperature were responsible for the weak evaporation in september additionally the input of the meltwater from the permafrost ground ice to the lakes may present fewer evaporative characteristics gibson et al 2015 narancic et al 2017 in this study the substantial contribution of the melting ice water to stream water in august and september fig 7 demonstrated this conclusion the higher air temperature and the abundant precipitation accelerated the thawing of the permafrost ground ice around the lakes that replenished the thermokarst lake and reduced the evaporation rate importantly contrast to the hoh xil continuous permafrost regions the sayr was identified as a warm permafrost region jin et al 2009 that was sensitive to temperature and numerous taliks occurred in the scg basin that increased the hydrological connectivities between the lakes and the groundwater spring these also attenuated the evaporative signals of the lakes 4 2 2 isotope framework of lakes and recharge sources identification in comparison significant differences in stable isotopes were shown between the thermokarst lakes and the other water components the thermokarst lakes displayed more positive isotopes suggesting strong evaporation in addition the stable isotopic points of some lakes located on the lmwl fig 9 and the d excess were close to the mean value of the precipitation which is suggestive of recharge by precipitation specifically the thermokarst lakes exhibited seasonal evaporation characteristics the stable isotopes were reduced from july to september indicating a gradual decrease in evaporation intensities fig 9d which reflects the influences of the air temperature precipitation and source water in july the calculated δi value 7 7 52 0 was more positive than the precipitation stream water ground ice and the spring fig 9a which suggests that the thermokarst lakes in july originated from water with positive isotopes field observation showed that most of these lakes reach the winter dried the higher vegetation cover around the lakes would intercept snow during the previous year after more than half a year of freezing and evaporation isotope fractionation happened to these snows which resulted in positive isotopes sokratov and golubev 2009 and in the warm season july the meltwater of the snow with positive isotopes was recharged to the lakes in august the calculated δi value 14 4 107 9 was more negative than the values for the summer precipitation spring and stream water but it was close to the value of the ground ice fig 9b this emphasizes the contribution of the near surface ground ice to the lakes previous analysis data pointed out the substantial input of ice meltwater to stream water in august when the nearly highest air temperature fig 4 and the quickly increased thaw depth aggravated the melt of the ground ice that would recharge the lakes lakes in september presented the most negative isotopes and some of them were located along the lmwl fig 9c the calculated δi value 9 9 70 8 was nearly the same for the summer precipitation fig 9c reflecting the control of the precipitation on the lake hydrology in this month 4 3 the formation and recharge sources of the near surface ground ice the stable isotopic profiles of the ground ice showed remarkably negative trends in δd and δ18o and positive trends in the d excess from top to bottom fig 10 between 115 cm and 135 cm the ground ice was enriched in δd and δ18o and depleted in d excess however the δd and δ18o tended to be negative and the d excess was inclined to be positive below 135 cm and δ18o and δd remained nearly stable at 14 and 106 respectively fig 10 the d excess fluctuated in a narrow range of 4 5 7 4 the differences between stable isotopes in the two sections are reflected the deviations in the initial source water of the ground ice between 115 cm and 135 cm the curves of δ18o and δd in the ground ice between 115 cm and 135 cm are show gradually negative trends fig 10 table 4 previous studies suggested that the formation of the near surface ground ice was closely related to the active layer hydrology yang et al 2017b here the isotopic value of upmost ground ice is close to that of annual average value of precipitation fig 11 under the control of the negative ground temperature gradient the water moisture in the active layer migrated from the top to the bottom and ice formed during slow freezing michel 2011 lacelle 2011 the slow freezing resulted in the stable isotopic fractionation wherein the heavier isotopes were preferentially concentrated in the solid ice while the residual liquid water was depleted in heavier isotopes and enriched in lighter isotopes which formed ice with lighter isotopes the freezing line was determined as y 6 3x 17 72 r2 0 99 in addition the regression analysis suggested a significantly negative relation between the d excess and the δd in this depth range fig 12 d excess 0 26δd 21 24 r2 0 8 which demonstrated the segregated origin of the ground ice between 115 cm and 135 cm lacelle 2011 the initial isotope value 11 8 92 6 was close to the annual average value of the precipitation fig 11 indicating the mixing recharge from precipitation yang et al 2017b and the precipitation originated active layer water throckmorton et al 2016 wang et al 2018b below 135 cm the δ18o and δd of the ice presented relatively stable conditions fig 10 with an average δ18o of 14 0 and an average δd of 105 9 table 4 the d excess was also fluctuating in a narrow range from 4 5 to 7 4 the freezing slope 5 2 was lower than that in the range between 115 cm and 135 cm this suggests that the ground ice formed in a cold environment by quick freezing the isotopic fractionation did not occur during rapid freezing thus there was little to no difference between the ice and the initial source water michel 2011 the calculated δi 14 4 108 1 was close to the average value of the winter snow 16 3 122 4 and the d excess 6 1 was similar to that of winter snow 7 7 therefore the ground ice in this depth range would originate from the meltwater of winter snow the accumulated snow would melt in the warm season and infiltrate into the active layer then quickly freeze into ice under a colder temperature that did not allow the occurrence of isotopic fractionation in addition according to the borehole data the ground temperature between 135 cm and 200 cm was nearly at 0 5 c luo et al 2018 with no temperature gradient existed which allowed no water migration thus the liquid water within this depth range froze in situ without isotopic fractionation additionally the weak d excess δd relation y 0 03x 3 38 r2 0 001 was similar to that of the precipitation and it was indicative of the precipitation origin lacelle 2011 table 5 4 4 hydrological connectivity mechanism between different water components the δd δ18o plot clearly shows significant hydrological connections between different water components fig 13 the isotopic dots of stream water in both the south and north branches are all located on the lmwl and overlapped by the spring reflecting the substantial recharge of the precipitation yang et al 2017a and the natural spring the soil water isotopes are concentrated in the range of the stream water suggesting the recharge relations between them in addition our filed result indicated that the stream water laterally and vertically infiltrated into active layer via in situ digging the ground ice is partially linked with the stream water and the winter precipitation indicating hydrological connections between them yang et al 2017a however the thermokarst lakes isotopically deviated from the precipitation stream water soil water spring and ground ice suggesting isotopic fractionation induced by strong evaporation yang et al 2016 gibson et al 2017 some of the lakes are located among the precipitation ranges which is due to the feed from summer precipitation the d excess presented obvious deviations in different water components the south and north branches showed comparable d excess trends in the study periods fig 14 reflecting the similar recharge sources the higher d excess was close to the average value of precipitation july august october in 2014 and june in 2015 fig 14 suggesting the control of precipitation on the stream hydrology and the lower values in august and september in 2015 fig 14 reflected the influence of evaporation and the input of ice meltwater the significantly negative d excess of the thermokarst lakes was indicative of the influence of strong evaporation on the lake hydrology cui et al 2017 ala aho et al 2018b the d excess of the soil water was close to the average value of the precipitation and was identical to the average value of the stream water fig 14 suggesting the replenishment of both precipitation and stream water the different patterns in the d δd relations of the water components reflected the origin and recharge processes lacelle 2011 yang et al 2017b in this study it was clearly shown that there were discrepancies in the d δd locations of different waterbodies fig 15 the precipitation presented wider variations in d excess and a weak correlation between d excess and δd emphasizing the seasonal variations of moisture sources of precipitation in the scg yao et al 2013 yang et al 2017a the stream water clustered in the center of the precipitation and overlapped with the ground ice and the spring denoting the hydrological connections between these water components and the feed of the precipitation spring and ground ice to the stream thermokarst lakes displayed different patterns than the other waterbodies fig 15 and the negative correlation between d and δd r2 0 36 reflected the impact of evaporation yang et al 2016 however some of the lakes were concentrated in the range of the precipitation and the stream field observation revealed that these lakes were small and shallow and covered by an alpine meadow they mainly received precipitation in the summer and were dried when reaching the winter and thus they had a short residence time and epitomized the precipitation signals 4 5 permafrost impacted hydrological variabilities in the sayr based on the stable isotopic and ec results a conceptual model was given in this study to illustrate the seasonal variations of the hydrological processes in the sayr in june the seasonal frozen layer in the sayr was characterized by low moisture contents due to freeze drying feldrnan 1988 although a high air temperature was present in this period fig 4 most of the surface ground was still frozen and the upmost layer had just began to thaw fig 16 luo et al 2018 thus the ground ice would not melt to replenish the stream water in this period the melting water of the snow covers in the last year and new precipitation was the main contributors to the stream water however due to the evaporation of snow and active layer lechler and niemi 2012 throckmorton et al 2016 the δ18o in june was enriched fig 16 the drying soil and the larger soil porosity resulted in the preferential infiltration of the precipitation into the soil to supply the moisture deficit therefore the discharge amounts of the stream in the scg were lower fig 4 from july to september the continuous high temperature fig 4 resulted in the gradual thawing of the active layer fig 16 and the near surface ground ice melted successively from top to bottom in these three months the stream water exhibited relatively negative δ18o values fig 16 which were interpreted as the mixing effect of precipitation and ground ice the moisture contents increased quickly due to the abundant precipitation and the thawing of the frozen soil ice and the melting water of ground ice could meltout to mix with the infiltrated precipitation in the active layer to recharge stream water with the gradual deepening of the active layer fig 16 more melting water from the ground ice entered the stream water fig 7 the considerable contribution mean ratio 22 5 of melting ice with negative isotopes table 2 and 18o depleted precipitation ren et al 2013 was responsible for the low δ18o of the stream water in october the stream water showed more positive δ18o values fig 16 it was attributed to the strong evaporation caused by the higher air temperature the lower input low precipitation in oct fig 4 of 18o depleted precipitation ren et al 2013 and the lack of meltwater from the ground ice fig 16 because all the near surface ground ice melted out during september no meltwater entered the stream in october thus the δ18o value was relatively positive our current conclusions on the role of ground ice were consistent with those in antarctica harris et al 2007 the high arctic paquette et al 2018 and the qtp zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2017a gao et al 2018b all of these changes would certainly alter the hydrological processes hydraulic connectivity and allocation of water resources in the sayr even on the qtp 5 conclusions in this study a comprehensive investigation of the hydrological characteristics in the sayr on the qtp was completed using isotopic tracers and in situ field observations the following findings were emphasized 1 the discharge conditions stable isotopes and the ec displayed significant seasonal fluctuations due to climatic conditions and diverse source water hydrograph separation results indicated that precipitation was the main source of stream water accounting for 53 5 52 2 of the total however the melting ground ice contributed 16 7 13 2 which cannot be neglected 2 the evaporation inflow e i ratios and d excess of thermokarst lakes evidenced seasonal evaporation differences in july the lakes were mainly fed by evaporative snow in the previous year they were significantly impacted by thawing permafrost in august and late summer precipitation and autumn precipitation were the main sources of them in september 3 high resolution stable isotopes of the ground ice between 115 cm and 200 cm suggested different ice formation mechanisms and initial source water the ground ice above 135 cm was closely related to active layer hydrology it was of segregated origin and was recharged by precipitation and active layer water however the ground ice below 135 cm was formed by quick freezing which was sourced from melting winter snow 4 the stable isotopic results and the conceptual model suggested that hydrological connectivities were evident between the precipitation stream water thermokarst lakes spring and ground ice under the context of continuous warming the permafrost and hydrological connections in the sayr will be altered significantly which will ultimately influence the allocation of water

6764,climatic warming has resulted in permafrost degradation and it is expected to alter the hydrological processes and hydraulic connectivity on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp some important and pending issues for understanding the hydrological processes in permafrost regions are how much melting water from thawing permafrost can feed the stream water and how the hydraulic connectivities will be altered under continual permafrost degradation in this study the source area of the yellow river locating on the northeast qtp was studied by using stable isotopic method and field hydrological observation results exhibited significant seasonal hydrological variations of stream water thermokarst lakes and ground ice hydrograph separation suggested that precipitation is the main contributor to stream water in ice free months accounting for 53 5 and 52 2 of the streams on average for the two branches respectively the second source is springs which contributed about 29 8 and 17 9 however the recharge from melting ice is also important it exported an average of 16 7 and 13 2 to the surface stream conceptual model and stable isotopes emphasized the remarkable hydraulic connectivities between the precipitation stream water thermokarst lakes spring and the near surface ground ice current findings provide a basic understanding of the log term hydrological processes under permafrost degradation and can offer an efficient way to assess future hydrological changes and water resource protection keywords permafrost hydrology hydraulic connectivities stable isotopes ground ice source

ground ice to the lakes and rivers yang et al 2016 2017a zhang et al 2017 results suggested that permafrost degradation influenced the annual runoff changes of the qtp qin et al 2017 wang et al 2017a changed the hydrological connectivity between surface water and ground water ma et al 2017 and dramatically increased the surface runoff and base flow gao et al 2018a the source area of the yellow river sayr located at the northeast margin of the qtp is considered the main runoff generation and efficient water source regulator region jin et al 2009 the permafrost the seasonal frozen ground and

processes resulting in various groundwater types and the distinctive transformation processes of the four types of water precipitation surface water ground water supra permafrost water sub permafrost water and ground ice since the 1980s the air temperatures in the sayr have been rising at an average rate of 0 02 c yr jin et al 2009 which resulted in the increase of average active layer thickness from 1 8 m to 2 4 m between 1980 and 2006 luo et al 2014 and the decrease of permafrost area ratio by 1 1 per year in the sayr qin et al 2017 as a result of the permafrost degradation the supra permafrost water was reduced by about 1 5 108 m3 between 1989 and 2002 in the sayr peng et al 2003 which significantly depressed the groundwater table jin et al 2009 influenced the surface runoff and discharge behaviors wu et al 2018 wang et al 2018a and finally changed the allocation of water sources in the sayr previous studies mainly focused on large scales and most of them were qualitative analysis however hydrological study on small scale was little which will certainly has a beneficial effect on the comprehension of instantaneous feedback on permafrost degradation due to the severe environment and the lack of long term observation of hydrological data on a small catchment scale in the sayr the traditional observations and methods could not precisely determine how the permafrost degradation altered the hydrological processes and hydraulic connectivity the stable isotopic technique provides a useful and successfully applied tool for identifying hydrological processes in small basins in permafrost regions streletskiy et al 2015 throckmorton et al 2016 ala aho et al 2018b previous stable hydrology studies on the qtp constrained the hydrological processes related to permafrost degradation yang et al 2017a song et al 2017 identified the hydrological behavior of ground ice yang et al 2017b wang et al 2018b and clarified the hydrological connectivity between different water components yang et al 2017a ma et al 2017 however these studies have qualitatively assessed the role of existing and degrading permafrost on the annual runoff yield and hydrological processes a major knowledge gap still remains regarding how much melting water can export from thawing permafrost to feed the stream water and how the degrading permafrost change the hydrological connectivity the present study will attempt to address the following three questions by using stable isotopic methods and field investigations 1 illuminate the hydrological processes of the stream water thermokarst lakes and ground ice in the shuangchagou basin scg in the sayr 2 quantitatively estimate the recharge ratios of the precipitation spring and melting ground ice to the stream water 3 conceptually interpret the hydrological evolution on seasonal scale in the sayr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the sayr is defined as the region included above duoshixia along the yellow river fig 1 with a total catchment area of 29 000 km2 luo et al 2011 it is located in the mosaic transition zones of seasonally frozen ground and discontinuous and continuous permafrost on the northeastern qinghai tibet plateau the elevation ranges between 4100 and 5442 m above sea level previous observations indicated that the mean annual air temperatures were lower than 4 c and the annual precipitation varied between 300 mm and 400 mm with most of precipitation 70 80 falling in the warm seasons numerous rivers and streams are included in the sayr with the majority of them distributed on the southern banks of the yellow river there are many lakes such as the sisters lakes galala co xingxinghai and the xingxiuhai lake clusters the majority of the lakes discharge fresh water to rivers the ngöring lake is the largest lake and the gyaring lake is the next largest lake jin et al 2009 fig 1 all of these lakes are fed by precipitation snowmelt and ice melt water rivers and groundwater rivers and lakes are important to the modulation of the hydrological processes and the water balance in the sayr the sayr presents various types of frozen ground including continuous discontinuous sporadic and isolated patches of permafrost as well as seasonally frozen ground and they experiences frequent transitions jin et al 2009 the permafrost thickness is less than 100 m and is generally warm 1 c with some exceptions on very high mountaintops luo et al 2012 the latest calculations suggest that the total amount of ground ice reserves between 3 m and 10 m in the sayr is approximately 49 62 km3 with higher ice contents near the permafrost table wang et al 2017b in this study the scg basin in the tangchama tcm region was selected to study the hydrological processes and hydraulic connections between different water components it is located between the ngöring lake and the gyaring lake fig 1 this region is the transition zone from the piedmont plain of the duoqu catchment to the lakeshore terrace and the plain of ngöring lake the mean annual air temperature was 4 3 c the permafrost developed in areas with plentiful vegetation and a deeper groundwater table permafrost thickness was about 20 40 m and the observed permafrost ground temperature was approximately 0 7 c according to our filed investigation achieved by hand dug and machine drilling the scg experimental basin was located in an ice rich permafrost region with the ice content of more than 60 it includes thermokarst lakes natural spring degrading permafrost and surface runoff which originated from the upstream hillside and was the confluence of natural spring precipitation and meltwater from permafrost ground ice plentiful of thermokarst lakes were distributed in scg basin they were almost shallower 1 m and smaller and were surrounded by alpine meadows field observations indicated that these shallower closed system lakes were mainly fed by precipitation and melting ice some of smaller lakes disappeared in the cold seasons and were showing in rainy seasons in our current research a total of 50 lakes near the scg streams 4 km south of two streams were investigated the landscape transition was remarkable in the scg which turned from a deserted steppe to an alpine meadow two streams were distributed in different ecosystems fig 2 the south branch located in the alpine swampy meadow with a length of 2 km fig 3 the source area was featured by a large flat swamp meadow with numerous thermokarst depressions which mainly accumulated precipitation and overflowed to form one of the source water of south branch and another source area of south branch is surface runoff generated via confluence of several natural springs the north branch is situated in the deserted steppe with a length of about 1 8 km fig 3 it originated from two kinds of surface runoff which were composed of an uphill exudative water flow and a confluence flow by alpine swamp meadow 2 2 stable isotope sampling and filed discharge monitor design due to the harsh environment continuous precipitation sampling work cannot be completed in the scg basin and precipitation samples were only obtained between july and september in 2014 during our fieldwork in order to represent the precipitation characteristics in this region and to clarify the hydraulic connections and recharge characteristics of the other water components the stable isotopic data of precipitation 2009 5 2010 5 in madoi county 120 km away from scg see fig 1 was used ren et al 2013 combined with our samples a total of 202 data points were compiled to reconstruct the local meteoric water line lmwl from 2014 to 2015 we completed the continuous sampling work for both two branches in different months the stream water samples for the two branches were collected on july 20 august 5 and october 9 2014 and more samples were consecutively collected on june 20 august 20 and september 20 2015 during every sampling campaign 20 water samples were obtained from upstream to downstream fig 2 the in situ measurement of the electrical conductivity ec was completed synchronously in addition the thermokarst lakes near the scg basin were investigated during three different months august and september in 2014 and july in 2015 in total 19 lakes were sampled in august 2014 21 lakes were investigated in september 2014 and 10 lakes were collected in july 2015 fig 2 thermokarst lake water samples were collected close to the center of each lake for isotope analysis all of the water samples were preserved in 30 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles and kept cold at 4 c until analysis to better understand the influence of the thawing permafrost ground ice on the hydrological circulation in the scg basin the manual excavation work was carried out to obtain soil and ice samples the ground ice between 115 cm and 135 cm was mainly identified as segregated ice with ice contents of approximate 80 and the ice samples below 135 cm were of intrusive origin ice contents 70 fig 2 altogether 17 ground ice samples were obtained between 115 cm and 200 cm each ice sample was collected using disposable pe gloves to prevent contamination the outer layer of each ice sample was chipped off to avoid any mixing with neighbor ice or surplus water ground ice samples were preserved in hdpe bottles and kept frozen in order to continuously monitor the seasonal variations in stream water discharge a rectangular weir was setup at the confluence site of two branches an onset hobo u20 water level logger 0 05 accuracy was equipped and recorded at 30 min intervals discharge was calculated by using a standard equation for the dimension of the installed weir 2 3 data analysis stable isotope δ18o δd analyses of all samples were completed using an isotopic liquid water and water vapor analyzer l2130 i picarro usa with a wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy technique in the state key laboratory of frozen soil engineering chinese academy of sciences the results were expressed in relation to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical error was less than 0 08 for δ18o and 0 2 for δd before analysis every sample was filtered through 0 22 μm disposable membrane filters to remove impurities the ec analysis was completed during fieldwork using an hq40d portable meter hach usa with a precision of less than 0 5 2 4 hydrograph separation method hydrograph separation is popularly used to differentiate and estimate the contributions of diverse sources to a terminal water body uhlenbrook and hoeg 2003 its appropriate application is mainly dependent on the steady state mass balance of water and tracers hoeg et al 2000 the stable isotopes combined with hydrochemical tracers ec were used as ideal tracers for hydrograph separation buttle 1994 maurya et al 2011 and were evaluated to be effective klaus and mcdonnell 2013 typically for isotope hydrograph separation it is assumed that each initial water individual recharging to a terminal water body is determined and shows significantly different isotopic values klaus and mcdonnell 2013 in order to evaluate the contributions of the different water components a few simple assumptions are made 1 the annual average values of δ18o and ec for the different water bodies contributing to the study streams stay essentially stable on a yearly scale 2 the observed temporal variations in these values in the stream water are naturally reflected in the temporal deviations in the parameters of the water components combining with the above assumptions and the mass balance conservation principle the following equations are used 1 s g p t 2 s g p 1 3 s δ s g δ g p δ p δ t 4 s e s g e g p e p e t here s g and p represent discharge in m3 s of the three contributive components of the spring s ground ice meltwater g and the precipitation p and the s g p dimensionless denote the discharge fraction ratio respectively which are defined as s s t g g t and p p t the variables δ and e stand for the δ18o in and the ec in μs cm of the three components thus combined the four equations 1 4 the contributing fractions of three components can be estimated as shown below 5 g δ t δ s e p e s δ p δ s e t e s δ g δ s e p e s δ p δ s e g e s 6 p δ t δ s e g e s δ g δ s e t e s δ p δ s e g e s δ g δ

hydrological regimes and flow conditions were delineated the south branch and the north branch of scg displayed significant seasonal variations in stream water conditions fig 3 which are dependent on the precipitation and air temperature changes in the scg a remarkable cutoff of the stream water in both two branches was shown in late june in 2015 fig 3 however the two branches displayed well flow conditions in late july with little zero flow happening by comparison the scg basin clearly exhibited different stream water conditions in early and late august in early august in 2014 the two branches dried up in the middle and lower reaches fig 3 due to the alternation of the source water and the vegetation cover however in late august in 2015 intermittent drying occurred in both branches fig 3 later by october in 2014 the two branches were all unblocked along the flow path fig 3 it is concluded that in june in 2015 the low air temperature with mean value of 3 9 c fig 4 and the higher precipitation 108 5 mm reduced the evaporation effect on the stream water in both branches these sites where the water continuously flows were covered by wetlands with well developed vegetation cover which increased the interception of precipitation to form surface runoff however the dried sections were covered by deserted steppe or barren ground and after experiencing a cold winter freeze drying decreased the moisture content of the seasonal freezing layer active layer and creates favorable conditions for the penetration of precipitation into the frozen sediments feldrnan 1988 thus the precipitation preferentially infiltrated into the seasonal freezing layer in july abundant precipitation fig 4 increased the recharge to the stream water the higher air temperature accelerated the thawing of the permafrost and the melting of the river ice and the spring ice cone which released melting water into the stream although a higher air temperature and rich precipitation were present in august significant cutoff of the water flow occurred this was due to the deepening of the active layer the filed results indicated that the thaw depths reached 110 cm in alpine meadow areas and about 94 cm in swamp meadow areas in scg basin the surface runoff would permeate into the active layer and be stored as supra permafrost water cheng and jin 2013 which resulted in the drying of the stream and the decrease of the discharge fig 4 another correlation analysis suggested that the water volumes in active layer were negatively related to the thaw depths above 70 cm and positive correlations were showing beneath 70 cm it is suggesting that the stream water entered into the active layer and penetrated downward gradually to the permafrost table during early october based on the field investigation and the ground temperature monitor the active layer reached to the maximum thawing depth luo et al 2018 and the soil moisture was higher or even saturated the rich precipitation and melting water of the ground ice permafrost significantly increased the recharge of the stream water in both branches fig 4 3 2 general stable isotopic distribution of different water components the stable isotopes of different water components are listed in table 1 noticeably the precipitation in the scg shows a wide range of stable isotopes resulting in a lmwl of δd 8 32δ18o 11 69 r2 0 96 the higher slope and intercept indicated that continental recycled moisture and westerlies would significantly influence the precipitation stable isotopes tian et al 2001 rhodes et al 2006 also a high lmwl slope can be caused by the lower temperature fig 4 in sayr ren et al 2013 the stream water in the scg exhibited significant seasonal deviations in both the south and north branches in comparison the thermokarst lakes presented more positive isotopic values mean δ18o 6 5 rather than the precipitation mean δ18o 9 9 and the stream water mean δ18o 11 2 for south branch 10 8 for north branch the ground ice sampled between 115 cm and 200 cm in the scg shows negative isotopic trends mean δ18o 13 6 than the stream waters the soil water showed similar isotopic ranges to the stream water 3 3 temporal variability of stable isotopes and ec of stream water in scg demonstrably no matter which branch it was measured in the δ18o of stream water displayed fluctuation trends in every month fig 4 we concluded that two main interpretations should be addressed 1 according to the field investigation the cutoff of the stream water was common fig 3 and from the previous cutoff site to the next flow site the discharge was small thus the stream water was susceptible to evaporation and resulting enrichment of heavier isotopic composition in remaining water which would exhibit positive isotopic signals 2 the isotopic negative precipitation and ice controlled the negative isotopes of the stream water in the thaw seasons the stream waters in the scg exhibited remarkable seasonal variations in stable isotopes due to the temporal differences in the air temperature and precipitation and the seasonal diversities in the recharge source water of stream generally in both 2014 and 2015 the δ18o of the stream water showed negative trends in july august and september and exhibited relatively positive values in june and october fig 4 this is due to the fact that from july to september the air temperature rose gradually and the snow begun to melt so the meltwater with negative isotopes mean δ18o 13 6 would replenish the stream water in addition temperature driven thawing permafrost ground ice also fed the stream water during this period in june and october the positive isotopes were controlled by air temperature and precipitation in june most of sections in two branches were dried up and the remaining water in stream suffered evaporation which resulted in more positive δ18o in the stream water in october the δ18o showed larger fluctuations in both branches fig 4 the negative δ18o in the source area of the stream was derived from the spring the subsequent positive values were influenced by evaporation and the negative trends in the middle and lower reaches might be attributed to the melting of the snow and ground ice the ec of the stream water varied between 50 μs cm and 571 μs cm in the south branch and ranged from 219 1 μs cm to 597 μs cm in north branch the plotted curves of the two branches exhibit similar trends and significant inverse trends between the ec and δ18o in both two branches are remarkable figs 5 and 6 the higher ecs in july august and september reflect the input of the ground ice and the spring which was enriched with dissolved solutes lamhonwah et al 2017 and the evaporation enrichment of dissolved solutes the higher ec in august in both two years exactly reflected the synergistic effect of ground ice spring input and evaporation enrichment on the stream hydrochemical concentration however the lower values in june and october are suggestive of the influence of precipitation especially the snow with low ec values additionally the fluctuations of the ec in each month are evident this is because of the stream water cutoff the subsequent evaporation and the mixing of different source water the higher ec mainly in july august and september was caused by mixing of source water with high concentration of dissolved solute i e ground ice spring and over flow from active layer and evaporative concentration of stream water which can also increase the ec of water contrarily the lower ec of stream water was mainly showing in june and october in june the snowmelt water with lower ec mainly replenished stream water and in october the autumn rain was the most important input water 4 discussion 4 1 hydrological processes and recharge sources of stream water in scg 4 1 1 determination of potential sources water of stream water in scg in order to accurately calculate the contribution ratios of different water components it is important to determine the source water of stream water in each month field investigations suggest that the potential sources of the stream water in the scg were composed of precipitation ground ice and spring water in june the air temperature was lower fig 4 the active layer was still frozen and the ground ice had not begun to melt thus only the precipitation and the spring could possibly recharge the stream however due to the differences in the ecosystem of the two branches the spring had different recharge characteristics for the south and north branches the north branch is mainly covered by desert steppe with low vegetation fig 2 and the insulation effect and the water interception for this branch are weak the overflow of the spring freezes into an ice cone during this cold period according to the field inspection most of stream water was cutoff and only small fractions of the water flow near the headwater area were observed in june in 2015 fig 3 additionally the average isotope of the north branch in june 9 1 61 2 was close to the summer precipitation value table 1 therefore the summer precipitation is the main source water for the north branch in june however the good cover of the alpine meadow in the south branches played an important role on keeping the ground warm and retaining the water of snowmelt and spring in earlier time therefore the spring and the precipitation were designed as the potential sources of the south branch in june in july august september and october the air temperature rose gradually with an increase of precipitation fig 4 the active layer thickness increased and the near surface ground ice began to melt the precipitation the meltwater of near surface ground ice and the spring are important recharge sources of the streamflow in the scg for these four months 4 1 2 hydrograph separation on the stream water in scg in order to clarify the recharge characteristics of stream waters in the scg the end member mix model was used to quantitatively determine the contribution ratios of the end member components precipitation meltwater of ground ice spring to the stream water in different months the δ18o and ec were designated as tracers the average values of the three end member components were used to decrease the uncertainties during hydrograph separation table 2 since all of the sampling work was conducted in the summer and most of the precipitation occurred in summer time fig 4 the average values in summer were designated as the precipitation end member values the average values of the stream water in both the south and north branches in different months were calculated table 2 it is clearly implied that the precipitation was the main contributor to the stream water in the scg during the study periods ranging between 40 35 and 100 in different months fig 7 table 3 the natural spring was the second source of the stream water however the contribution from the meltwater of near surface ground ice cannot be neglected this accounts for more than 20 of the total in august and september in early august the cutoff appeared in the middle and lower reaches this is because the spring can replenish the river in the upper reaches however recharge from the spring is limited in the middle and lower reaches due to the evaporation and infiltration the river showed evident cutoff in late august the precipitation increased and intermittent cutoff occurred figs 3 and 4 the field observation indicated that the cutoff sections were mainly covered by deserted steppe with low vegetation coverage and high soil permeability the stream water infiltrated into the active layer and was stored as supra permafrost water 4 1 3 the seasonal differences in contribution ratios of ground ice to streams it is clear that the meltwater from the ground ice contributed significantly to the stream water in both branches however the recharge ratios differed in different months fig 7 the melting of the ground ice displayed the maximum recharge volumes for the stream water in august which accounted for 24 31 31 90 of the total in contrast no contribution was identified in june in either of the branches the seasonal deviations in the recharge ratios of the ground ice were attributed to the differences in air temperature precipitation and vegetation coverage in june the relatively lower air temperature kept the active layer and near surface ground ice frozen and a larger amount of precipitation replenished the south and north branches in july about 5 38 17 5 of the inputs were from ground ice meltwater fig 7 due to the higher temperature induced thawing of the active layer and the following melting of the near surface ground ice however only 5 38 of the ground ice meltwater recharged to the south branch compared to 17 5 in the north branch fig 7 this was due to the differences in vegetation cover in the south branch the higher vegetation cover decreased the ground surface temperature and slowed the thaw rate of the active layer and subsequent melting of the near surface ground ice however in the north branch the low cover of deserted steppe was helpful in increasing ground temperature and the infiltration of the precipitation which both promoted the thaw of the active layer and the melting of ground ice in august the contribution of the ground ice meltwater increased significantly ranging from 24 31 to 31 9 mean ratio 27 94 fig 7 due to the substantial melting of the ground ice driven by the rising air temperature in this month the air temperature nearly reached the highest value in both years fig 4 and the thaw depth increased considerably thus the near surface ground ice would melt extensively to recharge the stream water in september and october the continuous melting of ground ice would replenish the stream water the gradual decrease in recharge volumes from august september and october reflected the differences in the amounts and covered depths of the remaining ice in august the uppermost ice would preferentially melt to recharge the stream however with the continuous melting of ice the top layer ice would melt out and the remaining ice in the deep layer began to melt to replenish the stream in september in october the low air temperature reduced the melting of the ice in the deep layer thus the recharge ratios declined from 27 94 in august to 5 67 fig 7 4 2 seasonal hydrological changes of thermokarst lakes in scg 4 2 1 seasonal evaporation variations of thermokarst lakes due to the climatic differences during the three months the evaporation degrees of lakes were varied the evaporation to inflow e i ratios and the d excess defined as d excess δd 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was usually used to reflect the evaporation characteristics of the lakes gibson et al 2017 narancic et al 2017 cui et al 2017 the e i ratios of the thermokarst lakes in the scg in july august and september were determined fig 8 a in order to identify the evaporation of the thermokarst lake fig 9 a the e i ratios in july ranged between 0 19 and 0 98 mean value 0 71 they were in the range of 0 44 0 96 mean value 0 64 in august and ranged from 0 003 to 0 43 mean value 0 09 in september the differences in the e i ratios in different months reflected the discrepancies in the evaporative influence on the lake water balance narancic et al 2017 the thermokarst lakes in september show strongly positive water balances and they showed the most evaporative control on the lakes in july the d excess displayed a similar trend during these three months fig 8b which is consistent with the e i fig 8 and δi results fig 9 the thermokarst lakes showed strongest evaporation in july due to low precipitation and high air temperature in contrast a higher precipitation and a lower air temperature were responsible for the weak evaporation in september additionally the input of the meltwater from the permafrost ground ice to the lakes may present fewer evaporative characteristics gibson et al 2015 narancic et al 2017 in this study the substantial contribution of the melting ice water to stream water in august and september fig 7 demonstrated this conclusion the higher air temperature and the abundant precipitation accelerated the thawing of the permafrost ground ice around the lakes that replenished the thermokarst lake and reduced the evaporation rate importantly contrast to the hoh xil continuous permafrost regions the sayr was identified as a warm permafrost region jin et al 2009 that was sensitive to temperature and numerous taliks occurred in the scg basin that increased the hydrological connectivities between the lakes and the groundwater spring these also attenuated the evaporative signals of the lakes 4 2 2 isotope framework of lakes and recharge sources identification in comparison significant differences in stable isotopes were shown between the thermokarst lakes and the other water components the thermokarst lakes displayed more positive isotopes suggesting strong evaporation in addition the stable isotopic points of some lakes located on the lmwl fig 9 and the d excess were close to the mean value of the precipitation which is suggestive of recharge by precipitation specifically the thermokarst lakes exhibited seasonal evaporation characteristics the stable isotopes were reduced from july to september indicating a gradual decrease in evaporation intensities fig 9d which reflects the influences of the air temperature precipitation and source water in july the calculated δi value 7 7 52 0 was more positive than the precipitation stream water ground ice and the spring fig 9a which suggests that the thermokarst lakes in july originated from water with positive isotopes field observation showed that most of these lakes reach the winter dried the higher vegetation cover around the lakes would intercept snow during the previous year after more than half a year of freezing and evaporation isotope fractionation happened to these snows which resulted in positive isotopes sokratov and golubev 2009 and in the warm season july the meltwater of the snow with positive isotopes was recharged to the lakes in august the calculated δi value 14 4 107 9 was more negative than the values for the summer precipitation spring and stream water but it was close to the value of the ground ice fig 9b this emphasizes the contribution of the near surface ground ice to the lakes previous analysis data pointed out the substantial input of ice meltwater to stream water in august when the nearly highest air temperature fig 4 and the quickly increased thaw depth aggravated the melt of the ground ice that would recharge the lakes lakes in september presented the most negative isotopes and some of them were located along the lmwl fig 9c the calculated δi value 9 9 70 8 was nearly the same for the summer precipitation fig 9c reflecting the control of the precipitation on the lake hydrology in this month 4 3 the formation and recharge sources of the near surface ground ice the stable isotopic profiles of the ground ice showed remarkably negative trends in δd and δ18o and positive trends in the d excess from top to bottom fig 10 between 115 cm and 135 cm the ground ice was enriched in δd and δ18o and depleted in d excess however the δd and δ18o tended to be negative and the d excess was inclined to be positive below 135 cm and δ18o and δd remained nearly stable at 14 and 106 respectively fig 10 the d excess fluctuated in a narrow range of 4 5 7 4 the differences between stable isotopes in the two sections are reflected the deviations in the initial source water of the ground ice between 115 cm and 135 cm the curves of δ18o and δd in the ground ice between 115 cm and 135 cm are show gradually negative trends fig 10 table 4 previous studies suggested that the formation of the near surface ground ice was closely related to the active layer hydrology yang et al 2017b here the isotopic value of upmost ground ice is close to that of annual average value of precipitation fig 11 under the control of the negative ground temperature gradient the water moisture in the active layer migrated from the top to the bottom and ice formed during slow freezing michel 2011 lacelle 2011 the slow freezing resulted in the stable isotopic fractionation wherein the heavier isotopes were preferentially concentrated in the solid ice while the residual liquid water was depleted in heavier isotopes and enriched in lighter isotopes which formed ice with lighter isotopes the freezing line was determined as y 6 3x 17 72 r2 0 99 in addition the regression analysis suggested a significantly negative relation between the d excess and the δd in this depth range fig 12 d excess 0 26δd 21 24 r2 0 8 which demonstrated the segregated origin of the ground ice between 115 cm and 135 cm lacelle 2011 the initial isotope value 11 8 92 6 was close to the annual average value of the precipitation fig 11 indicating the mixing recharge from precipitation yang et al 2017b and the precipitation originated active layer water throckmorton et al 2016 wang et al 2018b below 135 cm the δ18o and δd of the ice presented relatively stable conditions fig 10 with an average δ18o of 14 0 and an average δd of 105 9 table 4 the d excess was also fluctuating in a narrow range from 4 5 to 7 4 the freezing slope 5 2 was lower than that in the range between 115 cm and 135 cm this suggests that the ground ice formed in a cold environment by quick freezing the isotopic fractionation did not occur during rapid freezing thus there was little to no difference between the ice and the initial source water michel 2011 the calculated δi 14 4 108 1 was close to the average value of the winter snow 16 3 122 4 and the d excess 6 1 was similar to that of winter snow 7 7 therefore the ground ice in this depth range would originate from the meltwater of winter snow the accumulated snow would melt in the warm season and infiltrate into the active layer then quickly freeze into ice under a colder temperature that did not allow the occurrence of isotopic fractionation in addition according to the borehole data the ground temperature between 135 cm and 200 cm was nearly at 0 5 c luo et al 2018 with no temperature gradient existed which allowed no water migration thus the liquid water within this depth range froze in situ without isotopic fractionation additionally the weak d excess δd relation y 0 03x 3 38 r2 0 001 was similar to that of the precipitation and it was indicative of the precipitation origin lacelle 2011 table 5 4 4 hydrological connectivity mechanism between different water components the δd δ18o plot clearly shows significant hydrological connections between different water components fig 13 the isotopic dots of stream water in both the south and north branches are all located on the lmwl and overlapped by the spring reflecting the substantial recharge of the precipitation yang et al 2017a and the natural spring the soil water isotopes are concentrated in the range of the stream water suggesting the recharge relations between them in addition our filed result indicated that the stream water laterally and vertically infiltrated into active layer via in situ digging the ground ice is partially linked with the stream water and the winter precipitation indicating hydrological connections between them yang et al 2017a however the thermokarst lakes isotopically deviated from the precipitation stream water soil water spring and ground ice suggesting isotopic fractionation induced by strong evaporation yang et al 2016 gibson et al 2017 some of the lakes are located among the precipitation ranges which is due to the feed from summer precipitation the d excess presented obvious deviations in different water components the south and north branches showed comparable d excess trends in the study periods fig 14 reflecting the similar recharge sources the higher d excess was close to the average value of precipitation july august october in 2014 and june in 2015 fig 14 suggesting the control of precipitation on the stream hydrology and the lower values in august and september in 2015 fig 14 reflected the influence of evaporation and the input of ice meltwater the significantly negative d excess of the thermokarst lakes was indicative of the influence of strong evaporation on the lake hydrology cui et al 2017 ala aho et al 2018b the d excess of the soil water was close to the average value of the precipitation and was identical to the average value of the stream water fig 14 suggesting the replenishment of both precipitation and stream water the different patterns in the d δd relations of the water components reflected the origin and recharge processes lacelle 2011 yang et al 2017b in this study it was clearly shown that there were discrepancies in the d δd locations of different waterbodies fig 15 the precipitation presented wider variations in d excess and a weak correlation between d excess and δd emphasizing the seasonal variations of moisture sources of precipitation in the scg yao et al 2013 yang et al 2017a the stream water clustered in the center of the precipitation and overlapped with the ground ice and the spring denoting the hydrological connections between these water components and the feed of the precipitation spring and ground ice to the stream thermokarst lakes displayed different patterns than the other waterbodies fig 15 and the negative correlation between d and δd r2 0 36 reflected the impact of evaporation yang et al 2016 however some of the lakes were concentrated in the range of the precipitation and the stream field observation revealed that these lakes were small and shallow and covered by an alpine meadow they mainly received precipitation in the summer and were dried when reaching the winter and thus they had a short residence time and epitomized the precipitation signals 4 5 permafrost impacted hydrological variabilities in the sayr based on the stable isotopic and ec results a conceptual model was given in this study to illustrate the seasonal variations of the hydrological processes in the sayr in june the seasonal frozen layer in the sayr was characterized by low moisture contents due to freeze drying feldrnan 1988 although a high air temperature was present in this period fig 4 most of the surface ground was still frozen and the upmost layer had just began to thaw fig 16 luo et al 2018 thus the ground ice would not melt to replenish the stream water in this period the melting water of the snow covers in the last year and new precipitation was the main contributors to the stream water however due to the evaporation of snow and active layer lechler and niemi 2012 throckmorton et al 2016 the δ18o in june was enriched fig 16 the drying soil and the larger soil porosity resulted in the preferential infiltration of the precipitation into the soil to supply the moisture deficit therefore the discharge amounts of the stream in the scg were lower fig 4 from july to september the continuous high temperature fig 4 resulted in the gradual thawing of the active layer fig 16 and the near surface ground ice melted successively from top to bottom in these three months the stream water exhibited relatively negative δ18o values fig 16 which were interpreted as the mixing effect of precipitation and ground ice the moisture contents increased quickly due to the abundant precipitation and the thawing of the frozen soil ice and the melting water of ground ice could meltout to mix with the infiltrated precipitation in the active layer to recharge stream water with the gradual deepening of the active layer fig 16 more melting water from the ground ice entered the stream water fig 7 the considerable contribution mean ratio 22 5 of melting ice with negative isotopes table 2 and 18o depleted precipitation ren et al 2013 was responsible for the low δ18o of the stream water in october the stream water showed more positive δ18o values fig 16 it was attributed to the strong evaporation caused by the higher air temperature the lower input low precipitation in oct fig 4 of 18o depleted precipitation ren et al 2013 and the lack of meltwater from the ground ice fig 16 because all the near surface ground ice melted out during september no meltwater entered the stream in october thus the δ18o value was relatively positive our current conclusions on the role of ground ice were consistent with those in antarctica harris et al 2007 the high arctic paquette et al 2018 and the qtp zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2017a gao et al 2018b all of these changes would certainly alter the hydrological processes hydraulic connectivity and allocation of water resources in the sayr even on the qtp 5 conclusions in this study a comprehensive investigation of the hydrological characteristics in the sayr on the qtp was completed using isotopic tracers and in situ field observations the following findings were emphasized 1 the discharge conditions stable isotopes and the ec displayed significant seasonal fluctuations due to climatic conditions and diverse source water hydrograph separation results indicated that precipitation was the main source of stream water accounting for 53 5 52 2 of the total however the melting ground ice contributed 16 7 13 2 which cannot be neglected 2 the evaporation inflow e i ratios and d excess of thermokarst lakes evidenced seasonal evaporation differences in july the lakes were mainly fed by evaporative snow in the previous year they were significantly impacted by thawing permafrost in august and late summer precipitation and autumn precipitation were the main sources of them in september 3 high resolution stable isotopes of the ground ice between 115 cm and 200 cm suggested different ice formation mechanisms and initial source water the ground ice above 135 cm was closely related to active layer hydrology it was of segregated origin and was recharged by precipitation and active layer water however the ground ice below 135 cm was formed by quick freezing which was sourced from melting winter snow 4 the stable isotopic results and the conceptual model suggested that hydrological connectivities were evident between the precipitation stream water thermokarst lakes spring and ground ice under the context of continuous warming the permafrost and hydrological connections in the sayr will be altered significantly which will ultimately influence the allocation of water resources on the qtp conflicts of interest none acknowledgements we express our gratitude to the chief editor editor huaming guo and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive and insightful
