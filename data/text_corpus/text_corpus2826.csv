14130,this work investigated the effects of reactant concentrations and synthesis periods on in situ deposition of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fibers the separation performances of the zeolite membranes in forward osmosis applications were studied based on pure water fluxes and reverse solutes the reactant concentration of 0 66 m enabled zeolite membrane deposited onto glass hollow fiber to give a water flux of 4 50 l m 2 hr 1 with reverse solute of 0 05 kg m 2 hr 1 when the deposition time was reduced to 12 h and 18 h water fluxes increased to 62 25 and 71 92 l m 2 hr 1 respectively keywords zeolite membrane glass hollow fiber forward osmosis in situ hydrothermal synthesis 1 introduction recovery of fresh water from seas and oceans has been regarded as an alternative option to minimize water scarcity as they cover most of the earth s surface comprising approximately 97 1 various technologies have been used in desalination processes such as ion exchange electrodialysis and distillations 1 2 with attention shifting to membrane technology using the reverse osmosis process to harvest fresh water in a large scale however reverse osmosis is an energy intensive technology which is linked to greenhouse gas ghg emissions and other negative environmental impact such as organism impingement and brine disposal at the outfall 3 as an alternative to the reverse osmosis process forward osmosis fo has been considered to be a promising approach to water purification in overcoming challenges in water recovery the fo process utilizes an osmotic pressure gradient through a semipermeable membrane as a basic process in water purification the osmotic pressure gradient which is the driving force in the fo operation occurs when a semipermeable membrane is placed between a solution of high concentration draw and a solution of lower concentration feed although fo can be a solution for hydraulic pressure driven membrane processes it is not a substitute for reverse osmosis ro 4 polymeric membranes have been utilized extensively for fo processes however the disadvantages of polymeric membranes i e biofouling oxidation metal oxide fouling abrasion and mineral scaling due to their low stability have caused ceramic membranes to receive greater attention as fo membranes 5 this is due to the advantages of the ceramic materials themselves such as resistance to mechanical chemical and thermal stress high porosity and hydrophilic surface which is suitable for water treatment applications 6 nevertheless it should be noted that not all ceramic materials can be used as membrane materials for fo applications this is because conventional ceramic materials i e alumina and zirconia have limited pore structures resulting in such materials to lack the capability to effectively remove salt from water it is thus suggested that micro porous ceramic membranes i e zeolite be used as a material for the preparation of fo membranes as a ceramic membrane zeolite has gained attention as it has been proven to improve water treatment in terms of hydrophilicity surface charge porosity antimicrobial properties permeability and solute rejection 7 thus zeolite is considered a promising ceramic material to be applied in seawater desalination the hydrophilic nature of zeolite due to the presence of silanol sioh groups on its surface can render the membranes to have better resistance to biofouling 8 in addition zeolite membranes have been proven to have superior performance for ion removal from aqueous solutions by reverse osmosis ro processes which indirectly fit the fo processes 9 zeolite is frequently impregnated as a thin layer on polyamide membranes to improve water fluxes without large losses of salt rejection 7 8 10 jamali et al reported that zeolite nanosheet is a potential membrane for desalination as long as the pore sizes of the zeolite are smaller than 5 5 å thereby possessing a larger channel density for water permeation with cages size shell diameter of 6 5 å for salt rejection 9 the main mechanism of the separation solute rejection is the size exclusion of hydrated ions and electrostatic repulsion donnan exclusion at the intercrystalline pore entrance 11 the synthesis of zeolite has played a significant role in zeolite development since the past decade 9 zeolite is usually synthesized using hydrothermal crystallization in situ hydrothermal synthesis vapor phase transport a sol gel method chemical growth galvanic metal deposition leakage blocked method and microwave synthesis 12 15 commonly in situ hydrothermal approach will construct a thin dense layer of zeolite membrane becoming a very appropriate membrane for seawater desalination 12 parameters involving temperature reaction time and molar composition concentration in the zeolite synthesis will affect the performance of zeolites therefore this study aimed at preparing zeolite membranes by hydrothermal synthesis onto a glass hollow fiber the unique properties of glass fiber encompassing flexible geometric form and pore structure chemical inertness optical transparency high mechanical and thermal stability and reactive surface have resulted in glass membranes to be used in a wide range of applications 16 17 these advantages have made glass fiber a suitable support for zeolite membranes the phase inversion and sintering technique were adopted in preparing porous glass hollow fiber for the deposition of zeolite membranes this process enabled the porous glass hollow fiber to be produced in the simplest way compared to the conventional technique of glass membrane fabrication 18 in this work various parameters in preparing zeolite membranes were investigated namely synthesis duration and total molar concentration of reactants effects of these parameters on the physical and chemical properties of zeolites were correlated with the membranes performance in terms of water flux and reverse solute 2 experiments 2 1 materials zeolite 5a was purchased from sigma aldrich usa and used as a starting material the powder was dried at 60 c for 24 h before use commercially available yttria stabilized zirconia ysz powder with particle size of 0 3 μm d50 0 3 μm was purchased from fuel cell material and used as the ceramic particles mixed with the zeolite radel a300 polyethersulfone pesf was provided by ameco performance usa polyethyleneglycol 30 dipolyhydroxystrearate arlacel p135 was purchased from croda inc n methylpyrrolidone nmp was purchased from qrec new zealand sodium aluminate na2alo3 and sodium trisilicate na2o7si3 was purchased from sigma aldrich as alumina and silica sources respectively sodium hydroxide naoh was purchased from emsure darmstadt germany all chemicals were used as received without further treatment 2 2 preparation of glass hollow fiber porous glass membranes were prepared using the phase inversion based spinning technique following our previous method 18 1 wt of arlacel p135 was dissolved gradually in nmp solution before the addition of zeolite 30 wt and zirconia 20 wt particles later the suspension was rolled with different sizes of alumina agate milling balls 20 mm and 10 mm in a planetary ball milling machine nqm 2 planetary ball mill the process was continued for another 48 h after the addition of a polymer binder at a specific ratio of zeolite ysz and polymer tap water was used as both internal and external coagulants the extrusion rate and air gap were fixed at 10 ml min 1 and 15 cm respectively the hollow fiber precursor was further immersed in tap water for 24 h to complete the phase inversion process the hollow fiber precursors were then sintered in a tubular furnace xy 1700 china the sintering temperature was first increased at a rate of 3 ᵒc min 1 to 400 ᵒc where the thermolysis process a process where the polymer binder is removed was carried out for 1 h the temperature was further increased to 800 c at 4 c min 1 held for 2 h at this stage the polymer binder would have been burnt off leaving only the zeolite material the final sintering temperature was fixed at 1000 c with a rate 5 c min 1 and held for 8 h to allow the ceramic particles to combine becoming bigger grains finally the temperature was cooled down to room temperature at a rate 5 c min 1 2 3 synthesis of zeolite using in situ hydrothermal technique zeolite was prepared by dissolving sodium hydroxide naoh in distilled water and divided into two equal volumes sodium aluminate and sodium trisilicate were dissolved in naoh solutions separately the formed silica solutions were poured drop wise into a sodium aluminate solution while stirring vigorously the final solutions were then poured into a teflon bottle containing glass hollow fibers as zeolite support the hydrothermal process was carried out by placing the teflon bottle in an oven at 120 c for 24 h when this process was completed the membrane was washed with distilled water and dried the molar ratio of the zeolite solution composition is shown in table 1 2 4 membrane performance measurements fig 1 depicts the lab scale forward osmosis fo system the membrane was capped by epoxy at both ends without closing the membrane lumen a draw solution was prepared by dissolving nacl in deionized water nacl was chosen as it is easily characterized by osmotic pressure and diffusion coefficient 19 the concentration of nacl as the draw solution was fixed at 100 000 ppm crosscurrent mode was used as the feed solution fs and together with the draw solution ds were flowed in a closed loop separately the fs was flowed on the active layer of the membrane while the ds was flowed into the membrane lumen variable speed peristaltic pumps new era pump inc were used to pump the liquids with the difference in liquid mass weighted using a weighing balance smith water flux was measured by weighing the change in the fs over a selected period mass of the ds increased as water from the fs permeated across the membrane due to osmotic difference the water flux was calculated using eq 2 2 j w v t a where jw l m 2 hr 1 is water flux v is the volume of the permeability based on the mass change and density l v l mass kg density ρ t is time s and a is the total effective membrane area m2 reverse solute of nacl was determined by measuring conductivity of ds and fs using a conductivity meter eutech cond 6 thermo scientific singapore before and after fo filtration the reverse solute was calculated using eq 3 20 3 js f vt ct am δt where js kg m 2 h 1 is reverse solute v is the volume of the permeability based on the mass change and density l v l mass kg density ρ c is the nacl concentration kg l 1 t is time s and a is the total effective membrane area m2 all of the performances were repeated three times using membranes selected from a same batch the structure parameter s and the tortuosity factor τ were used to evaluate the concentration polarization phenomenon and calculated using eq 4 21 22 4 s lτ ε where l μm is the total membrane thickness and ɛ is the total porosity of the fo membrane 2 5 characterizations zeolite membranes were characterized using the x ray diffraction xrd field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms the cross sectional images of the zeolite membranes were obtained using the fesem zeiss cross beam 340 the membranes were snapped into 3 mm length and placed on a metal holder the fesem samples were coated with gold platinum mixture under vacuum for 3 min at 20 ma x ray diffraction xrd analyses of the membrane were carried out using philips pw1710 at scan rate 1 s ranging from 4 to 80 the membrane sample was finely grounded and mounted on a special plat holder prior to analysis nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were obtained using bet characterization micromeritics autopore iv the samples were degassed for 5 h at 350 c over night under vacuum condition prior to the measurement the pore volume and pore size distribution of the zeolite samples were acquired using the barret joyner halenda bjh model 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of glass hollow fiber for zeolite deposition glass hollow fiber was prepared using a zeolite suspension that was spun in a coagulation bath at an extrusion rate of 10 ml min 1 bore fluid of 9 ml min 1 and air gap of 15 cm the hollow fiber precursors were later sintered at 1000 c for 8 h to transform the zeolite particles into glass 18 the cross sectional image of the glass hollow fiber was acquired using the sem analysis as shown in fig 2 a ysz particles dispersed uniformly throughout the glass hollow fiber membrane it can be seen that the hollow fiber has an asymmetric membrane containing sponge like and finger like voids this was due to water used as a coagulant trapped in the cross section during the phase inversion process fig 2b shows the ftir spectra for the glass hollow fiber the peaks at 713 and 972 cm 1 denoted the vibration of overlapping symmetric and asymmetric of to bond where t is si or al while the peaks at 1362 and 1515 cm 1 denoted the ysz peaks this analysis confirmed the absence of chemical bonds between ysz particles and glass fig 2c shows the xrd spectrum of the glass hollow fiber ranging from 4 to 75 of the bragss s angles 2θ the results indicated that the glass hollow fiber has an amorphous phase the peaks at 30 50 and 60 represented the ysz whereas the peak at 34 represent the al2o3 the presence of al2o3 which was a by product formed due to zeolite sintering indicated a complete transformation of zeolite to the glass phase 18 23 26 3 2 effects of reactant concentration of the deposition of zeolite membrane onto glass hollow fiber zeolite membranes were prepared using three different reactant concentrations at 120 c for 24 h namely 0 13 m 0 22 m and 0 66 m respectively the atomic ratios between sodium aluminum and silicon for all these reactants were kept constant the purpose for the variation in the reactant concentrations was to study the deposition characteristics of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fiber the xrd analysis confirmed that zeolite a membranes prepared using different concentrations were successfully synthesized as shown in fig 3 zeolite membranes synthesized using the reactant concentration of 0 66 m had the highest number of zeolite xrd peaks however the number of these peaks was reduced when the concentration was reduced to 0 13 m this trend was due to the fact that the formation of zeolite crystals was influenced by the supersaturation in the zeolite gel which was dependent on the water content when the amount of water increased the supersaturation process which is typically followed by nucleation and crystal growth decelerated this will eventually slow the formation of the zeolite this process was completely halted when supersaturation did not occur 27 28 the fesem analysis was used to study the deposition of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fiber the results are shown in figs 4 and 5 at lower magnification the cross sectional images show the absence of any thick layer of zeolite on the outer surface of the glass support when zoomed at higher magnification the images show the presence of bulk particles on the cross section of the glass hollow fiber fig 4c iii shows particles deposited onto glass hollow fiber having a zeolite signature shape which was also dispersed into the macro void of the support fig 5 shows the fesem images of the outer surface of glass hollow fibers fully deposited with zeolite membranes variations in the shape of the zeolite grains with different reactant concentrations can be seen in fig 5a iii c iii as proved by the xrd results in fig 3 the zeolite grains synthesized using the lowest reactant concentration did not possess a cubical crystal shape which marks the shape of zeolite naa in contrast cubical shaped zeolites can be clearly observed using fesem when the reactant concentration was increased to 0 66 m the figure shows the zeolite membranes remained deposited on the glass surface even after a rigorous cleaning with water during post treatment and harsh preparation of the fesem analysis the glass hollow fiber is believed to be an excellent support for zeolite growth as the glass has an active surface hydroxyl group namely oh 29 30 a strong interaction between the zeolite membrane and glass hollow fiber could be formed due to intermolecular forces of hydrogen bonds and lone pair attractions hydrogen bond is formed through surface hydroxyl groups of both materials whereas lone pair attractions occur due to the interaction between oxygen ions in both zeolite and glass this explains the existence of lone pairs developing between oxygen ions in oh groups and na in zeolite n2 physisorption analysis was carried out on the zeolite samples to determine their bet specific surface area and total pore volume table 2 represents the textural properties of the zeolite naa particles synthesized at reactant concentrations ranging from 0 13 m to 0 66 m the results showed that the zeolite membranes synthesized in this work had low specific surface areas ranging from 2 32 to 14 38 m2 g 1 and low total pore volumes ranging from 0 016 to 0 129 cm3 g 1 typically zeolite has been known to possess high surface area but porous materials with a low specific surface and low total pore volume may be contributed by the synthesis condition at high synthesis temperature i e 120 c there was a reduction in the water content as water evaporated into the vapor phase this phenomenon caused a reduction in the size of the intra crystalline porosity 27 31 32 among the three samples the highest specific surface area was achieved by the zeolite membrane prepared using the reactant concentration of 0 22 m 14 38 cm3 g 1 with the highest total pore volume of 0 129 cm3 g 1 the range of pore size was determined using an isotherm graph and bjh pore size distribution n2 physisorption analysis was carried out to identify the presence of mesoporosity in zeolite membranes using n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and bjh mesopore size distribution as shown in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 demonstrated the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of zeolite membranes synthesized at different reactant concentrations the figure shows that all zeolite samples adsorbed insignificant amount of n2 represented by p p0 ranging from 0 0 to 0 3 this can be correlated with the absence of micropores in the zeolite membranes the figure shows that zeolite membranes prepared using various reactant concentrations have isotherms with hysteresis loop however the hysteresis loop of p p0 started at 0 6 and became significant above 0 9 indicating that the zeolite membranes had limited mesoporous structures the result also showed that the agglomeration of zeolite occurred during the synthesis process especially the zeolite prepared using a reactant concentration of 0 13 m this condition was represented by the significant n2 adsorption when p p0 0 9 agglomeration caused the formation of macro pores which enabled significant adsorption of n2 during the n2 adsorption desorption analysis bjh pore size distribution of zeolite membranes prepared using various reactant concentrations are shown in fig 7 the figures suggest that the zeolite membranes prepared in this work had a wide pore size ranging from 2 to 120 nm this result supports the finding discussed in fig 6 that predicted macroporous structure with pore size 50 nm would be formed due to agglomeration of zeolite the results also showed that all samples had a hierarchical characteristic 33 indicating the formation of uneven particle sizes this might give the zeolite membrane a mesoporous characteristic as different grain sizes had created a tangible gap between the zeolite grains 3 3 effects of in situ synthesis period on the deposition of zeolite membrane on glass hollow fiber to study the effect of the synthesis period on the deposition of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fiber this parameter was varied ranging from 3 h to 24 h using the reactant concentration of 0 66 m fig 8 shows the fesem images of the cross section and outer surface of zeolite membrane prepared using various synthesis periods it can be seen that zeolite membranes with a cubical a type characteristic were deposited on the glass hollow fiber for all samples zeolite membranes prepared for 3 h was not able to be deposited uniformly on the outer surface of the glass hollow fiber due to limited time for the deposition process when the synthesis period was increased the deposition process of the zeolite membrane improved it can be seen by the formation of a complete and continuous layer of zeolite prepared using 12 18 and 24 h synthesis time however zeolite membrane synthesized for 24 h was too dense which may inhibit water diffusion thus reducing permeability during the separation process the fesem images also show that the zeolite membrane prepared using in situ hydrothermal synthesis was able to grow firmly on the glass support as a thin membrane layer however the mechanism of zeolite deposited onto an inert support is complex which involves a number of reaction steps i e molecular self organization nucleation aggregation crystallization and growth the combination of these reaction steps in an in situ synthesis of zeolite is indeed a challenge particularly in obtaining the desired properties of the zeolite membrane 34 a similar phenomenon occurred when the zeolite was synthesized on the glass fiber the fesem images showed that zeolite membranes grew uncontrollably in both the outer surface and in the lumen of the glass fiber to study the crystallinity of the prepared zeolite membranes using different synthesis periods the xrd analysis was performed on all membrane samples the results are shown in fig 9 the results showed that zeolite membranes prepared using a synthesis period of 3 and 6 h were in the amorphous form whereas zeolite membranes prepared using a synthesis period ranging from 12 to 24 h were in the crystalline form this implied that an increase in the reaction time would enhance the crystallinity of the zeolite membrane zeolite membranes synthesized for 12 h had a characteristic of zeolite naa indicating this was the minimum synthesis period required in order to obtain this characteristic when the synthesis period was extended to 24 h diffraction peaks of the zeolite particles changed giving a different trend compared to zeolite particles prepared for 12 and 18 h with new xrd peaks appearing representing the formation of zeolite nax however zeolite naa still appeared on this sample based on the zeolite database included in the xrd analysis represented by it is expected that naa zeolite may exist as nax zeolite when the synthesis time was prolonged 35 to study the porosity of zeolite membranes prepared under various synthesis time n2 physisorption analysis was carried out on all samples to determine their bet specific surface area and total pore volume table 3 shows the textural properties of the zeolite naa prepared ranging from 3 to 24 h the results showed that all samples had low specific surface area and total pore volume except for samples prepared using the synthesis period of 12 and 18 h zeolite particles synthesized for 12 and 18 h had a specific surface area of 181 10 m2 g 1 and 134 62 m2 g 1 respectively both samples also showed a significant total pore volume of 0 106 m2 g 1 and 0 084 cm3 g 1 respectively an increase in the specific surface areas of zeolite membranes prepared with this range can be associated with the synthesis condition to obtain a high surface of zeolite naa various studies suggested that the synthesis process should be carried out at a synthesis temperature of 100 c for 24 h however in this work the synthesis temperature was increased to 120 c which was expected to enhance the zeolite deposition process onto the glass hollow fiber an increase in the temperature should be compensated with the reduction of synthesis time therefore a reduction in synthesis time from 12 h to 18 h may be an ideal duration for zeolite with high surface area to be produced further reduction in the synthesis time ranging from 3 h to 6 h caused a reduction in the surface area of the zeolite particles causing the formation of premature zeolites as proven by the xrd analysis fig 10 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms analysis for zeolite particles prepared using different synthesis times zeolite particles synthesized for 3 to 18 h displayed isotherms with hysteresis loop the hysteresis loop resulted from a specific pore in zeolite membranes that were filled with n2 at high pressures and emptied at low pressures zeolite membranes synthesized for 3 h 6 h and 24 h respectively were found to have n2 insignificant adsorption compared to zeolite membranes synthesized for 12 h and 18 h the results showed that zeolite membranes synthesized ranging from 12 h to 18 h had both microporous and mesoporous structures as these samples possessed high n2 adsorption at p p0 0 2 and 0 2 p p0 1 0 respectively high n2 adsorption of both regions enabled the zeolite membranes to possess high surface area as shown in table 3 to study the pore size distribution of the zeolite membranes at the mesoporous region bjh mesopore size analysis was carried out for all zeolite membranes synthesized at different synthesis times the figure shows that the zeolite membranes synthesized for 12 h and 18 h have similar pore size distributions ranging from 5 nm to 40 nm while zeolite membranes prepared for 6 h and 24 h have insignificant pore size distributions ranging from 10 nm to 50 nm absence of the mesopore structure in these membranes was proved by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms in fig 10 however zeolite membranes synthesized for 3 h showed significant pore size distribution similar to the zeolite membranes synthesized ranging from 12 h to 18 h referring to fig 10 the membranes possessed high n2 adsorption p p0 0 8 indicating existence of the mesoporous structure in the samples although this membrane has been categorized as premature zeolites using xrd analysis in fig 9 agglomeration of particles was expected to occur during the synthesis process it is expected that this condition may lead to the formation of mesoporous structures 3 4 performance of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fibers for salt removal the performance of zeolite membranes deposited on glass hollow fiber synthesized using various reactant concentrations and synthesis periods were evaluated based on the membranes water fluxes and rejections in this work a performance study was carried out using the forward osmosis system which required a draw solution to be introduced in the lumen and feed solution to be introduced on the outer surface of the membrane water fluxes were categorized as either positive ve fluxes or negative ve fluxes based on the membrane characteristics positive fluxes referred to the flow of water from dilute solution pure water to the concentrated solution following a natural phenomenon called the osmosis process negative fluxes refer to the flow of the draw solution which has a high solute concentration to feed solution with a negligible solute concentration however this condition was undesirable as the membranes used for the separation process contained defects that prevented the occurrence of the osmosis process from the feed solute to the draw solute 36 37 in this work nacl solution 100 000 ppm was used as the draw solution whereas di water was used as the feed solution table 4 shows the water fluxes and reverse solute fluxes of zeolite membranes prepared using reactant concentrations of 0 13 0 22 and 0 66 m via in situ hydrothermal process a separation process was also carried out using bare glass hollow fiber in order to compare the performance of zeolite membranes in rejecting salt the bare glass hollow fiber showed a water flux and a reverse solute of 600 00 l m 2h 1 and 511 97 kg m 2h 1 respectively these readings indicated that bare glass hollow fiber should not be used as a membrane for desalination although glass hollow fibers deposited with zeolite membranes prepared using reactant concentrations of 0 13 and 0 22 m showed improvements in terms of water fluxes and reverse solutes these improvements were still insufficient for efficient desalination this inefficiency is probably due to the zeolite membranes not being deposited uniformly on the glass hollow causing defects that halted the osmosis process the various concentrations used were not sufficient in producing defect free zeolite membranes when the reactant concentration was increased to 0 66 m the osmosis process started to occur which gave a positive flow of 4 50 l m 2h 1 with reverse solute of 0 05 kg m 2h 1 it is expected that within the synthesis period of 24 h the surface of glass hollow fiber would be fully deposited with zeolite membrane resulting in the absence of any defects and enabling osmosis to occur to study the optimum period of depositing zeolite membranes on glass hollow fiber the synthesis period was varied ranging from 3 h to 24 h this range was based on studies carried out by okamoto et al 38 and bayati et al 39 okamoto et al stated that the shortest reaction time to prepare naa zeolites via single step crystallization was 3 h 38 while bayati et al proposed a maximum time of 24 h for preparing zeolite 39 the performance of zeolite membranes in performing forward osmosis is listed in table 5 when in situ deposition time was reduced to 12 h and 18 h water fluxes increased to 62 25 to 71 92 l m 2 h 1 respectively reverse solutes for zeolite membranes in situ deposited for 12 h and 18 h were 0 11 kg m 2 h 1 and 0 05 kg m 2 h 1 respectively improvements in the separation performance can be correlated with porosity of the membrane both samples showed significant surface area and porosity to enable zeolite in facilitating the diffusion of water through its framework but halting high reverse solute to occur although zeolite membranes deposited in situ for 24 h had a positive flux the water flux was low surprisingly the membrane had an insignificant surface area and porosity as shown in table 3 and fig 11 when the deposition period was reduced to 6 h reverse solute increased significantly the membrane enabled the osmosis process to occur but it was too thin to resist any reverse salt from a high concentration liquid the zeolite membrane displayed poor separation performance when in situ deposition process was carried out for 3 h thus it can be assumed that synthesis time ranging from 3 h to 6 h was not sufficient to develop full fledged zeolites as support by the xrd analysis in fig 9 the internal concentration gradient icp is the common phenomenon occurred in fo process this phenomenon is undesirable as it will reduce the fluxes over a long period of membrane operation the concentration polarization effect could be measured by calculating the structure parameter s of zeolite membrane an increase in s value indicated that a significant effect of icp in the fo process the s values of zeolite membranes were tabulated in table 5 it was found that the s value was small and comparable to the traditional fo membranes that synthesized on porous polymeric supporting layers 22 the s value for zeolite membrane prepared for 24 h increased which can be correlated to the thick and dense layer of zeolite membrane on glass hollow fiber in fig 12 the s values for zeolite membranes prepared for 6 12 and 18 h were considered low which indicated an insignificant effect of the concentration polarization during fo process the separation performance of zeolite membranes prepared in this work in forward osmosis applications was compared with various studies as shown in table 6 the zeolite membrane prepared using a reactant concentration of 0 66 m and deposition time of 18 h had a water flux of 72 l m 2 h 1 and reverse solute of 0 05 kg m 2 h 1 in comparison to ma et al s work 40 the zeolite membrane prepared in this study showed a higher water flux possibly due to the peculiar properties of zeolite itself nevertheless the membrane still allowed low reverse solute in this work high concentrations of draw solution was used 100 000 ppm to evaluate the performance of the zeolite different from other works that used lower concentration ranging from 40 000 to 60 000 ppm as shown in table 6 this justifies the reason of slightly high reverse solute reported in this work as the salt may leeched into feed flow during fo process nevertheless zeolite membrane on glass hollow fiber still cannot match the performance of aquaporin membrane in fo this phenomenon can be associated with grain boundaries which is a type of defect for crystalline materials of zeolite membrane that may allow considerable amount of salt to migrate into feed flow causing significant reverse solute 37 this case is irrelevant to polymeric membrane that possesses continuous polymer phase 4 conclusion the effects of reactant concentrations and synthesis periods on in situ deposition of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fibers were studied xrd analysis confirmed the presence of the zeolite phase when the reactant concentration of 0 66 m and synthesis period ranging from 12 to 24 h were applied during the deposition process when the synthesis period ranging from 12 to 18 h was used zeolite particles were found to have significant bet surface areas the separation performances of zeolite membranes were studied using the forward osmosis system the reactant concentration of 0 66 m 24 h reaction period enabled the separation process to occur which gave a positive water flux of 4 50 l m 2h 1 with reverse solute of 0 05 kg m 2h 1 when in situ deposition time was reduced to 12 h and 18 h water fluxes increased to 62 25 and 71 92 l m 2 h 1 respectively reverse solutes for zeolite membranes deposited on glass follow fiber prepared for 12 h and 18 h were 0 11 kg m 2 h 1 and 0 05 kg m 2 h 1 respectively interestingly both samples were shown to have significant surface area and porosity enabling the zeolite membranes to facilitate the diffusion of water through its framework the separation performances of zeolite membranes prepared in this work were comparable to other studies in forward osmosis applications acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from various parties namely the islamic

14130,this work investigated the effects of reactant concentrations and synthesis periods on in situ deposition of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fibers the separation performances of the zeolite membranes in forward osmosis applications were studied based on pure water fluxes and reverse solutes the reactant concentration of 0 66 m enabled zeolite membrane deposited onto glass hollow fiber to give a water flux of 4 50 l m 2 hr 1 with reverse solute of 0 05 kg m 2 hr 1 when the deposition time was reduced to 12 h and 18 h water fluxes increased to 62 25 and 71 92 l m 2 hr 1 respectively keywords zeolite membrane glass hollow fiber forward osmosis in situ hydrothermal synthesis 1 introduction recovery of fresh water from seas and oceans has been regarded as an alternative option to minimize water scarcity as they cover most of the earth s surface comprising approximately 97 1 various technologies have been used in desalination processes such as ion exchange electrodialysis and distillations 1 2 with attention shifting to membrane technology using the reverse osmosis process to harvest fresh water in a large scale however reverse osmosis is an energy intensive technology which is linked to greenhouse gas ghg emissions and other negative environmental impact such as organism impingement and brine disposal at the outfall 3 as an alternative to the reverse osmosis process forward osmosis fo has been considered to be a promising approach to water purification in overcoming challenges in water recovery the fo process utilizes an osmotic pressure gradient through a semipermeable membrane as a basic process in water purification the osmotic pressure gradient which is the driving force in the fo operation occurs when a semipermeable membrane is placed between a solution of high concentration draw and a solution of lower concentration feed although fo can be a solution for hydraulic pressure driven membrane processes it is not a substitute for reverse osmosis ro 4 polymeric membranes have been utilized extensively for fo processes however the disadvantages of polymeric membranes i e biofouling oxidation metal oxide fouling abrasion and mineral scaling due to their low stability have caused ceramic membranes to receive greater attention as fo membranes 5 this is due to the advantages of the ceramic materials themselves such as resistance to mechanical chemical and thermal stress high porosity and hydrophilic surface which is suitable for water treatment applications 6 nevertheless it should be noted that not all ceramic materials can be used as membrane materials for fo applications this is because conventional ceramic materials i e alumina and zirconia have limited pore structures resulting in such materials to lack the capability to effectively remove salt from water it is thus suggested that micro porous ceramic membranes i e zeolite be used as a material for the preparation of fo membranes as a ceramic membrane zeolite has gained attention as it has been proven to improve water treatment in terms of hydrophilicity surface charge porosity antimicrobial properties permeability and solute rejection 7 thus zeolite is considered a promising ceramic material to be applied in seawater desalination the hydrophilic nature of zeolite due to the presence of silanol sioh groups on its surface can render the membranes to have better resistance to biofouling 8 in addition zeolite membranes have been proven to have superior performance for ion removal from aqueous solutions by reverse osmosis ro processes which indirectly fit the fo processes 9 zeolite is frequently impregnated as a thin layer on polyamide membranes to improve water fluxes without large losses of salt rejection 7 8 10 jamali et al reported that zeolite nanosheet is a potential membrane for desalination as long as the pore sizes of the zeolite are smaller than 5 5 å thereby possessing a larger channel density for water permeation with cages size shell diameter of 6 5 å for salt rejection 9 the main mechanism of the separation solute rejection is the size exclusion of hydrated ions and electrostatic repulsion donnan exclusion at the intercrystalline pore entrance 11 the synthesis of zeolite has played a significant role in zeolite development since the past decade 9 zeolite is usually synthesized using hydrothermal crystallization in situ hydrothermal synthesis vapor phase transport a sol gel method chemical growth galvanic metal deposition leakage blocked method and microwave synthesis 12 15 commonly in situ hydrothermal approach will construct a thin dense layer of zeolite membrane becoming a very appropriate membrane for seawater desalination 12 parameters involving temperature reaction time and molar composition concentration in the zeolite synthesis will affect the performance of zeolites therefore this study aimed at preparing zeolite membranes by hydrothermal synthesis onto a glass hollow fiber the unique properties of glass fiber encompassing flexible geometric form and pore structure chemical inertness optical transparency high mechanical and thermal stability and reactive surface have resulted in glass membranes to be used in a wide range of applications 16 17 these advantages have made glass fiber a suitable support for zeolite membranes the phase inversion and sintering technique were adopted in preparing porous glass hollow fiber for the deposition of zeolite membranes this process enabled the porous glass hollow fiber to be produced in the simplest way compared to the conventional technique of glass membrane fabrication 18 in this work various parameters in preparing zeolite membranes were investigated namely synthesis duration and total molar concentration of reactants effects of these parameters on the physical and chemical properties of zeolites were correlated with the membranes performance in terms of water flux and reverse solute 2 experiments 2 1

performance usa polyethyleneglycol 30 dipolyhydroxystrearate arlacel p135 was purchased from croda inc n methylpyrrolidone nmp was purchased from qrec new zealand sodium aluminate na2alo3 and sodium trisilicate na2o7si3 was purchased from sigma aldrich as alumina and silica sources respectively sodium hydroxide naoh was purchased from emsure darmstadt germany all chemicals were used as received without further treatment 2 2 preparation of glass hollow fiber porous glass membranes were prepared using the phase inversion based spinning technique following our previous method 18 1 wt of arlacel p135 was dissolved gradually in nmp solution before the addition of zeolite 30 wt and zirconia 20 wt particles later the suspension was rolled with different sizes of alumina agate milling balls 20 mm and 10 mm in a planetary ball milling machine nqm 2 planetary ball mill the process was continued for another 48 h after the addition of a polymer binder at a specific ratio of zeolite ysz and polymer tap water was used as both internal and external coagulants the extrusion rate and air gap were fixed at 10 ml min 1 and 15 cm respectively the hollow fiber precursor was further immersed in tap water for 24 h to complete the phase inversion process the hollow fiber precursors were then sintered in a tubular furnace xy 1700 china the sintering temperature was first increased at a rate of 3 ᵒc min 1 to 400 ᵒc where the thermolysis process a process where the polymer binder is removed was carried out for 1 h the temperature was further increased to 800 c at 4 c min 1 held for 2 h at this stage the polymer binder would have been burnt off leaving only the zeolite material the final sintering temperature was fixed at 1000 c with a rate 5 c min 1 and held for 8 h to allow the ceramic particles to combine becoming bigger grains finally the temperature was cooled down to room temperature at a rate 5 c min 1 2 3 synthesis of zeolite using in situ hydrothermal technique zeolite was prepared by dissolving sodium hydroxide naoh in distilled water and divided into two equal volumes sodium aluminate and sodium trisilicate were dissolved in naoh solutions separately the formed silica solutions were poured drop wise into a sodium aluminate solution while stirring vigorously the final solutions were then poured into a teflon bottle containing glass hollow fibers as zeolite support the hydrothermal process was carried out by placing the teflon bottle in an oven at 120 c for 24 h when this process was completed the membrane was washed with distilled water and dried the molar ratio of the zeolite solution composition is shown in table 1 2 4 membrane performance measurements fig 1 depicts the lab scale forward osmosis fo system the membrane was capped by epoxy at both ends without closing the membrane lumen a draw solution was prepared by dissolving nacl in deionized water nacl was chosen as it is easily characterized by osmotic pressure and diffusion coefficient 19 the concentration of nacl as the draw solution was fixed at 100 000 ppm crosscurrent mode was used as the feed solution fs and together with the draw solution ds were flowed in a closed loop separately the fs was flowed on the active layer of the membrane while the ds was flowed into the membrane lumen variable speed peristaltic pumps new era pump inc were used to pump the liquids with the difference in liquid mass weighted using a weighing balance smith water flux was measured by weighing the change in the fs over a selected period mass of the ds increased as water from the fs permeated across the membrane due to osmotic difference the water flux was calculated using eq 2 2 j w v t a where jw l m 2 hr 1 is water flux v is the volume of the permeability based on the mass change and density l v l mass kg density ρ t is time s and a is the total effective membrane area m2 reverse solute of nacl was determined by measuring conductivity of ds and fs using a conductivity meter eutech cond 6 thermo scientific singapore before and after fo filtration the reverse solute was calculated using eq 3 20 3 js f vt ct am δt where js kg m 2 h 1 is reverse solute v is the volume of the permeability based on the mass change and density l v l mass kg density ρ c is the nacl concentration kg l 1 t is time s and a is the total effective membrane area m2 all of the performances were repeated three times using membranes selected from a same batch the structure parameter s and the tortuosity factor τ were used to evaluate the concentration polarization phenomenon and calculated using eq 4 21 22 4 s lτ ε where l μm is the total membrane thickness and ɛ is the total porosity of the fo membrane 2 5 characterizations zeolite membranes were characterized using the x ray diffraction xrd field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms the cross sectional images of the zeolite membranes were obtained using the fesem zeiss cross beam 340 the membranes were snapped into 3 mm length and placed on a metal holder the fesem samples were coated with gold platinum mixture under vacuum for 3 min at 20 ma x ray diffraction xrd analyses of the membrane were carried out using philips pw1710 at scan rate 1 s ranging from 4 to 80 the membrane sample was finely grounded and mounted on a special plat holder prior to analysis nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms were obtained using bet characterization micromeritics autopore iv the samples were degassed for 5 h at 350 c over night under vacuum condition prior to the measurement the pore volume and pore size distribution of the zeolite samples were acquired using the barret joyner halenda bjh model 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of glass hollow fiber for zeolite deposition glass hollow fiber was prepared using a zeolite suspension that was spun in a coagulation bath at an extrusion rate of 10 ml min 1 bore fluid of 9 ml min 1 and air gap of 15 cm the hollow fiber precursors were later sintered at 1000 c for 8 h to transform the zeolite particles into glass 18 the cross sectional image of the glass hollow fiber was acquired using the sem analysis as shown in fig 2 a ysz particles dispersed uniformly throughout the glass hollow fiber membrane it can be seen that the hollow fiber has an asymmetric membrane containing sponge like and finger like voids this was due to water used as a coagulant trapped in the cross section during the phase inversion process fig 2b shows the ftir spectra for the glass hollow fiber the peaks at 713 and 972 cm 1 denoted the vibration of overlapping symmetric and asymmetric of to bond where t is si or al while the peaks at 1362 and 1515 cm 1 denoted the ysz peaks this analysis confirmed the absence of chemical bonds between ysz particles and glass fig 2c shows the xrd spectrum of the glass hollow fiber ranging from 4 to 75 of the bragss s angles 2θ the results indicated that the glass hollow fiber has an amorphous phase the peaks at 30 50 and 60 represented the ysz whereas the peak at 34 represent the al2o3 the presence of al2o3 which was a by product formed due to zeolite sintering indicated a complete transformation of zeolite to the glass phase 18 23 26 3 2 effects of reactant concentration of the deposition of zeolite membrane onto glass hollow fiber zeolite membranes were prepared using three different reactant concentrations at 120 c for 24 h namely 0 13 m 0 22 m and 0 66 m respectively the atomic ratios between sodium aluminum and silicon for all these reactants were kept constant the purpose for the variation in the reactant concentrations was to study the deposition characteristics of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fiber the xrd analysis confirmed that zeolite a membranes prepared using different concentrations were successfully synthesized as shown in fig 3 zeolite membranes synthesized using the reactant concentration of 0 66 m had the highest number of zeolite xrd peaks however the number of these peaks was reduced when the concentration was reduced to 0 13 m this trend was due to the fact that the formation of zeolite crystals was influenced by the supersaturation in the zeolite gel which was dependent on the water content when the amount of water increased the supersaturation process which is typically followed by nucleation and crystal growth decelerated this will eventually slow the formation of the zeolite this process was completely halted when supersaturation did not occur 27 28 the fesem analysis was used to study the deposition of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fiber the results are shown in figs 4 and 5 at lower magnification the cross sectional images show the absence of any thick layer of zeolite on the outer surface of the glass support when zoomed at higher magnification the images show the presence of bulk particles on the cross section of the glass hollow fiber fig 4c iii shows particles deposited onto glass hollow fiber having a zeolite signature shape which was also dispersed into the macro void of the support fig 5 shows the fesem images of the outer surface of glass hollow fibers fully deposited with zeolite membranes variations in the shape of the zeolite grains with different reactant concentrations can be seen in fig 5a iii c iii as proved by the xrd results in fig 3 the zeolite grains synthesized using the lowest reactant concentration did not possess a cubical crystal shape which marks the shape of zeolite naa in contrast cubical shaped zeolites can be clearly observed using fesem when the reactant concentration was increased to 0 66 m the figure shows the zeolite membranes remained deposited on the glass surface even after a rigorous cleaning with water during post treatment and harsh preparation of the fesem analysis the glass hollow fiber is believed to be an excellent support for zeolite growth as the glass has an active surface hydroxyl group namely oh 29 30 a strong interaction between the zeolite membrane and glass hollow fiber could be formed due to intermolecular forces of hydrogen bonds and lone pair attractions hydrogen bond is formed through surface hydroxyl groups of both materials whereas lone pair attractions occur due to the interaction between oxygen ions in both zeolite and glass this explains the existence of lone pairs developing between oxygen ions in oh groups and na in zeolite n2 physisorption analysis was carried out on the zeolite samples to determine their bet specific surface area and total pore volume table 2 represents the textural properties of the zeolite naa particles synthesized at reactant concentrations ranging from 0 13 m to 0 66 m the results showed that the zeolite membranes synthesized in this work had low specific surface areas ranging from 2 32 to 14 38 m2 g 1 and low total pore volumes ranging from 0 016 to 0 129 cm3 g 1 typically zeolite has been known to possess high surface area but porous materials with a low specific surface and low total pore volume may be contributed by the synthesis condition at high synthesis temperature i e 120 c there was a reduction in the water content as water evaporated into the vapor phase this phenomenon caused a reduction in the size of the intra crystalline porosity 27 31 32 among the three samples the highest specific surface area was achieved by the zeolite membrane prepared using the reactant concentration of 0 22 m 14 38 cm3 g 1 with the highest total pore volume of 0 129 cm3 g 1 the range of pore size was determined using an isotherm graph and bjh pore size distribution n2 physisorption analysis was carried out to identify the presence of mesoporosity in zeolite membranes using n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and bjh mesopore size distribution as shown in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 demonstrated the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of zeolite membranes synthesized at different reactant concentrations the figure shows that all zeolite samples adsorbed insignificant amount of n2 represented by p p0 ranging from 0 0 to 0 3 this can be correlated with the absence of micropores in the zeolite membranes the figure shows that zeolite membranes prepared using various reactant concentrations have isotherms with hysteresis loop however the hysteresis loop of p p0 started at 0 6 and became significant above 0 9 indicating that the zeolite membranes had limited mesoporous structures the result also showed that the agglomeration of zeolite occurred during the synthesis process especially the zeolite prepared using a reactant concentration of 0 13 m this condition was represented by the significant n2 adsorption when p p0 0 9 agglomeration caused the formation of macro pores which enabled significant adsorption of n2 during the n2 adsorption desorption analysis bjh pore size distribution of zeolite membranes prepared using various reactant concentrations are shown in fig 7 the figures suggest that the zeolite membranes prepared in this work had a wide pore size ranging from 2 to 120 nm this result supports the finding discussed in fig 6 that predicted macroporous structure with pore size 50 nm would be formed due to agglomeration of zeolite the results also showed that all samples had a hierarchical characteristic 33 indicating the formation of uneven particle sizes this might give the zeolite membrane a mesoporous characteristic as different grain sizes had created a tangible gap between the zeolite grains 3 3 effects of in situ synthesis period on the deposition of zeolite membrane on glass hollow fiber to study the effect of the synthesis period on the deposition of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fiber this parameter was varied ranging from 3 h to 24 h using the reactant concentration of 0 66 m fig 8 shows the fesem images of the cross section and outer surface of zeolite membrane prepared using various synthesis periods it can be seen that zeolite membranes with a cubical a type characteristic were deposited on the glass hollow fiber for all samples zeolite membranes prepared for 3 h was not able to be deposited uniformly on the outer surface of the glass hollow fiber due to limited time for the deposition process when the synthesis period was increased the deposition process of the zeolite membrane improved it can be seen by the formation of a complete and continuous layer of zeolite prepared using 12 18 and 24 h synthesis time however zeolite membrane synthesized for 24 h was too dense which may inhibit water diffusion thus reducing permeability during the separation process the fesem images also show that the zeolite membrane prepared using in situ hydrothermal synthesis was able to grow firmly on the glass support as a thin membrane layer however the mechanism of zeolite deposited onto an inert support is complex which involves a number of reaction steps i e molecular self organization nucleation aggregation crystallization and growth the combination of these reaction steps in an in situ synthesis of zeolite is indeed a challenge particularly in obtaining the desired properties of the zeolite membrane 34 a similar phenomenon occurred when the zeolite was synthesized on the glass fiber the fesem images showed that zeolite membranes grew uncontrollably in both the outer surface and in the lumen of the glass fiber to study the crystallinity of the prepared zeolite membranes using different synthesis periods the xrd analysis was performed on all membrane samples the results are shown in fig 9 the results showed that zeolite membranes prepared using a synthesis period of 3 and 6 h were in the amorphous form whereas zeolite membranes prepared using a synthesis period ranging from 12 to 24 h were in the crystalline form this implied that an increase in the reaction time would enhance the crystallinity of the zeolite membrane zeolite membranes synthesized for 12 h had a characteristic of zeolite naa indicating this was the minimum synthesis period required in order to obtain this characteristic when the synthesis period was extended to 24 h diffraction peaks of the zeolite particles changed giving a different trend compared to zeolite particles prepared for 12 and 18 h with new xrd peaks appearing representing the formation of zeolite nax however zeolite naa still appeared on this sample based on the zeolite database included in the xrd analysis represented by it is expected that naa zeolite may exist as nax zeolite when the synthesis time was prolonged 35 to study the porosity of zeolite membranes prepared under various synthesis time n2 physisorption analysis was carried out on all samples to determine their bet specific surface area and total pore volume table 3 shows the textural properties of the zeolite naa prepared ranging from 3 to 24 h the results showed that all samples had low specific surface area and total pore volume except for samples prepared using the synthesis period of 12 and 18 h zeolite particles synthesized for 12 and 18 h had a specific surface area of 181 10 m2 g 1 and 134 62 m2 g 1 respectively both samples also showed a significant total pore volume of 0 106 m2 g 1 and 0 084 cm3 g 1 respectively an increase in the specific surface areas of zeolite membranes prepared with this range can be associated with the synthesis condition to obtain a high surface of zeolite naa various studies suggested that the synthesis process should be carried out at a synthesis temperature of 100 c for 24 h however in this work the synthesis temperature was increased to 120 c which was expected to enhance the zeolite deposition process onto the glass hollow fiber an increase in the temperature should be compensated with the reduction of synthesis time therefore a reduction in synthesis time from 12 h to 18 h may be an ideal duration for zeolite with high surface area to be produced further reduction in the synthesis time ranging from 3 h to 6 h caused a reduction in the surface area of the zeolite particles causing the formation of premature zeolites as proven by the xrd analysis fig 10 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms analysis for zeolite particles prepared using different synthesis times zeolite particles synthesized for 3 to 18 h displayed isotherms with hysteresis loop the hysteresis loop resulted from a specific pore in zeolite membranes that were filled with n2 at high pressures and emptied at low pressures zeolite membranes synthesized for 3 h 6 h and 24 h respectively were found to have n2 insignificant adsorption compared to zeolite membranes synthesized for 12 h and 18 h the results showed that zeolite membranes synthesized ranging from 12 h to 18 h had both microporous and mesoporous structures as these samples possessed high n2 adsorption at p p0 0 2 and 0 2 p p0 1 0 respectively high n2 adsorption of both regions enabled the zeolite membranes to possess high surface area as shown in table 3 to study the pore size distribution of the zeolite membranes at the mesoporous region bjh mesopore size analysis was carried out for all zeolite membranes synthesized at different synthesis times the figure shows that the zeolite membranes synthesized for 12 h and 18 h have similar pore size distributions ranging from 5 nm to 40 nm while zeolite membranes prepared for 6 h and 24 h have insignificant pore size distributions ranging from 10 nm to 50 nm absence of the mesopore structure in these membranes was proved by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms in fig 10 however zeolite membranes synthesized for 3 h showed significant pore size distribution similar to the zeolite membranes synthesized ranging from 12 h to 18 h referring to fig 10 the membranes possessed high n2 adsorption p p0 0 8 indicating existence of the mesoporous structure in the samples although this membrane has been categorized as premature zeolites using xrd analysis in fig 9 agglomeration of particles was expected to occur during the synthesis process it is expected that this condition may lead to the formation of mesoporous structures 3 4 performance of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fibers for salt removal the performance of zeolite membranes deposited on glass hollow fiber synthesized using various reactant concentrations and synthesis periods were evaluated based on the membranes water fluxes and rejections in this work a performance study was carried out using the forward osmosis system which required a draw solution to be introduced in the lumen and feed solution to be introduced on the outer surface of the membrane water fluxes were categorized as either positive ve fluxes or negative ve fluxes based on the membrane characteristics positive fluxes referred to the flow of water from dilute solution pure water to the concentrated solution following a natural phenomenon called the osmosis process negative fluxes refer to the flow of the draw solution which has a high solute concentration to feed solution with a negligible solute concentration however this condition was undesirable as the membranes used for the separation process contained defects that prevented the occurrence of the osmosis process from the feed solute to the draw solute 36 37 in this work nacl solution 100 000 ppm was used as the draw solution whereas di water was used as the feed solution table 4 shows the water fluxes and reverse solute fluxes of zeolite membranes prepared using reactant concentrations of 0 13 0 22 and 0 66 m via in situ hydrothermal process a separation process was also carried out using bare glass hollow fiber in order to compare the performance of zeolite membranes in rejecting salt the bare glass hollow fiber showed a water flux and a reverse solute of 600 00 l m 2h 1 and 511 97 kg m 2h 1 respectively these readings indicated that bare glass hollow fiber should not be used as a membrane for desalination although glass hollow fibers deposited with zeolite membranes prepared using reactant concentrations of 0 13 and 0 22 m showed improvements in terms of water fluxes and reverse solutes these improvements were still insufficient for efficient desalination this inefficiency is probably due to the zeolite membranes not being deposited uniformly on the glass hollow causing defects that halted the osmosis process the various concentrations used were not sufficient in producing defect free zeolite membranes when the reactant concentration was increased to 0 66 m the osmosis process started to occur which gave a positive flow of 4 50 l m 2h 1 with reverse solute of 0 05 kg m 2h 1 it is expected that within the synthesis period of 24 h the surface of glass hollow fiber would be fully deposited with zeolite membrane resulting in the absence of any defects and enabling osmosis to occur to study the optimum period of depositing zeolite membranes on glass hollow fiber the synthesis period was varied ranging from 3 h to 24 h this range was based on studies carried out by okamoto et al 38 and bayati et al 39 okamoto et al stated that the shortest reaction time to prepare naa zeolites via single step crystallization was 3 h 38 while bayati et al proposed a maximum time of 24 h for preparing zeolite 39 the performance of zeolite membranes in performing forward osmosis is listed in table 5 when in situ deposition time was reduced to 12 h and 18 h water fluxes increased to 62 25 to 71 92 l m 2 h 1 respectively reverse solutes for zeolite membranes in situ deposited for 12 h and 18 h were 0 11 kg m 2 h 1 and 0 05 kg m 2 h 1 respectively improvements in the separation performance can be correlated with porosity of the membrane both samples showed significant surface area and porosity to enable zeolite in facilitating the diffusion of water through its framework but halting high reverse solute to occur although zeolite membranes deposited in situ for 24 h had a positive flux the water flux was low surprisingly the membrane had an insignificant surface area and porosity as shown in table 3 and fig 11 when the deposition period was reduced to 6 h reverse solute increased significantly the membrane enabled the osmosis process to occur but it was too thin to resist any reverse salt from a high concentration liquid the zeolite membrane displayed poor separation performance when in situ deposition process was carried out for 3 h thus it can be assumed that synthesis time ranging from 3 h to 6 h was not sufficient to develop full fledged zeolites as support by the xrd analysis in fig 9 the internal concentration gradient icp is the common phenomenon occurred in fo process this phenomenon is undesirable as it will reduce the fluxes over a long period of membrane operation the concentration polarization effect could be measured by calculating the structure parameter s of zeolite membrane an increase in s value indicated that a significant effect of icp in the fo process the s values of zeolite membranes were tabulated in table 5 it was found that the s value was small and comparable to the traditional fo membranes that synthesized on porous polymeric supporting layers 22 the s value for zeolite membrane prepared for 24 h increased which can be correlated to the thick and dense layer of zeolite membrane on glass hollow fiber in fig 12 the s values for zeolite membranes prepared for 6 12 and 18 h were considered low which indicated an insignificant effect of the concentration polarization during fo process the separation performance of zeolite membranes prepared in this work in forward osmosis applications was compared with various studies as shown in table 6 the zeolite membrane prepared using a reactant concentration of 0 66 m and deposition time of 18 h had a water flux of 72 l m 2 h 1 and reverse solute of 0 05 kg m 2 h 1 in comparison to ma et al s work 40 the zeolite membrane prepared in this study showed a higher water flux possibly due to the peculiar properties of zeolite itself nevertheless the membrane still allowed low reverse solute in this work high concentrations of draw solution was used 100 000 ppm to evaluate the performance of the zeolite different from other works that used lower concentration ranging from 40 000 to 60 000 ppm as shown in table 6 this justifies the reason of slightly high reverse solute reported in this work as the salt may leeched into feed flow during fo process nevertheless zeolite membrane on glass hollow fiber still cannot match the performance of aquaporin membrane in fo this phenomenon can be associated with grain boundaries which is a type of defect for crystalline materials of zeolite membrane that may allow considerable amount of salt to migrate into feed flow causing significant reverse solute 37 this case is irrelevant to polymeric membrane that possesses continuous polymer phase 4 conclusion the effects of reactant concentrations and synthesis periods on in situ deposition of zeolite membranes on glass hollow fibers were studied xrd analysis confirmed the presence of the zeolite phase when the reactant concentration of 0 66 m and synthesis period ranging from 12 to 24 h were applied during the deposition process when the synthesis period ranging from 12 to 18 h was used zeolite particles were found to have significant bet surface areas the separation performances of zeolite membranes were studied using the forward osmosis system the reactant concentration of 0 66 m 24 h reaction period enabled the separation process to occur which gave a positive water flux of 4 50 l m 2h 1 with reverse solute of 0 05 kg m 2h 1 when in situ deposition time was reduced to 12 h and 18 h water fluxes increased to 62 25 and 71 92 l m 2 h 1 respectively reverse solutes for zeolite membranes deposited on glass follow fiber prepared for 12 h and 18 h were 0 11 kg m 2 h 1 and 0 05 kg m 2 h 1 respectively interestingly both samples were shown to have significant surface area and porosity enabling the zeolite membranes to facilitate the diffusion of water through its framework the separation performances of zeolite membranes prepared in this work were comparable to other studies in forward osmosis applications acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from various parties namely the islamic

14131,a recyclable magnetic waste tyre activated carbon chitosan composite was synthesized as a suitable adsorbent material in the adsorptive parabens removal from model solutions and real wastewater samples characterization techniques such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy as well as x ray diffraction confirmed the formation of adsorbent material the results of brunauer emmett teller isotherms showed that the adsorbent has a specific surface area of 1281 m2 g 1 and pore size of 4 05 nm these results offer relatively high adsorption capacity for the parabens under optimised conditions kinetics results demonstrated that the adsorption fitted the pseudo second kinetic model while the simultaneous adsorption of methylparaben and propylparaben was described better by langmuir and redlich peterson isotherm models the maximum adsorption capacity for monolayer adsorption from the langmuir model as 85 9 mg g 1 and 90 0 mg g 1 for methylparaben and propylparaben respectively it was observed that the composite was stable after seven cycles of adsorption desorption with obvious loss of adsorption efficiency 95 therefore it was concluded that as prepared composite had considerable reusability properties which could make it a cost effective adsorbent for the removal of parabens from various media furthermore the eco friendly and cost effective magnetic adsorbent was used for remediation of parabens from wastewater samples and up to 100 removal was achieved keywords emerging contaminants parabens adsorption technology regeneration magnetic adsorbent 1 introduction parabens are esters in an alkyl group derived from the family of p hydroxybenzoic acid commonly used in cosmetic products pharmaceuticals food and beverages as preservatives due to their antifungal and antimicrobial properties 1 the four widely used preservatives in daily use products include butylparaben bp ethylparaben ep methylparaben mp and propylparaben pp which are either used singly or in combination 2 they offer advantages which include as low cost chemical and or thermal stability with other properties such as low toxicity odourless tasteless and non decolorization action 3 however studies have previously indicated that continued exposure to parabens even in low concentrations can cause alteration of the endocrine system pathway of vertebrates 3 recently evidence of parabens have been identified in human breast tumor tissues have been presented 4 and were also found to as cause of male infertility as a result of testis mitochondrial dysfunctions 5 in aquatic organisms parabens are considered toxic when the lethal dose lc50 are greater than 10 mg l 1 and less than 100 mg l 1 6 thus evidence of toxicity was provided by lee et al 6 where acute toxicity test conducted on daphnids daphnina magna revealed the lethal concentration lc50 values were 11 4 mg l 1 to 73 4 mg l 1 which therefore indicated that parabens could be to harmful to aquatic organisms therefore various legislations by different countries were introduced in order to control the use of parabens and reduce their potential health impacts on the environment as well as humans 7 the extensive use of parabens contributes largely to their distribution into the environment where the main pathway is via the domestic and industrial wastewater 8 despite the efficiency of treatment plant in removal of parabens some are said to be pseudo persistent under wastewater treatment processes as they have been detected in effluent wastewater at levels of sub ng ml 1 level concentration thus posing a risk to environmental waters 9 moreover conventional removal methods such as ozonation 10 chlorine dioxide treatment 11 and photosensitised degradation 12 are effective in removal of parabens but lead to production of disinfection by products 12 thus adsorption methods can provide a much safer and environmentally friendly alternative for the removal of parabens in wastewater 13 where a well designed adsorption process can results in high efficiency for high quality effluents after treatment which can be recycled 14 15 the efficiency of this technique is also dependent on the choice of adsorbent material which should be readily available cost effective should have no economic value and feasibility in regeneration 16 generally a wide variety of adsorbent material like carbon nanotube mesoporous silica biopolymers fly ash magnetic nanoparticles 17 activated carbon 18 and chitosan amongst others has been applied in the adsorption of different pollutants from aqueous solutions 19 recently a great interest has been to discover cost effective adsorbent material with adsorption capacities that are high such as biopolymers activated carbon and natural molecules particularly as adsorbents for organic pollutants like parabens 13 20 amongst the low cost sorbent chitosan has been used to fabricate polymeric sorbent for water decontamination 21 due to it being an eco friendly biopolymer easily obtained by alkaline deacetylation of chitin 22 in addition it has properties which include biodegradable bio compatibility non toxic and wide uses 23 moreover the existence of primary oh groups secondary oh groups and free nh2 groups on chitosan makes it a suitable support for chromatographic use 23 thus the use of chitosan in fabrication of several polymeric sorbent in water decontamination 24 however chitosan on its own presents some drawbacks based on its weak mechanical strength and dissolution in acidic solution 25 thus emphasis is placed on improving its performance by modifications to the physical and chemical properties where various common substances have been used as support for immobilizing chitosan and also forming sorbent were less quantities of chitosan are used 26 different types of material have been applied in order to form composites combined with chitosan such as polyanaline 16 perlite 27 magnetite 28 waste material from shoe material 18 29 waste tyre 30 31 activated carbon 21 25 32 34 amongst others activated carbon ac has been one very useful adsorbent in the removal of wide variety range of either organic or inorganic pollutants is 35 36 as such activated carbon from waste tyre offered attractive capabilities due to its attractive adsorption capacity surface area pore volume and pore size distribution 37 therefore this in turn allows effective distribution of contaminants on its large internal surface thus allowing for easy accessibility to reactants in this work the aim was to synthesize a magnetic waste tyre activated carbon chitosan mwtacc composite with magnetic properties by easier one step co precipitation method

1 preparation of waste tyre based activated carbon waste tyre activated carbon wtac was synthesized using a method described by our research group 37 briefly a pyrolysis process was used to prepare carbonaceous material where waste tyre was cut into small pieces from its sides in order to prevent the steel wires this pieces were then washed and put into quartz tube and placed in electric tubular furnace at 900 c under n2 purging 2 ml min 1 activation of obtained carbonaceous material was done by chemical activation method where hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was the activating agent using a microwave system for heating in the synthesis process this was carried out in terflon vessels in the microwave two separate carbon products were synthesized at differing power intensities 300 w and 600 w and irradiation time was kept constant at 15 min the desired ratio for chemical impregnation of material was set at 1 10 m m carbon black h2o2 final products for activation process from the microwave were washed to a neutral ph and then stored for further studies 2 5 preparation of magnetic waste tyre based activated carbon mwtac ferrous sulphate and ferric chloride solutions were dissolved at the ratio 1 2 fe2 fe3 and with 5 min stirring then 4 g of activated carbon was added with vigorous stirring into the solution and heated at 70 c subsequent addition sodium hydroxide naoh 100 ml into the mixture was performed with further heating at 70 c for 30 min once cool a magnet was used to remove the formed black precipitate during colour change of the mixture the formed mixture was then washed by ethanol water 50 solution for removal of any impurities lastly the obtained magnetic sorbent was dried in an oven at 80 c for 2 h 2 6 preparation of magnetic waste tyre activated carbon coated with chitosan mwtacc the synthesis of magnetic waste tyre coated activated carbon mwtacc was performed based on the methodology developed by shariffard and colleagues 25 briefly 17 5 g mwtac magnetic waste tyre based activated carbon synthesized above was poured in 0 2 m oxalic acid c2h2o4 for 2 h and washed using deionised water filtered and dried at 70 c in an oven for 12 h chitosan 10 g was then added into 1 l of solution c2h2o4 with stirring continuously at 40 50 c to form viscous gel thereafter 10 g acid treated mwac was added to the gel and stirred further at 45 50 c for 12 h coating of mwtac with chitosan beads was formed by adding mwac gel mixture drop wise to a naoh 0 7 m precipitation bath 2 7 batch adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments was performed on effects of significant parameters which included ph contact time adsorbent dosage and temperature on the adsorptive removal of two parabens onto the synthesized mwtacc this was done on a series of capped polypropylene bottles at room temperature 25 1 the preparation of standard solutions was by dilution of stock solution 50 mg l 1 of parabens mixture 1 1 of mp pp the adjustment of the ph of solutions to the required values 4 0 8 0 was performed by adding small amounts acetic acid 1 mol l 1 and ammonium hydroxide solution suitable quantities of the adsorbent 20 70 mg were added into clean polypropylene bottles and then 50 ml of parabens mixture with concentration ranging between 5 to 15 mg l 1 were mixed with synthesized sorbent this mixture was then sonicated for about 20 35 min the supernatant was then separated from sorbent in the presence of an external magnet fig 1 and filtered by means of a syringe filtered with 0 22 μm pvdf filters the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of mp and pp were measured using hplc dad the optimization of adsorption process was carried using experimental approach and table 1 summarizes the factors and their level calculations of the removal efficiency for mwtacc sorbent were done using eq 1 1 r e c o c e c o 100 while calculation of the adsorption capacity qe was done using eq 2 2 q e c o c i v m where m g adsorbent mass and v l is the volume of the liquid sample 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of adsorbent morphological properties for chitosan magnetic activated carbon and prepared mwtacc composite were studied by sem and the images shown in fig 2 a c as presented fig 2a shows smooth surface of chitosan with small pores whereas magnetic waste tyre activated carbon mwtac exhibited more porous structure fig 2c shows bead like porous structure these observations revealed that the introduction of chitosan resulted in the formation of bead like structures the elemental analysis done by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds fig 2d revealed c o n and fe confirming the existence of chitosan active carbon and fe3o4 fig 3 shows xrd patterns of waste tyre activated carbon chitosan and mwtacc xrd patterns for mwtacc indicated the presence of fe3o4 with six distinct peaks with 2 theta values at 30 1 35 4 43 1 53 4 56 9 62 5 pure chitosan comparison showed qualitative changes observed at 2θ 10 and 20 confirming that the incorporation of chitosan into mwtac changed the crystalline structure of chitosan moreover the binding process of chitosan did not cause a phase change of fe3o4 the tem images fig 4 of mwtacc particles indicated different contrast of sorbent were the darker areas present the fe3o4 while the bright regions are connected to activated carbon chitosan beads the tem images of the composite confirmed that the incorporation of chitosan resulted in the formation of beads fig 5 shows ftir spectra wtac mwtac mwtacc material were mixed with potassium bromide kbr at ratio 1 15 prior to characterization the ftir spectra for synthesized mwtacc sorbent showed vibration bands at 632 1 580 9 and 438 9 cm 1 to indicate characteristic peaks for magnetite 38 where the intense band at 580 9 cm 1 could be assigned to vibration of fe 2 o functional groups and the splitting up peak at 632 cm 1 was a result of octahedral b sites symmetry degeneration this is a feature not present in the wtac wtac shows 3 peaks 3386 9 1579 and 1125 cm 1 which are assigned to oh co and c o stretch vibration while for mwtac has peaks at 3386 9 and 1579 cm 1 corresponds with o h and co vibrations respectively the broad peak 1135cm 1 may be as a result of coating magnetite on the surface of activated carbon ac in the case of mwtacc the broad wide band at 3386 9 cm 1 corresponds to nh and oh stretch vibrations and also intramolecular hydrogen bonds as this indicates the interaction between amine groups in chitosan the bet surface area together with pore size and pore volume for mwtac composite chitosan mwtacc composite were measured using nitrogen adsorption desorption technique table 2 the mwtacc surface area slightly increased with addition of magnetic nanoparticles furthermore according to table 1 mwtacc composite bet surface area decreased after incorporation of chitosan slight changes in the surface characteristics of composite might be due to chitosan filling in the pores of wtacc composite point of zero charge phpzc defined as the colloidal particle s sliding plane of and associated with the particle surface charge 39 zeta potentials values for mwtacc are plotted in fig 6 obviously the phpzc for the mwtacc composite fell at ph 8 these results implied that the adsorbent surface was positively charged below the phpzc value while negative above the phpzc 3 2 optimization strategy effects of influential parameters were valuated i e mass of adsorbent sample ph for the removal of mp and pp from aqueous solution was using response surface methodology rsm obtainable via central composite design ccd pareto chart from the analysis of variance anova was applied to view the significance of the interactive as well as individual effects fig 7 if the bar length passes the 95 confidence level red line p value 0 05 it means that the factor or interactions is statistical significance according to pareto chart fig 7 for exploring the significant effect of assigned factors on the process of adsorption such are the sample ph initial concentration of sample inconc and also mass of adsorbent ma proved significant at the 95 confidence level contact time ct and interaction between the factors were insignificant at the 95 confidence level the three dimensional 3 d response surface plots shown in fig 8 are to demonstrate the simultaneous effect of a pair of variables in the removal of parabens while other factors were fixed at zero level central point as seen in this fig 8 several curvatures observed were ascribed to interaction between the investigated variables according to the 3 d plots the removal of mp and pp increases when the adsorbent mass was above 60 mg this results from the increasing surface area and also availability of binding sites on adsorbent this was also carried out under different ph ranges in which maximum recoveries were obtained at sample ph below 8 this is because at ph pka pka values for mp 8 17 and pp 8 5 the ionised forms of mp and pp are predominant while at ph pka the molecular forms will be the dominant in the solution 40 consequently as ph increases from 4 to values slightly below 8 point of zero charge the adsorbent surface is positive and ionised forms lead to an enhanced electrostatic attraction sample ph values above 8 led to decrease in re due electrostatic repulsion furthermore the adsorption of mp and pp on the adsorbent was conducted at different inconc of samples ranging from 2 to18 mg l 1 fig 5 it was observed from the response surface graphs that mp and pp adsorption efficiency was enhanced with inconc ranging between 8 and 10 mg l 1 with contact time between 20 60 min the reasoning behind this is that the adsorbent with a large amount of activated sites could provide sufficient adsorption sites for the two parabens the desirability function df for optimizing investigated variables at the same time applying the method of desired function fig 9 optimum conditions were mass of adsorbent at 64 mg initial concentration at 63 mg l 1 sample ph value 6 and contact time of 57 min with an overall desirability value of 1 00 contact time of 57 min was found to rather too high and it was reduced to 35 min the optimal conditions were validated experimentally and re of 99 3 was obtained these results agreed with the predicted values at 95 confidence level 3 3 adsorption models adsorption isotherms models are crucial in describing interaction behaviour of analytes and sorbent material 41 thus to optimise the design for the absorption process the establishment of the most suitable correlation for the equilibrium curve was of vital importance 42 the equilibrium data for the removal analysis of mp and pp was carried using different isotherms model such as langmuir model freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherms the linear expressions for each isotherm are presented in eqs 3 and 4 3 3 1 langmuir isotherm model this equation is applicable in homogeneous adsorption where adsorption of the individual absorbate molecules has equal sorption energy on the surface 43 linear expression of the model is expressed as 3 1 q 1 q max k l c e 1 q max where qm theoretical monolayer saturation capacity mg g 1 ce described as unadsorbed adsorbate concentration of a solution at equilibrium mg l 1 qe amount of adsorbed adsorbate per unit weight of adsorbent mg g 1 kl langmuir equilibrium constant l mg 1 in addition the crucial properties of the langmuir isotherm are presented in terms of a dimensionless constant called separation factor defined by eq 4 4 r l 1 1 k c l 0 where co highest initial concentration of absorbate mg l 1 and rl values denotes the shape of isotherms as either favourable 0 rl 1 unfavourable rl 1 irreversible rl 0 or linear rl 1 the equilibrium isotherm data for the adsorption for both parabens fitted langmuir isotherms with higher correlation coefficient r2 table s1 2 the langmuir isotherm proved the sorbent to be homogenous therefore thus assuming monolayer adsorption as all the sorption sites were uniform further observation indicated that values of qmax and kl were higher for adsorption of pp than mp moreover the separation factor rl lied between 0 and 1 0 rl 1 for both parabens showing that it was favourable adsorption process 3 3 2 freundlich isotherm models the most crucial multilayer adsorption isotherm to describe heterogeneous surfaces its linear form is expressed by eq 5 44 5 ln q e ln k f ln c e where qe mg g amount of mp and pp adsorbed ce equilibrium concentration of mp and pp in mg l 1 kf freudlich constant l g 1 and n freundlich exponent g l 1 the freudlich isotherms were tested in both parabens for sorbent mwtacc table 3 figs s3 and s4 the resultswhowed that the freundlich exponent n remained constant for both mp and pp adsorption while freundlich constant kf was found to be higher for pp than mp in addition the value of n was between 1 and 10 also proving that the process was favourable 3 3 3 sips adsorption isotherms this is a combination of two models langmuir and freundlich isotherms derived due to their limiting behaviour valid for confined adsorption without adsorbate adsorbate interaction 45 46 sips linear equation is expressed as eq 6 6 1 q e 1 q max k s 1 c e 1 n 1 q max where ks denotes sips equilibrium constant 1 mg qmax maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 and n describes surface heterogeneity therefore when n is between 0 and 1 it depicts heterogeneity but if n 1 the equation is reduced to langmuir and implies a homogenous adsorption process adsorption data for mp and pp were tested in sips model and results are depicted in table 4 figs s5 and s6 the sips isotherm constant ks increases slightly for pp as compared to mp while ns equals unity n 1 and was constant for both parabens indicating homogeity on the adsorbent surface 3 3 4 redlich peterson adsorption isotherms the model combines features of langmuir and freundlich isotherms which can be expressed as eq 7 where redlich peterson constants are krp l mg 1 and αrp r p isotherms also use similar parameters to that of sips isotherms equilibrium data for indicating the adsorption of both parabens was also fitted onto the redlich peterson isotherms and results given in table 4 figs s7 and s8 7 ln k r 1 b r ln c e ln α the parameters αr r p isotherm constant and βr exponent that lies between 0 and 1 if βr 1 then r p isotherm equation converts to langmuir equation and if βr 0 it is leans towards freundlich equation according to the αr data for r p isotherms in table 4 both mp and pp equilibrium data depicted the langmuir monolayer characteristic testing of both isotherm models it can be inferred that value of separation factor rl was between 0 and 1 for both parabens thus proving that the conducted absorption process were favourable thus the adsorption processes favoured langmuir isotherm this was due to their r2 values closer proximity moreover sips and redlich peterson isotherms constants ns and βr also proved that the prepared adsorbent surface nature was homogenous 3 4 adsorption kinetics investigate mechanisms for mp and pp onto the mwtacc composite where the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were studied results obtained showed table 5 s9 s16 the kinetic interaction of two parabens with the composite were best explained using pseudo second order and elovich models confirmed by high r2 values furthermore the calculated equilibrium adsorption amount qecal for pseudo second order model with that of experimental qeexp were in agreement pseudo second order undertakes that rate limiting factor for the adoption of parabens by mwtacc was determined by chemi sorption hence removal of mp and pp onto the composite was chemisorption more than physical sorption mechanisms of the adsorption process were studied by plots of intra particle diffusion and boyde plots where the parameters for both models are shown in table 5 3 4 1 pseudo first order pseudo first order model proposed by lagersen for adsorption analysis 47 the linear form is expressed by equation 8 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where k1 min 1 denotes pseudo first order adsorption kinetics parameter qt amount adsorbed at time t min while qe amount adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 the results for first order kinetics are shown in table 5 the amount of mp sorbed onto mwtacc at different times decreased with an increase in time similarly with pp adsorption moreover the values of the k1 were slightly higher for the adsorption of mp than pp a large deviation was also detected between experimental qe exp and calculated qe cal values this might have been caused by the poor fit of the data into pseudo first order kinetic model 3 4 2 pseudo second order pseudo second order model used to describe sorption kinetics where their linear form is expressed as eq 8 42 9 1 q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e where k2 g mg 1 min 1 denotes pseudo second order rate constant for adsorption if pseudo second order kinetic model is applicable a plot of 1 q t against t provides a linear relationship and from its slope and intercept k2 and qe can be deduced the plot of eq 8 gave excellent linearity r2 0 98 for the two parabens pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic parameters are determined by considering their correlation coefficient r2 thus based on table 5 the adsorption kinetics of mp and pp onto mwtacc was explained better by with pseudo second model either that pseudo first order based on the higher r2 value of pseudo second order in both parabens moreover qcal values estimated from the pseudo second order model were in close proximity to the experimental values qexp therefore this indicated that the adsorption of mp and pp onto the mwtacc was controlled by chemical processes adsorption process passes through various stages which involves the transport of absorbate from aqueous phase to the surface of adsorbent and also diffusion of the adsorbate to the interior of the adsorbent pores characterised a slow process 48 3 4 3 elovich model this model is mostly applicable for chemisorption processes where the model is presented as eq 13 13 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t where α denotes initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min while β relates to the extent at which the surface is covered and the activation energy is described as chemisorption g mg 1 this model was analysed so to recognize the rate determining step linear plot for the elovich model gave high correlation coefficients table 5 which suggested that adsorption process is governed by chemisorptions which takes into account the electrostatic interaction between adsorbent and parabens 3 4 4 intraparticle diffusion this equation is given by eq 10 49 10 q t k i d t 1 2 c where qt mg g 1 amount of solute on sorbent surface at a time t kid mg g 1 m1 2 intra particle diffusion rate constant this model is used for describing adsorption that is competitive the linear portion for extensive range of contact time of the plot between adsorbent and adsorbate did not pass through the origin or near saturation could be due to the variation of mass transfer in initial and final stage adsorption 48 thus indicating that the sorptive removal for both parabens consisted of the first boundary layer then intra particle diffusion constant c value intercept value that provides an indication of boundary layer thickness 50 was increased from 12 5 to 63 4 for mp and 0 84 to 69 3 for pp where the large value indicates a larger influence of the boundary layer therefore it was confirmed that adsorption of parabens was controlled by the intra particle and also liquid film diffusion model 3 4 5 boyd model to determine whether the adsorption process continued through an external or intraparticle diffusion mechanism the kinetics data was subjected to boyd kinetics model eq 11 51 11 b t 0 4977 ln 1 f where bt represents the mathematical function f where f is the fraction of the solute adsorbed at any given time t min calculated by eq 12 12 f q t q 0 where q0 amount of adsorbates at infinite time mg g 1 and qt is the amount of analytes adsorbed a given time t min bt values at various contact time are plotted against time t boyd plots table 5 revealed that the adsorption mechanism had an element external mass transport were particle diffusion because the linear plots which did not pass through the origin 3 5 stability and regeneration adsorption desorption regeneration experiments were done in order to investigate the reuse of mwtacc composite as this is a necessary feature in treatment processes for water this study regeneration of the adsorbent was carried according to previous studies reported elsewhere 52 the analytes were desorbed using methanol and the adsorbent was washed three times using deionised water before use recoveries of each analyte using the regenerated and recycled magnetic adsorbent are presented in fig 10 the results obtained demonstrated that recovery and adsorption for mp and pp were not affected for up to seven adsorption desorption cycles therefore this demonstrated the great reusability of the synthesized composite and also indicated its excellent regeneration properties thus magnetic waste tyre activated carbon coated with chitosan composite has the potential applicability in water treatment 3 6 applications in real samples applicability of mwtacc was analysed by carrying out adsorptive removal of mp and pp from influent wastewater samples the samples were first filtered to eliminate particulates and then analysed under optimum conditions the initial concentrations of mp and pp in influent wastewater were determined by solid phase extraction using the prepared adsorbent and the results were verified by using commercial spe cartridge table 6 the removal efficiency were 100 for both methylparaben and propylparaben table 6 therefore the results indicated that mwtacc can be applicable for adsorptive removal of mp and pp in real samples with complex matrix 3 7 comparison of mwtacc with other adsorbents the adsorption capacity of mwtacc for this study was compared with other adsorbent reported in literature table 7 it was observed that the as prepared adsorbent showed much higher adsorption capacity for mp and pp as compared the reported adsorbents in literature table7 4 conclusion the isotherm and kinetics of magnetic water tyre carbon chitosan based sorbet mcac on the uptake of parabens from water system was investigated the equilibrium data were fitted into langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherms models and according to results obtained the langmuir isotherm model made for the best fit this was indicated through the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 85 87 and 90 0 g g for mp and pp respectively moreover the kinetics models proved to follow a pseudo second order kinetic model than first order and this is evident on their r2 values meanwhile intra particle diffusion indicated that the boundary layer had less significant effects on the diffusion mechanism of the sorbate in addition the elovich model indicated that intra diffusion was the rate determining step in mp and pp adsorption by mwtacc this is proven by the higher correlation coefficients obtained compared to boyd model the magnetic sorbent presents advantages such as ease to use cost effective and could be separated easily from liquid solutions by using an external magnetic field declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

14131,a recyclable magnetic waste tyre activated carbon chitosan composite was synthesized as a suitable adsorbent material in the adsorptive parabens removal from model solutions and real wastewater samples characterization techniques such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy transmission electron microscopy as well as x ray diffraction confirmed the formation of adsorbent material the results of brunauer emmett teller isotherms showed that the adsorbent has a specific surface area of 1281 m2 g 1 and pore size of 4 05 nm these results offer relatively high adsorption capacity for the parabens under optimised conditions kinetics results demonstrated that the adsorption fitted the pseudo second kinetic model while the simultaneous adsorption of methylparaben and propylparaben was described better by langmuir and redlich peterson isotherm models the maximum adsorption capacity for monolayer adsorption from the langmuir model as 85 9 mg g 1 and 90 0 mg g 1 for methylparaben and propylparaben respectively it was observed that the composite was stable after seven cycles of adsorption desorption with obvious loss of adsorption efficiency 95 therefore it was concluded that as prepared composite had considerable reusability properties which could make it a cost effective adsorbent for the removal of parabens from various media furthermore the eco friendly and cost effective magnetic adsorbent was used for remediation of parabens from wastewater samples and up to 100 removal was achieved keywords emerging contaminants parabens adsorption technology regeneration magnetic adsorbent 1 introduction parabens are esters in an alkyl group derived from the family of p hydroxybenzoic acid commonly used in cosmetic products pharmaceuticals food and beverages as preservatives due to their antifungal and antimicrobial properties 1 the four widely used preservatives in daily use products include butylparaben bp ethylparaben ep methylparaben mp and propylparaben pp which are either used singly or in combination 2 they offer advantages which include as low cost chemical and or thermal stability with other properties such as low toxicity odourless tasteless and non decolorization action 3 however studies have previously indicated that continued exposure to parabens even in low concentrations can cause alteration of the endocrine system pathway of vertebrates 3 recently evidence of parabens have been identified in human breast tumor tissues have been presented 4 and were also found to as cause of male infertility as a result of testis mitochondrial dysfunctions 5 in aquatic organisms parabens are considered toxic when the lethal dose lc50 are greater than 10 mg l 1 and less than 100 mg l 1 6 thus evidence of toxicity was provided by lee et al 6 where acute toxicity test conducted on daphnids daphnina magna revealed the lethal concentration lc50 values were 11 4 mg l 1 to 73 4 mg l 1 which therefore indicated that parabens could be to harmful to aquatic organisms therefore various legislations by different countries were introduced in order to control the use of parabens and reduce their potential health impacts on the environment as well as humans 7 the extensive use of parabens contributes largely to their distribution into the environment where the main pathway is via the domestic and industrial wastewater 8 despite the efficiency of treatment plant in removal of parabens some are said to be pseudo persistent under wastewater treatment processes as they have been detected in effluent wastewater at levels of sub ng ml 1 level concentration thus posing a risk to environmental waters 9 moreover conventional removal methods such as ozonation 10 chlorine dioxide treatment 11 and photosensitised degradation 12 are effective in removal of parabens but lead to production of disinfection by products 12 thus adsorption methods can provide a much safer and environmentally friendly alternative for the removal of parabens in wastewater 13 where a well designed adsorption process can results in high efficiency for high quality effluents after treatment which can be recycled 14 15 the efficiency of this technique is also dependent on the choice of adsorbent material which should be readily available cost effective should have no economic value and feasibility in regeneration 16 generally a wide variety of adsorbent material like carbon nanotube mesoporous silica biopolymers fly ash magnetic nanoparticles 17 activated carbon 18 and chitosan amongst others has been applied in the adsorption of different pollutants from aqueous solutions 19 recently a great interest has been to discover cost effective adsorbent material with adsorption capacities that are high such as biopolymers activated carbon and natural molecules particularly as adsorbents for organic pollutants like parabens 13 20 amongst the low cost sorbent chitosan has been used to fabricate polymeric sorbent for water decontamination 21 due to it being an eco friendly biopolymer easily obtained by alkaline deacetylation of chitin 22 in addition it has properties which include biodegradable bio compatibility non toxic and wide uses 23 moreover the existence of primary oh groups secondary oh groups and free nh2 groups on chitosan makes it a suitable support for chromatographic use 23 thus the use of chitosan in fabrication of several polymeric sorbent in water decontamination 24 however chitosan on its own presents some drawbacks based on its weak mechanical strength and dissolution in acidic solution 25 thus emphasis is placed on improving its performance by modifications to the physical and chemical properties where various common substances have been used as support for immobilizing chitosan and also forming sorbent were less quantities of chitosan are used 26 different types of material have been applied in order to form composites combined with chitosan such as polyanaline 16 perlite 27 magnetite 28 waste material from shoe material 18 29 waste tyre 30 31 activated carbon 21 25 32 34 amongst others activated carbon ac has been one very useful adsorbent in the removal of wide variety range of either organic or inorganic pollutants is 35 36 as such activated carbon from waste tyre offered attractive capabilities due to its attractive adsorption capacity surface area pore volume and pore size distribution 37 therefore this in turn allows effective distribution of contaminants on its large internal surface thus allowing for easy accessibility to reactants in this work the aim was to synthesize a magnetic waste tyre activated carbon chitosan mwtacc composite with magnetic properties by easier one step co precipitation method

1 preparation of waste tyre based activated carbon waste tyre activated carbon wtac was synthesized using a method described by our research group 37 briefly a pyrolysis process was used to prepare carbonaceous material where waste tyre was cut into small pieces from its sides in order to prevent the steel wires this pieces were then washed and put into quartz tube and placed in electric tubular furnace at 900 c under n2 purging 2 ml min 1 activation of obtained carbonaceous material was done by chemical activation method where hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was the activating agent using a microwave system for heating in the synthesis process this was carried out in terflon vessels in the microwave two separate carbon products were synthesized at differing power intensities 300 w and 600 w and irradiation time was kept constant at 15 min the desired ratio for chemical impregnation of material was set at 1 10 m m carbon black h2o2 final products for activation process from the microwave were washed to a neutral ph and then stored for further studies 2 5 preparation of magnetic waste tyre based activated carbon mwtac ferrous sulphate and ferric chloride solutions were dissolved at the ratio 1 2 fe2 fe3 and with 5 min stirring then 4 g of activated carbon was added with vigorous stirring into the solution and heated at 70 c subsequent addition sodium hydroxide naoh 100 ml into the mixture was performed with further heating at 70 c for 30 min once cool a magnet was used to remove the formed black precipitate during colour change of the mixture the formed mixture was then washed by ethanol water 50 solution for removal of any impurities lastly the obtained magnetic sorbent was dried in an oven at 80 c for 2 h 2 6 preparation of magnetic waste tyre activated carbon coated with chitosan mwtacc the synthesis of magnetic waste tyre coated activated carbon mwtacc was performed based on the methodology developed by shariffard and colleagues 25 briefly 17 5 g mwtac magnetic waste tyre based activated carbon synthesized above was poured in 0 2 m oxalic acid c2h2o4 for 2 h and washed using deionised water filtered and dried at 70 c in an oven for 12 h chitosan 10 g was then added into 1 l of solution c2h2o4 with stirring continuously at 40 50 c to form viscous gel thereafter 10 g acid treated mwac was added to the gel and stirred further at 45 50 c for 12 h coating of mwtac with chitosan beads was formed by adding mwac gel mixture drop wise to a naoh 0 7 m precipitation bath 2 7 batch adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments was performed on effects of significant parameters which included ph contact time adsorbent dosage and temperature on the adsorptive removal of two parabens onto the synthesized mwtacc this was done on a series of capped polypropylene bottles at room temperature 25 1 the preparation of standard solutions was by dilution of stock solution 50 mg l 1 of parabens mixture 1 1 of mp pp the adjustment of the ph of solutions to the required values 4 0 8 0 was performed by adding small amounts acetic acid 1 mol l 1 and ammonium hydroxide solution suitable quantities of the adsorbent 20 70 mg were added into clean polypropylene bottles and then 50 ml of parabens mixture with concentration ranging between 5 to 15 mg l 1 were mixed with synthesized sorbent this mixture was then sonicated for about 20 35 min the supernatant was then separated from sorbent in the presence of an external magnet fig 1 and filtered by means of a syringe filtered with 0 22 μm pvdf filters the initial concentration and equilibrium concentration of mp and pp were measured using hplc dad the optimization of adsorption process was carried using experimental approach and table 1 summarizes the factors and their level calculations of the removal efficiency for mwtacc sorbent were done using eq 1 1 r e c o c e c o 100 while calculation of the adsorption capacity qe was done using eq 2 2 q e c o c i v m where m g adsorbent mass and v l is the volume of the liquid sample 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of adsorbent morphological properties for chitosan magnetic activated carbon and prepared mwtacc composite were studied by sem and the images shown in fig 2 a c as presented fig 2a shows smooth surface of chitosan with small pores whereas magnetic waste tyre activated carbon mwtac exhibited more porous structure fig 2c shows bead like porous structure these observations revealed that the introduction of chitosan resulted in the formation of bead like structures the elemental analysis done by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds fig 2d revealed c o n and fe confirming the existence of chitosan active carbon and fe3o4 fig 3 shows xrd patterns of waste tyre activated carbon chitosan and mwtacc xrd patterns for mwtacc indicated the presence of fe3o4 with six distinct peaks with 2 theta values at 30 1 35 4 43 1 53 4 56 9 62 5 pure chitosan comparison showed qualitative changes observed at 2θ 10 and 20 confirming that the incorporation of chitosan into mwtac changed the crystalline structure of chitosan moreover the binding process of chitosan did not cause a phase change of fe3o4 the tem images fig 4 of mwtacc particles indicated different contrast of sorbent were the darker areas present the fe3o4 while the bright regions are connected to activated carbon chitosan beads the tem images of the composite confirmed that the incorporation of chitosan resulted in the formation of beads fig 5 shows ftir spectra wtac mwtac mwtacc material were mixed with potassium bromide kbr at ratio 1 15 prior to characterization the ftir spectra for synthesized mwtacc sorbent showed vibration bands at 632 1 580 9 and 438 9 cm 1 to indicate characteristic peaks for magnetite 38 where the intense band at 580 9 cm 1 could be assigned to vibration of fe 2 o functional groups and the splitting up peak at 632 cm 1 was a result of octahedral b sites symmetry degeneration this is a feature not present in the wtac wtac shows 3 peaks 3386 9 1579 and 1125 cm 1 which are assigned to oh co and c o stretch vibration while for mwtac has peaks at 3386 9 and 1579 cm 1 corresponds with o h and co vibrations respectively the broad peak 1135cm 1 may be as a result of coating magnetite on the surface of activated carbon ac in the case of mwtacc the broad wide band at 3386 9 cm 1 corresponds to nh and oh stretch vibrations and also intramolecular hydrogen bonds as this indicates the interaction between amine groups in chitosan the bet surface area together with pore size and pore volume for mwtac composite chitosan mwtacc composite were measured using nitrogen adsorption desorption technique table 2 the mwtacc surface area slightly increased with addition of magnetic nanoparticles furthermore according to table 1 mwtacc composite bet surface area decreased after incorporation of chitosan slight changes in the surface characteristics of composite might be due to chitosan filling in the pores of wtacc composite point of zero charge phpzc defined as the colloidal particle s sliding plane of and associated with the particle surface charge 39 zeta potentials values for mwtacc are plotted in fig 6 obviously the phpzc for the mwtacc composite fell at ph 8 these results implied that the adsorbent surface was positively charged below the phpzc value while negative above the phpzc 3 2 optimization strategy effects of influential parameters were valuated i e mass of adsorbent sample ph for the removal of mp and pp from aqueous solution was using response surface methodology rsm obtainable via central composite design ccd pareto chart from the analysis of variance anova was applied to view the significance of the interactive as well as individual effects fig 7 if the bar length passes the 95 confidence level red line p value 0 05 it means that the factor or interactions is statistical significance according to pareto chart fig 7 for exploring the significant effect of assigned factors on the process of adsorption such are the sample ph initial concentration of sample inconc and also mass of adsorbent ma proved significant at the 95 confidence level contact time ct and interaction between the factors were insignificant at the 95 confidence level the three dimensional 3 d response surface plots shown in fig 8 are to demonstrate the simultaneous effect of a pair of variables in the removal of parabens while other factors were fixed at zero level central point as seen in this fig 8 several curvatures observed were ascribed to interaction between the investigated variables according to the 3 d plots the removal of mp and pp increases when the adsorbent mass was above 60 mg this results from the increasing surface area and also availability of binding sites on adsorbent this was also carried out under different ph ranges in which maximum recoveries were obtained at sample ph below 8 this is because at ph pka pka values for mp 8 17 and pp 8 5 the ionised forms of mp and pp are predominant while at ph pka the molecular forms will be the dominant in the solution 40 consequently as ph increases from 4 to values slightly below 8 point of zero charge the adsorbent surface is positive and ionised forms lead to an enhanced electrostatic attraction sample ph values above 8 led to decrease in re due electrostatic repulsion furthermore the adsorption of mp and pp on the adsorbent was conducted at different inconc of samples ranging from 2 to18 mg l 1 fig 5 it was observed from the response surface graphs that mp and pp adsorption efficiency was enhanced with inconc ranging between 8 and 10 mg l 1 with contact time between 20 60 min the reasoning behind this is that the adsorbent with a large amount of activated sites could provide sufficient adsorption sites for the two parabens the desirability function df for optimizing investigated variables at the same time applying the method of desired function fig 9 optimum conditions were mass of adsorbent at 64 mg initial concentration at 63 mg l 1 sample ph value 6 and contact time of 57 min with an overall desirability value of 1 00 contact time of 57 min was found to rather too high and it was reduced to 35 min the optimal conditions were validated experimentally and re of 99 3 was obtained these results agreed with the predicted values at 95 confidence level 3 3 adsorption models adsorption isotherms models are crucial in describing interaction behaviour of analytes and sorbent material 41 thus to optimise the design for the absorption process the establishment of the most suitable correlation for the equilibrium curve was of vital importance 42 the equilibrium data for the removal analysis of mp and pp was carried using different isotherms model such as langmuir model freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherms the linear expressions for each isotherm are presented in eqs 3 and 4 3 3 1 langmuir isotherm model this equation is applicable in homogeneous adsorption where adsorption of the individual absorbate molecules has equal sorption energy on the surface 43 linear expression of the model is expressed as 3 1 q 1 q max k l c e 1 q max where qm theoretical monolayer saturation capacity mg g 1 ce described as unadsorbed adsorbate concentration of a solution at equilibrium mg l 1 qe amount of adsorbed adsorbate per unit weight of adsorbent mg g 1 kl langmuir equilibrium constant l mg 1 in addition the crucial properties of the langmuir isotherm are presented in terms of a dimensionless constant called separation factor defined by eq 4 4 r l 1 1 k c l 0 where co highest initial concentration of absorbate mg l 1 and rl values denotes the shape of isotherms as either favourable 0 rl 1 unfavourable rl 1 irreversible rl 0 or linear rl 1 the equilibrium isotherm data for the adsorption for both parabens fitted langmuir isotherms with higher correlation coefficient r2 table s1 2 the langmuir isotherm proved the sorbent to be homogenous therefore thus assuming monolayer adsorption as all the sorption sites were uniform further observation indicated that values of qmax and kl were higher for adsorption of pp than mp moreover the separation factor rl lied between 0 and 1 0 rl 1 for both parabens showing that it was favourable adsorption process 3 3 2 freundlich isotherm models the most crucial multilayer adsorption isotherm to describe heterogeneous surfaces its linear form is expressed by eq 5 44 5 ln q e ln k f ln c e where qe mg g amount of mp and pp adsorbed ce equilibrium concentration of mp and pp in mg l 1 kf freudlich constant l g 1 and n freundlich exponent g l 1 the freudlich isotherms were tested in both parabens for sorbent mwtacc table 3 figs s3 and s4 the resultswhowed that the freundlich exponent n remained constant for both mp and pp adsorption while freundlich constant kf was found to be higher for pp than mp in addition the value of n was between 1 and 10 also proving that the process was favourable 3 3 3 sips adsorption isotherms this is a combination of two models langmuir and freundlich isotherms derived due to their limiting behaviour valid for confined adsorption without adsorbate adsorbate interaction 45 46 sips linear equation is expressed as eq 6 6 1 q e 1 q max k s 1 c e 1 n 1 q max where ks denotes sips equilibrium constant 1 mg qmax maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 and n describes surface heterogeneity therefore when n is between 0 and 1 it depicts heterogeneity but if n 1 the equation is reduced to langmuir and implies a homogenous adsorption process adsorption data for mp and pp were tested in sips model and results are depicted in table 4 figs s5 and s6 the sips isotherm constant ks increases slightly for pp as compared to mp while ns equals unity n 1 and was constant for both parabens indicating homogeity on the adsorbent surface 3 3 4 redlich peterson adsorption isotherms the model combines features of langmuir and freundlich isotherms which can be expressed as eq 7 where redlich peterson constants are krp l mg 1 and αrp r p isotherms also use similar parameters to that of sips isotherms equilibrium data for indicating the adsorption of both parabens was also fitted onto the redlich peterson isotherms and results given in table 4 figs s7 and s8 7 ln k r 1 b r ln c e ln α the parameters αr r p isotherm constant and βr exponent that lies between 0 and 1 if βr 1 then r p isotherm equation converts to langmuir equation and if βr 0 it is leans towards freundlich equation according to the αr data for r p isotherms in table 4 both mp and pp equilibrium data depicted the langmuir monolayer characteristic testing of both isotherm models it can be inferred that value of separation factor rl was between 0 and 1 for both parabens thus proving that the conducted absorption process were favourable thus the adsorption processes favoured langmuir isotherm this was due to their r2 values closer proximity moreover sips and redlich peterson isotherms constants ns and βr also proved that the prepared adsorbent surface nature was homogenous 3 4 adsorption kinetics investigate mechanisms for mp and pp onto the mwtacc composite where the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models were studied results obtained showed table 5 s9 s16 the kinetic interaction of two parabens with the composite were best explained using pseudo second order and elovich models confirmed by high r2 values furthermore the calculated equilibrium adsorption amount qecal for pseudo second order model with that of experimental qeexp were in agreement pseudo second order undertakes that rate limiting factor for the adoption of parabens by mwtacc was determined by chemi sorption hence removal of mp and pp onto the composite was chemisorption more than physical sorption mechanisms of the adsorption process were studied by plots of intra particle diffusion and boyde plots where the parameters for both models are shown in table 5 3 4 1 pseudo first order pseudo first order model proposed by lagersen for adsorption analysis 47 the linear form is expressed by equation 8 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where k1 min 1 denotes pseudo first order adsorption kinetics parameter qt amount adsorbed at time t min while qe amount adsorbed at equilibrium mg g 1 the results for first order kinetics are shown in table 5 the amount of mp sorbed onto mwtacc at different times decreased with an increase in time similarly with pp adsorption moreover the values of the k1 were slightly higher for the adsorption of mp than pp a large deviation was also detected between experimental qe exp and calculated qe cal values this might have been caused by the poor fit of the data into pseudo first order kinetic model 3 4 2 pseudo second order pseudo second order model used to describe sorption kinetics where their linear form is expressed as eq 8 42 9 1 q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e where k2 g mg 1 min 1 denotes pseudo second order rate constant for adsorption if pseudo second order kinetic model is applicable a plot of 1 q t against t provides a linear relationship and from its slope and intercept k2 and qe can be deduced the plot of eq 8 gave excellent linearity r2 0 98 for the two parabens pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic parameters are determined by considering their correlation coefficient r2 thus based on table 5 the adsorption kinetics of mp and pp onto mwtacc was explained better by with pseudo second model either that pseudo first order based on the higher r2 value of pseudo second order in both parabens moreover qcal values estimated from the pseudo second order model were in close proximity to the experimental values qexp therefore this indicated that the adsorption of mp and pp onto the mwtacc was controlled by chemical processes adsorption process passes through various stages which involves the transport of absorbate from aqueous phase to the surface of adsorbent and also diffusion of the adsorbate to the interior of the adsorbent pores characterised a slow process 48 3 4 3 elovich model this model is mostly applicable for chemisorption processes where the model is presented as eq 13 13 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t where α denotes initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min while β relates to the extent at which the surface is covered and the activation energy is described as chemisorption g mg 1 this model was analysed so to recognize the rate determining step linear plot for the elovich model gave high correlation coefficients table 5 which suggested that adsorption process is governed by chemisorptions which takes into account the electrostatic interaction between adsorbent and parabens 3 4 4 intraparticle diffusion this equation is given by eq 10 49 10 q t k i d t 1 2 c where qt mg g 1 amount of solute on sorbent surface at a time t kid mg g 1 m1 2 intra particle diffusion rate constant this model is used for describing adsorption that is competitive the linear portion for extensive range of contact time of the plot between adsorbent and adsorbate did not pass through the origin or near saturation could be due to the variation of mass transfer in initial and final stage adsorption 48 thus indicating that the sorptive removal for both parabens consisted of the first boundary layer then intra particle diffusion constant c value intercept value that provides an indication of boundary layer thickness 50 was increased from 12 5 to 63 4 for mp and 0 84 to 69 3 for pp where the large value indicates a larger influence of the boundary layer therefore it was confirmed that adsorption of parabens was controlled by the intra particle and also liquid film diffusion model 3 4 5 boyd model to determine whether the adsorption process continued through an external or intraparticle diffusion mechanism the kinetics data was subjected to boyd kinetics model eq 11 51 11 b t 0 4977 ln 1 f where bt represents the mathematical function f where f is the fraction of the solute adsorbed at any given time t min calculated by eq 12 12 f q t q 0 where q0 amount of adsorbates at infinite time mg g 1 and qt is the amount of analytes adsorbed a given time t min bt values at various contact time are plotted against time t boyd plots table 5 revealed that the adsorption mechanism had an element external mass transport were particle diffusion because the linear plots which did not pass through the origin 3 5 stability and regeneration adsorption desorption regeneration experiments were done in order to investigate the reuse of mwtacc composite as this is a necessary feature in treatment processes for water this study regeneration of the adsorbent was carried according to previous studies reported elsewhere 52 the analytes were desorbed using methanol and the adsorbent was washed three times using deionised water before use recoveries of each analyte using the regenerated and recycled magnetic adsorbent are presented in fig 10 the results obtained demonstrated that recovery and adsorption for mp and pp were not affected for up to seven adsorption desorption cycles therefore this demonstrated the great reusability of the synthesized composite and also indicated its excellent regeneration properties thus magnetic waste tyre activated carbon coated with chitosan composite has the potential applicability in water treatment 3 6 applications in real samples applicability of mwtacc was analysed by carrying out adsorptive removal of mp and pp from influent wastewater samples the samples were first filtered to eliminate particulates and then analysed under optimum conditions the initial concentrations of mp and pp in influent wastewater were determined by solid phase extraction using the prepared adsorbent and the results were verified by using commercial spe cartridge table 6 the removal efficiency were 100 for both methylparaben and propylparaben table 6 therefore the results indicated that mwtacc can be applicable for adsorptive removal of mp and pp in real samples with complex matrix 3 7 comparison of mwtacc with other adsorbents the adsorption capacity of mwtacc for this study was compared with other adsorbent reported in literature table 7 it was observed that the as prepared adsorbent showed much higher adsorption capacity for mp and pp as compared the reported adsorbents in literature table7 4 conclusion the isotherm and kinetics of magnetic water tyre carbon chitosan based sorbet mcac on the uptake of parabens from water system was investigated the equilibrium data were fitted into langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson isotherms models and according to results obtained the langmuir isotherm model made for the best fit this was indicated through the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 85 87 and 90 0 g g for mp and pp respectively moreover the kinetics models proved to follow a pseudo second order kinetic model than first order and this is evident on their r2 values meanwhile intra particle diffusion indicated that the boundary layer had less significant effects on the diffusion mechanism of the sorbate in addition the elovich model indicated that intra diffusion was the rate determining step in mp and pp adsorption by mwtacc this is proven by the higher correlation coefficients obtained compared to boyd model the magnetic sorbent presents advantages such as ease to use cost effective and could be separated easily from liquid solutions by using an external magnetic field declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest

14132,in this work the polyethersulfone pes based membranes were prepared via phase inversion technique in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp as a pore forming agent polydopamine pda coating followed by silver ag immobilization was then carried out on the pes pvp blend membrane to enhance the membrane wettability and antibacterial property respectively in total four different membrane samples namely pristine pes m1 pes pvp m2 pda pes pvp m3 and ag pda pes pvp m4 were produced the fabricated membranes were characterized with respect to physical morphology contact angle pure water permeability pwp humic acid ha and escherichia coli e coli rejection as well as antibacterial activity the pristine pes membrane m1 was reported to remove 77 81 ha and 96 4 e coli with the addition of pvp into the membrane matrix the ha and e coli rejection of m2 membrane was further improved to 79 94 and 99 33 respectively upon pda coating the m3 membrane recorded much higher rejection rate 89 97 and 99 85 respectively owing to the formation of additional layer that reduced membrane pore size it is interesting to note that complete elimination of e coli was able to achieve by immobilizing ag on the m4 membrane this membrane also exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity and the highest ha rejection among all the fabricated membranes keywords antibacterial membrane e coli silver immobilization polydopamine humic acid 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the top ten problems that human facing in the 21st century 1 despite 71 of the earth surface is water covered only less than 3 of the water is surface water and the rest are saline water unlike surface water saline water requires extensive treatment process to remove large amount of dissolved ions in order to meet the drinking water standard although surface water is easier to be treated it has been always reported to be polluted by human activities such as landfill mining dumping sewage and industrial waste as well as agricultural runoff the presence of natural organic matters noms in surface water sources can cause undesired color and taste in the water body humic substances constitute a major fraction of noms in surface water typically ranged from 50 to 80 2 3 humic substances can be categorized into humin fulvic acid and humic acid ha according to their solubility at different solution ph carboxylic phenolic alcohols and methoxyl carbonyls in ha molecules have the potential to react with other organic compounds and produce carcinogenic chlorinated by products such as trihalomethane and haloacetic acid 3 the presence of these pollutants in surface water have restricted its potential usage thus water reclamation related research works have received significant attention among the water reclamation processes membrane based technology offers several advantages such as small footprint easy operation relatively low cost low energy consumption consistent permeate quality and minimum usage of chemicals for membrane cleaning 4 7 polyethersulfone pes is a common polymeric material used for fabricating membrane via phase inversion technique owing to its robust properties such as high mechanical strength high thermal stability and wide ph tolerances 8 10 however the hydrophobic characteristic possessed by pes results in low water permeability and high fouling tendency 7 the deposition of particles and organic compounds on the membrane surface can lower the permeate flux and deteriorate the permeate quality in many situations 11 besides bacteria in the water source may colonize on the hydrophobic membrane surface generating biofilm that causes biofouling as a result the separation performance of the membrane is negatively affected biofouling also tends to increase energy consumption due to higher operating pressure and shorten membrane lifespan in order to tackle membrane fouling the surface chemistry of the membrane must be carefully tailored via membrane surface modification various membrane modification techniques have been adopted in the previous studies to improve membrane anti fouling properties these include blending surface grafting and coating using hydrophilic materials polydopamine pda is a promising candidate for membrane modification owing to its compact structure and strong adhesion towards different types of substrates 12 the monomer dopamine can easily oxidize self polymerize into pda and form a strong covalent bond with the membrane surface in a mild alkaline condition 10 13 14 the successful pda coating can be easily confirmed based on the color changes on the membrane surface the high anchoring capability of the pda layer allows its application in functionalizing and modifying several materials in different research fields 12 for instance cai et al 15 established pda coating on sericin polyvinyl alcohol composite film for antimicrobial application karkhanechi et al 16 meanwhile immobilized polyzwitterions on a pda coated commercial reverse osmosis membrane to improve the anti biofouling properties of the membrane the pda coatings are of interest in membrane modification as the thin pda film on the surface and bulk membrane could significantly improve membrane hydrophilicity typically a hydration layer composed of water molecules would act as a barrier to prevent foulant adhesion and reduce membrane fouling 17 the poor affinity of the pda coating towards hydrophobic foulants such as proteins bacteria and emulsified oil droplets also minimizes the direct contact between the foulants and the membrane surface 12 besides improving membrane anti fouling property the pda coating would reduce membrane pore size for better solute rejection 18 20 however the pda film may cause the water permeation to decrease in order to reduce the thickness of pda coating the concentration of the dopamine solution and coating duration shall be kept at minimum values 12 14 21 previous studies have reported that higher dopamine concentration and prolonged coating time would develop a thicker pda film which is likely to block membrane pores increasing water permeation resistance and reducing membrane flux 20 22 thus a dopamine solution of 2 g l was commonly adopted during pda coating to avoid severe flux decline 20 23 as for dopamine coating duration the exposure time must be sufficient to generate a stable pda film that would not be easily washed away this is rather important because the coated pda provides additional reaction sites and often used for further modifications which have been reported for functionalizing graphene 24 26 carbon nanotubes 14 27 and titanium dioxide 28 30 zhang and co workers have reported that 4 h pda coating time could synthesize an ultrathin pda film with excellent stability that is able to anchor silver ag particles achieving slow ag leaching rate of 0 184 mg cm 1 day 1 18 ag is well documented as a strong biocide against a broad spectrum of microorganisms regardless of its state ag0 or ag the direct interaction between bacterial cells and ag0 would cause the formation of hole and pits on the cellular surface 67 as a result the bacteria cells would have their cytoplasmic material leaking and begin to lose their morphological integrity several researchers opined that the antimicrobial activity of ag loaded membranes originated from the released ag ions the ag ions could bind with dna bases which inhibits the dna replication process by preventing bacterial cells from dividing and multiplying 68 besides faunce and watal 29 reported that the ag ions also targeted on mitochondria and induced swelling which further affected cell metabolism to date the exact toxicity mechanism of ag is remained unclear and debatable among the researchers however most of the researchers believe that both ag0 and ag are effective for antibacterial activity several methods of incorporating ag into a polymeric membrane have been reported in the literature these include blending 31 32 photo induced grafting 33 34 and in situ silver immobilization 18 19 35 it was found that the conventional blending method would distribute ag throughout the membrane structure thus lowering its antibacterial properties on the membrane surface 36 sawada et al 37 reported that the aggregation of ag in the membrane structure prepared via ex situ blending method would decrease the water permeability in situ silver immobilization seems to be a better option as the silver is deposited on the membrane surface 32 in fact huang et al 19 immobilized silver on pda coated membrane via a simple redox reaction owing to the metal binding ability of phenolic hydroxyl group in pda ag ions would be preferentially adsorbed on the pda film and resulted in the formation of ag on the membrane surface this would facilitate the release of ag into the solution and yield a better antibacterial property 32 it was reported that pda could be used as both polymer linker and reductant to improve ag nanoparticles coating on membrane surface 38 this bifunctional performance of pda serves as a simple and green route for the surface immobilization of ag nanoparticles 39 the dopamine monomer has metal ion chelating ability and redox activity thus it can reduce the adsorbed ag ions to form metallic ag0 in one step reaction 40 41 this property allows pda to act as a 3d matrix to enhance the adsorption of ag ion and promote high density growth of metallic ag0 hence pda would avoid the direct exposure of ag to oxygen and slow down the release of ag ions 15 nevertheless cai et al 15 suggested that the pda coating on a composite film surface could enhance the capacity of ag and improved antibacterial activity in short the hydrophilic pda coated membrane could prevent the adhesion of bacteria while ag imparted antibacterial property to the membrane in addition one of the pioneering works investigated the in situ formation of ag particles on the pda modified membrane surfaces for antibacterial properties was carried out by tang et al 42 the silver nitrate agno3 solution was reduced and ag particles were immobilized on the pda modified polysulfone psf membrane to mitigate membrane biofouling it was reported that the ag pda modified psf membrane could achieve 99 antibacterial capability in another study the ag pda coated pes membrane has exhibited 100 antibacterial efficiency as compared to 9 achieved by the pristine pes membrane 18 besides it was also reported that the ag pda coated polyacrylonitrile pan membrane could completely remove escherichia coli e coli and bacillus subtilis b subtilis with no bacteria being detected in the permeate 39 several researchers studied the effect of ag immobilization and pda coating on the antibacterial and salt rejection performance of the thin film composite polyamide psf membranes 23 43 they further affirmed that the ag immobilized membranes showed better rejection performance and antibacterial properties as compared to the control pda coated membrane although previous studies have demonstrated promising salt and dye removals using ag pda modified membranes we have yet to find any work using such membranes to mitigate fouling caused by noms in this study the separation performance of pristine pes pes pvp pda pes pvp and ag pda pes pvp composite membranes was evaluated using feed solution containing ha and e coli in addition the antibacterial activity against e coli was demonstrated using scanning electron microscope sem and diffusion inhibition zone test the cross sectional morphologies surface morphologies and chemical compositions of the modified membranes were also characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem scanning electron microscope sem fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscope x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps x ray diffractometer xrd and static water contact angle measurement besides a detailed practical approach to fabricate the anti biofouling composite membranes through the incorporation of hydrophilic pda adlayer and in situ immobilization of ag was graphically demonstrated in this study 2

temperature for phase inversion a flat sheet membrane was formed and stored wet prior to use 2 3 pda coating and in situ immobilization of silver on pes pvp blend substrate the fabricated membranes were fixed on a 15 cm x 10 cm acrylic frame with the active surface exposed to coating agent as shown in fig 1 an aqueous dopamine solution 2 g l in tris hcl buffer solution 0 05 m ph 8 5 was poured on the membrane and left in open air for 4 h dopamine would contact with oxygen from ambient air and be oxidized gradually to form a pda layer on the membrane surface the formation of pda layer could be easily detected by observing the changes of membrane surface color from white to dark brown the resultant membrane denoted as m3 pda pes pvp was rinsed with distilled water to produce membrane m4 ag pda pes pvp 1 g l of silver nitrate solution was poured on the active surface of membrane m3 and kept for 2 h the membrane was then rinsed with distilled water several times and stored wet at room temperature the coating procedure for membrane m3 and m4 is illustrated in fig 2 2 4 membrane characterization membrane surface and cross sectional morphologies were studied using field emission scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6701f japan and scanning electron microscope hitachi s3400n japan respectively prior to the cross sectional sem analysis the samples were prepared by cryogenic cracking and sputtered with gold quorum sc7620 uk the elemental composition of membrane samples was quantified by energy dispersive x ray spectroscope ametek apollo x usa fourier transform infrared spectroscope thermo scientific nicolet is10 usa was employed to determine the functional group bonding on the membrane the transmission spectra of all membrane samples were recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 after baseline correction at the resolution of 4 cm 1 membrane wettability was examined by sessile drop method using contact angle goniometer krüss gmbh germany about 0 2 μl of distilled water was dropped on the active surface of the membrane and the contact angle was measured immediately the measurement was repeated for three times at different locations and the values were averaged to obtain a mean value the metallic silver that deposited on the membrane m4 was characterized by x ray diffractometer shimadzu 6000 cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 0 3 ma using cu kα radiation the diffraction pattern on 2θ from 5 to 85 was collected at the scanning rate of 5 per minute the valence state of ag and surface elemental composition of the membrane m4 was further investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscope shimadzu axis ultradld the adopted radiation was mg kα and the survey spectrum was collected from 0 to 1000 ev furthermore the high resolution spectrum was collected from 363 to 383 ev to confirm the valence state of ag the long term stability of the immobilized ag was evaluated by filtering deionized water across the membrane m4 for 48 h at 1 bar during the filtration 15 ml of the permeate at different time intervals zero 6th 12th 18th 24th 30th 36th 42th and 48th h were collected the concentration of ag in the permeate was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscope perkinelmer icp oes optima 7000dv usa after calibration using standard solutions 2 5 membrane properties and performance testing 2 5 1 permeability test and pore size analysis the filtration experiment for the fabricated membrane samples was conducted using the dead end filtration cell sterlitech hp4750 with an effective membrane area of 14 6 cm2 the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 3 prior to pure water permeability pwp test the membrane samples were compacted at 4 bar for 30 min to ensure a steady flux the pwp of the membrane sample was calculated using eq 1 46 1 p w p q a t δ p where q is the permeate volume collected over a specified time l a is the membrane area m² t is the time taken to collect permeate h and δ p represents the operating pressure bar the membrane porosity ε was calculated using eq 2 39 46 2 ε w 1 w 2 ρ w a t e r w 1 w 2 ρ w a t e r w 2 ρ m e m b r a n e 100 where w 1 and w 2 are the wet and dry mass of the

test was conducted in the dead end filtration cell at 1 bar using 10 ppm ha solution the ultraviolet uv absorbance of ha in the feed and permeate were measured by uv visible spectrophotometer pg instrument t60u uk at 254 nm 44 by using a standard calibration curve the absorbance value was converted to concentration of ha where its rejection was subsequently calculated using eq 4 3 4 r h a 1 c p c f 100 where r h a is the percentage rejection of ha c p and c f are the concentration of ha in permeate and feed respectively 2 5 3 antibacterial test 2 5 3 1 diffusion inhibition zone test the antibacterial properties of the membranes were investigated by diffusion inhibition zone test a qualitative study on the bacteriostatic effect of fabricated membranes based on disk diffusion assay 100 μl of bacteria inoculum containing 3 108 colony forming unit cfu ml of e coli was dropped and spread on a sterilized agar plate a piece of circular shaped membrane coupon diameter 1 5 cm was irradiated by uv light before placing on the agar plate with its active surface facing the nutrient agar the agar plates were sealed with parafilm and incubated overnight at 37 c the bacterial inhibition zone defined as a zone around the disk where no bacteria growth was observed to compare the bacteriostatic effect of the fabricated membrane 2 5 3 2 sem observation of bacteria contaminated membrane sample membrane samples were cut into circular shaped of 5 mm diameter followed by uv irradiation before placing on the agar plate with its active surface facing upwards 50 μl of bacteria inoculum containing 3 108 cfu ml of e coli was dropped on the active surface of the membrane coupon the agar plates were sealed with parafilm and incubated overnight at 37 c the live and dead cells remained on the membrane surface were then observed by sem to study the membrane antibacterial effect 2 5 4 bacteria removal performance by filtration 50 ml of e coli suspension at 3 108 cfu ml was fed into the dead end filtration cell and filtered across the membrane samples at 1 bar all parts of filtration setup and apparatus which were in contact with e coli were sterilized under uv irradiation before and after the experiment the permeate was collected and spread plate count was conducted right after the bacteria filtration serial dilution was conducted to ensure the number of colonies formed on the agar plate is always within the countable range which is from 30 to 300 colonies per plate 100 μl of diluted permeate was dropped and spread on a sterilized agar plate then incubated at 37 c the number of colonies formed in the agar plate was counted after 24 h and the results were reported in cfu ml the bacterial removal percentage was calculated using eq 5 5 r b a 1 b

membrane characterization 3 1 1 morphological and elemental analysis fig 4 shows the cross sectional morphologies of fabricated membranes all the membranes exhibit asymmetric structure consisting of a top sublayer with finger like structure and bottom sublayer with macrovoids the control membrane m1 showed blocked pore channels while several long and thin macrovoid extended to the top sublayer the undesired poor distribution of the pores and channels could deteriorate membrane performance in terms of permeability and rejection tests our findings were similar to the results reported by chong et al 48 for the membranes fabricated without pvp the membrane structure was dense and packed due to a delayed solvent and non solvent exchange during phase inversion in contrast the addition of 3 pvp as a pore forming agent into the membrane m2 m3 and m4 had significantly altered their cross sectional morphologies as shown in fig 4 the skin layers of these membranes were denser and the finger like structures were longer this was in agreement with the previous study that thicker membrane skin layer was observed at higher pvp loadings 45 besides the finger like structure in membrane m2 m3 and m4 were open and evenly distributed this provides an insight that these membranes would have higher water permeability and probably better separation performance as compared to membrane m1 it was previously explained that the addition of pvp as a hydrophilic polymer would enhance thermodynamic instability in the dope inducing instantaneous demixing associated with the formation of macrovoids 49 as a result a more porous membrane structure with larger macrovoids was observed in the membrane m2 m3 and m4 as compared to the membrane m1 from the cross sectional sem images no considerable difference in bulk morphologies between the membrane m2 m3 and m4 could be observed since the pda coating and silver immobilization was performed after membrane formation this showed that pda coating and silver immobilization did not alter the cross sectional morphology fig 5 shows the fesem surface images of the fabricated membranes the membrane m1 showed irregular pore size distribution under magnification of 10 000 apart from the tiny pores several huge pores could be observed on the surface of the membrane m1 which could be responsible for a low rejection performance owing to a poor molecular sieving mechanism with the addition of 3 pvp as a pore sizing agent the surface pore distribution of the membrane m2 was comparatively more even than the membrane m1 large surface pores had been disappeared from the membrane m2 and therefore a better rejection performance could be expected upon 4 h dopamine coating a continuous pda layer with scattering pda particles was formed on the surface of membrane m3 the membrane pores appeared to be covered by the pda film hence became no longer visible under fesem our observation is similar to the work reported in the literature 18 42 numerous bright spots found on the surface of membrane m4 are due to the presence of immobilized ag particles through the reduction of silver ions by the functional groups on pda 42 50 although the immobilized ag particles were uniformly distributed with minimum agglomeration they tended to block the membrane surface and subsequently led to a lower permeability compared to the membrane m3 table 2 presents the elemental composition of the fabricated membranes the pristine pes membrane m1 displayed only carbon c sulphur s and oxygen o in the edx spectrum for the membrane m2 the blended pvp molecules had a greater affinity towards water than the solvent nmp and a substantial amount of pvp would leach out from the membrane matrix during phase inversion 47 51 hence only a trace amount of nitrogen n was detected in the membrane m2 meanwhile the presence of pda on the membrane m3 and m4 could be confirmed with the detection of 5 32 at and 3 42 at n respectively due to the presence of amine groups the additional ag element was found in the membrane m4 which suggested that ag had been successfully immobilized on the pda support 3 1 2 ftir spectra analysis the ftir spectra of the fabricated membranes over the wavelength range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 are shown in fig 6 in general all membranes displayed similar ftir spectra as they were made of the same polymeric material the sulfonyl stretching peaks were found at 1105 and 1150 cm 1 while the coc stretching peak was captured at 1240 cm 1 23 52 besides the absorption peak at 1420 cm 1 was due to aromatic skeletal vibration 53 a benzene ring cc stretching was observed at 1480 cm 1 and 1575 cm 1 23 while ch stretching peak of benzene ring contributed to a broad band at 3080 cm 1 52 some researchers reported that the use of pda as membrane surface coating material would result in a peak at 3400 cm 1 owing to the vibration of catechol oh groups and nh groups 10 19 however no obvious difference could be observed between the membrane m2 and m3 probably due to the thin pda layer and overlapped peaks on top of that the pda coating also exhibited an absorption peak at 1610 cm 1 due to nh bending vibration and aromatic ring stretching 10 15 this peak might overlap with the absorption peak at 1650 cm 1 caused by the carbonyl of pvp molecules 7 19 55 owing to this the membrane m2 m3 and m4 displayed an absorption peak at 1650 cm 1 but it is not visible in the spectrum of m1 3 1 3 contact angle the contact angles for fabricated membranes are tabulated in table 3 as a semi hydrophobic material the pristine pes membrane exhibited a static water contact angle of 73 73 0 61 the addition of 3 wt hydrophilic pvp into the dope solution of membrane m2 has reduced its contact angle to 70 90 0 38 suggesting this membrane was less hydrophobic than the membrane m1 it could be due to the trapped pvp in the pes membrane that formed an integral part of the polymeric structure and yielded a more hydrophilic polymer surface 55 furthermore the incorporation of hydrophilic pda on the membrane m3 significantly enhanced membrane hydrophilicity by decreasing the contact angle to 62 11 0 26 the improvement is due to the enrichment of catechol quinone and amine functional groups in the pda film that carrying hydrophilic groups oh and nh 19 42 50 the presence of ag on the pda coated membrane further improved membrane hydrophilicity achieving contact angle of 59 84 0 53 the immobilization of ag would increase the membrane surface roughness for better deposition of more water molecules on the membrane surface 12 besides the excellent affinity of immobilized ag towards water molecules also improved membrane wettability and contributed to a lower water contact angle 12 17 3 1 4 x ray diffraction analysis fig 7 presents the xrd diffraction pattern of the membrane m4 which provides a basic understanding of its crystalline structure as the membrane m1 m2 and m3 were made up of same polymers amorphous sample xrd analysis was not performed on these samples the broad band at 2θ range of 15 to 30 was attributed to the amorphous structure 32 the sharp peaks at 2θ of 37 8 43 8 64 2 77 2 and 81 5 were corresponded to 1 1 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 3 1 1 and 2 2 2 planes of the face centered cubic lattice of silver jcpds 04 0783 respectively 14 the reduction of silver ions on the pda coated membrane and the formation of metallic silver on the composite membrane were thus confirmed 3 1 5 x ray photoelectron surface analysis from fig 8 the xps peaks were found in agreement with those reported in the literature 18 19 the existence of n1s signal in the spectrum was ascribed to the pda coating on the membrane while the presence of ag3d and ag3p peaks indicated the successful reduction of ag ion to ag particle 41 to further confirm the status of the ag particle high resolution ag3d xps spectrum was performed and the result is presented in fig 9 the doublet signals of ag3d in the membrane m4 coincided with the standard binding energy of ag3d5 2 368 2 ev and ag3d3 2 374 2 ev for pure ag0 18 19 besides the spin orbit splitting of 3d doublet of ag is 6 0 ev which indicates that the synthesized silver particles were metallic ag0 with zero valence 41 the surface elemental composition of the membrane m4 is shown in table 4 as xps analysis is a sensitive surface analysis method that probes the top 10 nm of the film 56 it offers distinct information from edx analysis that reports a bulk composition the immobilized ag on the pda layer had contributed 5 11 at to the total surface elemental composition which was higher than 1 37 at that being reported in the edx spectra besides the presence of amine groups in the pda structure has contributed high nitrogen content in the surface elemental composition of membrane m4 in contrast only a trace amount of sulphur from the pes substrate that existed beneath the pda layer could be detected 3 1 6 long term stability test the long term stability of the ag pda pes membrane was determined by analyzing the amount of ag leached into the permeate at different time intervals from fig 10 the concentration of the leached ag in the permeate was recorded at 0 075 ppm during initial filtration time which then reduced to 0 028 ppm after 6th hour the membrane m4 exhibited a steady ag leaching throughout the next 42 h filtration and approximately 0 005 ppm of ag could be detected in the permeate in fact the freely bound silver in the ag pda matrix might leach out easily due to the hydraulic pressure during the filtration process hence increase the release of ag in the initial stage 12 however it is worth to mention that the concentration of the leached ag in the permeate was much lower than the maximum ag contaminant limit in drinking water quality standards 0 1 ppm regulated by the world health organization who 19 57 it was believed that hydroxyl groups in the dopamine monomer underwent polymerization creating strong physical bonding with membrane surface and minimizing the possibility of delamination in the pda coating 12 17 meanwhile the catechol groups in the pda had strong affinity towards noble metal that allowed a stable adhesion with ag 12 the oxidation of metallic ag0 into ag was governed by eqs 6 and 7 as follows 18 6 4 a g 0 o 2 2 a g 2 o 7 2 a g 2 o 4 h 4 a g 2 h 2 o pda mediated ag was less sensitive to oxygen hence yielded a lower releasing rate 59 60 this would ensure the long term stability of the ag pda pes composite membrane and confirmed its safe operation in water treatment process 3 2 membrane performance 3 2 1 permeability and pore size analysis from table 5 all the fabricated membranes are having their mean pore radius fall within the ultrafiltration range between 1 and 100 nm 19 61 the addition of 3 wt pvp into dope solution significantly increased the porosity of membrane m2 m3 and m4 comparing with the pristine pes membrane m1 control the porosity and mean pore radius for the membrane m2 were increased and its pwp was doubled it was believed that the enlargement of both mean pore radius and porosity were the major factors that causing a significant improvement in pwp 47 62 in contrast the dopamine solution had penetrated into the membrane pores which resulted in a lower membrane porosity with reduced pore size 7 18 19 the unavoidable pore blockage caused by pda coating also increased membrane permeation resistance hence reduced membrane pwp 10 12 upon silver nitrate treatment silver ions triggered further oxidation of the residual catechol groups on the pda and caused the self crosslinking reaction to happen between the pda oligomers 18 this further reduced the membrane pore size and increased water transport resistance for a lower membrane pwp 3 2 2 humic acid rejection test referring to table 6 the control membrane m1 achieved 77 81 1 52 of ha rejection the addition of 3 wt pvp as a pore forming agent into the membrane m2 did not deteriorate ha rejection previous study also revealed that the addition of 2 to 10 wt of pvp into pes membrane did not deteriorate the bovine serum albumin rejection 63 besides the fesem surface images as shown in fig 5 had confirmed that the pore size distribution of membrane m2 is more even compared to the membrane m1 thus gave rise to a better selectivity in fact previous studies had shown that the pvp regulated pore formation and improved membrane performance 64 66 the oxidation of the dopamine monomer induced the deposition of pda aggregates on the membrane m3 as a result the membrane pore size was reduced and granted 10 improvement in the ha rejection besides the hydrophilic pda could reduce the ha from depositing on the membrane surface which improved solute rejection 62 the immobilization of ag on the membrane m4 triggered further oxidation of the pda groups while the reduced metallic ag covered up the membrane pores and surface 18 19 this improved membrane rejection performance by molecular sieving and therefore the ha rejection of the membrane m4 was enhanced to 94 53 0 61 3 3 membrane antibacterial performance 3 3 1 diffusion inhibition zone test fig 11 demonstrates the results for diffusion inhibition zone test the clear ring without bacterial infection confirmed the bacteriostatic effect of the membrane e coli bacteria grew well around the membrane m1 m2 and m3 which indicated that these membranes did not impart any antibacterial property in contrast a clear inhibition ring was formed around the membrane m4 revealing that the membrane possessed significant antibacterial property researchers opined that the membrane antibacterial property came from the release of high dosage diffusible inhibitory compounds from the ag particles into the surrounding medium 12 36 47 the released ag ions are able to bind with cell protein and interrupt the reproduction of cell dna preventing their growth in the membrane vicinity 12 19 the diameter of the ring was measured randomly at three different locations and the average diameter was 2 32 0 2 cm 3 3 2 sem observation of bacteria contaminated membrane samples fig 12 demonstrates the sem images of incubated bacteria grown on surfaces of all the membranes as can be seen e coli were actively grown on the surface of the membrane m1 m2 and m3 with rigid cell wall being observed under sem the membrane m1 as a control justified that the pristine pes membrane itself did not possess any antibacterial property the pda coating on the pes pvp blend membrane was also reported to exhibit no antibacterial effect our findings are similar to those reported in the literature 15 19 in contrast the e coli cells on the membrane m4 were dead and the cell walls were ruptured due to the direct contact with bactericidal ag this further confirmed the bactericidal effect of the ag pda pes composite membrane the biocidal capacity of the ag incorporated membrane was dependent on the bacteria s accessibility to ag particles on the membrane 36 in this experiment the bacteria suspension was directly dropped on the ag immobilized membrane m4 the direct contact between ag and bacteria cell led to the rupture of bacterial cell wall followed by a loss of bacterial morphological integrity 67 on top of that the release of ag ions also triggered the generation of reactive oxygen species to attack the bacteria by disturbing their metabolic process 12 3 4 bacteria removal performance by filtration the bacterial removal performance of the membranes was investigated by filtering e coli suspension 3 03 108 cfu ml through the membrane and quantifying the viable e coli in the permeate the bacterial content measurement was conducted by spread plate count on the agar plate with serial dilution and the results are tabulated in table 7 from the table the concentration of e coli was reduced by 96 4 upon filtration using the control membrane m1 in comparison to 99 achieved by the membrane m2 m3 and m4 the bacteria removal by the membrane m1 was solely based on physical separation given the small pore size of the membrane compared to the typical size of e coli cell 1 3 μm 39 the improvement of the bacteria removal rate in the membrane m2 was probably due to a better pore size distribution on the membrane surface that resulted in better rejection during the dopamine solution treatment the dopamine solution penetrated and oxidized to form pda aggregate in the pores of membrane m3 19 the diminished pore size and unavoidable pores blockage in the membrane m3 were believed to improve the bacteria removal by physical molecular sieving for the membrane m4 the bacteria removal was based on both physical separation and silver disinfection the presence of ag on pda not only reduced pore size for better separation but also disinfected bacteria on the membrane avoiding secondary contamination the great reduction in the number of e coli cells in the permeate had proven that the immobilized ag on the pda layer was effective for e coli inactivation 4 conclusion in summary the ag immobilized pda coated pes pvp composite membrane was successfully prepared by coating method under standard laboratory condition various characterization techniques were used to confirm the state structure and bonding between polymers and synthesized ag particles the results showed that the pristine pes membrane m1 has successfully removed 77 81 ha and 96 4 e coli upon blending with 3 pvp the rejections of the resultant membrane m2 were improved to 79 94 and 99 33 respectively the pda coating on the membrane m3 could enhance the membrane hydrophilicity and reduce its mean pore radius this resulted in higher ha 89 97 and bacterial removal 99 85 besides immobilizing ag on the pda coated membrane further diminished the mean pore radius and enhanced ha rejection up to 94 53 it is worth to mention that the pes substrate pvp pore forming agent and pda coating did not show antibacterial activity in contrast the membrane m4 demonstrated excellent bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties against e coli on top of that this membrane was able to remove 100 e coli cell through the filtration process at 1 bar the pda coating on the membrane successfully anchored ag particles to minimize ag leaching rate which falls below the maximum ag contaminant limit in drinking water quality standards regulated by the who to conclude the newly fabricated membrane m4 ag pda pes pvp showed the best performance in terms of ha rejection and antibacterial behaviour among the membrane fabricated in this work this membrane is a promising solution to water reclamation that involves organic foulants and bacteria contained waterbodies declaration of

14132,in this work the polyethersulfone pes based membranes were prepared via phase inversion technique in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp as a pore forming agent polydopamine pda coating followed by silver ag immobilization was then carried out on the pes pvp blend membrane to enhance the membrane wettability and antibacterial property respectively in total four different membrane samples namely pristine pes m1 pes pvp m2 pda pes pvp m3 and ag pda pes pvp m4 were produced the fabricated membranes were characterized with respect to physical morphology contact angle pure water permeability pwp humic acid ha and escherichia coli e coli rejection as well as antibacterial activity the pristine pes membrane m1 was reported to remove 77 81 ha and 96 4 e coli with the addition of pvp into the membrane matrix the ha and e coli rejection of m2 membrane was further improved to 79 94 and 99 33 respectively upon pda coating the m3 membrane recorded much higher rejection rate 89 97 and 99 85 respectively owing to the formation of additional layer that reduced membrane pore size it is interesting to note that complete elimination of e coli was able to achieve by immobilizing ag on the m4 membrane this membrane also exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity and the highest ha rejection among all the fabricated membranes keywords antibacterial membrane e coli silver immobilization polydopamine humic acid 1 introduction water scarcity is one of the top ten problems that human facing in the 21st century 1 despite 71 of the earth surface is water covered only less than 3 of the water is surface water and the rest are saline water unlike surface water saline water requires extensive treatment process to remove large amount of dissolved ions in order to meet the drinking water standard although surface water is easier to be treated it has been always reported to be polluted by human activities such as landfill mining dumping sewage and industrial waste as well as agricultural runoff the presence of natural organic matters noms in surface water sources can cause undesired color and taste in the water body humic substances constitute a major fraction of noms in surface water typically ranged from 50 to 80 2 3 humic substances can be categorized into humin fulvic acid and humic acid ha according to their solubility at different solution ph carboxylic phenolic alcohols and methoxyl carbonyls in ha molecules have the potential to react with other organic compounds and produce carcinogenic chlorinated by products such as trihalomethane and haloacetic acid 3 the presence of these pollutants in surface water have restricted its potential usage thus water reclamation related research works have received significant attention among the water reclamation processes membrane based technology offers several advantages such as small footprint easy operation relatively low cost low energy consumption consistent permeate quality and minimum usage of chemicals for membrane cleaning 4 7 polyethersulfone pes is a common polymeric material used for fabricating membrane via phase inversion technique owing to its robust properties such as high mechanical strength high thermal stability and wide ph tolerances 8 10 however the hydrophobic characteristic possessed by pes results in low water permeability and high fouling tendency 7 the deposition of particles and organic compounds on the membrane surface can lower the permeate flux and deteriorate the permeate quality in many situations 11 besides bacteria in the water source may colonize on the hydrophobic membrane surface generating biofilm that causes biofouling as a result the separation performance of the membrane is negatively affected biofouling also tends to increase energy consumption due to higher operating pressure and shorten membrane lifespan in order to tackle membrane fouling the surface chemistry of the membrane must be carefully tailored via membrane surface modification various membrane modification techniques have been adopted in the previous studies to improve membrane anti fouling properties these include blending surface grafting and coating using hydrophilic materials polydopamine pda is a promising candidate for membrane modification owing to its compact structure and strong adhesion towards different types of substrates 12 the monomer dopamine can easily oxidize self polymerize into pda and form a strong covalent bond with the membrane surface in a mild alkaline condition 10 13 14 the successful pda coating can be easily confirmed based on the color changes on the membrane surface the high anchoring capability of the pda layer allows its application in functionalizing and modifying several materials in different research fields 12 for instance cai et al 15 established pda coating on sericin polyvinyl alcohol composite film for antimicrobial application karkhanechi et al 16 meanwhile immobilized polyzwitterions on a pda coated commercial reverse osmosis membrane to improve the anti biofouling properties of the membrane the pda coatings are of interest in membrane modification as the thin pda film on the surface and bulk membrane could significantly improve membrane hydrophilicity typically a hydration layer composed of water molecules would act as a barrier to prevent foulant adhesion and reduce membrane fouling 17 the poor affinity of the pda coating towards hydrophobic foulants such as proteins bacteria and emulsified oil droplets also minimizes the direct contact between the foulants and the membrane surface 12 besides improving membrane anti fouling property the pda coating would reduce membrane pore size for better solute rejection 18 20 however the pda film may cause the water permeation to decrease in order to reduce the thickness of pda coating the concentration of the dopamine solution and coating duration shall be kept at minimum values 12 14 21 previous studies have reported that higher dopamine concentration and prolonged coating time would develop a thicker pda film which is likely to block membrane pores increasing water permeation resistance and reducing membrane flux 20 22 thus a dopamine solution of 2 g l was commonly adopted during pda coating to avoid severe flux decline 20 23 as for dopamine coating duration the exposure time must be sufficient to generate a stable pda film that would not be easily washed away this is rather important because the coated pda provides additional reaction sites and often used for further modifications which have been reported for functionalizing graphene 24 26 carbon nanotubes 14 27 and titanium dioxide 28 30 zhang and co workers have reported that 4 h pda coating time could synthesize an ultrathin pda film with excellent stability that is able to anchor silver ag particles achieving slow ag leaching rate of 0 184 mg cm 1 day 1 18 ag is well documented as a strong biocide against a broad spectrum of microorganisms regardless of its state ag0 or ag the direct interaction between bacterial cells and ag0 would cause the formation of hole and pits on the cellular surface 67 as a result the bacteria cells would have their cytoplasmic material leaking and begin to lose their morphological integrity several researchers opined that the antimicrobial activity of ag loaded membranes originated from the released ag ions the ag ions could bind with dna bases which inhibits the dna replication process by preventing bacterial cells from dividing and multiplying 68 besides faunce and watal 29 reported that the ag ions also targeted on mitochondria and induced swelling which further affected cell metabolism to date the exact toxicity mechanism of ag is remained unclear and debatable among the researchers however most of the researchers believe that both ag0 and ag are effective for antibacterial activity several methods of incorporating ag into a polymeric membrane have been reported in the literature these include blending 31 32 photo induced grafting 33 34 and in situ silver immobilization 18 19 35 it was found that the conventional blending method would distribute ag throughout the membrane structure thus lowering its antibacterial properties on the membrane surface 36 sawada et al 37 reported that the aggregation of ag in the membrane structure prepared via ex situ blending method would decrease the water permeability in situ silver immobilization seems to be a better option as the silver is deposited on the membrane surface 32 in fact huang et al 19 immobilized silver on pda coated membrane via a simple redox reaction owing to the metal binding ability of phenolic hydroxyl group in pda ag ions would be preferentially adsorbed on the pda film and resulted in the formation of ag on the membrane surface this would facilitate the release of ag into the solution and yield a better antibacterial property 32 it was reported that pda could be used as both polymer linker and reductant to improve ag nanoparticles coating on membrane surface 38 this bifunctional performance of pda serves as a simple and green route for the surface immobilization of ag nanoparticles 39 the dopamine monomer has metal ion chelating ability and redox activity thus it can reduce the adsorbed ag ions to form metallic ag0 in one step reaction 40 41 this property allows pda to act as a 3d matrix to enhance the adsorption of ag ion and promote high density growth of metallic ag0 hence pda would avoid the direct exposure of ag to oxygen and slow down the release of ag ions 15 nevertheless cai et al 15 suggested that the pda coating on a composite film surface could enhance the capacity of ag and improved antibacterial activity in short the hydrophilic pda coated membrane could prevent the adhesion of bacteria while ag imparted antibacterial property to the membrane in addition one of the pioneering works investigated the in situ formation of ag particles on the pda modified membrane surfaces for antibacterial properties was carried out by tang et al 42 the silver nitrate agno3 solution was reduced and ag particles were immobilized on the pda modified polysulfone psf membrane to mitigate membrane biofouling it was reported that the ag pda modified psf membrane could achieve 99 antibacterial capability in another study the ag pda coated pes membrane has exhibited 100 antibacterial efficiency as compared to 9 achieved by the pristine pes membrane 18 besides it was also reported that the ag pda coated polyacrylonitrile pan membrane could completely remove escherichia coli e coli and bacillus subtilis b subtilis with no bacteria being detected in the permeate 39 several researchers studied the effect of ag immobilization and pda coating on the antibacterial and salt rejection performance of the thin film composite polyamide psf membranes 23 43 they further affirmed that the ag immobilized membranes showed better rejection performance and antibacterial properties as compared to the control pda coated membrane although previous studies have demonstrated promising salt and dye removals using ag pda modified membranes we have yet to find any work using such membranes to mitigate fouling caused by noms in this study the separation performance of pristine pes pes pvp pda pes pvp and ag pda pes pvp composite membranes was evaluated using feed solution containing ha and e coli in addition the antibacterial activity against e coli was demonstrated using scanning electron microscope sem and diffusion inhibition zone test the cross sectional morphologies surface morphologies and chemical compositions of the modified membranes were also characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem scanning electron microscope sem fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscope x ray photoelectron spectroscope xps x ray diffractometer xrd and static water contact angle measurement besides a detailed practical approach to fabricate the anti biofouling composite membranes through the incorporation of hydrophilic pda adlayer and in situ immobilization of ag was graphically demonstrated in this study 2

out by in situ silver ions reduction on pda layer using silver nitrate solution 2 5 w v agno3 in h2o sigma aldrich switzerland humic acid ha powder 4 71 kda sigma aldrich switzerland was utilized as the model of natural organic matter for membrane rejection study sodium bicarbonate 99 chemsoln malaysia was added to improve the solubility of ha in water the distilled water used in this study was prepared by a laboratory distillation unit favorit w4l water stills malaysia all reagents were of analytical grades and used as received 2 2 preparation of membrane samples the dope compositions and surface modifications of membranes are summarized in table 1 prior to fabrication pes and pvp were dried in an oven at 60 c overnight to remove moisture for control membrane m1 25 wt pes was dissolved in solvent nmp under continuous stirring at 50 c 31 44 for membrane m2 m3 and m4 25 wt pes and 3 wt pvp pore forming agent were dissolved in nmp under similar condition the homogenous dope solution was left to cool down before casting at 150 μm using adjustable doctor blade braive instrument germany the casted substrate was then immersed into a distilled water coagulation bath at room temperature for phase inversion a flat sheet membrane was formed and stored wet prior to use 2 3 pda coating and in situ immobilization of silver on pes pvp blend substrate the fabricated membranes were fixed on a 15 cm x 10 cm acrylic frame with the active surface exposed to coating agent as shown in fig 1 an aqueous dopamine solution 2 g l in tris hcl buffer solution 0 05 m ph 8 5 was poured on the membrane and left in open air for 4 h dopamine would contact with oxygen from ambient air and be oxidized gradually to form a pda layer on the membrane surface the formation of pda layer could be easily detected by observing the changes of membrane surface color from white to dark brown the resultant membrane denoted as m3 pda pes pvp was rinsed with distilled water to produce membrane m4 ag pda pes pvp 1 g l of silver nitrate solution was poured on the active surface of membrane m3 and kept for 2 h the membrane was then rinsed with distilled water several times and stored wet at room temperature the coating procedure for membrane m3 and m4 is illustrated in fig 2 2 4 membrane characterization membrane surface and cross sectional morphologies were studied using field emission scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6701f japan and scanning electron microscope hitachi s3400n japan respectively prior to the cross sectional sem analysis the samples were prepared by cryogenic cracking and sputtered with gold quorum sc7620 uk the elemental composition of membrane samples was quantified by energy dispersive x ray spectroscope ametek apollo x usa fourier transform infrared spectroscope thermo scientific nicolet is10 usa was employed to determine the functional group bonding on the membrane the transmission spectra of all membrane samples were recorded from 4000 to 400 cm 1 after baseline correction at the resolution of 4 cm 1 membrane wettability was examined by sessile drop method using contact angle goniometer krüss gmbh germany about 0 2 μl of distilled water was dropped on the active surface of the membrane and the contact angle was measured immediately the measurement was repeated for three times at different locations and the values were averaged to obtain a mean value the metallic silver that deposited on the membrane m4 was characterized by x ray diffractometer shimadzu 6000 cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 0 3 ma using cu kα radiation the diffraction pattern on 2θ from 5 to 85 was collected at the scanning rate of 5 per minute the valence state of ag and surface elemental composition of the membrane m4 was further investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscope shimadzu axis ultradld the adopted radiation was mg kα and the survey spectrum was collected from 0 to 1000 ev furthermore the high resolution spectrum was collected from 363 to 383 ev to confirm the valence state of ag the long term stability of the immobilized ag was evaluated by filtering deionized water across the membrane m4 for 48 h at 1 bar during the filtration 15 ml of the permeate at different time intervals zero 6th 12th 18th 24th 30th 36th 42th and 48th h were collected the concentration of ag in the permeate was determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscope perkinelmer icp oes optima 7000dv usa after calibration using standard solutions 2 5 membrane properties and performance testing 2 5 1 permeability test and pore size analysis the filtration experiment for the fabricated membrane samples was conducted using the dead end filtration cell sterlitech hp4750 with an effective membrane area of 14 6 cm2 the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 3 prior to pure water permeability pwp test the membrane samples were compacted at 4 bar for 30 min to ensure a steady flux the pwp of the membrane sample was calculated using eq 1 46 1 p w p q a t δ p where q is the permeate volume collected over a specified time l a is the membrane area m² t is the time taken to collect permeate h and δ p represents the operating pressure bar the membrane porosity ε was calculated using eq 2 39 46 2 ε w 1 w 2 ρ w a t e r w 1 w 2 ρ w a t e r w 2 ρ m e m b r a n e 100 where w 1 and w 2 are the wet and dry mass of the membrane sample respectively ρ w a t e r and ρ m e m b r a n e are the density of water and membrane polymer respectively the pore radius r m of the membrane was calculated using eq 3 47 3 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 n l q ε a δ p where η stands for the viscosity of pure water pa s l is the membrane thickness m and δ p represents the operating pressure in pa 2 5 2 rejection of humic acid the ha rejection test was conducted in the dead end filtration cell at 1 bar using 10 ppm ha solution the ultraviolet uv absorbance of ha in the feed and permeate were measured by uv visible spectrophotometer pg instrument t60u uk at 254 nm 44 by using a standard calibration curve the absorbance value was converted to concentration of ha where its rejection was subsequently calculated using eq 4 3 4 r h a 1 c p c f 100 where r h a is the percentage rejection of ha c p and c f are the concentration of ha in permeate and feed respectively 2 5 3 antibacterial test 2 5 3 1 diffusion inhibition zone test the antibacterial properties of the membranes were investigated by diffusion inhibition zone test a qualitative study on the bacteriostatic effect of fabricated membranes based on disk diffusion assay 100 μl of bacteria inoculum containing 3 108 colony forming unit cfu ml of e coli was dropped and spread on a sterilized agar plate a piece of circular shaped membrane coupon diameter 1 5 cm was irradiated by uv light before placing on the agar plate with its active surface facing the nutrient agar the agar plates were sealed with parafilm and incubated overnight at 37 c the bacterial inhibition zone defined as a zone around the disk where no bacteria growth was observed to compare the bacteriostatic effect of the fabricated membrane 2 5 3 2 sem observation of bacteria contaminated membrane sample membrane samples were cut into circular shaped of 5 mm diameter followed by uv irradiation before placing on the agar plate with its active surface facing upwards 50 μl of bacteria inoculum containing 3 108 cfu ml of e coli was dropped on the active surface of the membrane coupon the agar plates were sealed with parafilm and incubated overnight at 37 c the live and dead cells remained on the membrane surface were then observed by sem to study the membrane antibacterial effect 2 5 4 bacteria removal performance by filtration 50 ml of e coli suspension at 3 108 cfu ml was fed into the dead end filtration cell and filtered across the membrane samples at 1 bar all parts of filtration setup and apparatus which were in contact with e coli were sterilized under uv irradiation before and after the experiment the permeate was collected and spread plate count was conducted right after the bacteria filtration serial dilution was conducted to ensure the number of colonies formed on the agar plate is always within the countable range which is from 30 to 300 colonies per plate 100 μl of diluted permeate was dropped and spread on a sterilized agar plate then incubated at 37 c the number of colonies formed in the agar plate was counted after 24 h and the results were reported in cfu ml the bacterial removal percentage was calculated using eq 5 5 r b a 1 b a p b a f 100 where r b a represents the percentage removal of e coli bacteria b a p and b a f are the number of bacteria present in permeate and feed cfu ml respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 morphological and elemental analysis fig 4 shows the cross sectional morphologies of fabricated membranes all the membranes exhibit asymmetric structure consisting of a top sublayer with finger like structure and bottom sublayer with macrovoids the control membrane m1 showed blocked pore channels while several long and thin macrovoid extended to the top sublayer the undesired poor distribution of the pores and channels could deteriorate membrane performance in terms of permeability and rejection tests our findings were similar to the results reported by chong et al 48 for the membranes fabricated without pvp the membrane structure was dense and packed due to a delayed solvent and non solvent exchange during phase inversion in contrast the addition of 3 pvp as a pore forming agent into the membrane m2 m3 and m4 had significantly altered their cross sectional morphologies as shown in fig 4 the skin layers of these membranes were denser and the finger like structures were longer this was in agreement with the previous study that thicker membrane skin layer was observed at higher pvp loadings 45 besides the finger like structure in membrane m2 m3 and m4 were open and evenly distributed this provides an insight that these membranes would have higher water permeability and probably better separation performance as compared to membrane m1 it was previously explained that the addition of pvp as a hydrophilic polymer would enhance thermodynamic instability in the dope inducing instantaneous demixing associated with the formation of macrovoids 49 as a result a more porous membrane structure with larger macrovoids was observed in the membrane m2 m3 and m4 as compared to the membrane m1 from the cross sectional sem images no considerable difference in bulk morphologies between the membrane m2 m3 and m4 could be observed since the pda coating and silver immobilization was performed after membrane formation this showed that pda coating and silver immobilization did not alter the cross sectional morphology fig 5 shows the fesem surface images of the fabricated membranes the membrane m1 showed irregular pore size distribution under magnification of 10 000 apart from the tiny pores several huge pores could be observed on the surface of the membrane m1 which could be responsible for a low rejection performance owing to a poor molecular sieving mechanism with the addition of 3 pvp as a pore sizing agent the surface pore distribution of the membrane m2 was comparatively more even than the membrane m1 large surface pores had been disappeared from the membrane m2 and therefore a better rejection performance could be expected upon 4 h dopamine coating a continuous pda layer with scattering pda particles was formed on the surface of membrane m3 the membrane pores appeared to be covered by the pda film hence became no longer visible under fesem our observation is similar to the work reported in the literature 18 42 numerous bright spots found on the surface of membrane m4 are due to the presence of immobilized ag particles through the reduction of silver ions by the functional groups on pda 42 50 although the immobilized ag particles were uniformly distributed with minimum agglomeration they tended to block the membrane surface and subsequently led to a lower permeability compared to the membrane m3 table 2 presents the elemental composition of the fabricated membranes the pristine pes membrane m1 displayed only carbon c sulphur s and oxygen o in the edx spectrum for the membrane m2 the blended pvp molecules had a greater affinity towards water than the solvent nmp and a substantial amount of pvp would leach out from the membrane matrix during phase inversion 47 51 hence only a trace amount of nitrogen n was detected in the membrane m2 meanwhile the presence of pda on the membrane m3 and m4 could be confirmed with the detection of 5 32 at and 3 42 at n respectively due to the presence of amine groups the additional ag element was found in the membrane m4 which suggested that ag had been successfully immobilized on the pda support 3 1 2 ftir spectra analysis the ftir spectra of the fabricated membranes over the wavelength range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 are shown in fig 6 in general all membranes displayed similar ftir spectra as they were made of the same polymeric material the sulfonyl stretching peaks were found at 1105 and 1150 cm 1 while the coc stretching peak was captured at 1240 cm 1 23 52 besides the absorption peak at 1420 cm 1 was due to aromatic skeletal vibration 53 a benzene ring cc stretching was observed at 1480 cm 1 and 1575 cm 1 23 while ch stretching peak of benzene ring contributed to a broad band at 3080 cm 1 52 some researchers reported that the use of pda as membrane surface coating material would result in a peak at 3400 cm 1 owing to the vibration of catechol oh groups and nh groups 10 19 however no obvious difference could be observed between the membrane m2 and m3 probably due to the thin pda layer and overlapped peaks on top of that the pda coating also exhibited an absorption peak at 1610 cm 1 due to nh bending vibration and aromatic ring stretching 10 15 this peak might overlap with the absorption peak at 1650 cm 1 caused by the carbonyl of pvp molecules 7 19 55 owing to this the membrane m2 m3 and m4 displayed an absorption peak at 1650 cm 1 but it is not visible in the spectrum of m1 3 1 3 contact angle the contact angles for fabricated membranes are tabulated in table 3 as a semi hydrophobic material the pristine pes membrane exhibited a static water contact angle of 73 73 0 61 the addition of 3 wt hydrophilic pvp into the dope solution of membrane m2 has reduced its contact angle to 70 90 0 38 suggesting this membrane was less hydrophobic than the membrane m1 it could be due to the trapped pvp in the pes membrane that formed an integral part of the polymeric structure and yielded a more hydrophilic polymer surface 55 furthermore the incorporation of hydrophilic pda on the membrane m3 significantly enhanced membrane hydrophilicity by decreasing the contact angle to 62 11 0 26 the improvement is due to the enrichment of catechol quinone and amine functional groups in the pda film that carrying hydrophilic groups oh and nh 19 42 50 the presence of ag on the pda coated membrane further improved membrane hydrophilicity achieving contact angle of 59 84 0 53 the immobilization of ag would increase the membrane surface roughness for better deposition of more water molecules on the membrane surface 12 besides the excellent affinity of immobilized ag towards water molecules also improved membrane wettability and contributed to a lower water contact angle 12 17 3 1 4 x ray diffraction analysis fig 7 presents the xrd diffraction pattern of the membrane m4 which provides a basic understanding of its crystalline structure as the membrane m1 m2 and m3 were made up of same polymers amorphous sample xrd analysis was not performed on these samples the broad band at 2θ range of 15 to 30 was attributed to the amorphous structure 32 the sharp peaks at 2θ of 37 8 43 8 64 2 77 2 and 81 5 were corresponded to 1 1 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 3 1 1 and 2 2 2 planes of the face centered cubic lattice of silver jcpds 04 0783 respectively 14 the reduction of silver ions on the pda coated membrane and the formation of metallic silver on the composite membrane were thus confirmed 3 1 5 x ray photoelectron surface analysis from fig 8 the xps peaks were found in agreement with those reported in the literature 18 19 the existence of n1s signal in the spectrum was ascribed to the pda coating on the membrane while the presence of ag3d and ag3p peaks indicated the successful reduction of ag ion to ag particle 41 to further confirm the status of the ag particle high resolution ag3d xps spectrum was performed and the result is presented in fig 9 the doublet signals of ag3d in the membrane m4 coincided with the standard binding energy of ag3d5 2 368 2 ev and ag3d3 2 374 2 ev for pure ag0 18 19 besides the spin orbit splitting of 3d doublet of ag is 6 0 ev which indicates that the synthesized silver particles were metallic ag0 with zero valence 41 the surface elemental composition of the membrane m4 is shown in table 4 as xps analysis is a sensitive surface analysis method that probes the top 10 nm of the film 56 it offers distinct information from edx analysis that reports a bulk composition the immobilized ag on the pda layer had contributed 5 11 at to the total surface elemental composition which was higher than 1 37 at that being reported in the edx spectra besides the presence of amine groups in the pda structure has contributed high nitrogen content in the surface elemental composition of membrane m4 in contrast only a trace amount of sulphur from the pes substrate that existed beneath the pda layer could be detected 3 1 6 long term stability test the long term stability of the ag pda pes membrane was determined by analyzing the amount of ag leached into the permeate at different time intervals from fig 10 the concentration of the leached ag in the permeate was recorded at 0 075 ppm during initial filtration time which then reduced to 0 028 ppm after 6th hour the membrane m4 exhibited a steady ag leaching throughout the next 42 h filtration and approximately 0 005 ppm of ag could be detected in the permeate in fact the freely bound silver in the ag pda matrix might leach out easily due to the hydraulic pressure during the filtration process hence increase the release of ag in the initial stage 12 however it is worth to mention that the concentration of the leached ag in the permeate was much lower than the maximum ag contaminant limit in drinking water quality standards 0 1 ppm regulated by the world health organization who 19 57 it was believed that hydroxyl groups in the dopamine monomer underwent polymerization creating strong physical bonding with membrane surface and minimizing the possibility of delamination in the pda coating 12 17 meanwhile the catechol groups in the pda had strong affinity towards noble metal that allowed a stable adhesion with ag 12 the oxidation of metallic ag0 into ag was governed by eqs 6 and 7 as follows 18 6 4 a g 0 o 2 2 a g 2 o 7 2 a g 2 o 4 h 4 a g 2 h 2 o pda mediated ag was less sensitive to oxygen hence yielded a lower releasing rate 59 60 this would ensure the long term stability of the ag pda pes composite membrane and confirmed its safe operation in water treatment process 3 2 membrane performance 3 2 1 permeability and pore size analysis from table 5 all the fabricated membranes are having their mean pore radius fall within the ultrafiltration range between 1 and 100 nm 19 61 the addition of 3 wt pvp into dope solution significantly increased the porosity of membrane m2 m3 and m4 comparing with the pristine pes membrane m1 control the porosity and mean pore radius for the membrane m2 were increased and its pwp was doubled it was believed that the enlargement of both mean pore radius and porosity were the major factors that causing a significant improvement in pwp 47 62 in contrast the dopamine solution had penetrated into the membrane pores which resulted in a lower membrane porosity with reduced pore size 7 18 19 the unavoidable pore blockage caused by pda coating also increased membrane permeation resistance hence reduced membrane pwp 10 12 upon silver nitrate treatment silver ions triggered further oxidation of the residual catechol groups on the pda and caused the self crosslinking reaction to happen between the pda oligomers 18 this further reduced the membrane pore size and increased water transport resistance for a lower membrane pwp 3 2 2 humic acid rejection test referring to table 6 the control membrane m1 achieved 77 81 1 52 of ha rejection the addition of 3 wt pvp as a pore forming agent into the membrane m2 did not deteriorate ha rejection previous study also revealed that the addition of 2 to 10 wt of pvp into pes membrane did not deteriorate the bovine serum albumin rejection 63 besides the fesem surface images as shown in fig 5 had confirmed that the pore size distribution of membrane m2 is more even compared to the membrane m1 thus gave rise to a better selectivity in fact previous studies had shown that the pvp regulated pore formation and improved membrane performance 64 66 the oxidation of the dopamine monomer induced the deposition of pda aggregates on the membrane m3 as a result the membrane pore size was reduced and granted 10 improvement in the ha rejection besides the hydrophilic pda could reduce the ha from depositing on the membrane surface which improved solute rejection 62 the immobilization of ag on the membrane m4 triggered further oxidation of the pda groups while the reduced metallic ag covered up the membrane pores and surface 18 19 this improved membrane rejection performance by molecular sieving and therefore the ha rejection of the membrane m4 was enhanced to 94 53 0 61 3 3 membrane antibacterial performance 3 3 1 diffusion inhibition zone test fig 11 demonstrates the results for diffusion inhibition zone test the clear ring without bacterial infection confirmed the bacteriostatic effect of the membrane e coli bacteria grew well around the membrane m1 m2 and m3 which indicated that these membranes did not impart any antibacterial property in contrast a clear inhibition ring was formed around the membrane m4 revealing that the membrane possessed significant antibacterial property researchers opined that the membrane antibacterial property came from the release of high dosage diffusible inhibitory compounds from the ag particles into the surrounding medium 12 36 47 the released ag ions are able to bind with cell protein and interrupt the reproduction of cell dna preventing their growth in the membrane vicinity 12 19 the diameter of the ring was measured randomly at three different locations and the average diameter was 2 32 0 2 cm 3 3 2 sem observation of bacteria contaminated membrane samples fig 12 demonstrates the sem images of incubated bacteria grown on surfaces of all the membranes as can be seen e coli were actively grown on the surface of the membrane m1 m2 and m3 with rigid cell wall being observed under sem the membrane m1 as a control justified that the pristine pes membrane itself did not possess any antibacterial property the pda coating on the pes pvp blend membrane was also reported to exhibit no antibacterial effect our findings are similar to those reported in the literature 15 19 in contrast the e coli cells on the membrane m4 were dead and the cell walls were ruptured due to the direct contact with bactericidal ag this further confirmed the bactericidal effect of the ag pda pes composite membrane the biocidal capacity of the ag incorporated membrane was dependent on the bacteria s accessibility to ag particles on the membrane 36 in this experiment the bacteria suspension was directly dropped on the ag immobilized membrane m4 the direct contact between ag and bacteria cell led to the rupture of bacterial cell wall followed by a loss of bacterial morphological integrity 67 on top of that the release of ag ions also triggered the generation of reactive oxygen species to attack the bacteria by disturbing their metabolic process 12 3 4 bacteria removal performance by filtration the bacterial removal performance of the membranes was investigated by filtering e coli suspension 3 03 108 cfu ml through the membrane and quantifying the viable e coli in the permeate the bacterial content measurement was conducted by spread plate count on the agar plate with serial dilution and the results are tabulated in table 7 from the table the concentration of e coli was reduced by 96 4 upon filtration using the control membrane m1 in comparison to 99 achieved by the membrane m2 m3 and m4 the bacteria removal by the membrane m1 was solely based on physical separation given the small pore size of the membrane compared to the typical size of e coli cell 1 3 μm 39 the improvement of the bacteria removal rate in the membrane m2 was probably due to a better pore size distribution on the membrane surface that resulted in better rejection during the dopamine solution treatment the dopamine solution penetrated and oxidized to form pda aggregate in the pores of membrane m3 19 the diminished pore size and unavoidable pores blockage in the membrane m3 were believed to improve the bacteria removal by physical molecular sieving for the membrane m4 the bacteria removal was based on both physical separation and silver disinfection the presence of ag on pda not only reduced pore size for better separation but also disinfected bacteria on the membrane avoiding secondary contamination the great reduction in the number of e coli cells in the permeate had proven that the immobilized ag on the pda layer was effective for e coli inactivation 4 conclusion in summary the ag immobilized pda coated pes pvp composite membrane was successfully prepared by coating method under standard laboratory condition various characterization techniques were used to confirm the state structure and bonding between polymers and synthesized ag particles the results showed that the pristine pes membrane m1 has successfully removed 77 81 ha and 96 4 e coli upon blending with 3 pvp the rejections of the resultant membrane m2 were improved to 79 94 and 99 33 respectively the pda coating on the membrane m3 could enhance the membrane hydrophilicity and reduce its mean pore radius this resulted in higher ha 89 97 and bacterial removal 99 85 besides immobilizing ag on the pda coated membrane further diminished the mean pore radius and enhanced ha rejection up to 94 53 it is worth to mention that the pes substrate pvp pore forming agent and pda coating did not show antibacterial activity in contrast the membrane m4 demonstrated excellent bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties against e coli on top of that this membrane was able to remove 100 e coli cell through the filtration process at 1 bar the pda coating on the membrane successfully anchored ag particles to minimize ag leaching rate which falls below the maximum ag contaminant limit in drinking water quality standards regulated by the who to conclude the newly fabricated membrane m4 ag pda pes pvp showed the best performance in terms of ha rejection and antibacterial behaviour among the membrane fabricated in this work this membrane is a promising solution to water reclamation that involves organic foulants and bacteria contained waterbodies declaration of

14133,this work presents a new hybrid technology for treating wastewater along with electricity generation the main objective of this work was to integrate a microbial fuel cell mfc into a horizontal subsurface constructed wetland hssf cw mfc at a pilot scale for improving the wastewater treatment performance of hssf cw the hssf cw mfc was tested on three different organic loading rates 0 15 0 30 and 0 52 kg cod m3 d at a set hydraulic retention time the hssf cw mfc was further studied for establishing the influence of electron transfer using conductive material artificial electron acceptor on wastewater treatment performance during the efficient electron transfer system run in closed circuit operation 33 7 higher chemical oxygen demand cod removal was achieved in comparison to the hindered electron transfer system run in open circuit condition the results illustrate that efficient electron transfer from bottom anaerobic zones to the aerobic zone of the hssf cw helps in enhancing the treatment performance the maximum power and current densities achieved were 11 67 mw m3and 17 15 ma m3 respectively keywords constructed wetland microbial fuel cell constructed wetland microbial fuel cell open circuit closed circuit 1 introduction constructed wetland cw is a low cost technology for treating various wastewaters such as domestic industrial agricultural run off including dairy and livestock wastewater 1 cws are classified into two types based on the flow direction horizontal subsurface flow hssf and vertical subsurface flow vssf the hssf cw is the most common of these the main mechanisms involved in the removal of pollutants in any cws include sedimentation filtration adsorption absorption oxidation reduction and plant uptake 1 2 in an hssf cw the upper layer of the filter bed usually remains aerobic these aerobic areas located in the vicinity of the rhizospheric region which is a thick layer near or at the surface in contact with the atmosphere 3 4 a large anaerobic region sits below the aerobic region where there is no oxygen diffusion from the atmosphere anaerobic regions are generally considered to be slow pollutant treatment zones probably due to the lack of an electron acceptor leading to the slow treatment rate in an hssf cw 5 6 slow treatment rate is one of the biggest challenges for cw technology in recent years there has been rapid growth in microbial fuel cells mfcs applications for wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation from various wastewater and degradable substances 7 typical mfc is made of an anode a cathode a separator and an external circuit the anode of the mfc is kept in an anaerobic environment where it acts as an insoluble electron acceptor during the oxidation of degradable substrate by specialized bacteria that are capable of transferring electrons to the anode 7 these electrons are moved to the cathode of mfc via an external electrical circuit oxidation of substrate at anode also produces proton which travels to the cathode via separator or via the bulk fluid to maintain charge neutrality the circuit becomes complete when electrons and protons are consumed in a reduction reaction at the cathode with the terminal electron acceptors which is generally oxygen due to its availability and high redox potential 8 9 an mfc uses bacteria as a catalyst to convert chemical energy into electrical energy 2 10 oxidation of organic matters in mfc requires fermentative and electroactive bacteria eab to work in cooperation synergy 11 fermentative microorganisms break down complex organic matters into simpler one such as acetate ethanol glucose amino acids and other long chain fatty acids which can easily be oxidized by eab 12 eab gains energy from electron transfer to extracellular conductive insoluble material like graphite or other minerals this electron transfer can be facilitated by two main mechanisms direct electron transfer and by mediated electron transfer direct electron transfer requires physical contact between the microorganism and the conductive insoluble material through direct attachment or through nanowires or pili some of the eabs use indirect way where they use electron shuttles or mediator endogenous redox active molecules for transferring the electrons to conductive insoluble material such mediators collect electrons from the eab and transfer them to conductive insoluble material 12 overall mfc needs a redox gradient for its functioning as described earlier an hssf cw naturally consists of a redox gradient which is required to mfc for their functioning due to said complementary situation of mfc and cw integration of an mfc into a cw has recently emerged as an efficient technology for the enhancement of the treatment performance of the cw as well as the generation of electricity 7 13 16 mfc works based on oxidation reduction redox reactions oxidation occurs at anode electrode and reduction occurs at the cathode electrode at the anode organic matters or substrates oxidize and produce electrons and protons an anode is a very crucial component as it plays a vital role between physical electrode and biological microbes components protons reach the cathode through the proton exchange membrane pem for maintaining charge neutrality the potential difference between the anode and the cathode drags electrons from anode to cathode via flow through the circuit at the cathode the electrons the protons and oxygen perform a reduction reaction to form a water molecule whole oxidation reduction reactions happen as follows 17 1 c6h12o6 6h2o 6co2 24h 24e anode 2 4e 4h o2 2h2o cathode 3 c6h12o6 6h2o 6o2 6co2 12h2o overall with the integration of an mfc into a cw the anode can provide an artificial electron acceptor in the

in cws due to their relatively vigorous growth in domestic wastewater 22 as illustrated in fig 1 wastewater flowed from one end of the hssf cw mfc inlet zone while treated water was collected from the other end outlet zone large stones were placed in the inlet and the outlet zones to avoid clogging and to allow influent and effluent to flow into and out of bed easily two 85 watt compact spiral

liters the hssf cw mfc was inoculated with 5 0 liters of digested biogas slurry mixed with tap water at a 1 1 ratio and further mixed with 60 liters of synthetic wastewater digested biogas slurry contained a diverse community of microbes and was used as an inoculum for wastewater treatment the hssf cw mfc was initially fed with a mixture of 50 freshly prepared synthetic wastewater and 50 recycled effluent the hssf cw mfc was kept in recirculation mode for an initial acclimatization period of one month to establish the biofilm in the system the hssf cw mfc was then run in horizontal subsurface flow mode with a feed of 100 synthetic wastewater to give a hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 6 days for further acclimatization over the next two months the total period of acclimatization was three months after which data collection was commenced three different organic loadings 0 15 l1 0 30 l2 0 52 l3 kg cod m3 d were employed throughout the experiment whenever the organic loading was changed the reactor was acclimatized until a steady state performance at that load was achieved a polarization curve is a parameter used to characterize the electrochemical properties of an electrochemical system in the present study the polarization curve allows an understanding of the activation loss concentration loss and ohmic loss in this study the polarization measurement was conducted by connecting a resistance ranging from 90 mω to100 ω based on polarization measurement an external resistance was decided for the reactor the experiment was initially run at each organic load in the closed circuit open and closed circuit operations were considered with the l3 organic load rate voltage was measured for each organic load as well as in open and closed circuit operation cod of influent and effluent samples were analyzed once a week the cod was also analyzed at the surface and the bottom using ports p1 p2 p3 to observe the removal efficiency of organics in the whole bed of hssf cw mfc 2 2 analytical techniques and calculations cod removal analysis was done to investigate the removal of organic matter from wastewater in hssf cw mfc cod was measured as described in the standard method 23 ph was measured by ph meter eutech instruments singapore calibrated with standard ph buffers oxidation reduction potential orp was measured with the orp meter eutech instruments oakton singapore voltage was measured with a handheld digital multimeter sanwa cd 722 japan at least four times in a day period dissolved oxygen do was measured with a do meter eutech instruments singapore the current i and power p were determined through basic electrical calculations using standard relation the power and the current densities were calculated by dividing the power and current by the volume m3 of the anode zone of the cw half the volume of total volume coulombic efficiency ce of hssf cw mfc was determined by the formula of a continuous flow system 8 24 4 c o u l o m b i c e f f i c i e n c y c e m i f b q δ c o d where q is the volumetric influent flow rate δcod is the difference in the influent and effluent cod m is the molecular weight of oxygen f is faraday s constant i is current and b is the number of electrons exchanged per mole of oxygen b 4 an anova test α 0 05 was employed to compare the removal efficiency of closed and open circuit conditions at l3 this test was also used for comparing the result of different ports at the l3 load 3 results and discussion 3 1 orp and do the orp in the surface and bottom regions was measured at each organic loading it was measured to determine the relative electroactivity of both zones 25 the orp of the bottom layer was between 140 0 23 to 20 0 45 mv whereas near the surface it was between 140 0 23 40 0 33 mv the orp between both chambers is represented in fig 2 the potential at the surface was less negative than at the bottom in most of the situations under all loading conditions the less negative value near the surface shows a comparative less anaerobic condition while more negative values in the bottom layer indicate more anaerobic conditions corbella et al 2014 26 reported that plant regimes also have effects on the redox potentials of the cw the other factors which influence the redox condition are evapotranspiration and also the flow regimes of the system 27 doherty et al 2015 7 reported that planted wetlands produce almost 20 higher redox gradient as compared to unplanted ones the do was measured in both anode and cathode regions of the hssf cw mfc at each organic load the do was 1 85 0 25 to 2 15 0 5 mg l at the surface and 0 16 0 16 to 0 56 0 14 mg l in the bottom layer the measured do was found to be similar for each organic load at the surface and the bottom however the measured do was always higher in the surface layer than near the bottom due to direct contact with the atmosphere plants also release oxygen from their roots and this plays an important role in increasing the do level at the surface 28 29 low do levels near the bottom are due to the high level of organic contaminants 3 2 wastewater treatment as described earlier the hssf cw mfc was fed continuously with synthetic wastewater at three different organic loads of 0 15 0 30 and 0 52 kg cod m3 d l1 l2and l3 respectively the hrt was the same for all the organic loads 6 5 days the overall cod removal efficiency of the effluent for l1 l2 l3 cl and l3 op was 98 3 2 23 98 9 2 34 95 4 2 22 and 61 7 2 27 respectively the cod removal for l1 and l2 organic load was very similar at 98 99 however when the organic load was increased to l3 removal dropped to 68 2 22 for the first week of sampling after this period removal increased to 95 4 2 22 for closed circuit operation once the biomass acclimatized to the increased load similar results have been reported in another study 30 this time lag was related to the time required to increase the biomass to cope with the increased organic load when the circuit was disconnected at the same load l3 op the removal for the initial week of sampling was 75 2 27 and this decreased to 61 7 2 27 in the following weeks fig 3 statistical analysis showed that l3 cl and l3 op were significantly different α 0 05 this clearly shows the role of the transfer of electrons from the anode to the cathode on the removal of organic contaminants when the transfer of electrons was stopped by disconnecting the electrical circuit the cod removal efficiency decreased to 33 7 the role of conductive material as an artificial electron acceptor is reported in several publications 2 18 a few studies reported that in cw mfc the closed circuit operation could enhance the cod removal by up to 5 22 in comparison to open circuit operation 18 in the absence of electron acceptors the anaerobic reactions are usually slower in cw 31 the integration of a conductive material based electron transfer arrangement can enhance the treatment performance of cw in a closed circuit while disconnecting the circuit the treatment performance also declines the overall performance of the hssf cw mfc was analyzed along its length and samples were collected under closed circuit conditions from the three sample ports along the bed samples were taken from the surface and the bottom layers for each organic load for the lower loadings l1 and l2 the cod removal was always high at 96 99 0 1 it was also effectively the same in the bottom and the surface regions however cod removal efficiency was found to drop near the start of the bed when the highest loading l3 was introduced at p1 60 cm from the inlet it was 47 0 0 3 at the surface and only 37 3 0 3 at the bottom as the distance from inlet to the p1 was short and organic mass was high the interaction between the organic material and the biofilm was low so the removal was also low when the wastewater flowed from p1 to p3 the cod removal efficiency found to be increased at p2 56 cm further along the bed removal at the surface had increased to 64 9 0 03 and at the bottom 39 0 0 03 a further 56 cm along it was 79 0 0 03 at the surface and 56 2 0 03 at the bottom this trend of cod removal clearly shows that overall cod removal in the hssf cw mfc improved as the wastewater retention time was increased furthermore the cod removal at the surface was higher than in the bottom region for all ports a similar analysis was carried out for l3 under open circuit conditions l3 op for p1 at the surface 41 2 0 01 of the cod was removed under open circuit conditions and this was down to 30 2 0 01 for the bottom region for p2 at the surface removal was 63 8 0 01 and at the bottom it was 34 4 0 01 while for p3 78 9 0 01 was removed at the surface and 39 0 0 01 at the bottom these are lower in all cases than the corresponding sample points under closed circuit conditions and the difference is greatest for samples collected from the bottom layer when the circuit was disconnected the opportunity for electron transfer became limited so the removal was low in addition as the bottom was anaerobic it contained a lower level of electron acceptors in comparison to the surface where oxygen acts as a terminal electron acceptor increasing the cod removal efficiency 31 fig 4 presents the results of l1 l2 l3 cl and l3 op at all three ports p1 p2 and p3 3 3 electricity generation the voltage generation was assessed for l1 l2 l3 cl and l3 op after an established period of two weeks the voltage output was between 400 and 650 mv throughout the experiment at a constant resistance of 1 2 kω fig 5 a presents the voltage generation profile during the experiment at each load the maximum voltage achieved was 680 mv on l3 cl whereas in l3 op it was 654 mv the output voltage on other loads was reasonably constant throughout the study though voltage generation for l2 was somewhat higher in the range 552 mv 637 mv in l3 op even though resistance was infinitely high voltage output was almost the same as other loads a positive correlation was found between voltage output and cod removal except l3 op which had a negative correlation the highest correlation was found for l3 cl correlation 0 56 a relationship between power density and cod was established for l3 cl from fig 5b it is clear that as the cod removal increased the power density also increased the removal of cod occurred through oxidation of organic matter or cod causing matters such oxidation generates reducing equivalents electrons which move through a circuit to produce power current thus power density is correlated with cod removal further the power density was measured against the reactor anodic volume in m3 the maximum power density achieved was 11 64 mw m3 and the minimum was 4 6 mw m3 ce was calculated for l1 l2 and l3 cl the results indicate that the ce was always high at the low organic load such as l1 whereas when the load increased ce decreased fig 5c the similar results are reported by other researchers 32 it is also reported in the same report that when the composition of wastewater became too complex for easy degradation by the bacteria ce decreased moreover when ce was affected current production also reduced other studies of mfc suggest two processes are the major factors which affect the ce efficiency of the system firstly it is the presence of other bacteria such as methanogenic bacteria and secondly aerobic respiration which usually affects the electron transfer mechanism 32 33 anaerobic bacteria along with fermentative bacteria dominate the anode portion and can consume electrons in other reaction mechanisms which decrease the ce 21 34 these bacteria however help in breaking down organic compounds to short chain organics in which electroactive bacteria can easily degrade thus despite low ce the removal n the cw mfc increases 32 the low ce could also be a reason of large distance between anode and cathode which subsequently increases the internal resistance of the reactor in the present study the polarization curve allows an understanding of the activation loss concentration loss and ohmic loss based on a previous study 35 these losses give an insight into the hindrance in current production fig 6 represents the polarization curve on l3 cl it was drawn based on current density power density and voltage achieved by changing the resistance from high to low 8 the maximum observed current and power density was 0 59 ma m3 and 0 11 mw m3 respectively when using 1 2 kω resistances the curve explains that voltage was high at low current density at the maximum voltage current density was at its lowest and inversely at the lowest voltage was at its maximum a similar pattern was seen in other studies too 8 30 it can be seen from the polarization curve that the major losses in the present study are due to ohmic losses which indicate the hindrance in the current production of hssf cw mfc 3 4 influence of electrochemical reaction on cod removal the present work was also intended to investigate the influence of electrode conductive materials as the temporary electron acceptor in anaerobic biological oxidation of pollutants parameter cod was chosen as model pollutants of wastewater for assessing this impact a biological anaerobic process involves slow rate oxidation due to the limited availability of electron acceptors in this situation the presence of the electrode as a temporary electron acceptor can catalyze the oxidation rate however this process can be efficient when the cathode is connected with anode through an electrical circuit and placed in an aerobic environment where oxidants like oxygen must harvest incoming electrons in a continuous manner to investigate the influence of electron transfer from anode anaerobic zone where anode works as temporary electron acceptor to cathode aerobic zone on cod removal experiments were performed in open no to minimum electron transfer and closed circuit efficient electron transfer manner at organic loading rate of 0 52 kg cod m3 d it is evident from the results that a minimum of 9 6 in week number 5 and a maximum 33 7 in week number 7 enhancement in cod removal was achieved when microcosm was run in closed circuit mode in comparison to open circuit mode fig 3 these results clearly establish that electrode assisted electrochemical reaction helps in biological oxidation of pollutants in a positive way average coulombic efficiency was achieved to 1 05 and 1 86 in an organic loading rate of 0 52 kg cod m3 d and 0 15 kg cod m3 d respectively it also indicates the positive impact of the electrochemical reaction occurred in hssf cw mfc fig 5 a direct correlation between achieved power density and cod removal also gives a direct indication of the positive impact of electrochemical reaction fig 5 besides this wetland plants also have some impact on power generation and cod removal lu et al 2015 36 has explained the impact of canna indica plants and mentioned that the rhizomes of canna indica could accommodate a diverse microbial community which further impact power density of cw mfcs the said study had achieved a power density of 18 mw m2 similarly oodally et al 2019 37 have used three different plants cyperus prolifer wachendorfia thyrsiflora and phragmites australis in cw mfc the finding of their study was the highest voltage 510mv power density 229 52 mw m3 and cod removal up to 97 1 were achieved from cyperus prolifer in comparison to other plants furthermore there are some other technologies integrated with mfcs which also contributes in high cod removal bolton randall 2019 5 has used mfc integrated sand filters for cod removal and has achieved a complete bacterial removal along with 99 0 cod removal from 432 mg l of initial cod with a power density of 4 33 mw m3 conclusively mfc integrated technologies have shown enhanced cod removal further the cod removal has been found correlated with power density 3 5 implication the integration of mfcs with cws is still in its early stage but it has shown promise in terms of enhanced wastewater treatment efficiency with additional advantages such as electricity generation anaerobic processes are well known for their slow rate oxidation of organic matter or other biodegradable substances anode electrode of mfc acts as a temporary electron acceptor for the oxidation of a biodegradable substance in the anaerobic environment cws also suffer from the slow rate of treatment due to the dominance of anaerobic conditions in their filter bed in such a situation the integration of mfc into cw is very helpful in enhancing the treatment rate this study has experimentally established the enhancement in the treatment rate this study opens a new way of improving the treatment rate of anaerobic processes along with electricity generation however at present it can be noted that produced electrical power is not enough for practical use and significant research progress is required on this aspect to make it beneficial most of the current attempts of developing mfc integrated cws were investigated in a vertical flow column in small size with other optimum environments like the use of high performing expensive electrode materials and configuration such unrealistic situations always give the best results but very difficult to implement in real world cws it is always easy to maintain stratified redox conditions in vertical flow cw especially for up flow which is a prerequisite for the functioning of an mfc probably this is the reason for not attempting mfc integration in hssf cw this study attempts mfc integration into hssf cw at a pilot level with a careful design where the cathode is exposed to atmospheric air and anode is buried deep in the bottom layer of hssf cw microcosm for maintaining redox gradient for the function of mfc besides this the study has used low cost graphite gravels in both electrodes which are a crucial factor for a larger level implementation of mfc into cws moreover the power output of such systems is still a problem which could be solved by reducing the internal resistance and cathodic challenges of the systems 4 conclusion a pilot scale hssf cw mfc was successfully demonstrated for enhanced high strength synthetic sewage wastewater treatment and electricity generation the study concludes that the integration of mfc into cw technology is helpful in improving the oxidation of pollutants present in wastewater as an anode of mfc act as a temporary electron acceptor for the oxidation of pollutants the results clearly established that incorporation of the mfc in hssf cw can improve the treatment performance at least 33 0 even under very high organic loads of wastewater implementation of improved hssf cw mfc will help in the low cost treatment of wastewaters generated in various municipal and industrial activities and will promote cleaner production in these sectors acknowledgments authors would like to

14133,this work presents a new hybrid technology for treating wastewater along with electricity generation the main objective of this work was to integrate a microbial fuel cell mfc into a horizontal subsurface constructed wetland hssf cw mfc at a pilot scale for improving the wastewater treatment performance of hssf cw the hssf cw mfc was tested on three different organic loading rates 0 15 0 30 and 0 52 kg cod m3 d at a set hydraulic retention time the hssf cw mfc was further studied for establishing the influence of electron transfer using conductive material artificial electron acceptor on wastewater treatment performance during the efficient electron transfer system run in closed circuit operation 33 7 higher chemical oxygen demand cod removal was achieved in comparison to the hindered electron transfer system run in open circuit condition the results illustrate that efficient electron transfer from bottom anaerobic zones to the aerobic zone of the hssf cw helps in enhancing the treatment performance the maximum power and current densities achieved were 11 67 mw m3and 17 15 ma m3 respectively keywords constructed wetland microbial fuel cell constructed wetland microbial fuel cell open circuit closed circuit 1 introduction constructed wetland cw is a low cost technology for treating various wastewaters such as domestic industrial agricultural run off including dairy and livestock wastewater 1 cws are classified into two types based on the flow direction horizontal subsurface flow hssf and vertical subsurface flow vssf the hssf cw is the most common of these the main mechanisms involved in the removal of pollutants in any cws include sedimentation filtration adsorption absorption oxidation reduction and plant uptake 1 2 in an hssf cw the upper layer of the filter bed usually remains aerobic these aerobic areas located in the vicinity of the rhizospheric region which is a thick layer near or at the surface in contact with the atmosphere 3 4 a large anaerobic region sits below the aerobic region where there is no oxygen diffusion from the atmosphere anaerobic regions are generally considered to be slow pollutant treatment zones probably due to the lack of an electron acceptor leading to the slow treatment rate in an hssf cw 5 6 slow treatment rate is one of the biggest challenges for cw technology in recent years there has been rapid growth in microbial fuel cells mfcs applications for wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation from various wastewater and degradable substances 7 typical mfc is made of an anode a cathode a separator and an external circuit the anode of the mfc is kept in an anaerobic environment where it acts as an insoluble electron acceptor during the oxidation of degradable substrate by specialized bacteria that are capable of transferring electrons to the anode 7 these electrons are moved to the cathode of mfc via an external electrical circuit oxidation of substrate at anode also produces proton which travels to the cathode via separator or via the bulk fluid to maintain charge neutrality the circuit becomes complete when electrons and protons are consumed in a reduction reaction at the cathode with the terminal electron acceptors which is generally oxygen due to its availability and high redox potential 8 9 an mfc uses bacteria as a catalyst to convert chemical energy into electrical energy 2 10 oxidation of organic matters in mfc requires fermentative and electroactive bacteria eab to work in cooperation synergy 11 fermentative microorganisms break down complex organic matters into simpler one such as acetate ethanol glucose amino acids and other long chain fatty acids which can easily be oxidized by eab 12 eab gains energy from electron transfer to extracellular conductive insoluble material like graphite or other minerals this electron transfer can be facilitated by two main mechanisms direct electron transfer and by mediated electron transfer direct electron transfer requires physical contact between the microorganism and the conductive insoluble material through direct attachment or through nanowires or pili some of the eabs use indirect way where they use electron shuttles or mediator endogenous redox active molecules for transferring the electrons to conductive insoluble material such mediators collect electrons from the eab and transfer them to conductive insoluble material 12 overall mfc needs a redox gradient for its functioning as described earlier an hssf cw naturally consists of a redox gradient which is required to mfc for their functioning due to said complementary situation of mfc and cw integration of an mfc into a cw has recently emerged as an efficient technology for the enhancement of the treatment performance of the cw as well as the generation of electricity 7 13 16 mfc works based on oxidation reduction redox reactions oxidation occurs at anode electrode and reduction occurs at the cathode electrode at the anode organic matters or substrates oxidize and produce electrons and protons an anode is a very crucial component as it plays a vital role between physical electrode and biological microbes components protons reach the cathode through the proton exchange membrane pem for maintaining charge neutrality the potential difference between the anode and the cathode drags electrons from anode to cathode via flow through the circuit at the cathode the electrons the protons and oxygen perform a reduction reaction to form a water molecule whole oxidation reduction reactions happen as follows 17 1

anaerobic zone which catalyzes the biological reactions in the cw 2 14 an mfc integrated into a vertical flow constructed wetlands vf cws has been reported to perform 12 20 higher in cod removal in

measured to determine the relative electroactivity of both zones 25 the orp of the bottom layer was between 140 0 23 to 20 0 45 mv whereas near the surface it was between 140 0 23 40 0 33 mv the orp between both chambers is represented in fig 2 the potential at the surface was less negative than at the bottom in most of the situations under all loading conditions the less negative value near the surface shows a comparative less anaerobic condition while more negative values in the bottom layer indicate more anaerobic conditions corbella et al 2014 26 reported that plant regimes also have effects on the redox potentials of the cw the other factors which influence the redox condition are evapotranspiration and also the flow regimes of the system 27 doherty et al 2015 7 reported that planted wetlands produce almost 20 higher redox gradient as compared to unplanted ones the do was measured in both anode and cathode regions of the hssf cw mfc at each organic load the do was 1 85 0 25 to 2 15 0 5 mg l at the surface and 0 16 0 16 to 0 56 0 14 mg l in the bottom layer the measured do was found to be similar for each organic load at the surface and the bottom however the measured do was always higher in the surface layer than near the bottom due to direct contact with the atmosphere plants also release oxygen from their roots and this plays an important role in increasing the do level at the surface 28 29 low do levels near the bottom are due to the high level of organic contaminants 3 2 wastewater treatment as described earlier the hssf cw mfc was fed continuously with synthetic wastewater at three different organic loads of 0 15 0 30 and 0 52 kg cod m3 d l1 l2and l3 respectively the hrt was the same for all the organic loads 6 5 days the overall cod removal efficiency of the effluent for l1 l2 l3 cl and l3 op was 98 3 2 23 98 9 2 34 95 4 2 22 and 61 7 2 27 respectively the cod removal for l1 and l2 organic load was very similar at 98 99 however when the organic load was increased to l3 removal dropped to 68 2 22 for the first week of sampling after this period removal increased to 95 4 2 22 for closed circuit operation once the biomass acclimatized to the increased load similar results have been reported in another study 30 this time lag was related to the time required to increase the biomass to cope with the increased organic load when the circuit was disconnected at the same load l3 op the removal for the initial week of sampling was 75 2 27 and this decreased to 61 7 2 27 in the following weeks fig 3 statistical analysis showed that l3 cl and l3 op were significantly different α 0 05 this clearly shows the role of the transfer of electrons from the anode to the cathode on the removal of organic contaminants when the transfer of electrons was stopped by disconnecting the electrical circuit the cod removal efficiency decreased to 33 7 the role of conductive material as an artificial electron acceptor is reported in several publications 2 18 a few studies reported that in cw mfc the closed circuit operation could enhance the cod removal by up to 5 22 in comparison to open circuit operation 18 in the absence of electron acceptors the anaerobic reactions are usually slower in cw 31 the integration of a conductive material based electron transfer arrangement can enhance the treatment performance of cw in a closed circuit while disconnecting the circuit the treatment performance also declines the overall performance of the hssf cw mfc was analyzed along its length and samples were collected under closed circuit conditions from the three sample ports along the bed samples were taken from the surface and the bottom layers for each organic load for the lower loadings l1 and l2 the cod removal was always high at 96 99 0 1 it was also effectively the same in the bottom and the surface regions however cod removal efficiency was found to drop near the start of the bed when the highest loading l3 was introduced at p1 60 cm from the inlet it was 47 0 0 3 at the surface and only 37 3 0 3 at the bottom as the distance from inlet to the p1 was short and organic mass was high the interaction between the organic material and the biofilm was low so the removal was also low when the wastewater flowed from p1 to p3 the cod removal efficiency found to be increased at p2 56 cm further along the bed removal at the surface had increased to 64 9 0 03 and at the bottom 39 0 0 03 a further 56 cm along it was 79 0 0 03 at the surface and 56 2 0 03 at the bottom this trend of cod removal clearly shows that overall cod removal in the hssf cw mfc improved as the wastewater retention time was increased furthermore the cod removal at the surface was higher than in the bottom region for all ports a similar analysis was carried out for l3 under open circuit conditions l3 op for p1 at the surface 41 2 0 01 of the cod was removed under open circuit conditions and this was down to 30 2 0 01 for the bottom region for p2 at the surface removal was 63 8 0 01 and at the bottom it was 34 4 0 01 while for p3 78 9 0 01 was removed at the surface and 39 0 0 01 at the bottom these are lower in all cases than the corresponding sample points under closed circuit conditions and the difference is greatest for samples collected from the bottom layer when the circuit was disconnected the opportunity for electron transfer became limited so the removal was low in addition as the bottom was anaerobic it contained a lower level of electron acceptors in comparison to the surface where oxygen acts as a terminal electron acceptor increasing the cod removal efficiency 31 fig 4 presents the results of l1 l2 l3 cl and l3 op at all three ports p1 p2 and p3 3 3 electricity generation the voltage generation was assessed for l1 l2 l3 cl and l3 op after an established period of two weeks the voltage output was between 400 and 650 mv throughout the experiment at a constant resistance of 1 2 kω fig 5 a presents the voltage generation profile during the experiment at each load the maximum voltage achieved was 680 mv on l3 cl whereas in l3 op it was 654 mv the output voltage on other loads was reasonably constant throughout the study though voltage generation for l2 was somewhat higher in the range 552 mv 637 mv in l3 op even though resistance was infinitely high voltage output was almost the same as other loads a positive correlation was found between voltage output and cod removal except l3 op which had a negative correlation the highest correlation was found for l3 cl correlation 0 56 a relationship between power density and cod was established for l3 cl from fig 5b it is clear that as the cod removal increased the power density also increased the removal of cod occurred through oxidation of organic matter or cod causing matters such oxidation generates reducing equivalents electrons which move through a circuit to produce power current thus power density is correlated with cod removal further the power density was measured against the reactor anodic volume in m3 the maximum power density achieved was 11 64 mw m3 and the minimum was 4 6 mw m3 ce was calculated for l1 l2 and l3 cl the results indicate that the ce was always high at the low organic load such as l1 whereas when the load increased ce decreased fig 5c the similar results are reported by other researchers 32 it is also reported in the same report that when the composition of wastewater became too complex for easy degradation by the bacteria ce decreased moreover when ce was affected current production also reduced other studies of mfc suggest two processes are the major factors which affect the ce efficiency of the system firstly it is the presence of other bacteria such as methanogenic bacteria and secondly aerobic respiration which usually affects the electron transfer mechanism 32 33 anaerobic bacteria along with fermentative bacteria dominate the anode portion and can consume electrons in other reaction mechanisms which decrease the ce 21 34 these bacteria however help in breaking down organic compounds to short chain organics in which electroactive bacteria can easily degrade thus despite low ce the removal n the cw mfc increases 32 the low ce could also be a reason of large distance between anode and cathode which subsequently increases the internal resistance of the reactor in the present study the polarization curve allows an understanding of the activation loss concentration loss and ohmic loss based on a previous study 35 these losses give an insight into the hindrance in current production fig 6 represents the polarization curve on l3 cl it was drawn based on current density power density and voltage achieved by changing the resistance from high to low 8 the maximum observed current and power density was 0 59 ma m3 and 0 11 mw m3 respectively when using 1 2 kω resistances the curve explains that voltage was high at low current density at the maximum voltage current density was at its lowest and inversely at the lowest voltage was at its maximum a similar pattern was seen in other studies too 8 30 it can be seen from the polarization curve that the major losses in the present study are due to ohmic losses which indicate the hindrance in the current production of hssf cw mfc 3 4 influence of electrochemical reaction on cod removal the present work was also intended to investigate the influence of electrode conductive materials as the temporary electron acceptor in anaerobic biological oxidation of pollutants parameter cod was chosen as model pollutants of wastewater for assessing this impact a biological anaerobic process involves slow rate oxidation due to the limited availability of electron acceptors in this situation the presence of the electrode as a temporary electron acceptor can catalyze the oxidation rate however this process can be efficient when the cathode is connected with anode through an electrical circuit and placed in an aerobic environment where oxidants like oxygen must harvest incoming electrons in a continuous manner to investigate the influence of electron transfer from anode anaerobic zone where anode works as temporary electron acceptor to cathode aerobic zone on cod removal experiments were performed in open no to minimum electron transfer and closed circuit efficient electron transfer manner at organic loading rate of 0 52 kg cod m3 d it is evident from the results that a minimum of 9 6 in week number 5 and a maximum 33 7 in week number 7 enhancement in cod removal was achieved when microcosm was run in closed circuit mode in comparison to open circuit mode fig 3 these results clearly establish that electrode assisted electrochemical reaction helps in biological oxidation of pollutants in a positive way average coulombic efficiency was achieved to 1 05 and 1 86 in an organic loading rate of 0 52 kg cod m3 d and 0 15 kg cod m3 d respectively it also indicates the positive impact of the electrochemical reaction occurred in hssf cw mfc fig 5 a direct correlation between achieved power density and cod removal also gives a direct indication of the positive impact of electrochemical reaction fig 5 besides this wetland plants also have some impact on power generation and cod removal lu et al 2015 36 has explained the impact of canna indica plants and mentioned that the rhizomes of canna indica could accommodate a diverse microbial community which further impact power density of cw mfcs the said study had achieved a power density of 18 mw m2 similarly oodally et al 2019 37 have used three different plants cyperus prolifer wachendorfia thyrsiflora and phragmites australis in cw mfc the finding of their study was the highest voltage 510mv power density 229 52 mw m3 and cod removal up to 97 1 were achieved from cyperus prolifer in comparison to other plants furthermore there are some other technologies integrated with mfcs which also contributes in high cod removal bolton randall 2019 5 has used mfc integrated sand filters for cod removal and has achieved a complete bacterial removal along with 99 0 cod removal from 432 mg l of initial cod with a power density of 4 33 mw m3 conclusively mfc integrated technologies have shown enhanced cod removal further the cod removal has been found correlated with power density 3 5 implication the integration of mfcs with cws is still in its early stage but it has shown promise in terms of enhanced wastewater treatment efficiency with additional advantages such as electricity generation anaerobic processes are well known for their slow rate oxidation of organic matter or other biodegradable substances anode electrode of mfc acts as a temporary electron acceptor for the oxidation of a biodegradable substance in the anaerobic environment cws also suffer from the slow rate of treatment due to the dominance of anaerobic conditions in their filter bed in such a situation the integration of mfc into cw is very helpful in enhancing the treatment rate this study has experimentally established the enhancement in the treatment rate this study opens a new way of improving the treatment rate of anaerobic processes along with electricity generation however at present it can be noted that produced electrical power is not enough for practical use and significant research progress is required on this aspect to make it beneficial most of the current attempts of developing mfc integrated cws were investigated in a vertical flow column in small size with other optimum environments like the use of high performing expensive electrode materials and configuration such unrealistic situations always give the best results but very difficult to implement in real world cws it is always easy to maintain stratified redox conditions in vertical flow cw especially for up flow which is a prerequisite for the functioning of an mfc probably this is the reason for not attempting mfc integration in hssf cw this study attempts mfc integration into hssf cw at a pilot level with a careful design where the cathode is exposed to atmospheric air and anode is buried deep in the bottom layer of hssf cw microcosm for maintaining redox gradient for the function of mfc besides this the study has used low cost graphite gravels in both electrodes which are a crucial factor for a larger level implementation of mfc into cws moreover the power output of such systems is still a problem which could be solved by reducing the internal resistance and cathodic challenges of the systems 4 conclusion a pilot scale hssf cw mfc was successfully demonstrated for enhanced high strength synthetic sewage wastewater treatment and electricity generation the study concludes that the integration of mfc into cw technology is helpful in improving the oxidation of pollutants present in wastewater as an anode of mfc act as a temporary electron acceptor for the oxidation of pollutants the results clearly established that incorporation of the mfc in hssf cw can improve the treatment performance at least 33 0 even under very high organic loads of wastewater implementation of improved hssf cw mfc will help in the low cost treatment of wastewaters generated in various municipal and industrial activities and will promote cleaner production in these sectors acknowledgments authors would like to

14134,defluoridation and disinfection of groundwater have been attempted in this study using carbonized bone meal cbm impregnated polysulfone based mixed matrix hollow fiber membrane the membranes were characterized in terms of permeability hydrophilicity molecular weight cut off for different cbm concentrations the membrane permeability was decreased from 5 10 10 m pa s without cbm to 2 8 10 11 m pa s with addition of 15 wt cbm corresponding reduction in molecular weight cut off was from 85 kda to 23 kda variation of such properties were corroborated by the scanning electron micrographs of the prepared membranes that showed the membrane morphology became dense due to cbm addition in the polymer matrix however membrane hydrophilicity became more pronounced in addition the surface roughness of the prepared membranes was increased facilitating the adsorptive properties the maximum fluoride adsorption capacity of the hollow fibers with 15 wt cbm was observed to be 5 mg g

world health organization xrd x ray diffraction 1 introduction fluoride contamination of groundwater is a severe water pollution hazard requiring urgent attention fluoride is a derivative of fluorine and it pollutes water bodies when percolated from sedimentary and igneous rocks due to natural weathering 1 untreated discharges from aluminium ore processing and toothpaste producing industries also increase the fluoride concentration in groundwater critical health related issues such as dental and skeletal fluorosis nerve paralysis and mutagenic deformation in infants are observed due to higher intake of fluoride 2 in terms of acute toxicity level fluoride is more poisonous than most of the heavy metals like lead and cadmium geographical mapping reveals most countries of african and asian continents are heavily affected due to presence of fluoride in groundwater safety level concentration of fluoride in drinking water should not be more than 1 5 mg l as per world health organization who recommendation 2 adsorption ion exchange coagulation and precipitation are some of the treatment techniques employed for defluoridation 3 6 however these processes exhibit some inherent limitations for example adsorption being an equilibrium governed process is slow 3 ion exchange resins follow a faster kinetics for fluoride removal but discharge phosphate and nitrate from their chemical structure in filtered stream 4 similarly coagulation and precipitation leave toxic sludge as by product 5 6 membrane filtration on the other hand does not have such restrictions and is an attractive alternative 7 nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro remove almost 90 of fluoride in groundwater 8 9 however excessive energy usage limits the cost effectiveness of membrane based treatment methods 8 additionally loss of 70 of feed water during reverse osmosis questions the ergonomics of the process 9 to circumvent such deterrent features mixed matrix membranes mmm are advantageous 10 this membrane typically utilizes impregnation of an additive in a polymer matrix by doing this filtration capability of the membrane and specific adsorptive property of the additive towards ionic contaminants are exploited simultaneously 10 prepared mmms operate in ultrafiltration uf range 11 different mmms have been reported for fluoride removal such as zirconium chitosan graphene oxide 12 exfoliated layer double hydroxides in polyethersulfone 13 aluminium fumarate metal organic framework impregnated polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber 14 and cellulose acetate phthalate flat sheet mmm 15 however synthesis of such inorganics employs expensive chemicals and complex techniques 16 additionally leaching of such inorganics from polymer matrix may pose a potential threat to the safety of the filtrate stream 17 in order to overcome these limitations a naturally abundant material with a modest treatment procedure can be used as a dope in polymer matrix bone meal is one such material which is used in fertilizer production it can be partially carbonized to increase its fluoride uptake capacity improvement in defluoridation performance occurs due to changes in the apatite structure of bone meal 18 another critical aspect of such membrane preparation is the compatibility between the inorganics and the polymers therefore choice of polymer also plays an important role during the preparation of mmms polysulfone psf belongs to a family of thermoplastic polymers and imparts toughness and stability at higher temperature due to their lower cost of processing these polymers are used for a variety of specialized applications 19 in the present study carbonized bone meal cbm impregnated psf based hollow fiber membranes are reported for fluoride removal applications the membrane samples were characterized in terms of permeability molecular weight cut off mwco porosity and hydrophilicity effect of additive concentration on the membrane morphology and surface

fibers with cbm concentration 3 1 1 inherent membrane properties this section details the variation of different membrane properties like permeability porosity molecular weight cut off and hydrophilicity with cbm concentration and the results are summarized in table 1 it is observed that the membrane permeability decreases with cbm concentration for example the permeability of mc0 membrane i e pure polymeric membrane is 5 10 10 m pa s on increasing the cbm concentration to 10 wt the permeability is substantially reduced to 7 8 10 11 m pa s further it is reduced to 2 8 10 11 m pa s when the cbm concentration increases to 15 wt this happens as the pores on membrane surface are blocked by the cbm particles reducing the membrane permeability it is also apparent from table 1 that shrinkage of pore size also contributes to the reduction of membrane permeability this is clear from the variation of mwco data with cbm concentration mwco of mc0 membrane is 85 kda and it reduces to 37 kda for mc1 membrane and 23 kda for mc2 membrane it is reported earlier that inorganic particles in polymeric matrix restrict the molecular motions of the polymer chains thereby decreasing the mean free volume lowering the membrane pore size 20 23 above findings also show a similar pattern in lowering the membrane porosity for example porosity is reduced from 91 for mc0 membrane to 86 for mc1 membrane however on increasing the cbm concentration to 15 mc2 membrane the porosity reduces significantly to 45 this observation is also corroborated by surface area reduction for example the surface area of mc0 membrane is 35 m2 g that decreases to 29 m2 g with addition of 10 wt cbm this again reduces to 26 m2 g when the cbm concentration increases to 15 wt mechanical strength is another property that highlights the elasticity and maximum stress that can be borne by membranes under dynamic operation it is observed that the tensile strength of the membrane samples decreases due to cbm impregnation in the matrix for example the tensile strength till break for mc0 membrane is 16 mpa it reduces nearly five times to 3 mpa for mc1 membranes on further impregnation of cbm particles the strength reduces marginally to 2 5 mpa as reported in literature restriction in polymer chain segmental mobility by cbm particles results in formation of weak interaction forces leading to transfer of stress between the filler particles cbm and polymer thereby reducing the tensile strength of the membrane 23 the mechanical strength and productivity of the hollow fibers can be augmented further by blending suitable concentration of polymeric fillers like polyvinyl pyrollidone polyethylene glycol polyvinyl alcohol chemical treatment of membrane surface is another route to enhance the mechanical strength along with productivity 24 however the hydrophilicity of prepared hollow fibers is improved due to addition of cbm for example the contact angle of water droplet on the surface of mc0 membrane is 78 9 that decreases to 63 7 for mc2 membrane being hydrophilic in nature cbm particles appear to the membrane surface during phase inversion improving the hydrophilicity of the membrane 24 data from table 1 also indicate that the viscosity of the spinning solution increases from 890 mpa s to 1569 mpa s with cbm concentration this observation signifies delay in the solvent nonsolvent exchange rate during membrane formation process resulting to denser morphology as explained in the following section 3 1 2 membrane morphology and surface roughness tem images of cbm particles are shown in fig 1 a and b it is observed that the cbm particles are thinly dispersed through entire analysis plate with agglomeration at some points fig 1a membrane morphology is highly influenced by addition of inorganic filler in the polymer matrix corresponding cross sectional micrographs are shown in fig 1 c e two things are clear from these figures first the prepared membrane shows an asymmetric structure consisting of thin dense layer followed by finger like macrovoids this mainly happens due to rapid phase inversion rate 23 second size of the macrovoids is reduced on addition of cbm in polymer it is due to the presence of cbm that affects the solvent nonsolvent exchange rate i e demixing increasing viscosity of the polymeric solution retards the phase separation kinetics leading to delayed demixing 24 this is quite apparent from table 1 where it is observed that the viscosity of the spinning solution increases almost two times upon addition of 15 wt cbm this phenomenon leads to the formation of denser microstructure however as impregnated cbm particles are hydrophilic see table 1 they induce high exchange rate between water nonsolvent and dmf solvent at the membrane interface resulting in faster demixing and macrovoid formation also with increase in the cbm concentration in polymeric solution the density of macrovoids reduces as observed from fig 1 c e internal and outer diameters of the prepared hollow fibers are 660 μm and 800 μm respectively see fig 1f top surface of the membranes see fig 1g h and i shows that pores on the outer surface of the membranes are blocked by cbm particles pore blocking along with macrovoids constriction corroborates the reduction in permeability mwco and porosity of prepared mmm with cbm concentration on further magnification the image shows dense structures with closely packed porous morphology it is also evident that the cbm particles do not leach out during phase inversion within the gelation bath as observed from edx images of mc2 and mc1 membrane refer fig 1k and l where peaks of calcium one of the constituents of cbm particles are observed 18 however the peaks of calcium are not present in pure polymeric i e mc0 membrane samples refer fig 1j variation of membrane roughness with cbm concentration is shown in afm images of fig 2 a c it is observed from these figures that the surface roughness of the prepared membranes increases with cbm concentration surface roughness of pure polymeric membrane i e mc0 is 2 nm this increases to 4 nm in mc1 10 wt cbm membrane see fig 2b and increases further to 6 nm in mc2 15 wt cbm membrane as shown in fig 2 c hydrophilic cbm particles are accumulated to the mmm surface during phase inversion increasing the surface roughness and facilitating the adsorptive ability of the membrane 25 26 this will be clearer in the following sections where it is observed through experimentation that defluoridation property of the mmms is improved upon cbm impregnation 3 1 3 mineralogical phases identification identification of different mineralogical phases in cbm particles pure polymeric membrane mc0 and prepared mmm mc2 are shown in fig 3 mineralogical phases found in the diffraction pattern of cbm particles having the highest intensity is hydroxypatite which is observed in diffraction angle 2θ 310 and 400 jcpds card no 9 432 as marked in the figure weak diffraction peak of crandallite icdd card no 04 017 9793 at 250 and silicious crandallite at 480 and 520 icdd card no 00 005 0616 can be found in this diffraction peak kyanoxalite icdd card no 04 017 7970 can be observed at 270 27 broad and less intense peaks of polysulfone can be observed at 2θ 170 along with the presence of glycol at 2θ 270 in the diffraction pattern of pure polymeric membrane mc0 28 incorporation of the peaks in mmm shows that the membrane is composed of mineral phases of both inorganics and polymer 3 1 4 functional groups identification ftir analysis of mc2 mmm before and after equilibration with fluoride is shown in fig 4 stretch between 4000 cm 1 and 2978 cm 1 spectra shows an inverted trough for a fresh mmm compared to fluoride equilibrated mmm this feature is due to the loss of adsorbed water molecules during drying of the membrane samples this stretch 4000 cm 1 2978 cm 1 represents the hydroxyl groups peaks at 2921 cm 1 and 2978 cm 1 are due to the presence of methoxy ch3 o and alkyne cc groups stretch between 1590 cm 1 and 2921 cm 1 confirms the presence of polyethylene glycol 29 transmittance peaks at 1590 cm 1 and 1500 cm 1 correspond to purine content of impregnated cbm beyond this region peaks at 1328 cm 1 and 1304 cm 1 signify the vibrations due to aryl sulfone of psf in prepared hollow fibers cumulative peaks at 1240 cm 1 1148 cm 1 and 1099 cm 1 confirm the presence of phosphate group in cbm particles 30 sharp and composite peaks at the lower region i e 882 cm 1 831 cm 1 and 687 cm 1 show existence of carbonyl with calcium and phosphate containing compounds like hydroxyapatite equilibration of prepared mmm with fluoride solution lowers the recorded spectra due to incorporation of the solute within the active sites of cbm 31 3 1 5 anti bacterial property variation viability of bacterial cells after subsequent treatment with pure polymeric membrane mc0 and mmm mc2 are shown in fig 5 b and c respectively vibrant green fluorescent pattern on mc0 membrane is a characteristic feature of living bacterial cells growing on the membrane surface refer fig 5a however appearance of green dots was reduced remarkably after treating with mmm due to inactivation of bacteria our earlier study demonstrated inherent antibacterial property of cbm 20 physical adsorption becomes more pronounced inducing inactivation of cultured cells by prepared hollow fibers as bacteria interacts with calcium and phosphate groups of cbm particles furthermore lesser number of cellular adhesions confirm antifouling nature of the membrane due to augmented hydrophilicity 21 29 as shown by the fluorescence images considerable reduction in viable cell was observed after treating with mc2 membrane it is simply due to the antibacterial activity of the mmm since cbm possesses calcium and phosphate groups on their surface physical adsorption of bacteria becomes dominant mechanism of cellular inactivation the outer membrane of bacteria consists of anionic lipopolysaccharide layer which is adsorbed readily by cationic components of cbm thereby damaging the cell membrane the observation was in line with our earlier study 18 certainly cbm has a lot of potential as biocidal agent it is evident that both the adhesion density and viability of bacteria were significantly reduced when treated with mc2 membrane compared to mc0 this is fundamentally due to the physical adsorption eventually causing lysis of the cells for example at optimum dose of cbm 15 wt in mc2 bacteria fail to retain their normal morphology due to excessive stress created by adsorption and become inactive this is ascribed to the bacteriostatic nature of cbm 3 2 fluoride removal performance of prepared mmm 3 2 1 equilibrium studies equilibrium studies were carried out to observe the uptake capacity of the membrane samples in batch mode and corresponding results are shown in fig 6 it is observed that the adsorption capacity of pure polymeric membrane is considerably lower than the hollow fiber mmm i e mc2 for example maximum adsorption capacity of mc0 membrane is 1 5 mg g while that of mc2 membrane is 5 mg g fluoride ions freely migrating within the solution are sorbed on the surface of the mmm and interact strongly with the calcium and phosphate groups in cbm effecting their removal pure polymeric membrane removes fluoride to much lower extent due to electrostatic repulsion between fluoride ions and sulfone group in the membrane 29 3 2 2 effect of different operating conditions in cross flow fluoride removal capacity of the prepared mmm is affected by several factors such as solution ph competing anions operating pressure and flow rate see fig 7 increase in cbm percentage in mmm also improves fluoride removal capacity and it is shown in fig 7 a in this experiment permeate samples were collected over eight hours at an interval of 60 min for a pressure and cross flow rate of 34 kpa and 10 l h respectively it is observed that membrane mc0 has the lowest fluoride removal capacity while it is improved for mc1 10 wt and mc2 15 wt for example fluoride concentration in the filtrate reduces marginally to 4 2 mg l feed concentration 5 mg l at 120 min for mc0 membrane however under the same operating conditions fluoride concentration decreases to 1 8 mg l and further to 0 5 mg l for mc1 and mc2 membranes respectively hence the main mechanism behind improved filtration capacity of the membranes is adsorption by impregnated cbm particles 20 the adsorptive capacity of mc0 membrane is low 1 5 mg g compared to mc2 membrane 5 mg g adsorptive capacity for a membrane with 5 cbm concentration was 1 8 mg g which is comparatively lower than mc1 and mc2 membranes as the focus of this study was to devise a membrane having higher defluoridation and antibacterial performance experimental data of prepared membranes having cbm loading lesser than 10 were not reported effect of different coexisting ions is also another important study to analyse the fluoride removal capacity of mmm in presence of different charged groups results are shown in fig 7 b no interference is observed in case of chloride ions as it has the lowest negative charge removal capacity of fluoride remains almost 95 till 600 mg l chloride concentration in feed however removal capacity decreases to 60 and 50 for nitrate and carbonate concentration of 600 mg l respectively maximum interference is caused by the sulfate ions in the feed for example fluoride removal capacity decreases to 48 when sulfate concentration becomes 600 mg l increase in charge and molecular weight of competing ions chloride single negative charge 35 g mol nitrate single negative charge 62 g mol carbonate dual negative charge 60 g mol sulphate dual negative charge 96 g mol also plays an important role in fluoride adsorption 31 effect of ph on fluoride filtration capability of mmm is shown in fig 7 c it is observed that the operating ph of the solution controls the fluoride removal capacity of the membranes this occurs due to change in surface charge on the mmm with operating ph for example membrane surface becomes positively charged when operating ph is below the isoelectric point phzpc while it is negatively charged when the operating ph is above phzpc 32 therefore in order to effect maximum removal negatively charged fluoride ions should be adsorbed on the positively charged membrane surface as phzpc of mc2 membrane is 7 4 removal of fluoride is high in acidic ph for example the removal is 95 at ph 2 5 at neutral ph i e 7 0 free fluoride ions in the solution are transported to the cbm particles in mmm where chemical interaction occurs between fluoride ions and calcium phosphate groups of cbm therefore they are adsorbed by the cbm particles on the mmm surface this lowers the concentration of fluoride in the residual solution however at ph higher than 7 4 isoelectric ph the removal capacity starts decreasing as observed from fig 7 c for example removal is only 25 at ph 11 5 this occurs as removal efficiency of fluoride ions decrease due to electrostatic repulsion by mmm surface 32 effect of transmembrane pressure drop on the fluoride filtration capacity and permeate flux of mc2 is shown in fig 7 d and e respectively it is observed that the fluoride concentration in the filtrate increases with pressure drop across the membrane at a cross flow rate 10 l h for example fluoride concentration in the filtrate is 2 7 mg l feed concentration 5 mg l at 180 min of filtration when the pressure is 70 kpa this decreases to 1 9 mg l and 0 4 mg l when pressure is lowered to 55 kpa and 34 kpa respectively decrease in fluoride concentration is due to enhanced interaction between cbm particles and fluoride ions at lower pressure 32 however the driving force decreases due to reduction in pressure resulting in lower permeate flux for example the permeate flux at 70 kpa is 6 3 l m2h which decreases to 4 8 l m2h at 55 kpa and 2 8 l m2h at 34 kpa after 180 min similarly cross flow rate affects the permeate flux and fluoride concentration in permeate see fig 7e permeate flux is increased marginally at higher cross flow rate fluoride concentration in permeate increases with cross flow rate due to lower contact time thereby effecting less adsorption for example the permeate fluoride concentration after 180 min of experiments is 0 4 mg l at 10 l h this increases to 0 6 mg l and 1 mg l at 30 l h and 50 l h respectively 3 2 3 long term dynamic cross flow run rejection capability of the membrane during dynamic cross flow run has been examined and shown in fig 8 flux and permeate concentration of the filtrate were determined experimentally and the variation in permeate concentration has been shown as a function of filtered volume of water experiments were conducted at 34 kpa and 10 l h since the fluoride removal capacity was maximum at these operating conditions volume of filtered water has been calculated by multiplying the flux with time of filtration and the area of the membrane 0 029 m2 it is observed that the volume of filtered water till breakthrough concentration 1 5 mg l is 1400 ml breakthrough time 24 h for a fresh mmm during initial 600 800 ml 9 10 hours of filtration of filtered volume the concentration of permeate almost remained the same due to rapid adsorption of fluoride by impregnated cbm in mmm however concentration increases after 900 ml of filtered volume due to saturation of active sites in cbm present within the prepared hollow fibers concentration of filtered water increases beyond allowable limit due to complete exhaustion of the active sites after the first run the membrane was desorbed using 0 1 n sodium hydroxide followed by washing at neutral ph and the second run was conducted it is observed that the volume of filtered water decreases to 1200 ml breakthrough time 19 h compared to the first run 1400 ml this happens due to incomplete desorption and permanent loss of active sites from the mmm during the first run volume of water obtained till breakthrough during filtration of real life groundwater is 1000 ml breakthrough time 18 h filtered volume is decreased compared to synthetic feed solution due to interference by dissolved solids and other coexisting ions complete characterization of feed and permeate stream in terms of ph dissolved solids different ions and bacterial concentration has been performed and shown in table 2 concentration of bacteria in feed is 2600 cfu 100 ml that becomes 0 cfu 100 ml after one hour of operation and remained invariant till breakthrough hence the prepared membrane has both defluoridating and antimicrobial properties 3 3 comparison of performance with different membranes comparison regarding the performance of conventional nf ro and other mmms reported in different studies with cbm psf mmm is presented in table 3 it has been observed that most of conventional membranes operate at comparatively higher pressure drop for example nf 90 has a cut off 90 da and it reduces fluoride concentration from 22 mg l to 0 2 mg l at 1000 kpa pressure drop 9 33 36 however the prepared hollow fiber mmm used in our study has 23 kda cut off and hence is more open pore and consumes less power compared to nf and ro membranes thus the prepared hollow fiber mmm can substitute the conventional membranes there are reports where different mmms were prepared for fluoride removal 12 15 20 however most of these studies have not shown any anti bacterial investigations also some studies have not shown performance of the membrane during dynamic operation 12 13 in one of our earlier study flat sheet cap activated alumina mmm 24 kda cut off reduced fluoride concentration from 4 mg l to 0 5 mg l in case of simulated tap water feed 20 in case of hollow fiber mmm operated at 34 kpa tmp the fluoride concentration in filtrate is 0 3 mg l when the groundwater has 3 2 mg l concentration in addition these membranes also disinfect water from bacterial contamination for example hollow fiber mmm can filter water having no residual bacteria in permeate 0 cfu 100 ml from a feed having 2600 cfu 100 ml of bacterial concentration 4 conclusions cbm impregnated uf grade hollow fiber mmm was used for removal of fluoride from groundwater maximum fluoride uptake capacity increased from 1 5 mg g for hollow fiber without cbm to 5 mg g for fibers incorporating 15 wt cbm presence of chloride ions in feed affected the fluoride removal capacity marginally however sulfate ions exhibited the maximum interference effect at 34 kpa transmembrane pressure drop and 10 l h cross flow rate maximum defluoridation capacity was observed breakthrough volume for synthetic feed 5 mg l was 1400 ml and that for contaminated groundwater 3 2 mg l was 1000 ml where the membrane area was 0 029 m2 hollow fibers were successfully regenerated by 0 1 m sodium hydroxide solution for two long runs bacterial cells were completely removed by the mmm from2600 cfu 100 ml to 0 cfu 100 ml for contaminated groundwater prepared mmm hollow fibers have

14134,defluoridation and disinfection of groundwater have been attempted in this study using carbonized bone meal cbm impregnated polysulfone based mixed matrix hollow fiber membrane the membranes were characterized in terms of permeability hydrophilicity molecular weight cut off for different cbm concentrations the membrane permeability was decreased from 5 10 10 m pa s without cbm to 2 8 10 11 m pa s with addition of 15 wt cbm corresponding reduction in molecular weight cut off was from 85 kda to 23 kda variation of such properties were corroborated by the scanning electron micrographs of the prepared membranes that showed the membrane morphology became dense due to cbm addition in the polymer matrix however membrane hydrophilicity became more pronounced in addition the surface roughness of the prepared membranes was increased facilitating the adsorptive properties the maximum fluoride adsorption capacity of the hollow fibers with 15 wt cbm was observed to be 5 mg g breakthrough studies were conducted for the membranes in cross flow filtration mode that showed a fresh membrane area 0 029 m2 can filter fluoride contaminated feed solution successfully for 24 h and 19 h for the first and second regeneration cycles for a real life groundwater feed solution the breakthrough time was observed to be 18 h the bacterial concentration in the filtrate samples was found

world health organization xrd x ray diffraction 1 introduction fluoride contamination of groundwater is a severe water pollution hazard requiring urgent attention fluoride is a derivative of fluorine and it pollutes water bodies when percolated from sedimentary and igneous rocks due to natural weathering 1 untreated discharges from aluminium ore processing and toothpaste producing industries also increase the fluoride concentration in groundwater critical health related issues such as dental and skeletal fluorosis nerve paralysis and mutagenic deformation in infants are observed due to higher intake of fluoride 2 in terms of acute toxicity level fluoride is more poisonous than most of the heavy metals like lead and cadmium geographical mapping reveals most countries of african and asian continents are heavily affected due to presence of fluoride in groundwater safety level concentration of fluoride in drinking water should not be more than 1 5 mg l as per world health organization who recommendation 2 adsorption ion exchange coagulation and precipitation are some of the treatment techniques employed for defluoridation 3 6 however these processes exhibit some inherent limitations for example adsorption being an equilibrium governed process is slow 3 ion exchange resins follow a faster kinetics for fluoride removal but discharge phosphate and nitrate from their chemical structure in filtered stream 4 similarly coagulation and precipitation leave toxic sludge as by product 5 6 membrane filtration on the other hand does not have such restrictions and is an attractive alternative 7 nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro remove almost 90 of fluoride in groundwater 8 9 however excessive energy usage limits the cost effectiveness of membrane based treatment methods 8 additionally loss of 70 of feed water during reverse osmosis questions the ergonomics of the process 9 to circumvent such deterrent features mixed matrix membranes mmm are advantageous 10 this membrane typically utilizes impregnation of an additive in a polymer matrix by doing this filtration capability of the membrane and specific adsorptive property of the additive towards ionic contaminants are exploited simultaneously 10 prepared mmms operate in ultrafiltration uf range 11 different mmms have been reported for fluoride removal such as zirconium chitosan graphene oxide 12 exfoliated layer double hydroxides in polyethersulfone 13 aluminium fumarate metal organic framework impregnated polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber 14 and cellulose acetate phthalate flat sheet mmm 15 however synthesis of such inorganics employs expensive chemicals and complex techniques 16 additionally leaching of such inorganics from polymer matrix may pose a potential threat to the safety of the filtrate stream 17 in order to overcome these limitations a naturally abundant material with a modest treatment procedure can be used as a dope in polymer matrix bone meal is one such material which is used in fertilizer production it can be partially carbonized to increase its fluoride uptake capacity improvement in defluoridation performance occurs due to changes in the apatite structure of bone meal 18 another critical aspect of such membrane preparation is the compatibility between the inorganics and the polymers therefore choice of polymer also plays an important role during the preparation of mmms polysulfone psf belongs to a family of thermoplastic polymers and imparts toughness and stability at higher temperature due to their lower cost of processing these polymers are used for a variety of specialized applications 19 in the present study carbonized bone meal cbm impregnated psf based hollow fiber membranes are reported for fluoride removal applications the membrane samples were characterized in terms of permeability molecular weight cut off mwco porosity and hydrophilicity effect of additive concentration on the membrane morphology and surface roughness was also studied finally the best membrane was selected based on its fluoride removal capacity and it is subjected to long duration filtration experiments using synthetic and contaminated

product showed the highest fluoride adsorption capacity of 12 5 mg g compared to other adsorbents which were prepared under different operating conditions 18 following this it was washed several times dried at 60 c for 4 h and pulverized to 50 60 μm 2 3 preparation of hollow fiber mmms cbm particles were added in two concentrations in the casting solution i e 10 and 15 by weight initially dried cbm

fibers with cbm concentration 3 1 1 inherent membrane properties this section details the variation of different membrane properties like permeability porosity molecular weight cut off and hydrophilicity with cbm concentration and the results are summarized in table 1 it is observed that the membrane permeability decreases with cbm concentration for example the permeability of mc0 membrane i e pure polymeric membrane is 5 10 10 m pa s on increasing the cbm concentration to 10 wt the permeability is substantially reduced to 7 8 10 11 m pa s further it is reduced to 2 8 10 11 m pa s when the cbm concentration increases to 15 wt this happens as the pores on membrane surface are blocked by the cbm particles reducing the membrane permeability it is also apparent from table 1 that shrinkage of pore size also contributes to the reduction of membrane permeability this is clear from the variation of mwco data with cbm concentration mwco of mc0 membrane is 85 kda and it reduces to 37 kda for mc1 membrane and 23 kda for mc2 membrane it is reported earlier that inorganic particles in polymeric matrix restrict the molecular motions of the polymer chains thereby decreasing the mean free volume lowering the membrane pore size 20 23 above findings also show a similar pattern in lowering the membrane porosity for example porosity is reduced from 91 for mc0 membrane to 86 for mc1 membrane however on increasing the cbm concentration to 15 mc2 membrane the porosity reduces significantly to 45 this observation is also corroborated by surface area reduction for example the surface area of mc0 membrane is 35 m2 g that decreases to 29 m2 g with addition of 10 wt cbm this again reduces to 26 m2 g when the cbm concentration increases to 15 wt mechanical strength is another property that highlights the elasticity and maximum stress that can be borne by membranes under dynamic operation it is observed that the tensile strength of the membrane samples decreases due to cbm impregnation in the matrix for example the tensile strength till break for mc0 membrane is 16 mpa it reduces nearly five times to 3 mpa for mc1 membranes on further impregnation of cbm particles the strength reduces marginally to 2 5 mpa as reported in literature restriction in polymer chain segmental mobility by cbm particles results in formation of weak interaction forces leading to transfer of stress between the filler particles cbm and polymer thereby reducing the tensile strength of the membrane 23 the mechanical strength and productivity of the hollow fibers can be augmented further by blending suitable concentration of polymeric fillers like polyvinyl pyrollidone polyethylene glycol polyvinyl alcohol chemical treatment of membrane surface is another route to enhance the mechanical strength along with productivity 24 however the hydrophilicity of prepared hollow fibers is improved due to addition of cbm for example the contact angle of water droplet on the surface of mc0 membrane is 78 9 that decreases to 63 7 for mc2 membrane being hydrophilic in nature cbm particles appear to the membrane surface during phase inversion improving the hydrophilicity of the membrane 24 data from table 1 also indicate that the viscosity of the spinning solution increases from 890 mpa s to 1569 mpa s with cbm concentration this observation signifies delay in the solvent nonsolvent exchange rate during membrane formation process resulting to denser morphology as explained in the following section 3 1 2 membrane morphology and surface roughness tem images of cbm particles are shown in fig 1 a and b it is observed that the cbm particles are thinly dispersed through entire analysis plate with agglomeration at some points fig 1a membrane morphology is highly influenced by addition of inorganic filler in the polymer matrix corresponding cross sectional micrographs are shown in fig 1 c e two things are clear from these figures first the prepared membrane shows an asymmetric structure consisting of thin dense layer followed by finger like macrovoids this mainly happens due to rapid phase inversion rate 23 second size of the macrovoids is reduced on addition of cbm in polymer it is due to the presence of cbm that affects the solvent nonsolvent exchange rate i e demixing increasing viscosity of the polymeric solution retards the phase separation kinetics leading to delayed demixing 24 this is quite apparent from table 1 where it is observed that the viscosity of the spinning solution increases almost two times upon addition of 15 wt cbm this phenomenon leads to the formation of denser microstructure however as impregnated cbm particles are hydrophilic see table 1 they induce high exchange rate between water nonsolvent and dmf solvent at the membrane interface resulting in faster demixing and macrovoid formation also with increase in the cbm concentration in polymeric solution the density of macrovoids reduces as observed from fig 1 c e internal and outer diameters of the prepared hollow fibers are 660 μm and 800 μm respectively see fig 1f top surface of the membranes see fig 1g h and i shows that pores on the outer surface of the membranes are blocked by cbm particles pore blocking along with macrovoids constriction corroborates the reduction in permeability mwco and porosity of prepared mmm with cbm concentration on further magnification the image shows dense structures with closely packed porous morphology it is also evident that the cbm particles do not leach out during phase inversion within the gelation bath as observed from edx images of mc2 and mc1 membrane refer fig 1k and l where peaks of calcium one of the constituents of cbm particles are observed 18 however the peaks of calcium are not present in pure polymeric i e mc0 membrane samples refer fig 1j variation of membrane roughness with cbm concentration is shown in afm images of fig 2 a c it is observed from these figures that the surface roughness of the prepared membranes increases with cbm concentration surface roughness of pure polymeric membrane i e mc0 is 2 nm this increases to 4 nm in mc1 10 wt cbm membrane see fig 2b and increases further to 6 nm in mc2 15 wt cbm membrane as shown in fig 2 c hydrophilic cbm particles are accumulated to the mmm surface during phase inversion increasing the surface roughness and facilitating the adsorptive ability of the membrane 25 26 this will be clearer in the following sections where it is observed through experimentation that defluoridation property of the mmms is improved upon cbm impregnation 3 1 3 mineralogical phases identification identification of different mineralogical phases in cbm particles pure polymeric membrane mc0 and prepared mmm mc2 are shown in fig 3 mineralogical phases found in the diffraction pattern of cbm particles having the highest intensity is hydroxypatite which is observed in diffraction angle 2θ 310 and 400 jcpds card no 9 432 as marked in the figure weak diffraction peak of crandallite icdd card no 04 017 9793 at 250 and silicious crandallite at 480 and 520 icdd card no 00 005 0616 can be found in this diffraction peak kyanoxalite icdd card no 04 017 7970 can be observed at 270 27 broad and less intense peaks of polysulfone can be observed at 2θ 170 along with the presence of glycol at 2θ 270 in the diffraction pattern of pure polymeric membrane mc0 28 incorporation of the peaks in mmm shows that the membrane is composed of mineral phases of both inorganics and polymer 3 1 4 functional groups identification ftir analysis of mc2 mmm before and after equilibration with fluoride is shown in fig 4 stretch between 4000 cm 1 and 2978 cm 1 spectra shows an inverted trough for a fresh mmm compared to fluoride equilibrated mmm this feature is due to the loss of adsorbed water molecules during drying of the membrane samples this stretch 4000 cm 1 2978 cm 1 represents the hydroxyl groups peaks at 2921 cm 1 and 2978 cm 1 are due to the presence of methoxy ch3 o and alkyne cc groups stretch between 1590 cm 1 and 2921 cm 1 confirms the presence of polyethylene glycol 29 transmittance peaks at 1590 cm 1 and 1500 cm 1 correspond to purine content of impregnated cbm beyond this region peaks at 1328 cm 1 and 1304 cm 1 signify the vibrations due to aryl sulfone of psf in prepared hollow fibers cumulative peaks at 1240 cm 1 1148 cm 1 and 1099 cm 1 confirm the presence of phosphate group in cbm particles 30 sharp and composite peaks at the lower region i e 882 cm 1 831 cm 1 and 687 cm 1 show existence of carbonyl with calcium and phosphate containing compounds like hydroxyapatite equilibration of prepared mmm with fluoride solution lowers the recorded spectra due to incorporation of the solute within the active sites of cbm 31 3 1 5 anti bacterial property variation viability of bacterial cells after subsequent treatment with pure polymeric membrane mc0 and mmm mc2 are shown in fig 5 b and c respectively vibrant green fluorescent pattern on mc0 membrane is a characteristic feature of living bacterial cells growing on the membrane surface refer fig 5a however appearance of green dots was reduced remarkably after treating with mmm due to inactivation of bacteria our earlier study demonstrated inherent antibacterial property of cbm 20 physical adsorption becomes more pronounced inducing inactivation of cultured cells by prepared hollow fibers as bacteria interacts with calcium and phosphate groups of cbm particles furthermore lesser number of cellular adhesions confirm antifouling nature of the membrane due to augmented hydrophilicity 21 29 as shown by the fluorescence images considerable reduction in viable cell was observed after treating with mc2 membrane it is simply due to the antibacterial activity of the mmm since cbm possesses calcium and phosphate groups on their surface physical adsorption of bacteria becomes dominant mechanism of cellular inactivation the outer membrane of bacteria consists of anionic lipopolysaccharide layer which is adsorbed readily by cationic components of cbm thereby damaging the cell membrane the observation was in line with our earlier study 18 certainly cbm has a lot of potential as biocidal agent it is evident that both the adhesion density and viability of bacteria were significantly reduced when treated with mc2 membrane compared to mc0 this is fundamentally due to the physical adsorption eventually causing lysis of the cells for example at optimum dose of cbm 15 wt in mc2 bacteria fail to retain their normal morphology due to excessive stress created by adsorption and become inactive this is ascribed to the bacteriostatic nature of cbm 3 2 fluoride removal performance of prepared mmm 3 2 1 equilibrium studies equilibrium studies were carried out to observe the uptake capacity of the membrane samples in batch mode and corresponding results are shown in fig 6 it is observed that the adsorption capacity of pure polymeric membrane is considerably lower than the hollow fiber mmm i e mc2 for example maximum adsorption capacity of mc0 membrane is 1 5 mg g while that of mc2 membrane is 5 mg g fluoride ions freely migrating within the solution are sorbed on the surface of the mmm and interact strongly with the calcium and phosphate groups in cbm effecting their removal pure polymeric membrane removes fluoride to much lower extent due to electrostatic repulsion between fluoride ions and sulfone group in the membrane 29 3 2 2 effect of different operating conditions in cross flow fluoride removal capacity of the prepared mmm is affected by several factors such as solution ph competing anions operating pressure and flow rate see fig 7 increase in cbm percentage in mmm also improves fluoride removal capacity and it is shown in fig 7 a in this experiment permeate samples were collected over eight hours at an interval of 60 min for a pressure and cross flow rate of 34 kpa and 10 l h respectively it is observed that membrane mc0 has the lowest fluoride removal capacity while it is improved for mc1 10 wt and mc2 15 wt for example fluoride concentration in the filtrate reduces marginally to 4 2 mg l feed concentration 5 mg l at 120 min for mc0 membrane however under the same operating conditions fluoride concentration decreases to 1 8 mg l and further to 0 5 mg l for mc1 and mc2 membranes respectively hence the main mechanism behind improved filtration capacity of the membranes is adsorption by impregnated cbm particles 20 the adsorptive capacity of mc0 membrane is low 1 5 mg g compared to mc2 membrane 5 mg g adsorptive capacity for a membrane with 5 cbm concentration was 1 8 mg g which is comparatively lower than mc1 and mc2 membranes as the focus of this study was to devise a membrane having higher defluoridation and antibacterial performance experimental data of prepared membranes having cbm loading lesser than 10 were not reported effect of different coexisting ions is also another important study to analyse the fluoride removal capacity of mmm in presence of different charged groups results are shown in fig 7 b no interference is observed in case of chloride ions as it has the lowest negative charge removal capacity of fluoride remains almost 95 till 600 mg l chloride concentration in feed however removal capacity decreases to 60 and 50 for nitrate and carbonate concentration of 600 mg l respectively maximum interference is caused by the sulfate ions in the feed for example fluoride removal capacity decreases to 48 when sulfate concentration becomes 600 mg l increase in charge and molecular weight of competing ions chloride single negative charge 35 g mol nitrate single negative charge 62 g mol carbonate dual negative charge 60 g mol sulphate dual negative charge 96 g mol also plays an important role in fluoride adsorption 31 effect of ph on fluoride filtration capability of mmm is shown in fig 7 c it is observed that the operating ph of the solution controls the fluoride removal capacity of the membranes this occurs due to change in surface charge on the mmm with operating ph for example membrane surface becomes positively charged when operating ph is below the isoelectric point phzpc while it is negatively charged when the operating ph is above phzpc 32 therefore in order to effect maximum removal negatively charged fluoride ions should be adsorbed on the positively charged membrane surface as phzpc of mc2 membrane is 7 4 removal of fluoride is high in acidic ph for example the removal is 95 at ph 2 5 at neutral ph i e 7 0 free fluoride ions in the solution are transported to the cbm particles in mmm where chemical interaction occurs between fluoride ions and calcium phosphate groups of cbm therefore they are adsorbed by the cbm particles on the mmm surface this lowers the concentration of fluoride in the residual solution however at ph higher than 7 4 isoelectric ph the removal capacity starts decreasing as observed from fig 7 c for example removal is only 25 at ph 11 5 this occurs as removal efficiency of fluoride ions decrease due to electrostatic repulsion by mmm surface 32 effect of transmembrane pressure drop on the fluoride filtration capacity and permeate flux of mc2 is shown in fig 7 d and e respectively it is observed that the fluoride concentration in the filtrate increases with pressure drop across the membrane at a cross flow rate 10 l h for example fluoride concentration in the filtrate is 2 7 mg l feed concentration 5 mg l at 180 min of filtration when the pressure is 70 kpa this decreases to 1 9 mg l and 0 4 mg l when pressure is lowered to 55 kpa and 34 kpa respectively decrease in fluoride concentration is due to enhanced interaction between cbm particles and fluoride ions at lower pressure 32 however the driving force decreases due to reduction in pressure resulting in lower permeate flux for example the permeate flux at 70 kpa is 6 3 l m2h which decreases to 4 8 l m2h at 55 kpa and 2 8 l m2h at 34 kpa after 180 min similarly cross flow rate affects the permeate flux and fluoride concentration in permeate see fig 7e permeate flux is increased marginally at higher cross flow rate fluoride concentration in permeate increases with cross flow rate due to lower contact time thereby effecting less adsorption for example the permeate fluoride concentration after 180 min of experiments is 0 4 mg l at 10 l h this increases to 0 6 mg l and 1 mg l at 30 l h and 50 l h respectively 3 2 3 long term dynamic cross flow run rejection capability of the membrane during dynamic cross flow run has been examined and shown in fig 8 flux and permeate concentration of the filtrate were determined experimentally and the variation in permeate concentration has been shown as a function of filtered volume of water experiments were conducted at 34 kpa and 10 l h since the fluoride removal capacity was maximum at these operating conditions volume of filtered water has been calculated by multiplying the flux with time of filtration and the area of the membrane 0 029 m2 it is observed that the volume of filtered water till breakthrough concentration 1 5 mg l is 1400 ml breakthrough time 24 h for a fresh mmm during initial 600 800 ml 9 10 hours of filtration of filtered volume the concentration of permeate almost remained the same due to rapid adsorption of fluoride by impregnated cbm in mmm however concentration increases after 900 ml of filtered volume due to saturation of active sites in cbm present within the prepared hollow fibers concentration of filtered water increases beyond allowable limit due to complete exhaustion of the active sites after the first run the membrane was desorbed using 0 1 n sodium hydroxide followed by washing at neutral ph and the second run was conducted it is observed that the volume of filtered water decreases to 1200 ml breakthrough time 19 h compared to the first run 1400 ml this happens due to incomplete desorption and permanent loss of active sites from the mmm during the first run volume of water obtained till breakthrough during filtration of real life groundwater is 1000 ml breakthrough time 18 h filtered volume is decreased compared to synthetic feed solution due to interference by dissolved solids and other coexisting ions complete characterization of feed and permeate stream in terms of ph dissolved solids different ions and bacterial concentration has been performed and shown in table 2 concentration of bacteria in feed is 2600 cfu 100 ml that becomes 0 cfu 100 ml after one hour of operation and remained invariant till breakthrough hence the prepared membrane has both defluoridating and antimicrobial properties 3 3 comparison of performance with different membranes comparison regarding the performance of conventional nf ro and other mmms reported in different studies with cbm psf mmm is presented in table 3 it has been observed that most of conventional membranes operate at comparatively higher pressure drop for example nf 90 has a cut off 90 da and it reduces fluoride concentration from 22 mg l to 0 2 mg l at 1000 kpa pressure drop 9 33 36 however the prepared hollow fiber mmm used in our study has 23 kda cut off and hence is more open pore and consumes less power compared to nf and ro membranes thus the prepared hollow fiber mmm can substitute the conventional membranes there are reports where different mmms were prepared for fluoride removal 12 15 20 however most of these studies have not shown any anti bacterial investigations also some studies have not shown performance of the membrane during dynamic operation 12 13 in one of our earlier study flat sheet cap activated alumina mmm 24 kda cut off reduced fluoride concentration from 4 mg l to 0 5 mg l in case of simulated tap water feed 20 in case of hollow fiber mmm operated at 34 kpa tmp the fluoride concentration in filtrate is 0 3 mg l when the groundwater has 3 2 mg l concentration in addition these membranes also disinfect water from bacterial contamination for example hollow fiber mmm can filter water having no residual bacteria in permeate 0 cfu 100 ml from a feed having 2600 cfu 100 ml of bacterial concentration 4 conclusions cbm impregnated uf grade hollow fiber mmm was used for removal of fluoride from groundwater maximum fluoride uptake capacity increased from 1 5 mg g for hollow fiber without cbm to 5 mg g for fibers incorporating 15 wt cbm presence of chloride ions in feed affected the fluoride removal capacity marginally however sulfate ions exhibited the maximum interference effect at 34 kpa transmembrane pressure drop and 10 l h cross flow rate maximum defluoridation capacity was observed breakthrough volume for synthetic feed 5 mg l was 1400 ml and that for contaminated groundwater 3 2 mg l was 1000 ml where the membrane area was 0 029 m2 hollow fibers were successfully regenerated by 0 1 m sodium hydroxide solution for two long runs bacterial cells were completely removed by the mmm from2600 cfu 100 ml to 0 cfu 100 ml for contaminated groundwater prepared mmm hollow fibers have
