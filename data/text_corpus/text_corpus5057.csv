25285,frugivores and fleshy fruited plants commonly engage in the mutually beneficial interaction by dispersing seeds while consuming fruit pulps such mutualistic interactions can have profound impacts on the persistence and distributions of plant populations based on pair approximation we here develop a process based mechanistic model that captures the dynamics of the mean and local densities of plants and the density of animals the model considers three components of frugivory the strength of frugivore plant mutualistic interaction the efficiency of seed dispersers and the germination probability of seeds results show that seed dispersal by animals is crucial to the extended persistence of plants by reducing the level of aggregation and thus local intraspecific competition importantly frugivory can only be beneficial to the plants if the animal is an efficient seed disperser with limited risks costs of dispersal plus adequate number of encounters otherwise frugivory could become a main driver of plant extinction from seed predation by the animals in conclusion frugivorous seed dispersal could allow persistence of plants in habitats that otherwise require much higher levels of fecundity and dispersal rate to survive such extended persistence highlights the threshold phenomenon in plant conservation extended persistence in environments that are difficult to restore once the plants have collapsed keywords seed dispersal plant frugivore mutualistic interaction pair approximation bistability bifurcation analysis regime shifts 1 introduction seed dispersal is the movement of seeds away from the parental plants which plays a crucial role in regulating the distribution of seeds seedlings and adult plants nathan and muller landau 2000 beckman et al 2012 and is therefore crucial to plant demography and diversity howe 1984 herrera 1989 2002 stoner and henry 2009 traveset et al 2013 seeds that are dispersed by vectors such as animals are often encapsulated in fleshy fruits to lure animal dispersers herrera et al 2002 perez mendez et al 2015 and the interaction between fleshy fruited plants and animals is of mutualistic kind benefiting both partners herrera et al 2002 schleuning et al 2011 in fact through frugivorous seed dispersal plants can drastically reduce intraspecific competition for resources inbreeding pressure and density dependent seed mortality near parental plants howe and smallwood 1982 herrera et al 2002 while frugivores obviously gain nutrients from consuming fruit pulps the number quality and size of fruits are such to entice more visitors and maximize visiting frequencies evidence supports increased visits and thus dispersed seeds when more fruits are available howe and estabrook 1977 schleuning et al 2011 however the number of consumed fruits per visit depends on the body mass of the frugivore jordano 2000 thus plant frugivore interactions strongly rely on size matching donoso et al 2017 large fruits are usually eaten by mammals whereas smaller fruits by birds due to limits to gape size as a result fruit size is strongly related with the mobility of their animal consumers jordano et al 2007 efficient seed dispersers can disperse large number of seeds to a suitable and less competitive environment where seeds can germinate with relatively low risks mokotjomela et al 2016 besides the usual risks associated with the fate of a dispersed seed e g local density of adult plants and landing in unsuitable habitats caughlin et al 2015 howe 1984 beckman and rogers 2013 animal dispersed seeds also face additional risks for obvious reasons janzen 1970 jordano 2000 seeds can be damaged during handling ingestion and digestion janzen 1971 herrera et al 2002 howe and estabrook 1977 howe 1984 consequently only a small fraction of eaten seeds can be dispersed and deposited into suitable habitats for germination and establishment nathan and muller landau 2000 heleno et al 2011 effective frugivorous seed dispersal thus requires a fine balance between benefits and risks to ensure the viability of plant populations in tropical regions approximately 90 of fleshy fruiting plant species almost entirely depend on frugivores vertebrates for seed dispersal chama et al 2013 whereas frugivorous vertebrates rely on fleshy fruited plants as source of additional nutrients howe 1984 often spending a significant portion of time handling fruits schleuning et al 2011 thus the relationship between plants and their seed dispersers is relatively strong jordano 2000 herrera et al 2002 alcantara and rey 2003 perez mendez et al 2015 for this reason the loss of frugivores from often illegal hunting in tropical regions could boost up the extinction risk of plants caughlin et al 2015 on the other hand frugivorous seed dispersal has also been considered an important tool for ecosystem restoration and conservation planning ribeiro da silva et al 2015 and thus its role in proliferating the persistence and distributions of plants warrants investigations most process based models of seed dispersal only consider seed dispersal by wind e g levin and muller landau 2000 schurr et al 2005 nathan et al 2002 2011 the influence of seed dispersal by animals on the dynamics and spatial structure of plant populations remains elusive côrtes and uriarte 2013 recent works on frugivorous seed dispersal are largely based on simulations and data analyses from multivariate statistics soons and bullock 2008 schleuning et al 2011 chama et al 2013 calvino cancela 2004 caughlin et al 2015 mokotjomela et al 2016 with most ignoring the spatial structure of plants and consequently often leading to incorrect conclusions harada and iwasa 1994 here we propose a process based mechanistic and deterministic model of frugivorous seed dispersal in addition to classic approaches mainly focusing on average density we also consider the local densities of plants harada and iwasa 1994 this allows a better description of the plant frugivore interaction morales et al 2013 and to explore its effects not only on plant density but also its spatial structure beckman and rogers 2013 caughlin et al 2015 to make the model realistic we further consider three essential components of frugivorous seed dispersal including the strength of the frugivore plant mutualistic interaction schleuning et al 2011 the efficiency of the seed disperser schupp 1993 mokotjomela et al 2016 as well as the germination probability of seeds chama et al 2013 calviño cancela 2004 specifically the interaction strength in our model is determined by species abundance fruit production rate and animal attack rate finally the model considers the benefit to animals from the interaction with plants contributing to an increased animal density due to extra food resources using this simple model we are able to systematically investigate how all different factors influencing animal mediated seed dispersal including fruit production rate plant local dispersal ability frugivore dispersal efficiency and frugivore attack rate alone or in combinations can affect the spatial and temporal dynamics of plants we further discuss possible implications to predicting plant extinction for better conservation as well as suggest possible intervention measures on the frugivore population and or on the plant frugivore interactions to allow plant persistence or restoration this paper provides the first endeavour of modelling plant frugivore mutualistic interaction using more accurate methodology of pair approximation that allows the formulation of spatial structures the model highlights the significant contribution of frugivores to often extended plant population viability however only efficient frugivorous species can support such conditional persistence of plants in environments that would otherwise require high fecundity and natural dispersal ability to sustain using this model early intervention strategies for preventing plant extinction can be set up once the dispersal efficiency of frugivores is measured this model can provide new insights for forest managers on the time to introduce new frugivore individuals for conserving or restoring plant populations especially for those with low fecundity and natural dispersal ability 2 model and method 2 1 pair approximation model of plant dynamics first we briefly recall the methodology of pair approximation used to build our model pair approximation is a method for constructing a system of ordinary differential equations for both global and local densities of a given population it assumes that the dynamics of focal individuals are affected by its direct neighbours local density and propagules from all the population global density matsuda et al 1992 harada and iwasa 1994 pair approximation method neglects the effect of secondary or even higher order neighbouring individuals e g the neighbour of a neighbour on the dynamics of the population the simplicity of pair approximation allows us to formulate spatial dynamics in an analytic fashion e g hui and li 2004 hui and richardson 2017 in contrast to pair approximation method the typical mean field approximation only considers the global density dynamics and neglects the effect of all local interactions between neighbours therefore pair approximation provides more accurate spatially structured predictions of the population dynamics than the mean field approximation at the cost of an extra variable the local density being included in describing the system dynamics in particular if the local density is greater than the global density plants are clustered in space equal local and global densities define the spatially random structure lower local density than the global density indicates segregated distributions of plants in the landscape hui et al 2006 more details about pair approximation method is found in matsuda et al 1992 and harada and iwasa 1994 we first consider an infinitely large and regular lattice model for plant population dynamics without animal mediated seed dispersal each lattice site is either occupied site by an individual plant or empty 0 site it is assumed that the size of a lattice cell can only allow one individual plant to establish that is each site can only be occupied by a single individual plant at a time see fig 1 for a schematic representation seeds produced by a focal plant in a site can only grow in the nearest neighbouring sites if they are empty fig 1 let p denote the probability called the global density that a randomly chosen lattice site is occupied by an individual plant and let p 0 1 p denote the probability that a randomly chosen lattice site is empty since birth of a new individual plant is restricted by the availability of a vacant nearest neighbouring site we consider q 0 to be the conditional probability that the nearest neighbouring site of a given occupied site is an empty site where a seed can germinate and become a new plant by definition q 1 q 0 where q is the conditional probability that the nearest neighbouring site of a given occupied site is also an occupied site that is the local density of the plants the local density q when compared with the global density describes the spatial structure of the plant population pair approximation allows an explicit description of the dynamics of both the global density p and the local density q in terms of ordinary differential equations since birth of a new plant can only take place if a seed is landed in an empty site in the neighbourhood of a focal plant the plant population growth is governed by the following equation 1 p d p b q 0 p d p b 1 q p where b and d are the birth and natural death rates of plants respectively in eq 1 the first term refers to the natural death of plants while the second term refers to the establishment of a new plant in an empty site from locally dispersed seeds of a neighbouring adult plant by definition q p p and time derivation gives q p p p 2 p p where p is the probability that two randomly chosen neighbouring sites a pair are both occupied to define the local density dynamics q the pair dynamics p needs to be specified this is given by p 2 d p 2 b z p 0 2 b z z 1 q 0 p 0 where parameter z represents the number of the nearest neighbouring sites of a focal plant and measures the local dispersal ability of plants to their neighbouring sites the first term indicates the transition of a pair to either a 0 or a 0 pair thus the factor 2 in the equation in the second term an occupied site contributes by a birth of an individual to its nearest neighbouring empty site p 0 p 0 q 0 p 1 q p in the third term one empty site may have two neighbouring occupied sites from left and right therefore this will affect the probability of transition from one occupied site to an empty site thus the multiplication by q 0 this would require the computation of higher order densities and would not allow to obtain a closed system of differential equations therefore pair approximation ignores the effect of the neighbour of the neighbour it assumes correlation is weaker with non direct neighbours i e correlation between sites decreases exponentially with the distance between them see e g harada and iwasa 1994 and approximates q 0 q 0 p 0 p 0 i e correlations with non nearest neighbours are approximately reconstructed from nearest neighbour correlations the dynamics of the local density of plants can thus be described as a function of only the global density p and the local density q 2 q q d b 1 q 2 b z 1 z 1 1 q p 1 p 1 q more details about the derivation of these equations can be found in appendix a in supplementary material see also matsuda et al 1992 and harada and iwasa 1994 2 2 plant frugivore interaction model we now extend the above pair approximation model to further describe the plant frugivore mutualistic interaction through seed dispersal plants provide frugivorous animals with extra food resources while frugivores disperse seeds away from the parent plants decreasing local intraspecific competition successful frugivore mediated seed dispersal can contribute to the plant long term fitness and preserve plant populations from extinction to model the plant frugivore mutualistic interaction we first divide the seeds produced by a focal plant into two groups eaten and non eaten seeds the non eaten seeds will grow locally if they fall in empty local sites in the neighbourhood of their parental plants while the eaten seeds will be dispersed by frugivores globally in the whole lattice eaten seeds experience some risk during dispersal thus we consider the frugivore dispersal efficiency for which only a fraction of eaten seeds will be dispersed globally in the lattice successfully dispersed seeds can only germinate if they fall in empty local sites in the neighbourhood of their parental plants furthermore we consider the strength of plant frugivore interaction which is characterized by the frugivore attack rate in the model however the interaction strength between plants and frugivores is also influenced by the availability of fruits and species abundances lastly we consider the germination probability of the dispersed seeds either locally by their parental plants or globally by animals plants produce seeds at rate m and frugivorous animals consume the encountered seeds in fruit pulps with probability a we assume that the animals have both a random spatial distribution and a random foraging behaviour meaning that the number of seeds eaten by animals in a time interval follows a poisson distribution with mean λ a a m p where a is the animal density see table 1 for a description of all variables and parameters of the model the fraction of seeds that are not eaten in the unit of time is thus given by e λ while the fraction of seeds that are eaten is 1 e λ the proportion of non eaten seeds will grow locally in the neighbourhood of plants if they fall in empty sites fig 1 the eaten seeds pass through the digestive system of frugivores and experience some risks so the proportion of seeds that is being dispersed and that can grow in the whole lattices if encountering an empty site is μ 1 e λ where μ is the dispersal efficiency of frugivores conversely 1 μ measures the dispersal cost of course only a fraction of seeds either dispersed locally in the neighbourhood of parent plants or globally by frugivores will germinate with probability g the entire process from plant frugivore interaction to germination of dispersed seeds is represented in fig 2 the global density dynamics of plants in the whole lattices is governed by 3 p d p g m e a a m p 1 q p g m μ 1 e a a m p p 1 p where d is the natural death rate of plants and g m the intrinsic birth rate of new plants germination rate fecundity the second term in eq 3 refers to the local birth of the non eaten seeds in the neighbourhood of the parent plants while the third term refers to the global birth of the successfully animal dispersed seeds we assume that animals are generalists and they have food resources other than the plants therefore in the absence of plants they can grow according to the logistic equation considering plant frugivore mutualistic interaction the pulp of the eaten fruits will be converted into new biomass of frugivores with conversion rate α thus the governing equation of frugivore dynamics is given by 4 a r a a 1 a k a α 1 e a a m p m p r a a k a a β p k a where a r a and k a are the density intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of frugivores respectively and β k a r a a α 1 e a a m p m represents the effect of plants on frugivores growth the first term in eq 4 refers to the logistic growth of generalist animals due to other resources while the last term indicates the positive contribution of plants to the frugivore biomass alternatively animals can be assumed to be specialists i e an obligatory mutualist that completely depends on plant fruit pulps for food donoso et al 2017 in such case the first term in eq 4 can be replaced by d a a where d a is the natural death rate of animals because the two sets of results are similar we only present the generalist case in the main text see supplementary material for the specialist case in order to obtain the full system that governs the plant frugivore mutualistic interaction eqs 3 and 4 must be accompanied by an equation of the local density q which is given by 5 q d q g e a a m p m 1 q 2 z q g μ 1 e a a m p m 2 p p q q 2 g z z 1 e a a m p 1 q 2 p 1 p the derivation of eq 5 can be found in the appendix a in supplementary material now we have a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential eqs 3 5 governing the ecological dynamics of the plant frugivore mutualistic interaction next we analyse our model numerically and investigate the dynamics of a plant population with and without frugivore mediated seed dispersal starting from different initial density conditions and for different seed production rates we then focus on plant density equilibria and study the effects of plant fecundity quantified by the seed production rate m and intrinsic local dispersal ability of plants quantified by the number of neighbouring sites z on the two ecological scenarios with and without animal dispersers we then study the effects of the frugivore attack rate a and dispersal efficiency μ on plant density equilibria we finally conclude by investigating the effects of all combinations of parameter pairs on plant population densities sensitivity analyses are reported in the supplementary material the model was numerically solved using the standard ode45 matlab integrator 3 results trajectories in fig 3 show that plants cannot persist if the seed production rate is low regardless the facilitation of seed dispersal from animals the scenario of extinction fig 3a and b however when the seed production rate becomes higher fig 3c and d efficient frugivores can prevent plants from extinction extending the ecological scenario from extinction to conditional persistence where the basins of attraction of the two alternative stable states are separated by the stable manifold of the saddle half filled dot in fig 3d with the realised regime depending on the initial conditions of the system with an even higher seed production rate fig 3e and f frugivores can increase the global density but reduce the local density of plants scattering plants randomly in the landscape i e an equilibrium located on the diagonal of the p q space therefore frugivores can change both the abundance and spatial structure of plants it also suggests that frugivores can reduce intraspecific competition between plants by dispersing seeds away from more clustered areas fig 3e and f with plant persistence the only regime scenario in the system with a high seed production rate if the global density of plants is very high the local density of plants is also expected to be high and thus the area below the curve 2 1 p q is mathematically unfeasible hui and li 2004 hui et al 2006 in fig 4 a without animal mediated seed dispersal we have the two scenarios of extinction and unconditional persistence describing the same scenarios in fig 3a and c extinction and e persistence here plants can only persist if the seed production rate exceeds the threshold of the branch point bp transcritical bifurcation when the branches of extinction equilibrium and persistence equilibrium intersect and exchange their stability in contrast with frugivorous seed dispersal plants can conditionally persist even before the seed production rate reaches the threshold specifically between the limit point lp saddle node or fold and the branch point bp bifurcations fig 4b therefore frugivores allow the plants to conditionally persist even in poor habitat quality represented by seed production rates provided that the initial plant densities are sufficient to above the threshold during conditional persistence fig 4b the equilibrium of local density of plants is higher than the equilibrium of global density meaning that the plants are still clustered in space after the branch point bp bifurcation the equilibria of local and global densities become equal implying that the clustered distribution of plants has been overridden by the random movements of animals without frugivores plants will go extinct if their intrinsic local dispersal ability is below a threshold i e when the number of the nearest neighbouring sites z is small fig 4c in contrast seed dispersal by frugivores can allow conditional persistence of plants even when the dispersal ability of plants is below such a threshold fig 4d when the plant local dispersal ability is relatively high plants can access more neighbouring sites and thus have a higher chance to encounter an empty site for successful local dispersal this explains why in fig 4d the equilibrium of q is higher than the equilibrium of p for high values of z high dispersal efficiency of frugivores μ or low cost of animal dispersal can prevent plants from extinction while inefficient seed dispersers can suppress plants to extinction through a sudden collapse when the dispersal efficiency declines to below a threshold so to trigger the limit point lp bifurcation fig 5 a the lp separates the extinction and conditional persistence regions plants can also become extinct if the strength of plant frugivore interaction i e the attack rate a is low fig 5b when in the conditional persistence region plants are spatially clustered when either the dispersal efficiency or the attack rate is low fig 5a and b while when dispersal efficiency μ and strength of plant frugivore interaction a are increased the equilibrium of p and q have the same value and plants are thus distributed randomly fig 6 shows the effects of parameter pairs on the three different ecological scenarios i e extinction conditional persistence and persistence in all panels plants become extinct if values of parameters lie below the limit point bifurcation curve conditionally persist if they lie between the limit point and branch point bifurcation curves and unconditionally persist if they lie above the branch point bifurcation curve fig 6a shows that if the seed production rate m fecundity is low then plants will go extinct even if the number of neighbouring sites z local dispersal ability is high conversely plants always have the chance to persist even if their intrinsic dispersal ability is low provided that their fecundity is sufficiently high this is due to animal dispersal that creates the scenario of conditional persistence when plant local dispersal ability is limited for this reason the efficiency and attack rate of frugivorous animals are both crucial to the persistence of plant species fig 6b indeed high frugivore efficiency alone does not prevent plants from extinction if the frugivore attack rate a is low and vice versa the limit point bifurcation curve in fig 6b can be crossed horizontally from left to right or vertically from bottom to top so that plant dynamics can be shifted from the extinction scenario to the conditional persistence scenario by increasing either or both the dispersal efficiency or the attack rate however fig 6c to f show that inefficient animals also having low attack rates cannot prevent plants from extinction if either the plant seed production rate m or the plant local dispersal ability z is smaller than the branch point threshold however efficient and aggressive high attack rate animals can provide plants the chance to escape extinction via dispersal conditional persistence even if the plant by itself cannot sustain its own population in other words although the presence of frugivores cannot influence the branch point bifurcation curve that makes extinction unstable thus providing stable unconditional persistence it nonetheless creates the possibility for the plants to conditionally persist in environments where plants alone would go extinct 4 discussion by proposing a novel pair approximation model for the plant animal mutualistic interaction our theoretical findings complement empirical studies confirming the importance of plant frugivore interactions for successful plant recruitment forest restoration and the provision of ecosystem functioning e g da silva et al 2015 archer and pyke 1991 caughlin et al 2015 in particular we argue that our results could be more significant in tropical regions where most plants rely on frugivores to disperse their seeds howe 1984 schleuning et al 2011 chama et al 2013 however for a plant frugivore interaction to be fully beneficial to the plant the frugivore must necessarily be an efficient seed disperser with low risks associated with dispersal fig 5a and sufficient fruit consumption fig 5b otherwise frugivorous animals might act as a main driver of plant extinction by behaving as seed predators fig 6b janzen 1970 1971 jordano 2000 in addition seed dispersal by animals also changes the spatial distribution of plants fig 3 also see nathan and muller landau 2000 beckman et al 2012 indeed plant frugivore interaction can facilitate plants to shift their niches due to climate change archer and pyke 1991 furthermore jordano 2000 argued that fruits are extremely aggregated in space relative to other food resources with high local abundance such a high level of clustering has been shown in our results to become mitigated in the presence of frugivores fig 3e such changes in plant spatial distribution could then affect the reproduction and recruitment of plants beckman and rogers 2013 with seed dispersal plant spatial distribution can also be imprinted by the spatial distribution of their dispersal agents nathan and muller landau 2000 thus because of the random distribution of frugivores and their foraging behaviour assumed here dispersed seeds also tend to become randomly distributed in space figs 3f and figure 4b introduction of seed dispersal agents allows the plant dynamics to display the scenario of conditional persistence efficient frugivores can maintain plants at an alternative regime of high density other than extinction fig 3d hence with respect to the conservation of an ecosystem with endangered plant populations the introduction or augmentation of populations of animal seed dispersers would be an efficient strategy for the plant to escape extinction in this regard our study confirms previous suggestions on conservation policy that aims to restore animal dispersed tree species in tropical forests brodie and aslan 2012 or to conserve the process of seed dispersal itself in temperate ecosystems by first increasing the abundance of frugivorous birds garcia et al 2010 notice however that the presence of animal seed dispersal turns the extinction persistence transition from smooth and gradual to abrupt and catastrophic for instance without frugivores the decrease in habitat quality would smoothly bring plants to low densities and gradual extinction fig 4a b but the abrupt collapse of the plant population from higher density would happen with frugivores such a catastrophic transition is difficult to reverse due to hysteresis in the system implying that the habitat quality to be restored greatly exceeds the one that caused the sudden collapse thus early warning signals should be monitored in the presence of animal dispersers to avoid such unwanted regime shift scheffer et al 2009 drake and griffen 2010 kéfi et al 2014 an easily detectable and measurable early warning signal suggested by our analysis is the plant spatial clustering i e the mismatch between the local and the global density of plants see fig 4b d and figure 5 the hysteresis in such systems can also be used for the control and eradication of alien invasive plants in such cases the removal of animal seed dispersers figs 3 and 4 the decrease of plant fertility and vegetative local dispersal fig 4 and 6 or the inhibition of plant animal interaction and animal dispersal efficiency fig 5 and 6 could all serve to achieve successful eradication despite the importance of animal seed dispersers plant persistence is firstly determined by the quality and availability of habitat variation and fragmentation of habitat can influence plant fecundity and consequently plant dynamics density and persistence beckman and rogers 2013 brudvig et al 2015 however not only can habitat quality affect the plant fecundity but also can influence plant frugivore interactions brudvig et al 2015 high habitat quality increases the probability of seed recruitment beckman and rogers 2013 and allows plant persistence fig 3e fig 6c and d conversely low habitat quality drives plants to extinction even if their seeds are dispersed by efficient frugivores fig 3a and b fig 6a the possibility of habitat heterogeneity local versus global habitat quality could further complicate the spatial and dynamical regimes of plants additionally the architecture and coevolution of plant animal interactions in a community affects species persistence abundances and distributions bascompte and jordano et al 2007 minoarivelo and hui 2016a b these extensions are left for future research taken together frugivore mediated seed dispersal can influence plant persistence abundance and spatial distribution it allows conditional persistence of plants

interactions to allow plant persistence or restoration this paper provides the first endeavour of modelling plant frugivore mutualistic interaction using more accurate methodology of pair approximation that allows the formulation of spatial structures the model highlights the significant contribution of frugivores to often extended plant population viability however only efficient frugivorous species can support such conditional persistence of plants in environments that would otherwise require high fecundity and natural dispersal ability to sustain using this model early intervention strategies for preventing plant extinction can be set up once the dispersal efficiency of frugivores is measured this model can provide new insights for forest managers on the time to introduce new frugivore individuals for conserving or restoring plant populations especially for those with low fecundity and natural dispersal ability 2 model and method 2 1 pair approximation model of plant dynamics first we briefly recall the methodology of pair approximation used to build our model pair approximation is a method for constructing a system of ordinary differential equations for both global and local densities of a given population it assumes that the dynamics of focal individuals are affected by its direct neighbours local density and propagules from all the population global density matsuda et al 1992 harada and iwasa 1994 pair approximation method neglects the effect of secondary or even higher order neighbouring individuals e g the neighbour of a neighbour on the dynamics of the population the simplicity of pair approximation allows us to formulate spatial dynamics in an analytic fashion e g hui and li 2004 hui and richardson 2017 in contrast to pair approximation method the typical mean field approximation only considers the global density dynamics and neglects the effect of all local interactions between neighbours therefore pair approximation provides more accurate spatially structured predictions of the population dynamics than the mean field approximation at the cost of an extra variable the local density being included in describing the system dynamics in particular if the local density is greater than the global density plants are clustered in space equal local and global densities define the spatially random structure lower local density than the global density indicates segregated distributions of plants in the landscape hui et al 2006 more details about pair approximation method is found in matsuda et al 1992 and harada and iwasa 1994 we first consider an infinitely large and regular lattice model for plant population dynamics without animal mediated seed dispersal each lattice site is either occupied site by an individual plant or empty 0 site it is assumed that the size of a lattice cell can only allow one individual plant to establish that is each site can only be occupied by a single individual plant at a time see fig 1 for a schematic representation seeds produced by a focal plant in a site can only grow in the nearest neighbouring sites if they are empty fig 1 let p denote the probability called the global density that a randomly chosen lattice site is occupied by an individual plant and let p 0 1 p denote the probability that a randomly chosen lattice site is empty since birth of a new individual plant is restricted by the availability of a vacant nearest neighbouring site we consider q 0 to be the conditional probability that the nearest neighbouring site of a given occupied site is an empty site where a seed can germinate and become a new plant by definition q 1 q 0 where q is the conditional probability that the nearest neighbouring site of a given occupied site is also an occupied site that is the local density of the plants the local density q when compared with the global density describes the spatial structure of the plant population pair approximation allows an explicit description of the dynamics of both the global density p and the local density q in terms of ordinary differential equations since birth of a new plant can only take place if a seed is landed in an empty site in the neighbourhood of a focal plant the plant population growth is governed by the following equation 1 p d p b q 0 p d p b 1 q p where b and d are the birth and natural death rates of plants respectively in eq 1 the first term refers to the natural death of plants while the second term refers to the establishment of a new plant in an empty site from locally dispersed seeds of a neighbouring adult plant by definition q p p and time derivation gives q p p p 2 p p where p is the probability that two randomly chosen neighbouring sites a pair are both occupied to define the local density dynamics q the pair dynamics p needs to be specified this is given by p 2 d p 2 b z p 0 2 b z z 1 q 0 p 0 where parameter z represents the number of the nearest neighbouring sites of a focal plant and measures the local dispersal ability of plants to their neighbouring sites the first term indicates the transition of a pair to either a 0 or a 0 pair thus the factor 2 in the equation in the second term an occupied site contributes by a birth of an individual to its nearest neighbouring empty site p 0 p 0 q 0 p 1 q p in the third term one empty site may have two neighbouring occupied sites from left and right therefore this will affect the probability of transition from one occupied site to an empty site thus the multiplication by q 0 this would require the computation of higher order densities and would not allow to obtain a closed system of differential equations therefore pair approximation ignores the effect of the neighbour of the neighbour it assumes correlation is weaker with non direct neighbours i e correlation between sites decreases exponentially with the distance between them see e g harada and iwasa 1994 and approximates q 0 q 0 p 0 p 0 i e correlations with non nearest neighbours are approximately reconstructed from nearest neighbour correlations the dynamics of the local density of plants can thus be described as a function of only the global density p and the local density q 2 q q d b 1 q 2 b z 1 z 1 1 q p 1 p 1 q more details about the derivation of these equations can be found in appendix a in supplementary material see also matsuda et al 1992 and harada and iwasa 1994 2 2 plant frugivore interaction model we now extend the above pair approximation model to further describe the plant frugivore mutualistic interaction through seed dispersal plants provide frugivorous animals with extra food resources while frugivores disperse seeds away from the parent plants decreasing local intraspecific competition successful frugivore mediated seed dispersal can contribute to the plant long term fitness and preserve plant populations from extinction to model the plant frugivore mutualistic interaction we first divide the seeds produced by a focal plant into two groups eaten and non eaten seeds the non eaten seeds will grow locally if they fall in empty local sites in the neighbourhood of their parental plants while the eaten seeds will be dispersed by frugivores globally in the whole lattice eaten seeds experience some risk during dispersal thus we consider the frugivore dispersal efficiency for which only a fraction of eaten seeds will be dispersed globally in the lattice successfully dispersed seeds can only germinate if they fall in empty local sites in the neighbourhood of their parental plants furthermore we consider the strength of plant frugivore interaction which is characterized by the frugivore attack rate in the model however the interaction strength between plants and frugivores is also influenced by the availability of fruits and species abundances lastly we consider the germination probability of the dispersed seeds either locally by their parental plants or globally by animals plants produce seeds at rate m and frugivorous animals consume the encountered seeds in fruit pulps with probability a we assume that the animals have both a random spatial distribution and a random foraging behaviour meaning that the number of seeds eaten by animals in a time interval follows a poisson distribution with mean λ a a m p where a is the animal density see table 1 for a description of all variables and parameters of the model the fraction of seeds that are not eaten in the unit of time is thus given by e λ while the fraction of seeds that are eaten is 1 e λ the proportion of non eaten seeds will grow locally in the neighbourhood of plants if they fall in empty sites fig 1 the eaten seeds pass through the digestive system of frugivores and experience some risks so the proportion of seeds that is being dispersed and that can grow in the whole lattices if encountering an empty site is μ 1 e λ where μ is the dispersal efficiency of frugivores conversely 1 μ measures the dispersal cost of course only a fraction of seeds either dispersed locally in the neighbourhood of parent plants or globally by frugivores will germinate with probability g the entire process from plant frugivore interaction to germination of dispersed seeds is represented in fig 2 the global density dynamics of plants in the whole lattices is governed by 3 p d p g m e a a m p 1 q p g m μ 1 e a a m p p 1 p where d is the natural death rate of plants and g m the intrinsic birth rate of new plants germination rate fecundity the second term in eq 3 refers to the local birth of the non eaten seeds in the neighbourhood of the parent plants while the third term refers to the global birth of the successfully animal dispersed seeds we assume that animals are generalists and they have food resources other than the plants therefore in the absence of plants they can grow according to the logistic equation considering plant frugivore mutualistic interaction the pulp of the eaten fruits will be converted into new biomass of frugivores with conversion rate α thus the governing equation of frugivore dynamics is given by 4 a r a a 1 a k a α 1 e a a m p m p r a a k a a β p k a where a r a and k a are the density intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of frugivores respectively and β k a r a a α 1 e a a m p m represents the effect of plants on frugivores growth the first term in eq 4 refers to the logistic growth of generalist animals due to other resources while the last term indicates the positive contribution of plants to the frugivore biomass alternatively animals can be assumed to be specialists i e an obligatory mutualist that completely depends on plant fruit pulps for food donoso et al 2017 in such case the first term in eq 4 can be replaced by d a a where d a is the natural death rate of animals because the two sets of results are similar we only present the generalist case in the main text see supplementary material for the specialist case in order to obtain the full system that governs the plant frugivore mutualistic interaction eqs 3 and 4 must be accompanied by an equation of the local density q which is given by 5 q d q g e a a m p m 1 q 2 z q g μ 1 e a a m p m 2 p p q q 2 g z z 1 e a a m p 1 q 2 p 1 p the derivation of eq 5 can be found in the appendix a in supplementary material now we have a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential eqs 3 5 governing the ecological dynamics of the plant frugivore mutualistic interaction next we analyse our model numerically and investigate the dynamics of a plant population with and without frugivore mediated seed dispersal starting from different initial density conditions and for different seed production rates we then focus on plant density equilibria and study the effects of plant fecundity quantified by the seed production rate m and intrinsic local dispersal ability of plants quantified by the number of neighbouring sites z on the two ecological scenarios with and without animal dispersers we then study the effects of the frugivore attack rate a and dispersal efficiency μ on plant density equilibria we finally conclude by investigating the effects of all combinations of parameter pairs on plant population densities sensitivity analyses are reported in the supplementary material the model was numerically solved using the standard ode45 matlab integrator 3 results trajectories in fig 3 show that plants cannot persist if the seed production rate is low regardless the facilitation of seed dispersal from animals the scenario of extinction fig 3a and b however when the seed production rate becomes higher fig 3c and d efficient frugivores can prevent plants from extinction extending the ecological scenario from extinction to conditional persistence where the basins of attraction of the two alternative stable states are separated by the stable manifold of the saddle half filled dot in fig 3d with the realised regime depending on the initial conditions of the system with an even higher seed production rate fig 3e and f frugivores can increase the global density but reduce the local density of plants scattering plants randomly in the landscape i e an equilibrium located on the diagonal of the p q space therefore frugivores can change both the abundance and spatial structure of plants it also suggests that frugivores can reduce intraspecific competition between plants by dispersing seeds away from more clustered areas fig 3e and f with plant persistence the only regime scenario in the system with a high seed production rate if the global density of plants is very high the local density of plants is also expected to be high and thus the area below the curve 2 1 p q is mathematically unfeasible hui and li 2004 hui et al 2006 in fig 4 a without animal mediated seed dispersal we have the two scenarios of extinction and unconditional persistence describing the same scenarios in fig 3a and c extinction and e persistence here plants can only persist if the seed production rate exceeds the threshold of the branch point bp transcritical bifurcation when the branches of extinction equilibrium and persistence equilibrium intersect and exchange their stability in contrast with frugivorous seed dispersal plants can conditionally persist even before the seed production rate reaches the threshold specifically between the limit point lp saddle node or fold and the branch point bp bifurcations fig 4b therefore frugivores allow the plants to conditionally persist even in poor habitat quality represented by seed production rates provided that the initial plant densities are sufficient to above the threshold during conditional persistence fig 4b the equilibrium of local density of plants is higher than the equilibrium of global density meaning that the plants are still clustered in space after the branch point bp bifurcation the equilibria of local and global densities become equal implying that the clustered distribution of plants has been overridden by the random movements of animals without frugivores plants will go extinct if their intrinsic local dispersal ability is below a threshold i e when the number of the nearest neighbouring sites z is small fig 4c in contrast seed dispersal by frugivores can allow conditional persistence of plants even when the dispersal ability of plants is below such a threshold fig 4d when the plant local dispersal ability is relatively high plants can access more neighbouring sites and thus have a higher chance to encounter an empty site for successful local dispersal this explains why in fig 4d the equilibrium of q is higher than the equilibrium of p for high values of z high dispersal efficiency of frugivores μ or low cost of animal dispersal can prevent plants from extinction while inefficient seed dispersers can suppress plants to extinction through a sudden collapse when the dispersal efficiency declines to below a threshold so to trigger the limit point lp bifurcation fig 5 a the lp separates the extinction and conditional persistence regions plants can also become extinct if the strength of plant frugivore interaction i e the attack rate a is low fig 5b when in the conditional persistence region plants are spatially clustered when either the dispersal efficiency or the attack rate is low fig 5a and b while when dispersal efficiency μ and strength of plant frugivore interaction a are increased the equilibrium of p and q have the same value and plants are thus distributed randomly fig 6 shows the effects of parameter pairs on the three different ecological scenarios i e extinction conditional persistence and persistence in all panels plants become extinct if values of parameters lie below the limit point bifurcation curve conditionally persist if they lie between the limit point and branch point bifurcation curves and unconditionally persist if they lie above the branch point bifurcation curve fig 6a shows that if the seed production rate m fecundity is low then plants will go extinct even if the number of neighbouring sites z local dispersal ability is high conversely plants always have the chance to persist even if their intrinsic dispersal ability is low provided that their fecundity is sufficiently high this is due to animal dispersal that creates the scenario of conditional persistence when plant local dispersal ability is limited for this reason the efficiency and attack rate of frugivorous animals are both crucial to the persistence of plant species fig 6b indeed high frugivore efficiency alone does not prevent plants from extinction if the frugivore attack rate a is low and vice versa the limit point bifurcation curve in fig 6b can be crossed horizontally from left to right or vertically from bottom to top so that plant dynamics can be shifted from the extinction scenario to the conditional persistence scenario by increasing either or both the dispersal efficiency or the attack rate however fig 6c to f show that inefficient animals also having low attack rates cannot prevent plants from extinction if either the plant seed production rate m or the plant local dispersal ability z is smaller than the branch point threshold however efficient and aggressive high attack rate animals can provide plants the chance to escape extinction via dispersal conditional persistence even if the plant by itself cannot sustain its own population in other words although the presence of frugivores cannot influence the branch point bifurcation curve that makes extinction unstable thus providing stable unconditional persistence it nonetheless creates the possibility for the plants to conditionally persist in environments where plants alone would go extinct 4 discussion by proposing a novel pair approximation model for the plant animal mutualistic interaction our theoretical findings complement empirical studies confirming the importance of plant frugivore interactions for successful plant recruitment forest restoration and the provision of ecosystem functioning e g da silva et al 2015 archer and pyke 1991 caughlin et al 2015 in particular we argue that our results could be more significant in tropical regions where most plants rely on frugivores to disperse their seeds howe 1984 schleuning et al 2011 chama et al 2013 however for a plant frugivore interaction to be fully beneficial to the plant the frugivore must necessarily be an efficient seed disperser with low risks associated with dispersal fig 5a and sufficient fruit consumption fig 5b otherwise frugivorous animals might act as a main driver of plant extinction by behaving as seed predators fig 6b janzen 1970 1971 jordano 2000 in addition seed dispersal by animals also changes the spatial distribution of plants fig 3 also see nathan and muller landau 2000 beckman et al 2012 indeed plant frugivore interaction can facilitate plants to shift their niches due to climate change archer and pyke 1991 furthermore jordano 2000 argued that fruits are extremely aggregated in space relative to other food resources with high local abundance such a high level of clustering has been shown in our results to become mitigated in the presence of frugivores fig 3e such changes in plant spatial distribution could then affect the reproduction and recruitment of plants beckman and rogers 2013 with seed dispersal plant spatial distribution can also be imprinted by the spatial distribution of their dispersal agents nathan and muller landau 2000 thus because of the random distribution of frugivores and their foraging behaviour assumed here dispersed seeds also tend to become randomly distributed in space figs 3f and figure 4b introduction of seed dispersal agents allows the plant dynamics to display the scenario of conditional persistence efficient frugivores can maintain plants at an alternative regime of high density other than extinction fig 3d hence with respect to the conservation of an ecosystem with endangered plant populations the introduction or augmentation of populations of animal seed dispersers would be an efficient strategy for the plant to escape extinction in this regard our study confirms previous suggestions on conservation policy that aims to restore animal dispersed tree species in tropical forests brodie and aslan 2012 or to conserve the process of seed dispersal itself in temperate ecosystems by first increasing the abundance of frugivorous birds garcia et al 2010 notice however that the presence of animal seed dispersal turns the extinction persistence transition from smooth and gradual to abrupt and catastrophic for instance without frugivores the decrease in habitat quality would smoothly bring plants to low densities and gradual extinction fig 4a b but the abrupt collapse of the plant population from higher density would happen with frugivores such a catastrophic transition is difficult to reverse due to hysteresis in the system implying that the habitat quality to be restored greatly exceeds the one that caused the sudden collapse thus early warning signals should be monitored in the presence of animal dispersers to avoid such unwanted regime shift scheffer et al 2009 drake and griffen 2010 kéfi et al 2014 an easily detectable and measurable early warning signal suggested by our analysis is the plant spatial clustering i e the mismatch between the local and the global density of plants see fig 4b d and figure 5 the hysteresis in such systems can also be used for the control and eradication of alien invasive plants in such cases the removal of animal seed dispersers figs 3 and 4 the decrease of plant fertility and vegetative local dispersal fig 4 and 6 or the inhibition of plant animal interaction and animal dispersal efficiency fig 5 and 6 could all serve to achieve successful eradication despite the importance of animal seed dispersers plant persistence is firstly determined by the quality and availability of habitat variation and fragmentation of habitat can influence plant fecundity and consequently plant dynamics density and persistence beckman and rogers 2013 brudvig et al 2015 however not only can habitat quality affect the plant fecundity but also can influence plant frugivore interactions brudvig et al 2015 high habitat quality increases the probability of seed recruitment beckman and rogers 2013 and allows plant persistence fig 3e fig 6c and d conversely low habitat quality drives plants to extinction even if their seeds are dispersed by efficient frugivores fig 3a and b fig 6a the possibility of habitat heterogeneity local versus global habitat quality could further complicate the spatial and dynamical regimes of plants additionally the architecture and coevolution of plant animal interactions in a community affects species persistence abundances and distributions bascompte and jordano et al 2007 minoarivelo and hui 2016a b these extensions are left for future research taken together frugivore mediated seed dispersal can influence plant persistence abundance and spatial distribution it allows conditional persistence of plants

25286,a nitrogen model was developed with the aim to trace nitrogen cycling in a cold climate mining pond at the aitik copper mine in northern sweden the model contains 10 state variables and 19 nitrogen cycling reactions the model also includes sediment and physical properties of the pond such as evaporation freezing and thawing the model was written in mathworks matlab and was calibrated and validated using environmental monitoring data for the clarification pond at the aitik mine the data used comprised monthly values of nitrogen speciation phosphorous and water flow the model accurately predicts ammonium r2 0 84 and nitrate r2 0 82 concentrations in a time series from february 2012 august 2014 the model did not accurately predict nitrate concentrations r2 0 11 presumably due to high oxygen concentration in the pond water that prevented denitrification in the water column the transport of organic material to the sediment was also limiting denitrification in the sediment when allowing denitrification in the water column as well as increasing the rate of transport of organic material to the sediment the nitrate prediction capacity increased to a satisfactory level r2 0 54 a sensitivity analysis for the system showed that the most sensitive reactions for the water column were oxic mineralisation as well as the nitrification rate keywords nitrogen modelling mining nitrogen numerical modelling biogeochemical modelling monitoring data modelling 1 introduction nitrogen discharge from mining sites causing local eutrophication in natural receiving waters has been a known problem for over a decade mattila et al 2007 chlot et al 2013 the source of nitrogen is predominantly from ammonium nitrate based explosives used in blasting operations mattila et al 2007 furthermore recirculation of mining pond water back to the ore refining process enhances the nitrogen concentration in the process waters which in the long term could affect the quality of the effluent waters this paper presents a model that can be used to predict nitrogen concentrations and effects of biogeochemical reactions in cold climate mining ponds mclemore et al 2014 published guidelines for the design of sampling and monitoring programmes at mine sites and pointed out the importance of collecting data that are acceptable for environmental modelling and prediction studies here we present a case study where ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations in a mining pond in northern sweden are modelled based on regular environmental monitoring data collected by the mining company there is an increasing demand from the mining industry on the ability to investigate the complex biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen and predict the behaviour of nitrogen and nitrogen related compounds released from mine sites most geochemical models focus on speciation modelling groundwater flow or coupled groundwater flow with kinetic reactions added phreeqc visual minteq geochemist s workbench which are considered inadequate for modelling a water column sediments and their interaction in a dynamic system during the last years a few models have been presented that focus on modelling inorganic nitrogen and it s interaction with organic material some of which have focused on large scale applications such as nitrogen phosphorus and oxygen fluxes in the baltic sea eilola et al 2011 summarised three of these models baltsem ergom and rco scobi for detailed model description of the three large scale nitrogen models see marmefelt et al 1999 or eilola et al 2009 we implemented the scobi model swedish coastal and ocean biogeochemical model in mathworks matlab and tested to predict nitrogen concentrations in a small scale mining pond affected by high nitrogen mining discharge but it showed poor prediction capacity the reason was not investigated in great depth but it could be due to the large horizontal discretisation or phytoplankton kinetics adapted to marine systems as the scobi model was originally developed for large scale marine systems chlot et al 2011 presented a model aiming to predict inorganic nitrogen concentrations and growth of phytoplankton and macrophytes in cold climate lakes receiving nitrogen rich mining effluents the model presented in this study focuses on cold climate mining pond systems and the interaction between nitrogen phosphorous oxygen and organic material in the water column and in the sediment compared to the model of chlot et al 2011 the present model contains more state variables and a refined discretisation of the sediment the sediment water interface is particularly important in this context since this is the sub oxic environment where most denitrification occurs in natural systems seitzinger 1988 meyer et al 2008 the aim of this study is twofold 1 to present a model that is useful in development and testing of different treatment methods for nitrogen removal within mining ponds where proper modelling of the sediment and the interaction between water column and sediment are of vital importance and 2 to demonstrate that regular environmental monitoring data can be used as model input data although it was not primarily collected for modelling purposes for the present model an extension of a previously used redox model was developed in mathworks matlab with extensions programmed in java predominantly ui elements the model is based on yakushev 2013 redox layer model rolm and with some modifications biogeochemical reactions are parameterised according to yakushev 2013 the model was adapted to a mass balance concept for the water column the surface sediment is modelled using discrete depth layers according to the implicit euler backwards finite difference method butcher 2003 water concentration dilution due to evaporation and precipitation as well as input and output water flow was also added evaporation was modelled using the semi empirical penman formula penman 1948 the model was coupled with a snow model to accurately model dilution during spring flood kokkonen et al 2006 the model was also coupled with a water temperature model that estimates water temperature from air temperature piccolroaz et al 2013 the presented model is simple fast and can be applied to different systems to estimate nitrogen concentrations in mining ponds with high accuracy the model was calibrated and validated using monitoring data from the clarification pond at the aitik copper mine in northern sweden where it accurately predicts ammonium and nitrite concentrations the input data for the aitik pond was obtained from the boliden mineral ab mining company the data was collected from 2012 02 01 to 2014 07 31 and consists of dissolved ammonium nitrite nitrate filtered outflow and unfiltered inflow phosphorous as well as total nitrogen concentrations chemical data was sampled monthly during late spring to early autumn water inflow and outflow to from the pond was measured daily 2 methods 2 1 study site the developed model was calibrated using data from the clarification pond at the aitik copper mine wanhainen et al 2006 where high concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen have been observed the aitik mine is located 15 km se of the town of gällivare in northern sweden fig 1 which is located roughly 60 km north of the arctic circle the annual average air temperature at the aitik mine is 2 c the average precipitation is 700 m m year 1 and snow coverage is 200 days year 1 smhi 2016 the aitik mine is an open pit copper mine with an annual production of 36 mtons of ore the source of nitrogen in the process water and clarification pond is the explosives used in blasting operations mattila et al 2007 the explosive used is an emulsion type explosive with 10 30 ammonium nitrate addition as oxidiser forcit 2016 blasting is generally performed weekly where 200 300 holes drilled into the ore body are filled with approximately 1 ton of explosives each during 2014 a total amount of 32 ktons were used forcit 2016 a major part of ammonium and nitrate in the mine water originates from undetonated explosives that dissolve when groundwater infiltrates into boreholes charged with explosives the water from the open pit mine is pumped up and used in ore refining processes and subsequently discharged into the tailings and clarification pond system the clarification pond at the aitik mine has an area of 1 54 106 m2 and the volume is on average 1 09 107 m3 for the clarification pond water discharge data is collected daily and chemical data at the inlet and outlet are collected on a monthly basis by boliden mineral ab for this model development physical parameters such as air temperature wind speed and incoming solar radiation were obtained from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi 2016 the predominant inorganic nitrogen species in the clarification pond both in the inlet and outlet water is nitrate which accounts for approximately 78 and 84 of total inorganic n in the inlet and outlet water respectively table 1 the higher percentage in the outlet water 84 indicates nitrification during water transport through the pond the second most common species is nitrite 5 31 of total inorganic nitrogen while ammonium accounts for only around 5 of the total inorganic nitrogen concentration table 1 the monitoring data only contains total unfiltered phosphorous in the inlet water average 0 186 mg l and dissolved filtered phosphorous in the outlet water average 0 0009 mg l table 1 the inlet phosphorous concentration shows a large span ranging from 0 030 to 1 1 mg l ph is generally close to neutral both in inflowing and outflowing water 2 1 1 water flow water inflow and outflow to from the clarification pond was measured daily during the period between 2012 02 01 and 2014 08 01 fig 2 there are two outlets where water is pumped from the clarification pond one is water pumped back into the ore refining process and the other is overflow water that is discharged to lina älv after passing through the ore concentrating plant this water is discharged to the tailings pond and is then gathered in a small stream which discharges into the clarification pond there is also a significant flow of 950 m3 h from the tailings pond originating from precipitation the average water retention time in the clarification pond is 88 days but varies significantly during the year the average for the summer months june august is 59 days with the lowest measured water retention time for the summer 2013 when the average residence time was 50 days 2 2 analytical methods the obtained chemical data for inlet and effluent water as well as chemical composition of the clarification pond were obtained from boliden mineral ab mining company the analyses were performed by an external accredited laboratory all inorganic nitrogen species nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were determined by flow analysis cfa and fia and spectrometric detection the analytical precision for nh4 n was 15 and for no3 n and no2 n the precision was 20 chlorophyll a samples were collected from the clarification pond during summer 2015 and filtered onto whatman gf c glass fibre filters pore size 1 2 μm and determined spectrophotometrically on a shimadzu instrument detection limit 0 5 μg l 2 3 model description and differential equation set up the model utilises the following four different sub models to calculate the concentration of the different state variables biogeochemical reactions in water column biogeochemical reactions and diffusion in discrete sediment layers dilution and enrichment due to water inflow and outflow precipitation and evaporation sedimentation and diffusive flux to and from sediment the different calculation steps are carried out simultaneously in standard differential equations form see section differential equation set up only the first sub model includes the original rolm model yakushev 2013 with diffusion added between discrete layers in the water column the water column was modelled as a continously stirred tank reactor cstr system schmidt 1998 since the clarification pond is relatively shallow average depth 8 2 m in relation to the surface area 1 54 106 m2 2 3 1 conceptual model the model utilises 10 different state variables phosphate po4 particulate organic matter pom dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic phosphorous dop ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 oxygen o2 phytoplankton phy and zooplankton zoo biogeochemical reactions are calculated for several cells the water column is one cell where concentration changes are controlled by biogeochemical reactions as well as other physical reactions biogeochemical reactions are also calculated in each discrete layer of the sediment fig 3 biogeochemical reactions and state variable interactions are presented in fig 4 the sum of reactions controlling the concentration of the state variables is set up in ordinary differential equations with details of the biogeochemical reactions and their parameterisation presented in tables 2 5 po4 pom don dop nh4 no3 no2 and o2 are also used as state variables in the sediment the model does not involve gaseous nitrogen compounds n2 n2o no as state variables since biological fixation of n2 is considered insignificant in relation to the mining related input of inorganic nitrogen compounds in the pond water thus nitrogen fixation is set to zero see parameterisation of biogeochemical reactions which implies that any produced nitrogen gas is considered as lost from the system and cannot be assimilated again the behaviour of nitrogen fixating organisms in high nitrate water has been discussed and modelled by tyrrell 1999 in addition to biogeochemical reactions the state variables of the model are also affected by physical reactions sedimentation affects suspended particulate material that settles through the water column and is added to the top layer of the sediment settling rates used in the model are similar in magnitude both to particulate organic carbon poc settling rates measured at the lkab mining site in kiruna which is located 85 km north of the aitik site unpublished data and values published by burns and rosa 1980 0 1 m day 1 diffusive flux to and from the sediment for dissolved species also controls concentrations in the water column and the sediment freezing and thawing of the water column enhances and dilutes the water column concentration respectively precipitation and evaporation from the water column also dilutes and enriches the water column concentration water flow is also included in the model with water inflow and outflow affecting the concentration in the pond according to a mass balance approach 2 3 2 water column differential equation set up all the state variables are set up in differential equations according to 1

reactions the chemical interactions were modelled using kinetic reactions published by yakushev 2013 with some minor modifications here only phosphorous nitrogen oxygen and organic matter are implemented while the full redox layer model originally developed for deep sea redox zones also includes iron sulphur and manganese yakushev 2013 the phytoplankton growth parameterisation was also slightly modified by combining the equations for limiting nutrient between phosphorous and nitrogen compared to that of yakushev 2013 the calculation of limiting nitrogen source ammonium or nitrate was simplified table 2 as was the calculation of limiting nutrient phosphate or nitrogen the last modification was made by implementing a simple way to alter the phytoplankton redfield ratio which is known to be variable jørgensen 1979 the rate calculations for all state variables are shown in table 2 which lists the reactions rx that are part of the differential equations set up in the water column and sediment sections of the model the parameterisations of the individual biogeochemical reactions are listed in table 3 the calculations are based on molar concentrations and biological uptake into mineralization of phytoplankton follows the redfield equation c h 2 o r e d f c n h 3 r e d f n h 3 p o 4 r e d f p r e d f o o 2 r e d f c c o 2 r e d f n n h 3 r e d f p h 3 p o 4 r e d f c h 2 o note that instead of the commonly quoted c n p redfield ratio of 106 16 1 the model allows for variable redfield ratios in phytoplankton which are known to vary from system to system jørgensen 1979 most chemical reactions are more or less temperature dependent atkins and de paula et al 2006 and temperature corrections based on a simplified arrhenius equation can be applied hwang and oleszkiewicz 2007 the simplified arrhenius equation is formulated 50 r t r 20 θ t 20 the equation describes the kinetic reaction rate r20 at temperature 20 c compared to the reaction rate at temperature t where the arrhenius correction factor θ is the fractional change in reaction rate per degree change in temperature table 6 several studies have investigated this correction factor for various biogeochemical reactions e g hwang and oleszkiewicz 2007 the two important biogeochemical reactions that are not already parameterised to include temperature dependence are nitrification and denitrification for nitrification hwang and oleszkiewicz 2007 estimated the correction factor θ to 1 072 while annelies et al 2011 estimated the denitrification correction factor to 1 09 the other biogeochemical reactions with known temperature dependences are parameterised to account for this dependence table 2 2 3 4 1 biogeochemical parameters the biogeochemical parameters used to obtain optimal model results are presented in table 5 significantly different parameter values can be noted for the water column and sediment environments all diffusion coefficients in the model are corrected for water temperature and dynamic viscosity according to eq 51 miller 1924 51 d t 1 d t 2 t 1 t 2 μ t 2 μ t 1 where dt1 and dt2 are the diffusion coefficients in water at temperatures t1 and t2 respectively and μ t1 and μ t2 are the dynamic viscosities at temperatures t1 and t2 respectively the dynamic viscosities are taken from crittenden et al 2012 diffusion in the sediment is corrected for porosity according to eq 52 52 d e d ϕ 2 where de is the effective diffusion in the porous sediment d is the diffusion coefficient in water and ϕ is porosity ullman and aller 1982 2 4 other sub models included a simple snow model was implemented kokkonen et al 2006 for calculation of water equivalents of snow as well as snow precipitation and melting ice formation on the pond was calculated as 53 h k t d where h is the thickness of the ice m t is the average daily temperature c d is number of days below freezing point and k is an empirical factor set to 2 2 the water equivalent and snow corrected precipitation is shown in fig 5 2 4 1 temperature due to a limited number of in situ water temperature measurements water temperature was modelled according to piccolroaz et al 2013 using air temperature and incoming solar radiation as input data fig 6 the model was calibrated using a large air and water temperature dataset from the clarification pond at the kiruna mine northern sweden since the parameters in the water temperature model are based on local physical parameters the model was considered being applicable to the aitik and kiruna sites which are located 85 km from each other incoming solar radiation was obtained from smhi 2016 2 4 2 snow model effects of snow melting and freeze out of salts are essential to model in the aitik pond due to the heavy spring flood in may and ice formation on the pond during winter the water added to the pond in spring causes a dilution effect that lowers the overall concentrations in spring during winter the concentration of dissolved species is elevated due to freeze out when a 0 7 1 m thick layer of ice forms on the pond canfield et al 1983 3 results discussion 3 1 calibration a monitoring programme dataset from the aitik mine obtained from boliden mineral ab was used for model calibration the calibration dataset contained dissolved ammonium nitrate nitrite and total phosphorous measured during the period 2012 02 01 2014 08 29 the first half of the data set was used during a monte carlo calibration run with white noise random numbers for the model parameters within reasonable limits in general the calibration run indicated that low biological activity such as nitrification and phytoplankton growth table 7 was required to correctly model dissolved ammonium r2 0 84 and nitrite r2 0 82 concentrations for dissolved nitrate the fit between modelled and observed data was unsatisfactory r2 0 11 potential reasons for the initially poor model fit and ways to improve this fit are discussed in the section on denitrification potential 3 2 validation validation was performed on an independent data set the second half of the monitoring dataset that was not used during calibration of the model the validity of the model was determined using root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and normalised absolute error nmae figs 7 9 show the fit between modelled and measured dissolved ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations for the period february 2012 october 2014 the results shown from the validation should be cautiously considered as the independent data set is from the same location as the calibration the modelled concentrations do correlate well with the monitoring data at this site so the predicted nitrogen cycling reactions should be seen as valid for this site and not necessarily all cold climate mining ponds 3 2 1 validation by comparison to other systems many biogeochemical rates can be compared to other systems as a form of validation in this study nitrification denitrification and to some extent phytoplankton growth can be compared with corresponding rates in other aquatic systems denitrification in lakes predominantly takes place in anoxic sediments seitzinger 1988 normally ranging from 50 to 250 μmol n m 2 h 1 with extremes in the range 0 1067 μmol n m 2 h 1 table 7 in hypolimnetic lakes with low oxygen concentrations seitzinger 1988 reported denitrification rates in bulk water to be in the range 0 2 1 9 μm n d 1 table 7 the clarification pond at aitik is shallow average water depth 8 2 m and is likely to be aerated most of the year due to wind mixing and a low input of reactive organic material model results show a small decrease in oxygen saturation during the winter months when the primary production is halted and decomposition of organic matter and nitrification are consuming oxygen yakushev 2013 found that denitrification is significantly halted at oxygen concentrations above 12 μm thus the modelled oxygen concentration 200 300 μm never reaches values low enough to justify denitrification in bulk water however denitrification in oxygenated systems has been reported in several studies including denitrification in oxygen saturated waters robertsson and kuenen 1984 lloyd 1993 and in small micro niches in the water where the oxygen concentration is low enough to permit denitrification robertsson and kuenen 1984 biogeochemical reaction rates are compiled in table 7 where modelled annual average values from the aitik pond are compared to those found in other studies the phytoplankton uptake is reported as an annual daily average but is in reality restricted to the summer months the modelled sediment nitrification is somewhat higher than literature values which is not unreasonable in a high nitrogen mining system table 7 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted on all parameters listed in table 5 by monte carlo sweep of 50 of optimal parameter setup as stated by cariboni et al 2007 monte carlo parameter sweeps are well suited for conducting sensitivity analysis of computing intensive models the sweep interval for the parameters was divided into 10 bins and a random number was sampled from a uniform distribution the sweep continued until each bin had at least 5 represented numbers minimum of 50 random numbers per parameter and average of 90 the most sensitive parameters for ammonium nitrite and nitrate are plotted in figs 10 12 the plots show the change in the coefficient of determination r2 in the interval of the parameter sweep since no data was available for the sediment the sediment parameters were calibrated separately and consequently are not included in the sensitivity analysis for the water column the diffusive transport to and from the sediment as well as sedimentation of pom are orders of magnitude lower than the rate of biogeochemical reactions in the water column the specific rate of denitrification p d e n 1 is the most sensitive parameter with regards to sediment transport and biogeochemical reactions in the sediment 3 2 3 denitrification potential denitrification in the pond can occur either in the water column bulk water denitrification or in the bottom sediment table 7 two important parameters controlling denitrification in these two environments are the oxygen concentration of the water column and the flux of organic material to the sediment in the performed modelling the denitrification rate in the water column was set to zero assuming fully oxygenated conditions in the shallow pond table 7 to investigate if denitrification in the water column could explain the relatively poor fit between modelled and measured dissolved nitrate concentrations fig 9 the oxygen condition of the water column was set to allow for denitrification the denitrification rate was then adjusted to fit the rates reported in the literature table 7 after the adjustment allowing denitrification in the water column the fit between modelled and measured nitrate concentrations was improved and the r2 value increased from 0 11 fig 9 to 0 42 when allowing denitrification in the water column the denitrification rate increased from 0 to 3 2 μmol n m 3 h 1 which is still around an order of magnitude lower than the maximum value quoted in the literature 79 16 μmol n m 3 h 1 seitzinger 1988 this means that a relatively small increase in denitrification rate in the water column is enough to significantly improve the modelled nitrate concentrations the modelled flux of doc to the sediment 14 74 μmol c m 2 h 1 is considerably lower than the literature values 23 116 μmol c m 2 h 1 table 7 the latter values of 23 116 μ m o l c m 2 h 1 are impossible to achieve by diffusive flux alone the doc might adsorb to settling particulate matter in the water burdige and komada 2015 and the pathway to the sediment might be via sedimentation instead of only diffusion the diffusion coefficient is also very low for doc 5 6 10 10 m2 s 1 calibrated value which further increases the unlikelihood of doc transport to the sediment only via diffusion two more tests for the model were run one where 20 the doc was affected by sedimentation and one where doc was affected by sedimentation and denitrification was allowed in the oxygen rich water column to test the effect of settling doc diffusive flux plus settling of doc were calibrated to fit the literature value doc flux to the sediment in table 7 then it was assumed that only a fraction of the settling doc would be bioavailable for denitrification and oxic decomposition with the bioavailable fraction set to 50 leaving the denitrification at zero in the water column and adding sedimentation of doc the nitrate r2 value increased from 0 11 to 0 2 this was due to lack of organic matter to drive denitrification in the sediment by allowing settling of doc the doc flux to the sediment increased from 14 7 to 94 6 μmol c m 2 h 1 where 54 7 μmol c m 2 h 1 were bioavailable for denitrification and oxic mineralisation this increased denitrification in the sediment from 411 4 μmol n m 2 h 1 to 758 6 μmol n m 2 h 1 measures of model performance rmse nmae r2 for the original model as well as the three different scenarios used to investigate denitrification effects on nitrate are shown in table 8 the best fit for all state variables are obtained with a denitrification in the water column as well as a modified doc transport to the sediment triggering denitrification in the sediment 4 conclusions the model was able to predict dissolved ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the aitik clarification pond to a satisfactory level r2 0 82 0 84 figs 7 and 8 while the dissolved nitrate concentration reached a coefficient of determination r2 of only 0 11 in the original model fig 9 with minor modifications of the model involving denitrification in the water column and an increased flux of bioreactive doc to the sediment r2 for nitrate could be increased to 0 54 table 8 which is considered acceptable the modifications required to achieve a better nitrate fit are not extreme and the biogeochemical reaction rates are well within rates observed in other systems table 7 although at present there is no field or experimental evidence of denitrification occurring in the presumably oxygenated water column of the pond denitrification has been demonstrated under such conditions robertsson and kuenen 1984 the oxygen saturation was however an assumption made because oxygen is not measured in the environmental monitoring programme at the aitik pond the model is highly optimized and generates a large data output for a short execution time the case study at the aitik pond shows that ordinary monitoring data can successfully be used as model input data although such data primarily may not have been collected for modelling purposes mclemore et al 2014 this study also shows that modelling can be a useful tool for estimating nitrogen concentrations and studying biogeochemical transformations of nitrogen in connection with the opening of new mines upscaling of mining activities or the design of clarification ponds it could also potentially be useful for the design and implementation of future regulating strategies regarding nitrogen removal in mining ponds the model is currently being developed with a more complex water flow model

25286,a nitrogen model was developed with the aim to trace nitrogen cycling in a cold climate mining pond at the aitik copper mine in northern sweden the model contains 10 state variables and 19 nitrogen cycling reactions the model also includes sediment and physical properties of the pond such as evaporation freezing and thawing the model was written in mathworks matlab and was calibrated and validated using environmental monitoring data for the clarification pond at the aitik mine the data used comprised monthly values of nitrogen speciation phosphorous and water flow the model accurately predicts ammonium r2 0 84 and nitrate r2 0 82 concentrations in a time series from february 2012 august 2014 the model did not accurately predict nitrate concentrations r2 0 11 presumably due to high oxygen concentration in the pond water that prevented denitrification in the water column the transport of organic material to the sediment was also limiting denitrification in the sediment when allowing denitrification in the water column as well as increasing the rate of transport of organic material to the sediment the nitrate prediction capacity increased to a satisfactory level r2 0 54 a sensitivity analysis for the system showed that the most sensitive reactions for the water column were oxic mineralisation as well as the nitrification rate keywords nitrogen modelling mining nitrogen numerical modelling biogeochemical modelling monitoring data modelling 1 introduction nitrogen discharge from mining sites causing local eutrophication in natural receiving waters has been a known problem for over a decade mattila et al 2007 chlot et al 2013 the source of nitrogen is predominantly from ammonium nitrate based explosives used in blasting operations mattila et al 2007 furthermore recirculation of mining pond water back to the ore refining process enhances the nitrogen concentration in the process waters which in the long term could affect the quality of the effluent waters this paper presents a model that can be used to predict nitrogen concentrations and effects of biogeochemical reactions in cold climate mining ponds mclemore et al 2014 published guidelines for the design of sampling and monitoring programmes at mine sites and pointed out the importance of collecting data that are acceptable for environmental modelling and prediction studies here we present a case study where ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations in a mining pond in northern sweden are modelled based on regular environmental monitoring data collected by the mining company there is an increasing demand from the mining industry on the ability to investigate the complex biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen and predict the behaviour of nitrogen and nitrogen related compounds released from mine sites most geochemical models focus on speciation modelling groundwater flow or coupled groundwater flow with kinetic reactions added phreeqc visual minteq geochemist s workbench which are considered inadequate for modelling a water column sediments and their interaction in a dynamic system during the last years a few models have been presented that focus on modelling inorganic nitrogen and it s interaction with organic material some of which have focused on large scale applications such as nitrogen phosphorus and oxygen fluxes in the baltic sea eilola et al 2011 summarised three of these models baltsem ergom and rco scobi for detailed model description of the three large scale nitrogen models see marmefelt et al 1999 or eilola et al 2009 we implemented the scobi model swedish coastal and ocean biogeochemical model in mathworks matlab and tested to predict nitrogen concentrations in a small scale mining pond affected by high nitrogen mining discharge but it showed poor prediction capacity the reason was not investigated in great depth but it could be due to the large horizontal discretisation or phytoplankton kinetics adapted to marine systems as the scobi model was originally developed for large scale marine systems chlot et al 2011 presented a model aiming to predict inorganic nitrogen concentrations and growth of phytoplankton and macrophytes in cold climate lakes receiving nitrogen rich mining effluents the model presented in this study focuses on cold climate mining pond systems and the interaction between nitrogen phosphorous oxygen and organic material in the water column and in the sediment compared to the model of chlot et al 2011 the present model contains more state variables and a refined discretisation of the sediment the sediment water interface is particularly important in this context since this is the sub oxic environment where most denitrification occurs in natural systems seitzinger 1988 meyer et al 2008 the aim of this study is twofold 1 to present a model that is useful in development and testing of different treatment methods for nitrogen removal within mining ponds where proper modelling of the sediment and the interaction between water column and sediment are of vital importance and 2 to demonstrate that regular environmental monitoring data can be used as model input data although it was not primarily collected for modelling purposes for the present model an extension of a previously used redox model was developed in mathworks matlab with extensions programmed in java predominantly ui elements the model is based on yakushev 2013 redox layer model rolm and with some modifications biogeochemical reactions are parameterised according to yakushev 2013 the model was adapted to a mass balance concept for the water column the surface sediment is modelled using discrete depth layers according to the implicit euler backwards finite difference method butcher 2003 water concentration dilution due to evaporation and precipitation as well as input and output water flow was also added evaporation was modelled using the semi empirical penman formula penman 1948 the model was coupled with a snow model to accurately model dilution during spring flood kokkonen et al 2006 the model was also coupled with a water temperature model that estimates water temperature from air temperature piccolroaz et al 2013 the presented model is simple fast and can be applied to different systems to estimate nitrogen concentrations in mining ponds with high accuracy the model was calibrated and validated using monitoring data from the clarification pond at the aitik copper mine in northern sweden where it accurately predicts ammonium and nitrite concentrations the input data for the aitik pond was obtained from the boliden mineral ab mining company the data was collected from 2012 02 01 to 2014 07 31 and consists of dissolved ammonium nitrite nitrate filtered outflow and unfiltered inflow phosphorous as well as total nitrogen concentrations chemical data was sampled monthly during late spring to early autumn water inflow and outflow to from the pond was measured daily 2 methods 2 1 study site the developed model was calibrated using data from the clarification pond at the aitik copper mine wanhainen et al 2006 where high concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen have been observed the aitik mine is located 15 km se of the town of gällivare in northern sweden fig 1 which is located roughly 60 km north of the arctic circle the annual average air temperature at the aitik mine is 2 c the average precipitation is 700 m m year 1 and snow coverage is 200 days year 1 smhi 2016 the aitik mine is an open pit copper mine with an annual production of 36 mtons of ore the source of nitrogen in the process water and clarification pond is the explosives used in blasting operations mattila et al 2007 the explosive used is an emulsion type explosive with 10 30 ammonium nitrate addition as oxidiser forcit 2016 blasting is generally performed weekly where 200 300 holes drilled into the ore body are filled with approximately 1 ton of explosives each during 2014 a total amount of 32 ktons were used forcit 2016 a major part of ammonium and nitrate in the mine water originates from undetonated explosives that dissolve when groundwater infiltrates into boreholes charged with explosives the water from the open pit mine is pumped up and used in ore refining processes and subsequently discharged into the tailings and clarification pond system the clarification pond at the aitik mine has an area of 1 54 106 m2 and the volume is on average 1 09 107 m3 for the clarification pond water discharge data is collected daily and chemical data at the inlet and outlet are collected on a monthly basis by boliden mineral ab for this model development physical parameters such as air temperature wind speed and incoming solar radiation were obtained from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi 2016 the predominant inorganic nitrogen species in the clarification pond both in the inlet and outlet water is nitrate which accounts for approximately 78 and 84 of total inorganic n in the inlet and outlet water respectively table 1 the higher percentage in the outlet water 84 indicates nitrification during water transport through the pond the second most common species is nitrite 5 31 of total inorganic nitrogen while ammonium accounts for only around 5 of the total inorganic nitrogen concentration table 1 the monitoring data only contains total unfiltered phosphorous in the inlet water average 0 186 mg l and dissolved filtered phosphorous in the outlet water average 0 0009 mg l table 1 the inlet phosphorous concentration shows a large span ranging from 0 030 to 1 1 mg l ph is generally close to neutral both in inflowing and outflowing water 2 1 1 water flow water inflow and outflow to from the clarification pond was measured daily during the period between 2012 02 01 and 2014 08 01 fig 2 there are two outlets where water is pumped from the clarification pond one is water pumped back into the ore refining process and the other is overflow water that is discharged to lina älv after passing through the ore concentrating plant this water is discharged to the tailings pond and is then gathered in a small stream which discharges into the clarification pond there is also a significant flow of 950 m3 h from the tailings pond originating from precipitation the average water retention time in the clarification pond is 88 days but varies significantly during the year the average for the summer months june august is 59 days with the lowest measured water retention time for the summer 2013 when the average residence time was 50 days 2 2 analytical methods the obtained chemical data for inlet and effluent water as well as chemical composition of the clarification pond were obtained from boliden mineral ab mining company the analyses were performed by an external accredited laboratory all inorganic nitrogen species nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were determined by flow analysis cfa and fia and spectrometric detection the analytical precision for nh4 n was 15 and for no3 n and no2 n the precision was 20 chlorophyll a samples were collected from the clarification pond during summer 2015 and filtered onto whatman gf c glass fibre filters pore size 1 2 μm and determined spectrophotometrically on a shimadzu instrument detection limit 0 5 μg l 2 3 model description and differential equation set up the model utilises the following four different sub models to calculate the concentration of the different state variables biogeochemical reactions in water column biogeochemical reactions and diffusion in discrete sediment layers dilution and enrichment due to water inflow and outflow precipitation and evaporation sedimentation and diffusive flux to and from sediment the different calculation steps are carried out simultaneously in standard differential equations form see section differential equation set up only the first sub model includes the original rolm model yakushev 2013 with diffusion added between discrete layers in the water column the water column was modelled as a continously stirred tank reactor cstr system schmidt 1998 since the clarification pond is relatively shallow average depth 8 2 m in relation to the surface area 1 54 106 m2 2 3 1 conceptual model the model utilises 10 different state variables phosphate po4 particulate organic matter pom dissolved organic nitrogen don dissolved organic phosphorous dop ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 oxygen o2 phytoplankton phy and zooplankton zoo biogeochemical reactions are calculated for several cells the water column is one cell where concentration changes are controlled by biogeochemical reactions as well as other physical reactions biogeochemical reactions are also calculated in each discrete layer of the sediment fig 3 biogeochemical reactions and state variable interactions are presented in fig 4 the sum of reactions controlling the concentration of the state variables is set up in ordinary differential equations with details of the biogeochemical reactions and their parameterisation presented in tables 2 5 po4 pom don dop nh4 no3 no2 and o2 are also used as state variables in the sediment the model does not involve gaseous nitrogen compounds n2 n2o no as state variables since biological fixation of n2 is considered insignificant in relation to the mining related input of inorganic nitrogen compounds in the pond water thus nitrogen fixation is set to zero see parameterisation of biogeochemical reactions which implies that any produced nitrogen gas is considered as lost from the system and cannot be assimilated again the behaviour of nitrogen fixating organisms in high nitrate water has been discussed and modelled by tyrrell 1999 in addition to biogeochemical reactions the state variables of the model are also affected by physical reactions sedimentation affects suspended particulate material that settles through the water column and is added to the top layer of the sediment settling rates used in the model are similar in magnitude both to particulate organic carbon poc settling rates measured at the lkab mining site in kiruna which is located 85 km north of the aitik site unpublished data and values published by burns and rosa 1980 0 1 m day 1 diffusive flux to and from the sediment for dissolved species also controls concentrations in the water column and the sediment freezing and thawing of the water column enhances and dilutes the water column concentration respectively precipitation and evaporation from the water column also dilutes and enriches the water column concentration water flow is also included in the model with water inflow and outflow affecting the concentration in the pond according to a mass balance approach 2 3 2 water column differential equation set up all the state variables are set up in differential equations according to 1

and zooplankton the sediment differential equations are set up in a way similar to in the water column except that the sediment is not affected directly by ice formation evaporation and precipitation

reactions the chemical interactions were modelled using kinetic reactions published by yakushev 2013 with some minor modifications here only phosphorous nitrogen oxygen and organic matter are implemented while the full redox layer model originally developed for deep sea redox zones also includes iron sulphur and manganese yakushev 2013 the phytoplankton growth parameterisation was also slightly modified by combining the equations for limiting nutrient between phosphorous and nitrogen compared to that of yakushev 2013 the calculation of limiting nitrogen source ammonium or nitrate was simplified table 2 as was the calculation of limiting nutrient phosphate or nitrogen the last modification was made by implementing a simple way to alter the phytoplankton redfield ratio which is known to be variable jørgensen 1979 the rate calculations for all state variables are shown in table 2 which lists the reactions rx that are part of the differential equations set up in the water column and sediment sections of the model the parameterisations of the individual biogeochemical reactions are listed in table 3 the calculations are based on molar concentrations and biological uptake into mineralization of phytoplankton follows the redfield equation c h 2 o r e d f c n h 3 r e d f n h 3 p o 4 r e d f p r e d f o o 2 r e d f c c o 2 r e d f n n h 3 r e d f p h 3 p o 4 r e d f c h 2 o note that instead of the commonly quoted c n p redfield ratio of 106 16 1 the model allows for variable redfield ratios in phytoplankton which are known to vary from system to system jørgensen 1979 most chemical reactions are more or less temperature dependent atkins and de paula et al 2006 and temperature corrections based on a simplified arrhenius equation can be applied hwang and oleszkiewicz 2007 the simplified arrhenius equation is formulated 50 r t r 20 θ t 20 the equation describes the kinetic reaction rate r20 at temperature 20 c compared to the reaction rate at temperature t where the arrhenius correction factor θ is the fractional change in reaction rate per degree change in temperature table 6 several studies have investigated this correction factor for various biogeochemical reactions e g hwang and oleszkiewicz 2007 the two important biogeochemical reactions that are not already parameterised to include temperature dependence are nitrification and denitrification for nitrification hwang and oleszkiewicz 2007 estimated the correction factor θ to 1 072 while annelies et al 2011 estimated the denitrification correction factor to 1 09 the other biogeochemical reactions with known temperature dependences are parameterised to account for this dependence table 2 2 3 4 1 biogeochemical parameters the biogeochemical parameters used to obtain optimal model results are presented in table 5 significantly different parameter values can be noted for the water column and sediment environments all diffusion coefficients in the model are corrected for water temperature and dynamic viscosity according to eq 51 miller 1924 51 d t 1 d t 2 t 1 t 2 μ t 2 μ t 1 where dt1 and dt2 are the diffusion coefficients in water at temperatures t1 and t2 respectively and μ t1 and μ t2 are the dynamic viscosities at temperatures t1 and t2 respectively the dynamic viscosities are taken from crittenden et al 2012 diffusion in the sediment is corrected for porosity according to eq 52 52 d e d ϕ 2 where de is the effective diffusion in the porous sediment d is the diffusion coefficient in water and ϕ is porosity ullman and aller 1982 2 4 other sub models included a simple snow model was implemented kokkonen et al 2006 for calculation of water equivalents of snow as well as snow precipitation and melting ice formation on the pond was calculated as 53 h k t d where h is the thickness of the ice m t is the average daily temperature c d is number of days below freezing point and k is an empirical factor set to 2 2 the water equivalent and snow corrected precipitation is shown in fig 5 2 4 1 temperature due to a limited number of in situ water temperature measurements water temperature was modelled according to piccolroaz et al 2013 using air temperature and incoming solar radiation as input data fig 6 the model was calibrated using a large air and water temperature dataset from the clarification pond at the kiruna mine northern sweden since the parameters in the water temperature model are based on local physical parameters the model was considered being applicable to the aitik and kiruna sites which are located 85 km from each other incoming solar radiation was obtained from smhi 2016 2 4 2 snow model effects of snow melting and freeze out of salts are essential to model in the aitik pond due to the heavy spring flood in may and ice formation on the pond during winter the water added to the pond in spring causes a dilution effect that lowers the overall concentrations in spring during winter the concentration of dissolved species is elevated due to freeze out when a 0 7 1 m thick layer of ice forms on the pond canfield et al 1983 3 results discussion 3 1 calibration a monitoring programme dataset from the aitik mine obtained from boliden mineral ab was used for model calibration the calibration dataset contained dissolved ammonium nitrate nitrite and total phosphorous measured during the period 2012 02 01 2014 08 29 the first half of the data set was used during a monte carlo calibration run with white noise random numbers for the model parameters within reasonable limits in general the calibration run indicated that low biological activity such as nitrification and phytoplankton growth table 7 was required to correctly model dissolved ammonium r2 0 84 and nitrite r2 0 82 concentrations for dissolved nitrate the fit between modelled and observed data was unsatisfactory r2 0 11 potential reasons for the initially poor model fit and ways to improve this fit are discussed in the section on denitrification potential 3 2 validation validation was performed on an independent data set the second half of the monitoring dataset that was not used during calibration of the model the validity of the model was determined using root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and normalised absolute error nmae figs 7 9 show the fit between modelled and measured dissolved ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations for the period february 2012 october 2014 the results shown from the validation should be cautiously considered as the independent data set is from the same location as the calibration the modelled concentrations do correlate well with the monitoring data at this site so the predicted nitrogen cycling reactions should be seen as valid for this site and not necessarily all cold climate mining ponds 3 2 1 validation by comparison to other systems many biogeochemical rates can be compared to other systems as a form of validation in this study nitrification denitrification and to some extent phytoplankton growth can be compared with corresponding rates in other aquatic systems denitrification in lakes predominantly takes place in anoxic sediments seitzinger 1988 normally ranging from 50 to 250 μmol n m 2 h 1 with extremes in the range 0 1067 μmol n m 2 h 1 table 7 in hypolimnetic lakes with low oxygen concentrations seitzinger 1988 reported denitrification rates in bulk water to be in the range 0 2 1 9 μm n d 1 table 7 the clarification pond at aitik is shallow average water depth 8 2 m and is likely to be aerated most of the year due to wind mixing and a low input of reactive organic material model results show a small decrease in oxygen saturation during the winter months when the primary production is halted and decomposition of organic matter and nitrification are consuming oxygen yakushev 2013 found that denitrification is significantly halted at oxygen concentrations above 12 μm thus the modelled oxygen concentration 200 300 μm never reaches values low enough to justify denitrification in bulk water however denitrification in oxygenated systems has been reported in several studies including denitrification in oxygen saturated waters robertsson and kuenen 1984 lloyd 1993 and in small micro niches in the water where the oxygen concentration is low enough to permit denitrification robertsson and kuenen 1984 biogeochemical reaction rates are compiled in table 7 where modelled annual average values from the aitik pond are compared to those found in other studies the phytoplankton uptake is reported as an annual daily average but is in reality restricted to the summer months the modelled sediment nitrification is somewhat higher than literature values which is not unreasonable in a high nitrogen mining system table 7 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was conducted on all parameters listed in table 5 by monte carlo sweep of 50 of optimal parameter setup as stated by cariboni et al 2007 monte carlo parameter sweeps are well suited for conducting sensitivity analysis of computing intensive models the sweep interval for the parameters was divided into 10 bins and a random number was sampled from a uniform distribution the sweep continued until each bin had at least 5 represented numbers minimum of 50 random numbers per parameter and average of 90 the most sensitive parameters for ammonium nitrite and nitrate are plotted in figs 10 12 the plots show the change in the coefficient of determination r2 in the interval of the parameter sweep since no data was available for the sediment the sediment parameters were calibrated separately and consequently are not included in the sensitivity analysis for the water column the diffusive transport to and from the sediment as well as sedimentation of pom are orders of magnitude lower than the rate of biogeochemical reactions in the water column the specific rate of denitrification p d e n 1 is the most sensitive parameter with regards to sediment transport and biogeochemical reactions in the sediment 3 2 3 denitrification potential denitrification in the pond can occur either in the water column bulk water denitrification or in the bottom sediment table 7 two important parameters controlling denitrification in these two environments are the oxygen concentration of the water column and the flux of organic material to the sediment in the performed modelling the denitrification rate in the water column was set to zero assuming fully oxygenated conditions in the shallow pond table 7 to investigate if denitrification in the water column could explain the relatively poor fit between modelled and measured dissolved nitrate concentrations fig 9 the oxygen condition of the water column was set to allow for denitrification the denitrification rate was then adjusted to fit the rates reported in the literature table 7 after the adjustment allowing denitrification in the water column the fit between modelled and measured nitrate concentrations was improved and the r2 value increased from 0 11 fig 9 to 0 42 when allowing denitrification in the water column the denitrification rate increased from 0 to 3 2 μmol n m 3 h 1 which is still around an order of magnitude lower than the maximum value quoted in the literature 79 16 μmol n m 3 h 1 seitzinger 1988 this means that a relatively small increase in denitrification rate in the water column is enough to significantly improve the modelled nitrate concentrations the modelled flux of doc to the sediment 14 74 μmol c m 2 h 1 is considerably lower than the literature values 23 116 μmol c m 2 h 1 table 7 the latter values of 23 116 μ m o l c m 2 h 1 are impossible to achieve by diffusive flux alone the doc might adsorb to settling particulate matter in the water burdige and komada 2015 and the pathway to the sediment might be via sedimentation instead of only diffusion the diffusion coefficient is also very low for doc 5 6 10 10 m2 s 1 calibrated value which further increases the unlikelihood of doc transport to the sediment only via diffusion two more tests for the model were run one where 20 the doc was affected by sedimentation and one where doc was affected by sedimentation and denitrification was allowed in the oxygen rich water column to test the effect of settling doc diffusive flux plus settling of doc were calibrated to fit the literature value doc flux to the sediment in table 7 then it was assumed that only a fraction of the settling doc would be bioavailable for denitrification and oxic decomposition with the bioavailable fraction set to 50 leaving the denitrification at zero in the water column and adding sedimentation of doc the nitrate r2 value increased from 0 11 to 0 2 this was due to lack of organic matter to drive denitrification in the sediment by allowing settling of doc the doc flux to the sediment increased from 14 7 to 94 6 μmol c m 2 h 1 where 54 7 μmol c m 2 h 1 were bioavailable for denitrification and oxic mineralisation this increased denitrification in the sediment from 411 4 μmol n m 2 h 1 to 758 6 μmol n m 2 h 1 measures of model performance rmse nmae r2 for the original model as well as the three different scenarios used to investigate denitrification effects on nitrate are shown in table 8 the best fit for all state variables are obtained with a denitrification in the water column as well as a modified doc transport to the sediment triggering denitrification in the sediment 4 conclusions the model was able to predict dissolved ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the aitik clarification pond to a satisfactory level r2 0 82 0 84 figs 7 and 8 while the dissolved nitrate concentration reached a coefficient of determination r2 of only 0 11 in the original model fig 9 with minor modifications of the model involving denitrification in the water column and an increased flux of bioreactive doc to the sediment r2 for nitrate could be increased to 0 54 table 8 which is considered acceptable the modifications required to achieve a better nitrate fit are not extreme and the biogeochemical reaction rates are well within rates observed in other systems table 7 although at present there is no field or experimental evidence of denitrification occurring in the presumably oxygenated water column of the pond denitrification has been demonstrated under such conditions robertsson and kuenen 1984 the oxygen saturation was however an assumption made because oxygen is not measured in the environmental monitoring programme at the aitik pond the model is highly optimized and generates a large data output for a short execution time the case study at the aitik pond shows that ordinary monitoring data can successfully be used as model input data although such data primarily may not have been collected for modelling purposes mclemore et al 2014 this study also shows that modelling can be a useful tool for estimating nitrogen concentrations and studying biogeochemical transformations of nitrogen in connection with the opening of new mines upscaling of mining activities or the design of clarification ponds it could also potentially be useful for the design and implementation of future regulating strategies regarding nitrogen removal in mining ponds the model is currently being developed with a more complex water flow model

25287,1 savanna systems exhibit a high plant functional diversity while aridity and livestock grazing intensity have been widely discussed as drivers of savanna vegetation composition physical soil properties have received less attention since savannas can show local differences in soil properties these might act as environmental filters and affect plant diversity and ecosystem functioning at the patch scale however research on the link between savanna vegetation diversity and ecosystem function is widely missing 2 in this study we aim at understanding the impact of local heterogeneity in soil conditions on plant diversity and on ecosystem functions for this we used the ecohydrological savanna model ecohyd the model simulates the fate of multiple plant functional types and their interactions with local biotic and abiotic conditions we applied the model to a set of different landscapes under a wide range of livestock grazing and precipitation scenarios to assess the impact of local heterogeneity in soil conditions on the composition and diversity of plant functional types and on ecosystem functions 3 comparisons between homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes revealed that landscape soil heterogeneity allowed for a higher functional diversity of vegetation under conditions of high competition i e scenarios of low grazing stress however landscape heterogeneity did not have this effect under low grazing stress in combination with high mean annual precipitation further landscape heterogeneity led to a higher community biomass especially for lower rainfall conditions but also dependent on grazing stress total transpiration of the plant community decreased in heterogeneous landscapes under arid conditions 4 this study highlights that local soil conditions interact with precipitation and grazing in driving savanna vegetation it clearly shows that vegetation diversity and resulting ecosystem functioning can be driven by landscape heterogeneity we therefore suggest that future research on ecosystem functioning of savanna systems should focus on the links between local environmental conditions via plant functional diversity to ecosystem functioning abbreviations pft plant functional type map mean annual precipitation lsu large stock units keywords plant functional type trait diversity ecosystem functioning plant coexistence soil texture ecohydrological model 1 introduction savannas cover approximately 20 of the global land surface and account for 30 of the terrestrial net primary production sankaran et al 2005 grace et al 2006 they can be found in regions with a rather limited water availability and highly variable annual precipitation d onofrio et al 2015 savanna are characterized by a matrix of abundant perennial grasses and scattered woody plants scholes and archer 1997 locally plant coverage and species composition vary strongly asner et al 1998 augustine 2003 as a result savanna vegetation exhibits a high functional diversity cowling et al 1994 busso et al 2001 kos and poschlod 2010 batalha et al 2011 the high temporal and spatial variability of environmental conditions in savannas is assumed to be a major driver for this high functional diversity because it enables the coexistence of plants with different strategies for example high intense precipitation events can lead to deep soil infiltration which facilitates woody plants with a deeper rooting system in contrast less intense precipitation events benefit species with a shallow rooting system walter 1954 accordingly if mean annual precipitation increases vegetation composition will shift towards more woody plant cover sankaran et al 2005 livestock grazing is another important factor affecting vegetation distribution and diversity adler et al 2001 it can increase the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation leading to long term changes in the community composition in savannas the shrub encroachment rate has been found to be very sensitive to grazing patterns weber et al 1998 while moderate level grazing intensity can increase vegetation diversity by creating mosaics of microhabitats oba et al 2001 high intensity of livestock grazing and browsing can cause a decline in plant diversity as it reduces the abundance and the biomass of most plant species mysterud 2006 another key factor for vegetation diversity in savannas is landscape heterogeneity san jose et al 1998 augustine 2003 in this context we define heterogeneous landscapes as a mosaic of patches of different soil properties leading to different pattern in soil water content which is the main limiting resource for plant growth in savanna systems walker et al 1981 landscape heterogeneity can act as a buffer mechanism against adverse environmental conditions jeltsch et al 2000 through the provision of refuge sites in addition it can create a high number of ecological niches hosting a more diverse plant species assemblage than homogeneous landscapes stein et al 2014 empirical studies and remote sensing data reveal that savanna landscapes show a high spatial variability in topography wu and archer 2005 and soil conditions williams et al 1996 fuhlendorf and smeins 1998 bestelmeyer et al 2009 2011 zhou et al 2017 such as soil texture and soil depth however the impacts of this spatial heterogeneity on vegetation cover and composition have so far received very little attention in the savanna ecology literature in general and in modeling studies in particular although differences in soil conditions can have multiple effects on vegetation soil texture results from the fraction of soil particle sizes and determines major physical properties of the soil that control hydrological processes by impacting infiltration and water holding capacity it determines plant water availability fernandez illescas et al 2001 coarse textured soils such as sand facilitate water infiltration into deeper soil layers mcclaran and van devender 1997 thus increasing the water availability for deep rooted plants soil depth determines the vertical water distribution as well as space that is available for rooting and thus determines the amount of water available for plant growth peterman et al 2014 landscape topography mainly influences lateral water fluxes by runoff and soil erosion tietjen 2016 but also influences spatial evapotranspiration patterns through local differences in radiation liu et al 2012 this impacts the surface water budget and vegetation patterns at different spatial scales bergkamp 1998 in summary heterogeneous soil conditions and topography in savanna landscapes will affect the water availability in the soil and thus the abundance and distribution of plant species therefore it will ultimately change the vegetation functional diversity changes in plant functional diversity will clearly entail changes in ecosystem functioning which is defined as the magnitude and dynamics of ecosystem processes determining plant productivity and resource cycling naeem et al 1999 thus unraveling the impact of landscape soil heterogeneity on plant functional diversity can improve our understanding of system level changes for example different soil conditions in the landscape have been found to affect biomass production tamme et al 2016 in addition the assessment of spatial heterogeneity of soils and topography can be used to identify landscapes that are vulnerable to transitions to a less desirable state bestelmeyer et al 2011 the effects of landscape soil heterogeneity on plant diversity and functioning might be modulated by drivers such as precipitation and grazing in savanna ecosystems since different soil parameters e g soil texture and soil depth can interact with those drivers williams et al 1996 fuhlendorf and smeins 1998 for example increased soil clay content in combination with decreased rainfall have been found to reduce the woody species richness and tree cover in australian tropical savannas williams et al 1996 another example is the larger decline of shrub cover on shallow soils than on deep soils during droughts munson 2013 the co occurrence of dominant grasses may be facilitated by spatial difference of habitats caused by soil texture and grazing herbivores in the serengeti savanna anderson et al 2006 increased precipitation shifted the effect of grazing on soil organic carbon from negative to positive on coarser textured soils mcsherry and ritchie 2013 so far many studies of savanna ecosystems assessed the interactive role of precipitation and grazing with single soil parameters however to our knowledge there is no study that considers the effects of landscape soil heterogeneity on plant functional diversity and ecosystem functioning comprehensively and that accounts for its interaction with precipitation and grazing intensity simulation models are a suitable approach to disentangle multiple effects of landscape heterogeneity in drylands some models e g the trigger transfer reserve pulse model ludwig et al 2005 assessed the influence of spatial resource heterogeneity such as water distribution on the biomass production of savanna vegetation other spatially explicit models were built to simulate the emergence of heterogeneous vegetation patterns in drylands rietkerk et al 2004 meron 2011 ursino and callegaro 2016 simulations of patchy vegetation across the landscape were also used to assess vegetation dynamics and productivity caylor and shugart 2004 montaldo et al 2008 however to our knowledge there is no savanna model that explicitly considers the spatial heterogeneity of physical soil properties such as soil texture and soil depth in this study we extended the ecohydrological savanna model ecohyd tietjen et al 2009 2010 lohmann et al 2012 guo et al 2016 lohmann et al 2017 to assess the impact of landscape heterogeneity in terms of soil properties under different precipitation and livestock grazing regimes in semi arid savannas we simulated a functionally diverse plant community and addressed the following questions 1 how does landscape heterogeneity affect plant functional diversity and ecosystem functioning 2 is the impact of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity dependent on the spatial scale of observation 3 how does the effect of landscape heterogeneity interact with precipitation and grazing intensity 2 methods we used an ecohydrological savanna model to simulate the impact of spatial heterogeneity of soils in terms of their depth and texture on savanna vegetation we evaluated plant functional type pft diversity and composition as well as the resulting ecosystem functioning here approximated by vegetation biomass and transpiration that emerged in artificial heterogeneous and homogeneous landscapes for different domestic livestock grazing and precipitation scenarios in the following we describe the simulation model the experimental setup of the simulated landscapes and pfts and how we evaluated the results see fig 1 2 1 model overview we used the process based savanna model ecohyd tietjen et al 2009 2010 lohmann et al 2012 guo et al 2016 lohmann et al 2017 which calculates soil moisture in two layers and the dynamics of vegetation cover and biomass this model has basic hydrological and vegetation processes which are dynamically linked fig 1 and conceptual overview in fig a 1 in appendix a in supplementary material the model has been validated for various sites soil moisture tietjen et al 2009 grass cover tietjen et al 2010 grass biomass and shrub cover lohmann et al 2012 all processes are simulated on a grid cell level with a resolution of 5 by 5 m in this study the landscape comprises 60 by 60 grid cells with a total size of 90 000 m² a detailed description of the hydrological processes which are calculated in hourly to daily time steps can be found in tietjen et al 2009 they include potential evapotranspiration soil evaporation plant transpiration water fluxes in the upper and lower soil layer and water run on and run off on the soil surface the potential evapotranspiration is determined by daily temperature solar radiation and topographical parameters the actual evapotranspiration is separated into soil evaporation of the upper soil layer and plant transpiration guo et al 2016 transpiration of both soil layers is impacted by the actual vegetation in a grid cell and its rooting guo et al 2016 soil hydrological parameters such as soil water potential hydraulic conductivity and field capacity largely control the infiltrative flux between layers tietjen et al 2009 each grid cell receives the same precipitation input but water can be redistributed among cells through run on and run off tietjen et al 2009 vegetation processes tietjen et al 2010 lohmann et al 2012 guo et al 2016 include growth mortality seed dispersal establishment and grazing by domestic livestock in a biweekly to annual temporal resolution plant species are categorized into three broad plant functional types pfts occurring in savanna ecosystems namely shrubs perennial and annual grasses and are further sub divided into sub pfts belonging to one of these pfts lohmann et al 2017 growth of perennial grasses and shrubs is related to the transpirational flux guo et al 2016 growth of annual plants is determined by the availability of space and water and annual grasses exclusively invest into a rooting system in the upper soil layer lohmann et al 2012 all pfts are prone to drought induced mortality tietjen et al 2010 and additional age based mortality for woody plants lohmann et al 2012 dispersal distance of perennial grasses is not assumed to be limited at the simulated spatial scale and establishment depends on top soil water availability tietjen et al 2010 seeds of annual grasses are assumed to be omnipresent but can only germinate and establish if competition is low lohmann et al 2012 in contrast shrub dispersal is limited to the local surrounding of the mother plant tietjen et al 2010 but can be extended by grazing animals lohmann et al 2012 livestock grazing leads to a reduction of plant biomass the selection of fodder plants is determined by the palatability and the distribution and amount of available biomass of each pft lohmann et al 2012 the biomass of each pft is a function of its cover and the rainfall conditions all model processes and the related model parameters are further described in the supplementary materials see appendix a in supplementary material 2 2 landscape heterogeneity we simulated landscape heterogeneity with respect to two properties soil texture and soil depth for this we first constructed nine homogeneous landscapes in a full factorial design with one of three soil textures sand loamy sand and sandy loam that are common in many savannas wilson and witkowski 1998 bestelmeyer et al 2011 and one of three soil depths of the lower soil layer 400 600 and 800 mm with a fixed depth of the upper soil layer 200 mm in terms of soil depth we exclusively changed the depth of the lower soil layer since we were mainly interested in the effect of altered transpiration and not evaporation which we assume to be limited to the upper layer afterwards we constructed the specific heterogeneous landscapes by randomly assigning each set of neighboring 3 by 3 grid cells to one of the nine combinations of soil texture and depth with the same probability for each combination details are provided in appendix a supplementary material the mean slope of the landscape was set to 0 5 in all simulations with local slopes between 0 001 and 12 32 based on tietjen 2016 with the same underlying elevation model for each homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape 2 3 plant functional type assemblage ecohyd assesses the fate of three broad plant functional types pfts namely shrubs perennial grasses and annual grasses called meta pft in the following these meta pfts differ in their life forms woody vs herbaceous plants and their life cycle perennial vs annual but also in some of their processes e g limited dispersal for shrubs vs ubiquity in grass seeds and in their baseline traits grasses for example have a larger potential growth rate and a higher mortality rate than shrubs each meta pft was sub divided into sub pfts with traits that can slightly deviate from the baseline traits of the respective meta pft shrubs and perennial grasses difference in seven plant traits annual grasses difference in five traits following lohmann et al 2017 we first constructed a species pool containing all theoretically possible sub pfts each trait of the sub pfts could take a low a medium and a high value and to enforce trade offs only trait combinations were allowed in which these values were balanced out of this total species pool of 353 sub pfts for perennial and woody species and 51 sub pfts for annual species we determined the two sub pfts one for annual grasses that were most successful i e had the highest cover in a given combination of soil texture and soil depth for low grazing 5 large stock units lsu per 100 ha and moderate mean annual precipitation 500 mm this lead to an optimal species pool of 18 shrub sub pfts 18 perennial grass sub pfts and 9 annual grass sub pfts for a detailed description see appendix a in supplementary material optimal trait combinations were robust and showed clear differences across the soil properties see appendix b in supplementary material for all following simulations all sub pfts of the optimal species pool were initially present the initial distribution of the sub pfts within the landscape followed the same rule for every simulation in order to generate a vegetation matrix of scattered shrubs and abundant perennial grasses within the savanna landscape shrubs were assumed to be present in 20 of the grid cells here called woody cells with a cover of 60 in each woody cell for this one of the 18 shrub sub pfts was randomly assigned to a woody cell in woody cells perennial cover was set to 5 five perennial sub pfts each with a cover of 1 and in non woody cells perennial cover was set to 90 ten perennial sub pfts each with a cover of 9 annual grasses were not initialized because they are assumed to emerge as soon as conditions are appropriate 2 4 grazing and precipitation scenarios we tested the effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity and ecosystem functioning along a rainfall gradient three rainfall scenarios under two scenarios of grazing intensity mean annual rainfall was set to 400 500 and 600 mm using a time series of precipitation generated by the rainfall simulator namrain köchy 2010 grazing intensity was set to low 5 lsu 100 ha and high 8 33 lsu 100 ha the definition and the intensity of livestock grazing were taken from lohmann et al 2012 one large stock unit lsu is defined as a 450 kg live weight cattle meissner 1982 the classification of low and high grazing intensities refer to guo et al 2016 each landscape setting was replicated three times with a different initial distribution of plant functional types and soil conditions for heterogeneous landscapes each scenario of mean annual precipitation was replicated five times leading in total to 15 replicates for each combination of grazing and rainfall 2 5 evaluation of pft diversity and ecosystem functioning all model outcomes were evaluated for the central zone 48 48 grid cells of the overall landscape 60 60 grid cells to exclude border effects through processes such as seed dispersal and lateral water flow see appendix a in supplementary material we evaluated functional diversity of plants by reporting the number of coexisting sub pfts s and the shannon indices for diversity and evenness only those sub pfts were included in the coexistence analysis that are present in at least one grid cell with at least 5 cover within the landscape we chose this threshold to exclude the impact of very rare sub pfts which allowed us to better detect differences in plant coexistence among scenarios to investigate the diversity of sub pfts at different spatial extents we selected different sizes of sampling areas in each landscape scenario the smallest sampling area is composed of 6 by 6 grid cells thus it can include a mixture of soil properties in heterogeneous landscapes we gradually increased the size of the sampling area until we reached the maximum of 48 by 48 grid cells to assess the diversity we first calculated the shannon entropy h eq 1 and then converted it to the shannon diversity d eq 2 and the shannon evenness e eq 3 for each sampling size jost 2006 the diversity indices integrate the occurrence as well as the abundance of coexisting sub pfts spellerberg and fedor 2003 1 h s i z e i 1 45 cover pft i size i 1 45 cover pft i size ln c o v e r p f t i s i z e i 1 45 c o v e r p f t i s i z e 2 d e h s i z e 3 e d s ecosystem functioning was estimated by calculating the biomass and transpiration of the plant community to study the difference in ecosystem functioning between homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes we related the functioning of the heterogeneous landscape to the average functioning of all nine homogeneous landscapes we used the mean value of all the grid cells to present the ecosystem functioning in a given landscape we applied the wilcoxon signed rank test to assess whether landscape heterogeneity significantly affects functional diversity or ecosystem functioning using r software r core team 2013 3 results 3 1 functional diversity in heterogeneous and homogeneous landscapes we found that the number of coexisting sub pfts a proxy of functional richness was very similar among the scenarios of different soil depths see appendix b in supplementary material thus in all subsequent analyses we pooled the results of all soil depths by soil textures to increase the number of replicates for each soil texture scenario by comparing homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes under a low grazing intensity and mean annual precipitation map of 500 mm we found that heterogeneity significantly increased the number of coexisting sub pfts fig 2 a on average nearly 80 of the 45 constructed sub pfts coexisted in heterogeneous landscapes the difference between the number of coexisting sub pfts in homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes was solely driven by the presence or absence of perennial grasses while all 18 shrub sub pfts were present in all landscape settings annual grass sub pfts were rated absent because of their low mean cover the lowest number of sub pfts 21 sub pfts was found in landscapes with sandy loam soils and all of these sub pfts were also present in sandy soils and loamy sand soils fig 2b one sub pft that was exclusively present in sandy soils and four sub pfts were only present in loamy sandy soils sub pfts that were absent in sandy loam soils generally had a relatively low vegetation cover in all repetitions these sub pfts belonged to rare sub pfts in other soil textures all sub pfts that were present in homogeneous landscapes coexisted also in heterogeneous landscapes 3 2 impact of landscape heterogeneity across spatial scales we assessed how the effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity changes with the spatial scale at which the functional diversity is reported fig 3 the shannon diversity increased with an increasing sampling area but this increase leveled off for areas larger than 104 m2 fig 3a the lower the sand content of the soil the lower the shannon diversity and the larger the sampling area had to be to reach the maximal diversity value for sizes of the sampling area at which the shannon diversity was still increasing 103 m2 most homogeneous landscapes showed a higher shannon diversity in contrast heterogeneous landscapes had a higher shannon diversity for larger sampling areas the standard error of the shannon diversity decreased with increasing size of the sampling area except for landscapes with sandy loam soils indicating higher variability in the functional composition of the plant community for small sampling areas the shannon evenness decreased with an increasing sampling area fig 3b until the final level was reached for sampling areas larger than 104 m2 the evenness was highest for sandy loamy soils and lowest for loamy sandy soils in contrast the shannon diversity was similar for both soil textures in large sampling areas the standard error of the shannon evenness was not impacted by the sampling areas 3 3 effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity under different environmental conditions the impact of landscape heterogeneity on the functional diversity differed along the gradients of mean annual precipitation and grazing intensity fig 4 at low grazing intensity landscape heterogeneity led to a significantly higher number of coexisting sub pfts at precipitation levels of 400 and 500 mm a but not for 600 mm a with the exception of sandy loam soils this was in contrast with the effects of landscape heterogeneity under high grazing intensity here heterogeneity led to lower or similar diversity compared to homogeneous landscapes for landscapes with sandy soils or loamy sand soils but not for sandy loamy soils for which diversity increased in the heterogeneous case for map 500 mm as for the above described special case of intermediate rainfall and grazing intensity the differences in coexistence were driven solely by the presence of perennial grasses along the rainfall gradient under two grazing intensities all shrub sub pfts were present in all settings while all annuals were absent generally higher rainfall and lower grazing led to higher diversity in perennial sub pfts 3 4 effect of landscape heterogeneity on ecosystem functioning in addition to the number of coexisting sub pfts landscape heterogeneity impacted ecosystem functioning here measured as biomass and transpiration the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the total community biomass as well as on the total community transpiration depended on mean annual precipitation and grazing intensity fig 5 for all environmental conditions landscape heterogeneity increased total community biomass however the magnitude did not show a clear pattern the only significant and biggest relative increases in biomass were found for a map of 400 mm and low grazing as well as for a map of 500 mm and high grazing pressure despite higher biomass plant transpiration was lower for 400 mm map significantly only for low grazing pressure for a map of 500 mm transpiration was slightly but non significantly higher and we did not observe a change in transpiration for 600 mm of rainfall 4 discussion in this study we used an ecohydrological model to simulate the fate of multiple plant functional types in semi arid savannas our goal was to assess the effects of landscape heterogeneity in terms of soil texture and depth on vegetation functional diversity and ecosystem functioning in summary we did not observe an effect of heterogeneous soil depths in contrast soil texture clearly impacted functional diversity and partly also ecosystem functioning simulation results showed that heterogeneous landscapes sustained a higher functional diversity for low livestock grazing intensity and under more arid conditions but not for higher grazing intensity or more humid conditions also the impact of landscape heterogeneity on total biomass and total transpiration depended on the mean annual precipitation and grazing intensity in addition we found that a minimum size of the sampling area was required to observe a positive effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity in the following we will discuss these findings in more detail 4 1 effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity in our simulation experiments we exclusively changed the soil depth of the lower layer and not the upper layer and did not find a significant effect on plant coexistence since the simulated relative soil moisture was generally very low in the lower soil shrubs and perennial grasses with longer roots benefited less from a deeper soil depth therefore a change in the lower soil depth did not result in altered plant diversity in contrast to soil depth soil texture and its heterogeneity strongly affected plant coexistence soil texture influences most soil hydrological parameters such as wilting point water potential and hydraulic conductivity maidment 1992 because of their impact on soil water availability these parameters also indirectly affect vegetation processes such as plant growth mortality and seed establishment empirical studies also show that soil texture has a strong filtering effect on plant functional traits kos et al 2012 liu et al 2013 plants in water limited environments potentially have longer roots in coarser textured soils because such soil types hardly hold water which means a stronger infiltration into deeper layers schenk and jackson 2002 our results show that landscapes with heterogeneous soil conditions hosted more plant functional types in a given community than landscapes with homogeneous soil conditions this is in line with empirical studies deutschewitz et al 2003 kumar et al 2006 lundholm 2009 and theoretical expectations kneitel and chase 2004 melbourne et al 2007 the reason for this finding is that heterogeneous edaphic properties provide more diverse conditions for plants and can thus host more diverse plants with specialized traits we found that all simulated shrub sub pfts coexisted regardless of the landscape type this is likely caused by the initial patchy distribution of shrubs which seem to survive independent of the soil texture and cannot outcompete other shrubs in contrast annual grasses were absent in all landscape settings the reason is that the mean total cover of annual grass over time was very low since annual grass species appear only in years with high rainfall in landscapes holding very low cover of perennial species the survival strategy of annual grasses is mostly associated with their larger reproductive efforts veenendaal et al 1996 in arid or semi arid savanna landscapes annual grass species are particularly abundant in large open spaces where perennial grasses do not dominate the plant community in areas where perennial species dominate the plant community they outcompete annuals for resources and space lauenroth and adler 2008 since annuals normally have a limited rooting depth and are therefore very limited in the access to water in deeper soil layers schenk and jackson 2002 our finding indicated that annual grasses only occurred when the perennial cover was very low see fig b 3 in the appendix b in supplementary material which matches the observations in real savanna landscapes hence in non degraded savannas the role of annual grasses to understand long term trends in vegetation dynamics is likely rather subordinate in the following our discussion will therefore focus on changes in perennial grass diversity generally high precipitation led to higher coexistence of perennial grasses while high grazing decreased the diversity of perennial grasses which is consistent with empirical findings busso et al 2004 adler and levine 2007 in addition our results clearly show that the interactions between grazing intensity and precipitation modulated the effects of landscape heterogeneity perennial grass coexistence was higher in heterogeneous landscapes than in homogeneous landscapes under low but not under high grazing stress exception sandy loamy soils with a generally low diversity the reason for this contrasting effect is that high grazing strongly decreased total plant biomass and created more empty space for plants to colonize therefore inter specific competition decreased plants with traits like a high water uptake rate or a low mortality did not benefit from landscape diversification for low rainfall the impact of landscape heterogeneity was stronger than under high rainfall the reason might be that under more humid conditions water availability is generally higher and therefore differences among soil textures become less important tietjen 2016 generally we found that a higher sand content sandy soil and loamy sandy soil led to higher plant diversity than sandy loamy soils with its lower infiltration capacity empirical findings from australian tropical savannas show similar effects where an increase in soil clay content reduces woody species richness williams et al 1996 4 2 the response of ecosystem functioning to landscape heterogeneity a higher functional diversity has been found to increase ecosystem functioning across many biomes including drylands maestre et al 2012 valencia et al 2015 our results showed a similar response in the change of two indicators of ecosystem functioning i e biomass and transpiration to landscape heterogeneity however higher functional diversity induced by landscape heterogeneity did not always increase the functioning one reason for this divergence is that our approach is not directly comparable to existing studies on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in our study we tested the effects of heterogeneous environmental conditions such as soil type precipitation and grazing pressure separately whereas empirical studies tend to aggregate this environmental information e g experimental studies tilman et al 1997 our results suggest that changes in ecosystem functioning may not be solely driven by vegetation functional diversity but also by other factors our mechanistic approach allows us to identify these factors we found a higher community biomass in heterogeneous landscapes under dry conditions the biomass increased is the result of higher shrub cover in heterogeneous landscapes under water limited conditions more details see appendix b in supplementary material which exhibit a larger biomass density than herbaceous plants a reason for the higher shrub cover is the increased lateral water redistribution which is caused by the spatial heterogeneity in soil properties water is redistributed from grid cells with a higher loam content with a low infiltration capacity to grid cells with higher sand content this increases the local water availability leading to more favorable conditions for shrubs more details see appendix b in supplementary material in arid landscapes heterogeneous distribution of resources typically leads to heterogeneous vegetation patterns with mosaics of bare patches and vegetated patches meron et al 2004 rietkerk et al 2004 this has been found to increase net primary production as in our study since water can be more efficiently used by plants ludwig et al 1999 the effect of heterogeneity on biomass levelled off in scenarios with a high rainfall since water availability is generally higher and water redistribution therefore less important surprisingly for arid conditions we found that transpiration was lower in the heterogeneous landscapes although plant biomass was higher that is a higher amount of biomass was sustained by less water this is caused by a shift in the fraction of community biomass from perennial grasses towards shrubs woody plants tend to have a high fraction of inactive biomass that does not transpire pallardy 2010 that is a vast amount of woody biomass is produced by a low fraction of transpiring leaf area in addition our results indicated a higher water use efficiency in heterogeneous landscapes where less water per unit biomass growth is transpired compared to homogeneous landscapes this has also been shown in empirical work in arid landscapes ludwig et al 1999 4 3 the role of landscape heterogeneity spatial scale matters literature indicates that the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and plant diversity positively relates to the spatial scale stein et al 2014 our simulation experiments showed the same relationship for the shannon diversity dependent on the scale of observation we found a negative effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity at small scales 103 m2 but a positive effect at a larger scale a large area containing heterogeneous soil conditions includes more different soil textures leading to a higher number of ecological niches and random effects of the soil conditions are less likely for small areas random effects are less important for homogeneous landscapes leading to a higher functional diversity of these landscapes at small scales the change in functional diversity with increasing spatial scale was similar for all landscape settings after a strong increase in diversity at a small scale the increase leveled off which is well in agreement with the species area relationship east 1981 ibáñez et al 2006 the reason is that a larger landscape includes diverse habitat types such as patches with very low or very high vegetation cover while patches with low cover favor fast growing and less competitive species patches with high cover contain more species with a high competitive ability grime 2001 leading overall to a higher functional diversity while the shannon diversity increased with sampling area the shannon evenness decreased for all landscapes settings the reason for this is the higher probability to capture rare species in a large area than in a small area especially these rare species lead to a decrease in the shannon evenness since sandy loamy soils did not host rare species their overall evenness was significantly higher than for landscapes including loamy sandy or sandy areas 4 4 limitations of our approach and further research heterogeneity in general has been found to be positively related to vegetation biodiversity across biomes questad and foster 2008 stein et al 2014 however little is known on the effect of heterogeneity on plant diversity in drylands and even less on the specific effect of soil heterogeneity given the large number of livelihoods that depend on livestock production in drylands reynolds et al 2007 and the potential of biodiversity as a mechanism to increase the resilience of fodder production mcnaughton 1994 more knowledge is needed our study made an initial contribution by showing that soil heterogeneity potentially increased plant diversity but that the effect depended on other important drivers of savanna vegetation which provides a mechanistic understanding of the interactions of spatial soil heterogeneity with climatic conditions or land management we chose a rather simplified representation of soil heterogeneity i e different soil types in grid cells that are scattered randomly across the landscape the heterogeneity of soil types leads to a patchy availability of the water resource which is a main limiting factor of plant growth in semi arid savannas walker et al 1981 follow up studies should also account for patchiness in nutrient availability since this can also play an essential role in driving vegetation dynamics in savanna landscapes wang et al 2009 but is currently not implemented in ecohyd the simulated landscapes did not account for spatial correlation between soil types or the relative proportion of different soil types within the landscape the exact spatial configuration might for example additionally affect the recruitment success of dispersal limited plants such as woody plant species joubert et al 2008 since the local soil conditions around a mother plant might not be suitable for plant establishment currently essential information on the spatial configuration of soil properties in savanna landscapes is missing recent technological developments such as remote sensing to map sand silt and clay soils could be used for future studies mulder et al 2011 but also aggregated information could be used to parameterize landscape generators pausas and lepš 2003 for running multiple non site specific simulations allowing for general conclusions on soil heterogeneity effects on species coexistence or ecosystem functioning 5 conclusion our results clearly show that landscape heterogeneity is an important factor driving savanna vegetation it interacts with other factors such as precipitation and livestock grazing that have received more attention so far our approach of process based modeling allows us to simulate multiple interacting drivers that simultaneously affect hydrological and vegetation processes this further highlights the role of process based models as a useful tool to study the complex savanna biome in addition we could show that soil conditions in savannas and their spatial configuration can be essential current threats to vegetation biodiversity and ecosystem service provision in savannas such as reduced precipitation through climate change or overgrazing will leave some regions more vulnerable than others because of their predetermined environmental conditions thus to optimize conservation efforts we need to study which regions require more effort respectively in which locations management interventions have the potential to succeed and where they may be overridden by the predetermined natural conditions author

25287,1 savanna systems exhibit a high plant functional diversity while aridity and livestock grazing intensity have been widely discussed as drivers of savanna vegetation composition physical soil properties have received less attention since savannas can show local differences in soil properties these might act as environmental filters and affect plant diversity and ecosystem functioning at the patch scale however research on the link between savanna vegetation diversity and ecosystem function is widely missing 2 in this study we aim at understanding the impact of local heterogeneity in soil conditions on plant diversity and on ecosystem functions for this we used the ecohydrological savanna model ecohyd the model simulates the fate of multiple plant functional types and their interactions with local biotic and abiotic conditions we applied the model to a set of different landscapes under a wide range of livestock grazing and precipitation scenarios to assess the impact of local heterogeneity in soil conditions on the composition and diversity of plant functional types and on ecosystem functions 3 comparisons between homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes revealed that landscape soil heterogeneity allowed for a higher functional diversity of vegetation under conditions of high competition i e scenarios of low grazing stress however landscape heterogeneity did not have this effect under low grazing stress in combination with high mean annual precipitation further landscape heterogeneity led to a higher community biomass especially for lower rainfall conditions but also dependent on grazing stress total transpiration of the plant community decreased in heterogeneous landscapes under arid conditions 4 this study highlights that local soil conditions interact with precipitation and grazing in driving savanna vegetation it clearly shows that vegetation diversity and resulting ecosystem functioning can be driven by landscape heterogeneity we therefore suggest that future research on ecosystem functioning of savanna systems should focus on the links between local environmental conditions via plant functional diversity to ecosystem functioning abbreviations pft plant functional type map mean annual precipitation lsu large stock units keywords plant functional type trait diversity ecosystem functioning plant coexistence soil texture ecohydrological model 1 introduction savannas cover approximately 20 of the global land surface and account for 30 of the terrestrial net primary production sankaran et al 2005 grace et al 2006 they can be found in regions with a rather limited water availability and highly variable annual precipitation d onofrio et al 2015 savanna are characterized by a matrix of abundant perennial grasses and scattered woody plants scholes and archer 1997 locally plant coverage and species composition vary strongly asner et al 1998 augustine 2003 as a result savanna vegetation exhibits a high functional diversity cowling et al 1994 busso et al 2001 kos and poschlod 2010 batalha et al 2011 the high temporal and spatial variability of environmental conditions in savannas is assumed to be a major driver for this high functional diversity because it enables the coexistence of plants with different strategies for example high intense precipitation events can lead to deep soil infiltration which facilitates woody plants with a deeper rooting system in contrast less intense precipitation events benefit species with a shallow rooting system walter 1954 accordingly if mean annual precipitation increases vegetation composition will shift towards more woody plant cover sankaran et al 2005 livestock grazing is another important factor affecting vegetation distribution and diversity adler et al 2001 it can increase the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation leading to long term changes in the community composition in savannas the shrub encroachment rate has been found to be very sensitive to grazing patterns weber et al 1998 while moderate level grazing intensity can increase vegetation diversity by creating mosaics of microhabitats oba et al 2001 high intensity of livestock grazing and browsing can cause a decline in plant diversity as it reduces the abundance and the biomass of most plant species mysterud 2006 another key factor for vegetation diversity in savannas is landscape heterogeneity san jose et al 1998 augustine 2003 in this context we define heterogeneous landscapes as a mosaic of patches of different soil properties leading to different pattern in soil water content which is the main limiting resource for plant growth in savanna systems walker et al 1981 landscape heterogeneity can act as a buffer mechanism against adverse environmental conditions jeltsch et al 2000 through the provision of refuge sites in addition it can create a high number of ecological niches hosting a more diverse plant species assemblage than homogeneous landscapes stein et al 2014 empirical studies and remote sensing data reveal that savanna landscapes show a high spatial variability in topography wu and archer 2005 and soil conditions williams et al 1996 fuhlendorf and smeins 1998 bestelmeyer et al 2009 2011 zhou et al 2017 such as soil texture and soil depth however the impacts of this spatial heterogeneity on vegetation cover and composition have so far received very little attention in the savanna ecology literature in general and in modeling studies in particular although differences in soil conditions can have multiple effects on vegetation soil texture results from the fraction of soil particle sizes and determines major physical properties of the soil that control hydrological processes by impacting infiltration and water holding capacity it determines plant water availability fernandez illescas et al 2001 coarse textured soils such as sand facilitate water infiltration into deeper soil layers mcclaran and van devender 1997 thus increasing the water availability for deep rooted plants soil depth determines the vertical water distribution as well as space that is available for rooting and thus determines the amount of water available for plant growth peterman et al 2014 landscape topography mainly influences lateral water fluxes by runoff and soil erosion tietjen 2016 but also influences spatial evapotranspiration patterns through local differences in radiation liu et al 2012 this impacts the surface water budget and vegetation patterns at different spatial scales bergkamp 1998 in summary heterogeneous soil conditions and topography in savanna landscapes will affect the water availability in the soil and thus the abundance and distribution of plant species therefore it will ultimately change the vegetation functional diversity changes in plant functional diversity will clearly entail changes in ecosystem functioning which is defined as the magnitude and dynamics of ecosystem processes determining plant productivity and resource cycling naeem et al 1999 thus unraveling the impact of landscape soil heterogeneity on plant functional diversity can improve our understanding of system level changes for example different soil conditions in the landscape have been found to affect biomass production tamme et al 2016 in addition the assessment of spatial heterogeneity of soils and topography can be used to identify landscapes that are vulnerable to transitions to a less desirable state bestelmeyer et al 2011 the effects of landscape soil heterogeneity on plant diversity and functioning might be modulated by drivers such as precipitation and grazing in savanna ecosystems since different soil parameters e g soil texture and soil depth can interact with those drivers williams et al 1996 fuhlendorf and smeins 1998 for example increased soil clay content in combination with decreased rainfall have been found to reduce the woody species richness and tree cover in australian tropical savannas williams et al 1996 another example is the larger decline of shrub cover on shallow soils than on deep soils during droughts munson 2013 the co occurrence of dominant grasses may be facilitated by spatial difference of habitats caused by soil texture and grazing herbivores in the serengeti savanna anderson et al 2006 increased precipitation shifted the effect of grazing on soil organic carbon from negative to positive on coarser textured soils mcsherry and ritchie 2013 so far many studies of savanna ecosystems assessed the interactive role of precipitation and grazing with single soil parameters however to our knowledge there is no study that considers the effects of landscape soil heterogeneity on plant functional diversity and ecosystem functioning comprehensively and that accounts for its interaction with precipitation and grazing intensity simulation models are a suitable approach to disentangle multiple effects of landscape heterogeneity in drylands some models e g the trigger transfer reserve pulse model ludwig et al 2005 assessed the influence of spatial resource heterogeneity such as water distribution on the biomass production of savanna vegetation other spatially explicit models were built to simulate the emergence of heterogeneous vegetation patterns in drylands rietkerk et al 2004 meron 2011 ursino and callegaro 2016 simulations of patchy vegetation across the landscape were also used to assess vegetation dynamics and productivity caylor and shugart 2004 montaldo et al 2008 however to our knowledge there is no savanna model that explicitly considers the spatial heterogeneity of physical soil properties such as soil texture and soil depth in this study we extended the ecohydrological savanna model ecohyd tietjen et al 2009 2010 lohmann et al 2012 guo et al 2016 lohmann et al 2017 to assess the impact of landscape heterogeneity in terms of soil properties under different precipitation and livestock grazing regimes in semi arid savannas we simulated a functionally diverse plant community and addressed the following questions 1 how does landscape heterogeneity affect plant functional diversity and ecosystem functioning 2 is the impact of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity dependent on the spatial scale of observation 3 how does the effect of landscape heterogeneity interact with precipitation and grazing intensity 2 methods we used an ecohydrological savanna model to simulate the impact of spatial heterogeneity of soils in terms of their depth and texture on savanna vegetation we evaluated plant functional type pft diversity and composition as well as the resulting ecosystem functioning here approximated by vegetation biomass and transpiration that emerged in artificial heterogeneous and homogeneous landscapes for different domestic livestock grazing and precipitation scenarios in the following we describe the simulation model the experimental setup of the simulated landscapes and pfts and how we evaluated the results see fig 1 2 1 model overview we used the process based savanna model ecohyd tietjen et al 2009 2010 lohmann et al 2012 guo et al 2016 lohmann et al 2017 which calculates soil moisture in two layers and the dynamics of vegetation cover and biomass this model has basic hydrological and vegetation processes which are dynamically linked fig 1 and conceptual overview in fig a 1 in appendix a in supplementary material the model has been validated for various sites soil moisture tietjen et al 2009 grass cover tietjen et al 2010 grass biomass and shrub cover lohmann et al 2012 all processes are simulated on a grid cell level with a resolution of 5 by 5 m in this study the landscape comprises 60 by 60 grid cells with a total size of 90 000 m² a detailed description of the hydrological processes which are calculated in hourly to daily time steps can be found in tietjen et al 2009 they include potential evapotranspiration soil evaporation plant transpiration water fluxes in the upper and lower soil layer and water run on and run off on the soil surface the potential evapotranspiration is determined by daily temperature solar radiation and topographical parameters the actual evapotranspiration is separated into soil evaporation of the upper soil layer and plant transpiration guo et al 2016 transpiration of both soil layers is impacted by the actual vegetation in a grid cell and its rooting guo et al 2016 soil hydrological parameters such as soil water potential hydraulic conductivity and field capacity largely control the infiltrative flux between layers tietjen et al 2009 each grid cell receives the same precipitation input but water can be redistributed among cells through run on and run off tietjen et al 2009 vegetation processes tietjen et al 2010 lohmann et al 2012 guo et al 2016 include growth mortality seed dispersal establishment and grazing by domestic livestock in a biweekly to annual temporal resolution plant species are categorized into three broad plant functional types pfts occurring in savanna ecosystems namely shrubs perennial and annual grasses and are further sub divided into sub pfts belonging to one of these pfts lohmann et al 2017 growth of perennial grasses and shrubs is related to the transpirational flux guo et al 2016 growth of annual plants is determined by the availability of space and water and annual grasses exclusively invest into a rooting system in the upper soil layer lohmann et al 2012 all pfts are prone to drought induced mortality tietjen et al 2010 and additional age based mortality for woody plants lohmann et al 2012 dispersal distance of perennial grasses is not assumed to be limited at the simulated spatial scale and establishment depends on top soil water availability tietjen et al 2010 seeds of annual grasses are assumed to be omnipresent but can only germinate and establish if competition is low lohmann et al 2012 in contrast shrub dispersal is limited to the local surrounding of the mother plant tietjen et al 2010 but can be extended by grazing animals lohmann et al 2012 livestock grazing leads to a reduction of plant biomass the selection of fodder plants is determined by the palatability and the distribution and amount of available biomass of each pft lohmann et al 2012 the biomass of each pft is a function of its cover and the rainfall conditions all model processes and the related model parameters are further described in the supplementary materials see appendix a in supplementary material 2 2 landscape heterogeneity we simulated landscape heterogeneity with respect to two properties soil texture and soil depth for this we first constructed nine homogeneous landscapes in a full factorial design with one of three soil textures sand loamy sand and sandy loam that are common in many savannas wilson and witkowski 1998 bestelmeyer et al 2011 and one of three soil depths of the lower soil layer 400 600 and 800 mm with a fixed depth of the upper soil layer 200 mm in terms of soil depth we exclusively changed the depth of the lower soil layer since we were mainly interested in the effect of altered transpiration and not evaporation which we assume to be limited to the upper layer afterwards we constructed the specific heterogeneous landscapes by randomly assigning each set of neighboring 3 by 3 grid cells to one of the nine combinations of soil texture and depth with the same probability for each combination details are provided in appendix a supplementary material the mean slope of the landscape was set to 0 5 in all simulations with local slopes between 0 001 and 12 32 based on tietjen 2016 with the same underlying elevation model for each homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape 2 3 plant functional type assemblage ecohyd assesses the fate of three broad plant functional types pfts namely shrubs perennial grasses and annual grasses called meta pft in the following these meta pfts differ in their life forms woody vs herbaceous plants and their life cycle perennial vs annual but also in some of their processes e g limited dispersal for shrubs vs ubiquity in grass seeds and in their baseline traits grasses for example have a larger potential growth rate and a higher mortality rate than shrubs each meta pft was sub divided into sub pfts with traits that can slightly deviate from the baseline traits of the respective meta pft shrubs and perennial grasses difference in seven plant traits annual grasses difference in five traits following lohmann et al 2017 we first constructed a species pool containing all theoretically possible sub pfts each trait of the sub pfts could take a low a medium and a high value and to enforce trade offs only trait combinations were allowed in which these values were balanced out of this total species pool of 353 sub pfts for perennial and woody species and 51 sub pfts for annual species we determined the two sub pfts one for annual grasses that were most successful i e had the highest cover in a given combination of soil texture and soil depth for low grazing 5 large stock units lsu per 100 ha and moderate mean annual precipitation 500 mm this lead to an optimal species pool of 18 shrub sub pfts 18 perennial grass sub pfts and 9 annual grass sub pfts for a detailed description see appendix a in supplementary material optimal trait combinations were robust and showed clear differences across the soil properties see appendix b in supplementary material for all following simulations all sub pfts of the optimal species pool were initially present the initial distribution of the sub pfts within the landscape followed the same rule for every simulation in order to generate a vegetation matrix of scattered shrubs and abundant perennial grasses within the savanna landscape shrubs were assumed to be present in 20 of the grid cells here called woody cells with a cover of 60 in each woody cell for this one of the 18 shrub sub pfts was randomly assigned to a woody cell in woody cells perennial cover was set to 5 five perennial sub pfts each with a cover of 1 and in non woody cells perennial cover was set to 90 ten perennial sub pfts each with a cover of 9 annual grasses were not initialized because they are assumed to emerge as soon as conditions are appropriate 2 4 grazing and precipitation scenarios we tested the effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity and ecosystem functioning along a rainfall gradient three rainfall scenarios under two scenarios of grazing intensity mean annual rainfall was set to 400 500 and 600 mm using a time series of precipitation generated by the rainfall simulator namrain köchy 2010 grazing intensity was set to low 5 lsu 100 ha and high 8 33 lsu 100 ha the definition and the intensity of livestock grazing were taken from lohmann et al 2012 one large stock unit lsu is defined as a 450 kg live weight cattle meissner 1982 the classification of low and high grazing intensities refer to guo et al 2016 each landscape setting was replicated three times with a different initial distribution of plant functional types and soil conditions for heterogeneous landscapes each scenario of mean annual precipitation was replicated five times leading in total to 15 replicates for each combination of grazing and rainfall 2 5 evaluation of pft diversity and ecosystem functioning all model outcomes were evaluated for the central zone 48 48 grid cells of the overall landscape 60 60 grid cells to exclude border effects through processes such as seed dispersal and lateral water flow see appendix a in supplementary material we evaluated functional diversity of plants by reporting the number of coexisting sub pfts s and the shannon indices for diversity and evenness only those sub pfts were included in the coexistence analysis that are present in at least one grid cell with at least 5 cover within the landscape we chose this threshold to exclude the impact of very rare sub pfts which allowed us to better detect differences in plant coexistence among scenarios to investigate the diversity of sub pfts at different spatial extents we selected different sizes of sampling areas in each landscape scenario the smallest sampling area is composed of 6 by 6 grid cells thus it can include a mixture of soil properties in heterogeneous landscapes we gradually increased the size of the sampling area until we reached the maximum of 48 by 48 grid cells to assess the diversity we first calculated the shannon entropy h eq 1 and then converted it to the shannon diversity d eq 2 and the shannon evenness e eq 3 for each sampling size jost 2006 the diversity indices integrate the occurrence as well as the abundance of coexisting sub pfts spellerberg and fedor 2003 1 h s i z e i 1 45 cover pft i size i 1 45 cover pft i size ln c o v e r p f t i s i z e i 1 45 c o v e r p f t i s i z e 2 d e h s i z e 3 e d s ecosystem functioning was estimated by calculating the biomass and transpiration of the plant community to study the difference in ecosystem functioning between homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes we related the functioning of the heterogeneous landscape to the average functioning of all nine homogeneous landscapes we used the mean value of all the grid cells to present the ecosystem functioning in a given landscape we applied the wilcoxon signed rank test to assess whether landscape heterogeneity significantly affects functional diversity or ecosystem functioning using r software r core team 2013 3 results 3 1 functional diversity in heterogeneous and homogeneous landscapes we found that the number of coexisting sub pfts a proxy of functional richness was very similar among the scenarios of different soil depths see appendix b in supplementary material thus in all subsequent analyses we pooled the results of all soil depths by soil textures to increase the number of replicates for each soil texture scenario by comparing homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes under a low grazing intensity and mean annual precipitation map of 500 mm we found that heterogeneity significantly increased the number of coexisting sub pfts fig 2 a on average nearly 80 of the 45 constructed sub pfts coexisted in heterogeneous landscapes the difference between the number of coexisting sub pfts in homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes was solely driven by the presence or absence of perennial grasses while all 18 shrub sub pfts were present in all landscape settings annual grass sub pfts were rated absent because of their low mean cover the lowest number of sub pfts 21 sub pfts was found in landscapes with sandy loam soils and all of these sub pfts were also present in sandy soils and loamy sand soils fig 2b one sub pft that was exclusively present in sandy soils and four sub pfts were only present in loamy sandy soils sub pfts that were absent in sandy loam soils generally had a relatively low vegetation cover in all repetitions these sub pfts belonged to rare sub pfts in other soil textures all sub pfts that were present in homogeneous landscapes coexisted also in heterogeneous landscapes 3 2 impact of landscape heterogeneity across spatial scales we assessed how the effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity changes with the spatial scale at which the functional diversity is reported fig 3 the shannon diversity increased with an increasing sampling area but this increase leveled off for areas larger than 104 m2 fig 3a the lower the sand content of the soil the lower the shannon diversity and the larger the sampling area had to be to reach the maximal diversity value for sizes of the sampling area at which the shannon diversity was still increasing 103 m2 most homogeneous landscapes showed a higher shannon diversity in contrast heterogeneous landscapes had a higher shannon diversity for larger sampling areas the standard error of the shannon diversity decreased with increasing size of the sampling area except for landscapes with sandy loam soils indicating higher variability in the functional composition of the plant community for small sampling areas the shannon evenness decreased with an increasing sampling area fig 3b until the final level was reached for sampling areas larger than 104 m2 the evenness was highest for sandy loamy soils and lowest for loamy sandy soils in contrast the shannon diversity was similar for both soil textures in large sampling areas the standard error of the shannon evenness was not impacted by the sampling areas 3 3 effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity under different environmental conditions the impact of landscape heterogeneity on the functional diversity differed along the gradients of mean annual precipitation and grazing intensity fig 4 at low grazing intensity landscape heterogeneity led to a significantly higher number of coexisting sub pfts at precipitation levels of 400 and 500 mm a but not for 600 mm a with the exception of sandy loam soils this was in contrast with the effects of landscape heterogeneity under high grazing intensity here heterogeneity led to lower or similar diversity compared to homogeneous landscapes for landscapes with sandy soils or loamy sand soils but not for sandy loamy soils for which diversity increased in the heterogeneous case for map 500 mm as for the above described special case of intermediate rainfall and grazing intensity the differences in coexistence were driven solely by the presence of perennial grasses along the rainfall gradient under two grazing intensities all shrub sub pfts were present in all settings while all annuals were absent generally higher rainfall and lower grazing led to higher diversity in perennial sub pfts 3 4 effect of landscape heterogeneity on ecosystem functioning in addition to the number of coexisting sub pfts landscape heterogeneity impacted ecosystem functioning here measured as biomass and transpiration the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the total community biomass as well as on the total community transpiration depended on mean annual precipitation and grazing intensity fig 5 for all environmental conditions landscape heterogeneity increased total community biomass however the magnitude did not show a clear pattern the only significant and biggest relative increases in biomass were found for a map of 400 mm and low grazing as well as for a map of 500 mm and high grazing pressure despite higher biomass plant transpiration was lower for 400 mm map significantly only for low grazing pressure for a map of 500 mm transpiration was slightly but non significantly higher and we did not observe a change in transpiration for 600 mm of rainfall 4 discussion in this study we used an ecohydrological model to simulate the fate of multiple plant functional types in semi arid savannas our goal was to assess the effects of landscape heterogeneity in terms of soil texture and depth on vegetation functional diversity and ecosystem functioning in summary we did not observe an effect of heterogeneous soil depths in contrast soil texture clearly impacted functional diversity and partly also ecosystem functioning simulation results showed that heterogeneous landscapes sustained a higher functional diversity for low livestock grazing intensity and under more arid conditions but not for higher grazing intensity or more humid conditions also the impact of landscape heterogeneity on total biomass and total transpiration depended on the mean annual precipitation and grazing intensity in addition we found that a minimum size of the sampling area was required to observe a positive effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity in the following we will discuss these findings in more detail 4 1 effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity in our simulation experiments we exclusively changed the soil depth of the lower layer and not the upper layer and did not find a significant effect on plant coexistence since the simulated relative soil moisture was generally very low in the lower soil shrubs and perennial grasses with longer roots benefited less from a deeper soil depth therefore a change in the lower soil depth did not result in altered plant diversity in contrast to soil depth soil texture and its heterogeneity strongly affected plant coexistence soil texture influences most soil hydrological parameters such as wilting point water potential and hydraulic conductivity maidment 1992 because of their impact on soil water availability these parameters also indirectly affect vegetation processes such as plant growth mortality and seed establishment empirical studies also show that soil texture has a strong filtering effect on plant functional traits kos et al 2012 liu et al 2013 plants in water limited environments potentially have longer roots in coarser textured soils because such soil types hardly hold water which means a stronger infiltration into deeper layers schenk and jackson 2002 our results show that landscapes with heterogeneous soil conditions hosted more plant functional types in a given community than landscapes with homogeneous soil conditions this is in line with empirical studies deutschewitz et al 2003 kumar et al 2006 lundholm 2009 and theoretical expectations kneitel and chase 2004 melbourne et al 2007 the reason for this finding is that heterogeneous edaphic properties provide more diverse conditions for plants and can thus host more diverse plants with specialized traits we found that all simulated shrub sub pfts coexisted regardless of the landscape type this is likely caused by the initial patchy distribution of shrubs which seem to survive independent of the soil texture and cannot outcompete other shrubs in contrast annual grasses were absent in all landscape settings the reason is that the mean total cover of annual grass over time was very low since annual grass species appear only in years with high rainfall in landscapes holding very low cover of perennial species the survival strategy of annual grasses is mostly associated with their larger reproductive efforts veenendaal et al 1996 in arid or semi arid savanna landscapes annual grass species are particularly abundant in large open spaces where perennial grasses do not dominate the plant community in areas where perennial species dominate the plant community they outcompete annuals for resources and space lauenroth and adler 2008 since annuals normally have a limited rooting depth and are therefore very limited in the access to water in deeper soil layers schenk and jackson 2002 our finding indicated that annual grasses only occurred when the perennial cover was very low see fig b 3 in the appendix b in supplementary material which matches the observations in real savanna landscapes hence in non degraded savannas the role of annual grasses to understand long term trends in vegetation dynamics is likely rather subordinate in the following our discussion will therefore focus on changes in perennial grass diversity generally high precipitation led to higher coexistence of perennial grasses while high grazing decreased the diversity of perennial grasses which is consistent with empirical findings busso et al 2004 adler and levine 2007 in addition our results clearly show that the interactions between grazing intensity and precipitation modulated the effects of landscape heterogeneity perennial grass coexistence was higher in heterogeneous landscapes than in homogeneous landscapes under low but not under high grazing stress exception sandy loamy soils with a generally low diversity the reason for this contrasting effect is that high grazing strongly decreased total plant biomass and created more empty space for plants to colonize therefore inter specific competition decreased plants with traits like a high water uptake rate or a low mortality did not benefit from landscape diversification for low rainfall the impact of landscape heterogeneity was stronger than under high rainfall the reason might be that under more humid conditions water availability is generally higher and therefore differences among soil textures become less important tietjen 2016 generally we found that a higher sand content sandy soil and loamy sandy soil led to higher plant diversity than sandy loamy soils with its lower infiltration capacity empirical findings from australian tropical savannas show similar effects where an increase in soil clay content reduces woody species richness williams et al 1996 4 2 the response of ecosystem functioning to landscape heterogeneity a higher functional diversity has been found to increase ecosystem functioning across many biomes including drylands maestre et al 2012 valencia et al 2015 our results showed a similar response in the change of two indicators of ecosystem functioning i e biomass and transpiration to landscape heterogeneity however higher functional diversity induced by landscape heterogeneity did not always increase the functioning one reason for this divergence is that our approach is not directly comparable to existing studies on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in our study we tested the effects of heterogeneous environmental conditions such as soil type precipitation and grazing pressure separately whereas empirical studies tend to aggregate this environmental information e g experimental studies tilman et al 1997 our results suggest that changes in ecosystem functioning may not be solely driven by vegetation functional diversity but also by other factors our mechanistic approach allows us to identify these factors we found a higher community biomass in heterogeneous landscapes under dry conditions the biomass increased is the result of higher shrub cover in heterogeneous landscapes under water limited conditions more details see appendix b in supplementary material which exhibit a larger biomass density than herbaceous plants a reason for the higher shrub cover is the increased lateral water redistribution which is caused by the spatial heterogeneity in soil properties water is redistributed from grid cells with a higher loam content with a low infiltration capacity to grid cells with higher sand content this increases the local water availability leading to more favorable conditions for shrubs more details see appendix b in supplementary material in arid landscapes heterogeneous distribution of resources typically leads to heterogeneous vegetation patterns with mosaics of bare patches and vegetated patches meron et al 2004 rietkerk et al 2004 this has been found to increase net primary production as in our study since water can be more efficiently used by plants ludwig et al 1999 the effect of heterogeneity on biomass levelled off in scenarios with a high rainfall since water availability is generally higher and water redistribution therefore less important surprisingly for arid conditions we found that transpiration was lower in the heterogeneous landscapes although plant biomass was higher that is a higher amount of biomass was sustained by less water this is caused by a shift in the fraction of community biomass from perennial grasses towards shrubs woody plants tend to have a high fraction of inactive biomass that does not transpire pallardy 2010 that is a vast amount of woody biomass is produced by a low fraction of transpiring leaf area in addition our results indicated a higher water use efficiency in heterogeneous landscapes where less water per unit biomass growth is transpired compared to homogeneous landscapes this has also been shown in empirical work in arid landscapes ludwig et al 1999 4 3 the role of landscape heterogeneity spatial scale matters literature indicates that the relationship between landscape heterogeneity and plant diversity positively relates to the spatial scale stein et al 2014 our simulation experiments showed the same relationship for the shannon diversity dependent on the scale of observation we found a negative effect of landscape heterogeneity on functional diversity at small scales 103 m2 but a positive effect at a larger scale a large area containing heterogeneous soil conditions includes more different soil textures leading to a higher number of ecological niches and random effects of the soil conditions are less likely for small areas random effects are less important for homogeneous landscapes leading to a higher functional diversity of these landscapes at small scales the change in functional diversity with increasing spatial scale was similar for all landscape settings after a strong increase in diversity at a small scale the increase leveled off which is well in agreement with the species area relationship east 1981 ibáñez et al 2006 the reason is that a larger landscape includes diverse habitat types such as patches with very low or very high vegetation cover while patches with low cover favor fast growing and less competitive species patches with high cover contain more species with a high competitive ability grime 2001 leading overall to a higher functional diversity while the shannon diversity increased with sampling area the shannon evenness decreased for all landscapes settings the reason for this is the higher probability to capture rare species in a large area than in a small area especially these rare species lead to a decrease in the shannon evenness since sandy loamy soils did not host rare species their overall evenness was significantly higher than for landscapes including loamy sandy or sandy areas 4 4 limitations of our approach and further research heterogeneity in general has been found to be positively related to vegetation biodiversity across biomes questad and foster 2008 stein et al 2014 however little is known on the effect of heterogeneity on plant diversity in drylands and even less on the specific effect of soil heterogeneity given the large number of livelihoods that depend on livestock production in drylands reynolds et al 2007 and the potential of biodiversity as a mechanism to increase the resilience of fodder production mcnaughton 1994 more knowledge is needed our study made an initial contribution by showing that soil heterogeneity potentially increased plant diversity but that the effect depended on other important drivers of savanna vegetation which provides a mechanistic understanding of the interactions of spatial soil heterogeneity with climatic conditions or land management we chose a rather simplified representation of soil heterogeneity i e different soil types in grid cells that are scattered randomly across the landscape the heterogeneity of soil types leads to a patchy availability of the water resource which is a main limiting factor of plant growth in semi arid savannas walker et al 1981 follow up studies should also account for patchiness in nutrient availability since this can also play an essential role in driving vegetation dynamics in savanna landscapes wang et al 2009 but is currently not implemented in ecohyd the simulated landscapes did not account for spatial correlation between soil types or the relative proportion of different soil types within the landscape the exact spatial configuration might for example additionally affect the recruitment success of dispersal limited plants such as woody plant species joubert et al 2008 since the local soil conditions around a mother plant might not be suitable for plant establishment currently essential information on the spatial configuration of soil properties in savanna landscapes is missing recent technological developments such as remote sensing to map sand silt and clay soils could be used for future studies mulder et al 2011 but also aggregated information could be used to parameterize landscape generators pausas and lepš 2003 for running multiple non site specific simulations allowing for general conclusions on soil heterogeneity effects on species coexistence or ecosystem functioning 5 conclusion our results clearly show that landscape heterogeneity is an important factor driving savanna vegetation it interacts with other factors such as precipitation and livestock grazing that have received more attention so far our approach of process based modeling allows us to simulate multiple interacting drivers that simultaneously affect hydrological and vegetation processes this further highlights the role of process based models as a useful tool to study the complex savanna biome in addition we could show that soil conditions in savannas and their spatial configuration can be essential current threats to vegetation biodiversity and ecosystem service provision in savannas such as reduced precipitation through climate change or overgrazing will leave some regions more vulnerable than others because of their predetermined environmental conditions thus to optimize conservation efforts we need to study which regions require more effort respectively in which locations management interventions have the potential to succeed and where they may be overridden by the predetermined natural conditions author

25288,in the context of the rewilding europe debate the german national strategy on biodiversity aims to dedicate two percent of the german state area to wilderness development until 2020 many of these potential large wilderness reserves harbor open habitats that require protection according to the flora fauna habitat directive of the european union as forests prevail in potential natural vegetation research is required to which extent wild large herbivores and natural disturbances may create semi open landscape patterns in the long term we used the spatially explicit process based model of pasture woodland ecosystem dynamics woodpam to analyze the long term interactions between intermediate foraging large wild herbivores and vegetation dynamics in edaphically heterogeneous forest grassland mosaic landscapes we newly implemented a routine for intermediate foraging herbivores we determined herbivore impact on vegetation from the quantitative balance between the demand and supply of herbaceous forage and woody browse in abstract landscapes that represent the conditions in the established german wilderness area döberitzer heide we simulated potential future landscape dynamics on open land in forest and along forest edges with and without intermediate foraging large herbivores and for a climate change scenario in our simulations the currently open landscape was conserved and even more the opening of current oak and beech forest was promoted canopy thinning and patch mosaics of oak birch poplar and pine stands increased the overall nature conservation value in the long term to the contrary open habitats were lost in simulations without herbivores moreover our simulations suggested that intermediate foraging herbivores are especially suitable to maintain semi open landscapes in wilderness areas because i no additional winter forage was required the natural availability of browse was sufficient ii their grazing maintained open land and their browsing thinned tree canopies even on poor sites that were unattractive for foraging here habitat was maintained for threatened species from dry grasslands keywords rewilding long term vegetation dynamics natural mosaic landscape spatially explicit simulation 1 introduction as part of the rewilding europe debate the german national strategy on biodiversity nbs jepson 2016 aims to dedicate two percent of the german state area to wilderness development until 2020 in large nature reserves all natural processes shall be protected in order to allow a course of vegetation succession that is free of anthropogenic influences but driven by large herbivores and natural disturbances rosenthal et al 2015 jepson 2016 a minimum size of at least 1000 ha 500 ha in peatlands river floodplains and adjacent buffer zone shall guarantee a minimal impact of e g wildfire windstorm and subsequent insect outbreaks to the surrounding landscape refer to the bark beetle outbreak in the bavarian forest national park heurich 2001 this size will also allow a viable population of wild large herbivores to live from forage resources provided by the area itself many of these potential german wilderness areas are currently far from a natural state e g former surface mines or military training grounds and harbor many habitats of open landscapes that require protection according to the flora fauna habitat directive of the european union ffh directive without future human interference a development towards closed forest is generally expected hofmann et al 2008 consequently nature conservation has conflicting aims wilderness on the one side according to the nbs and protection of endangered open habitats according to ffh aims on the other side the megaherbivore theory suggests a solution how this could be brought together re introduced wild large herbivores could act as a natural tool to maintain semi open wilderness landscapes without direct human interference in sensu trophic rewilding svenning et al 2016 vera 2009 hodder et al 2005 due to landscape cultivation since prehistoric times large scale natural wilderness and important large wild herbivore species are missing in central europe such as wisent or wild horse in turn nature conservation faces a knowledge gap regarding the potential long term development of future wilderness areas that host wild large herbivores hodder and bullock 2009 cornelissen 2017 partial insights can be gained from large near natural grazing systems on former military training grounds in germany finck et al 2009 oheimb et al 2006 felinks et al 2012 anders et al 2004 lorenz et al 2016 and from the rewilding project oostvaardersplassen in the netherlands cornelissen 2017 however in these systems the natural grazers e g heck cattle and konik horse dominate the herbivore communities subsequently deductions can mainly be drawn on the interactions among large herbivore grazing and vegetation succession similar experience is at hand on the influence of wild herbivore browsing on forest development kuijper et al 2010b vandenberghe et al 2008 falinski 1998 falinski 1998 but on the combined influence of grazing and browsing by intermediate foraging wild herbivores such as wisent and red deer a knowledge gap exists both species are promising for the open landscape conservation in german wilderness areas regarding the recent experience in the döberitzer heide and the military training ground grafenwöhr meißner et al 2015 the body of research from the primeval bialowieza forest bnp samojlik and kuijper 2013 miscicki 2012 kuijper et al 2009 also provides indications however the knowledge transfer suffers from very distinct climatic conditions and a distinct forest composition provision of supplementary forage during the long and cold winters very low population densities when compared to the döberitzer heide moreover the observations from near natural grazing systems rosenthal et al 2012 to the majority only provide short term information less than a decade on how large herbivores influence landscape development the experience in former military areas and in the rewilding project oostvaardersplassen is of similar shortage in the light of processes of natural landscape dynamics that aim cover forest growth and decay and therefore centuries in general observations and experimental data focus on early successional pathways such as tree seedling establishment under herbivore pressure facilitated by nurse shrub smit et al 2007 vandenberghe et al 2009 or trampling damage on the grass sward e g peringer et al 2017 nevertheless these short term observations show similar tendencies grazing by large herbivores was capable setting off succession dynamics and thus preventing dense forest formation finck et al 2002 oheimb et al 2006 lorenz et al 2016 cornelissen 2017 a shifting mosaic cycle of open and forested ecosystems in the landscape was suggested olff et al 1999 regarding the landscape scale impact of browsing in the primeval forest bnp it was observed that the wild large herbivore community which mainly comprises browsers red deer roe and fallow deer triggered vegetation structures of diverse successional stages induced shifts in tree species composition and for a short time contributed to openness in forest gaps kuijper et al 2010a miscicki 2012 however it is unclear if selective habitat use for grazing and browsing by intermediate foraging herbivores truly combine these effects on vegetation because of their low density when compared to grazing systems and because their impacts on vegetation succession influence each other under forest canopy thinned by browsing the herb layer provides more forage for grazing similar to traditional pasture woodlands so called hudewald e g kirby 2004 on the one hand side low grazing pressure on grasslands allow shrub development which provides browse forage outside forest such browse might be preferred by herbivores because it is easy to access and the attractiveness of shrub species themselves e g calluna vulgaris lorenz et al 2016 it is therefore unclear if intermediate foraging herbivores will keep grasslands clear from shrub and tree as grazers do in pasture woodlands and if they will thin forest canopy as browsers do in closed forest these interactions are further complicated when considering edaphic heterogeneity in large nature reserves poor soils provide low quality herbaceous forage and these sites are poorly grazed and turn into forest in the long term in pasture woodlands the forest grassland mosaic patterns therefore strongly depend on the edaphic conditions e g lederbogen et al 2004 on the other hand side the naturally thin canopy forest on poor soil provides attractive browse altogether an integrative analysis is therefore required of grazing and browsing impacts on vegetation succession and long term landscape patterns especially maintenance of open habitats in german wilderness areas in which rewilding with intermediate foraging wild herbivores shall take place moreover climate change impacts need to be considered because of the long term development of woody species and because upcoming summer droughts may inhibit woody plant establishment on grasslands hopf 2016 trigger shifts in tree species composition of forest hofmann et al 2008 climate change may therefore alter the future course of succession schulze et al 2016 several previous studies already addressed landscape development under herbivore pressure with special regard to the influence of large wild herbivores on forest development open landscape conservation respectively jorritsma et al 1999 danell et al 2006 kramer et al 2003 weisberg et al 2005 these studies either focused on browsing or were spatially implicit and therefore disregarded the complexity of intermediate foraging in heterogeneous landscapes in our modelling study we analyze the long term interactions among grazing and browsing by intermediate foraging wild herbivores and herb layer and woody plant vegetation dynamics using the wilderness area döberitzer heide as study site we put the fundamental process to pattern relationships shown in fig 1 into the context of edaphic heterogeneity and climate change fernandez et al 2017 jeltsch et al 1997 central to our approach is the implementation of a quantitative food chain for herbivore grazing and browsing into the spatially explicit model of pasture woodland ecosystem dynamics woodpam gillet 2008 peringer et al 2013 2015 2016 over long time scales the balance between herbivores forage demand and supply from vegetation is fundamental for semi open landscape development in wilderness areas the mutualistic herbivore habitat use of combined browsing and grazing intensities control vegetation patterns vera 2009 fernandez et al 2017 in comparison to previous studies jorritsma et al 1999 kramer et al 2003 weisberg et al 2005 our model for the first time spatially explicitly analyses the effects of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores in heterogeneous landscapes and thereby links processes to mosaic patterns we explored the herbivore and climate change driven landscape dynamics starting from three artificial initial landscapes that represent characteristic elements of the real landscape mosaic in order to separately analyze succession dynamics regression progression and neighboring effects in open treeless landscape forest edge and forest in scenario simulations we aim to find out q1 can intermediate foraging of wild large herbivores at low natural densities maintain and create semi open landscapes as suggested by the megaherbivore theory q2 how does selective habitat use for grazing and browsing of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores modify landscape patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the döberitzer heide is a former military training ground in northeastern germany n 52 511528 e 12 977092 fig 2 with gravelly sandy substratum and subcontinental climate annual mean temperature was 9 4 c mean annual precipitation was 582 mm in the reference period 1961 2014 military use started in 1713 in 1990 the site was abandoned since 2004 it belongs to the heinz sielmann stiftung which declared 1 860 ha as wilderness area in 2010 common wild herbivores red deer cervus elaphus roe deer capreolus capreolus fallow deer dama dama were complemented with wisent bison bonasus and wild horse equus ferus przewalski in the fenced wilderness core area the current numbers of individuals considered in this study are given in table 1 2 2 the woodpam model woodpam is a grid based model square cell size is 25 m that operates at a yearly time step at the cell level it simulates the dispersal establishment and growth of tree species and shrubs and the succession of herb layer communities at the landscape level it simulates the neighborhood dispersal and the long distance dispersal of tree species as well as the selective habitat use of livestock habitat selectivity considers the availability of herbaceous forage and browse and tree cover thereby a feedback is established in the model among the vegetation patterns at landscape scale and the grazing and browsing impacts on woody plants and the herb layer dynamics at the local scale of grid cells general framework in peringer et al 2013 2015 2017 the baseline parameterization of herbivores habitat use reflected the preferences of cattle which focuses on productive grasslands and disregards dense tree canopies for foraging kohler et al 2006 for our study we newly implemented the browsing behavior of wild intermediate herbivores our newly implemented browsing routine was inspired by the approach of hudjetz et al 2014 who considered the factors of mean plant woody biomass mean body weight and seasonal forage consumption of red deer simulated browsing impact on tree species was determined by the balance among forage demand kg dry woody matter of seedlings twigs bark for each herbivore species and browse availability from tree species and shrub kilograms dry matter of edible browse based on estimations kalén and bergquist 2004 annighöfer et al 2016 kalén and bergquist 2004 annighöfer et al 2016 browsing impact caused mortality of seedlings and reduces growth rates of saplings and shrubs based on the browsing tolerance index established in the landclim forest model schumacher and bugmann 2006 herbivores preferences for certain tree species were modelled based on observations by kuijper et al 2010b who established a selectivity index for browsing we therefore simulated a selective browsing behavior so that habitat use related to tree species and overall browse availability for adaptation of woodpam to the study site we modified the submodels of tree shrub and the herb layer the supplementary material provides a detailed description of our model modifications fig 3 2 3 simulated landscapes we performed simulations in a planar artificial model landscape of one km² size 40 40 grid cells in this model landscape heterogeneous edaphic conditions were represented by a central area of drought stressed shallow soils and surrounding deep soils see fig 4 moreover a watering point was included which attracts herbivores to the southern landscape edge in order to compare landscape dynamics on attractive and remote sites of the wilderness area however the watering point had no effect on vegetation growth the simulated climate is based on a combination of observed climate from year 1901 to 2015 ad data source pik and dwd and of a reconstructed climate time series from year 1 to 1900 ad moberg et al 2005 in monthly resolution for temperature and precipitation we chose a moderate future climate change scenario with a temperature increase of 2 6 c from 2011 to 2100 ad rcp4 5 data source pik 2 4 design of simulations in a two step procedure we first ran a spin up simulation starting from 10 seedlings of each tree species per grid cell towards the development of a mixed forest that approximates the current forest composition from 1850 to 1990 ad a dense mixed oak birch poplar and beech hornbeam forest with only a few forest glades fig 5 the results demonstrate the realistic parameterization of tree species competition and were used to calibrate the newly implemented tree species parameters the simulation ran along the climate time series and considered the mortality of old trees in terms of a yearly gap creation in 0 25 and shrub mortality in 2 of the landscape number of cells respectively these values relate to the maximum age of trees and shrub from which decay the corresponding gaps emerge refer to chapter 2 7 in the supplementary material from the vegetation data of this landscape tree and herb layer we created three distinct landscapes in order to initialize the model for scenario simulations in the second step see fig 4 in each landscape we simulated long term vegetation development reaching from 1990 to 2300 ad for two scenarios absence or presence of the current herds of intermediate herbivores table 1 for 365 days per year from 2010 ad onwards we numbered the landscape scenarios according to their initial landscape state at topmost level the open landscape scenarios belong to the scenario family 1 forest edge 2 and forest 3 at sub level the numbering indicated which scenario type was simulated the absence of large herbivores 1 or the presence of large herbivores 2 the simulated herds sum up to a density of 0 1 individuals hectare with an intermediate forage demand comprising 67 herbaceous forbs grasses fruits and 33 woody twigs seedlings saplings forage matter ca 14 8 daily forage consumption kg individual we lacked long term data on herbivore population dynamics and to avoid uncertain variability in simulations we therefore simulated the status quo density for details on the estimate of stock density and diet composition refer to the supplementary material 2 5 model plausibility testing the tree species competition and sequence of successional stages was subject to calibration in the spin up simulations the climate sensitivity of tree species was tested for historical climate fluctuations in schulze et al 2016 and led to plausible results the herbivore impact on vegetation development builds on our bottom up approach that balances foraging demand and available herbal and woody forage in terms of biomass kilogram dry matter based on observed data the general framework of herbivore behavior at landscape scale was tested many times in previous studies in pasture woodlands peringer et al 2013 2015 2016 2 6 landscape analysis for the analysis of landscape structures we recorded habitat diversity and spatial distribution of habitats at landscape scale along all scenario simulations the habitat types were defined following gallandat et al 1995 according to tree cover table 2 in order to explain habitat formation and quality mechanistically we also recorded the distribution of tree species the cover of herb layer communities and the habitat use of herbivores in terms of residence time per grid cell 3 results the temporal development of landscape structures and corresponding habitat diversity differed strongly between all scenario simulations i e for initial landscape states open landscape forest edge and forest and for the presence of herbivores in the following we characterize major aspects in landscape dynamics that correspond to our research questions 3 1 conservation of open landscape in the open landscape scenario and the forest edge scenario without herbivores scenarios 1 1 and 2 1 progressive succession towards forest occurred within one century fig 6 successional trajectories on open landscape showed fluctuating lines of habitat types that indicate the fast replacement of treeless grassland and thin canopy early successional woods by forest within a few decades these shifts among habitat types did not occur uniformly across the landscape but in a mosaic of successional stages the temporary decrease of the landscape structural diversity ail in fig 6 indicates structurally diverse mosaics however the general trend towards densely wooded habitats is uniform to the contrary in open landscape and forest edge scenarios with herbivores progressive succession was slowed for almost a century densely wooded habitats emerged around 2050 ad in scenario 1 1 but around 2150 ad in scenario 1 2 fig 6 in the forest edge scenario with herbivores scenario 2 2 the cover of sparsely wooded habitats remained consistent in the very long term in the open landscape with herbivores scenario 1 2 progressive succession was only partly inhibited sparsely wooded habitats accounted for the major part of landscape structure and dominated around the watering point in the southern landscape part fig 7 in the remote northern part a mosaic of sparsely and densely wooded habitats emerged and increase landscape structural diversity decrease of the ail in fig 6 3 2 regressive succession in forest in all scenarios without herbivores closed forest persisted where initially present figs 6 and 7 scenarios 2 1 and 3 1 climate change drove a tree species shift from beech hornbeam oak to oak pine forest figs 10 and 11 however thin canopy forest in a mosaic pattern emerged only temporarily decrease of the ail and increase of densely wooded habitat scenarios 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 in fig 6 in the forest and forest edge scenarios herbivores triggered regressive succession by thinning out of tree cover of forest towards densely wooded habitats with 50 to 70 tree cover scenarios 2 2 and 3 2 fig 7 in the forest scenario herbivores developed a structurally rich mosaic of sparsely medium wooded and densely wooded habitats from initially homogeneous closed forest scenario 3 2 fig 6 in the forest edge scenario herbivores selectively opened forest to medium wooded habitats close to the watering point in southern part of the landscape but failed to do so in the remote northern part scenario 2 2 fig 6 in all herbivore scenarios light demanding tree species poplar birch pine enriched tree species diversity of the forest stands on the cost of today present beech and hornbeam figs 9 11 oak persisted in all scenarios where initially present 3 3 the role of an edaphic mosaic landscape the habitat use of herbivores for grazing fig 8 was strongly determined by edaphic conditions fig 4 high grazing intensities fig 8 occurred on deep soils with productive grasslands fig a 1 in the supplementary material and in sparsely to medium wooded habitats compare figs 7 and 8 in the open landscape and the forest edge scenario the poor grasslands on shallow soils were disregarded for grazing scenarios 1 2 and 2 2 in fig 8 woody plant succession was the consequence fig 7 in the forest and in the open landscape scenarios the habitat use for browsing was more distinctly distributed according to edaphic conditions scenarios 1 2 and 3 2 in fig 8 in the forest scenario the understory on rich soil was preferred to poor soil in the open landscape scenario and later on after canopy thinning in the forest scenario patches of early successional tree species and shrubs were preferred fig 9 in the open landscape scenario even the poor soils partly became attractive for browsing because of their density of attractive tree species 4 discussion our scenario simulations of long term wilderness development suggest that herds of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores may maintain semi open landscapes in subcontinental heathlands and oak forests when moderate climate change is considered for the future in the following we first discuss the accuracy of our modelling of specific processes and patterns of intermediate foraging of wild herbivores and then the realism of our simulation outcomes in relation to the research questions the model validation regarding reproduction of current tree species composition and outpost tree colonization patterns on open landscape is discussed in chapter 3 in the supplementary material 4 1 the accuracy of simulated intermediate foraging behavior weisberg et al 2006 argue that the representation of herbivore vegetation interactions requires the integration of multiple ecosystem compartments most importantly vegetation and herbivores in a balanced manner regarding their properties tree shrub and herb layer foraging type of herbivores processes plant growth herbivore behavior and habitat use and the consideration of spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics otherwise the goal of integrative ecosystem analysis cannot be reached our modifications of the woodpam model aimed to establish such a balanced model formulation for wilderness development with special regard to the combination of grazing and browsing by intermediate foraging wild herbivores woodpam was already successfully used to analyze herbivore vegetation climate interactions in cattle grazed pasture woodlands in the swiss jura mountains peringer et al 2013 2015 2016 accordingly our modelling of browsing by intermediate foraging wild herbivores was strongly oriented on the existing process formulations for grazing behavior of cattle and established a second pathway of forage consumption and impact on vegetation that was parallel and symmetric to grazing therefore our browsing routines that were inspired by the approach of hudjetz et al 2014 fitted well into the existing model framework regarding a balanced level of mathematical detail quantitative estimate of food chain refer to chapter 2 1 in the supplementary material and their interaction with vegetation was plausible for wild large herbivores the landscape scale balance among the demand for and the availability of forage is central to survive and also an important determinant for the openness and tree species composition of wilderness areas jorritsma et al 1999 based on our quantitative estimate of the food chain regarding grazing and newly established browsing following hudjetz et al 2014 fig 1 we could verify our modelling regarding the fact that during the past years herbivore effects were observed almost everywhere in our study area but plenty of forage remained by the end of the year p nitschke pers comm the simulated utilization rates of browse reached about 50 and of course never exceeded browse supply fig a 2 supplementary material fundamental to this realistic balance among forage demand and supply was our explicit modelling of herbivores diet and tree seedlings proportion of edible biomass in terms of kilograms dry matter of woody browse furthermore we therefore successfully modelled the two main factors for browsing habitat use which are the availability of woody browse and its digestibility kalén and bergquist 2004 the simulated pattern of herbivore habitat use showed higher browsing activity in the forest area due to higher abundance of seedlings and saplings when compared to a treeless open landscape however browsing was also strong in the open landscape area when pioneer tree species had established and provided browse of high digestibility poplar birch finally the simulated browsing selectivity for certain tree species basically the preference birch and hornbeam realistically shifted tree species composition and distribution under herbivore pressure kuijper et al 2009 in forest scenarios the cover of hornbeam decreased because it is the most preferred among all tree species kuijper et al 2010a in open landscape scenarios herbivore browsing reduced the cover of pioneer species birch poplar pine for centuries scenarios 1 1 and 1 2 until 2200 ad lorenz et al 2016 our model did not simulate nursery effects by shrubs for tree species establishment vandenberghe et al 2009 smit et al 2007 vera 2000 we dedicate this to the low browsing pressure in our wilderness area when compared to low intensity grazing systems a limitation of our simulation results is our disregard of herbivore population dynamics fluctuations in herbivore densities correlate with fluctuations of tree species in forest community and density shifts are known to have strong impact on landscape structure kuijper et al 2009 marris 2009 cornelissen 2017 however we lacked long term data about the coupled population dynamics of wisent and horse under the conditions of the study area and when in competition for grazing resources further no data was available about population dynamics under natural conditions without human interferences of supplementary feeding or population regulation a population increase may have unexpected effects on herbivore interspecific competition as observed in the grazer dominated rewilding project oostvaardersplassen cornelissen 2017 further a fivefold decrease of browsing pressure by red and roe deer affected tree regeneration of deciduous tree species positively in the short term and in the long term influenced the loss of open habitats kuiters and slim 2002 we therefore preferred to simulate the status quo herbivore densities for which the carrying capacity of the study area is sufficient instead of the introduction of uncertain variability in our simulations 4 2 maintenance of semi open landscape by intermediate foraging large wild herbivores our scenario simulations suggested the potential of intermediate foraging herbivores at natural low densities to maintain and create semi open landscapes this simulated effect on open landscape conservation was reliable because it built on our modelling of the quantitative food chain regarding the combination of grazing and browsing which is specific for intermediate herbivores chapter 4 1 a semi open mosaic landscape was achieved similar to applications of low intensity grazing systems by nature conservation cornelissen 2017 lorenz et al 2016 finck et al 2009 although the density of intermediate herbivores was much lower than of grazers we dedicate this simulated efficiency of intermediate herbivores to their combined impact on both the herbaceous vegetation by grazing and the tree and shrub vegetation by browsing vera et al 2006 and to the impact of climate change similar low densities of browser dominated herbivore communities red roe and fallow deer did not maintain forest gaps samojlik and kuijper 2013 we consider future climate induced drought stress on tree species regeneration to play a crucial role because recent observations indicate that summer droughts restrict the establishment of pioneer tree species in the open landscape refer to the high mortality of birch in the experiments of hopf 2016 historical observations might not provide a basis for the future landscape dynamics schulze et al 2016 with our integrative analysis of herbivore vegetation interactions in the light of climate change we complement the analysis of historic landscape dynamics and gained new insights on the potential of intermediate herbivores for open landscape conservation in wilderness areas our results support that intermediate large herbivores are indispensable for the maintenance of landscape mosaics of grassland shrub and forest habitats bakker et al 2016 vera 2000 4 3 modification of landscape patterns by selective habitat use of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores similar to observations in low intensity pasture woodlands that were dominated by grazers the grassland forest mosaics that were created by intermediate foraging wild herbivores in our simulations showed the segregation of grasslands on main foraging sites from woods on poor soils with unattractive forest such forest grassland segregation is generally evaluated negative from the nature conservation perspective because forest development leads to habitat loss for threatened species that depend on e g dry grasslands as shown in the case of lime stone ridges in the pasture woodlands of the swiss jura mountains dufour et al 2006 on grazed oligotrophic fens the case of northern pre alpine pasture woodlands lederbogen et al 2004 and in our simulation the habitat quality for threatened species of dry grassland habitats e g ffh code 4030 ffh code 9190 dipner 2005 however in contrast to the grazer dominated systems the woods on poor soil did not develop towards dense forest but towards thin canopy forest in turn a high nature conservation value dipner 2005 was maintained on these sites because of their richness in tree species diversity and indicated habitat for grassland species in the understory this development depended on the natural browsing demand of intermediate foraging herbivores which in contrast to grazers browsed the unattractive forage sites where pioneer tree species provided attractive forage birch poplar the simulated effects of mutualistic habitat use support the hypotheses that in the past multispecies communities of large herbivores triggered successional pathways towards a decrease of woody cover and increase in light demanding species vera 2000 bakker et al 2016 our simulations thereby demonstrated that intermediate foraging large herbivores have the potential to evoke species rich semi open habitats on drought prone shallow soils that are otherwise disregarded by grazers and habitats are lost 4 4 conclusions for nature conservation our simulations suggested the capability of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores to play a crucial role for open landscape conservation in wilderness reserves even at low densities their mutualistic habitat use covered the entire landscape and showed positive effects in both open habitats and forest regarding nature conservation value thus they do not require additional winter forage open habitats were partly conserved by herbivores dry heathlands and secondary forest as well as today s forest were enriched in tree species diversity mixed stands with birch and poplar instead of pure pine stands even on sites with unattractive forage dry grasslands on shallow soil browsing thinned out forest canopy towards the development of a steppe heath structure regardless regressive succession today s forest showed a strong legacy effect regarding spatial distribution and dominant species which is of specific importance for the habitat continuity for the rich biodiversity of oak stands considering these positive effects we therefore argue to integrate large herbivore communities with distinct foraging

25288,in the context of the rewilding europe debate the german national strategy on biodiversity aims to dedicate two percent of the german state area to wilderness development until 2020 many of these potential large wilderness reserves harbor open habitats that require protection according to the flora fauna habitat directive of the european union as forests prevail in potential natural vegetation research is required to which extent wild large herbivores and natural disturbances may create semi open landscape patterns in the long term we used the spatially explicit process based model of pasture woodland ecosystem dynamics woodpam to analyze the long term interactions between intermediate foraging large wild herbivores and vegetation dynamics in edaphically heterogeneous forest grassland mosaic landscapes we newly implemented a routine for intermediate foraging herbivores we determined herbivore impact on vegetation from the quantitative balance between the demand and supply of herbaceous forage and woody browse in abstract landscapes that represent the conditions in the established german wilderness area döberitzer heide we simulated potential future landscape dynamics on open land in forest and along forest edges with and without intermediate foraging large herbivores and for a climate change scenario in our simulations the currently open landscape was conserved and even more the opening of current oak and beech forest was promoted canopy thinning and patch mosaics of oak birch poplar and pine stands increased the overall nature conservation value in the long term to the contrary open habitats were lost in simulations without herbivores moreover our simulations suggested that intermediate foraging herbivores are especially suitable to maintain semi open landscapes in wilderness areas because i no additional winter forage was required the natural availability of browse was sufficient ii their grazing maintained open land and their browsing thinned tree canopies even on poor sites that were unattractive for foraging here habitat was maintained for threatened species from dry grasslands keywords rewilding long term vegetation dynamics natural mosaic landscape spatially explicit simulation 1 introduction as part of the rewilding europe debate the german national strategy on biodiversity nbs jepson 2016 aims to dedicate two percent of the german state area to wilderness development until 2020 in large nature reserves all natural processes shall be protected in order to allow a course of vegetation succession that is free of anthropogenic influences but driven by large herbivores and natural disturbances rosenthal et al 2015 jepson 2016 a minimum size of at least 1000 ha 500 ha in peatlands river floodplains and adjacent buffer zone shall guarantee a minimal impact of e g wildfire windstorm and subsequent insect outbreaks to the surrounding landscape refer to the bark beetle outbreak in the bavarian forest national park heurich 2001 this size will also allow a viable population of wild large herbivores to live from forage resources provided by the area itself many of these potential german wilderness areas are currently far from a natural state e g former surface mines or military training grounds and harbor many habitats of open landscapes that require protection according to the flora fauna habitat directive of the european union ffh directive without future human interference a development towards closed forest is generally expected hofmann et al 2008 consequently nature conservation has conflicting aims wilderness on the one side according to the nbs and protection of endangered open habitats according to ffh aims on the other side the megaherbivore theory suggests a solution how this could be brought together re introduced wild large herbivores could act as a natural tool to maintain semi open wilderness landscapes without direct human interference in sensu trophic rewilding svenning et al 2016 vera 2009 hodder et al 2005 due to landscape cultivation since prehistoric times large scale natural wilderness and important large wild herbivore species are missing in central europe such as wisent or wild horse in turn nature conservation faces a knowledge gap regarding the potential long term development of future wilderness areas that host wild large herbivores hodder and bullock 2009 cornelissen 2017 partial insights can be gained from large near natural grazing systems on former military training grounds in germany finck et al 2009 oheimb et al 2006 felinks et al 2012 anders et al 2004 lorenz et al 2016 and from the rewilding project oostvaardersplassen in the netherlands cornelissen 2017 however in these systems the natural grazers e g heck cattle and konik horse dominate the herbivore communities subsequently deductions can mainly be drawn on the interactions among large herbivore grazing and vegetation succession similar experience is at hand on the influence of wild herbivore browsing on forest development kuijper et al 2010b vandenberghe et al 2008 falinski 1998 falinski 1998 but on the combined influence of grazing and browsing by intermediate foraging wild herbivores such as wisent and red deer a knowledge gap exists both species are promising for the open landscape conservation in german wilderness areas regarding the recent experience in the döberitzer heide and the military training ground grafenwöhr meißner et al 2015 the body of research from the primeval bialowieza forest bnp samojlik and kuijper 2013 miscicki 2012 kuijper et al 2009 also provides indications however the knowledge transfer suffers from very distinct climatic conditions and a distinct forest composition provision of supplementary forage during the long and cold winters very low population densities when compared to the döberitzer heide moreover the observations from near natural grazing systems rosenthal et al 2012 to the majority only provide short term information less than a decade on how large herbivores influence landscape development the experience in former military areas and in the rewilding project oostvaardersplassen is of similar shortage in the light of processes of natural landscape dynamics that aim cover forest growth and decay and therefore centuries in general observations and experimental data focus on early successional pathways such as tree seedling establishment under herbivore pressure facilitated by nurse shrub smit et al 2007 vandenberghe et al 2009 or trampling damage on the grass sward e g peringer et al 2017 nevertheless these short term observations show similar tendencies grazing by large herbivores was capable setting off succession dynamics and thus preventing dense forest formation finck et al 2002 oheimb et al 2006 lorenz et al 2016 cornelissen 2017 a shifting mosaic cycle of open and forested ecosystems in the landscape was suggested olff et al 1999 regarding the landscape scale impact of browsing in the primeval forest bnp it was observed that the wild large herbivore community which mainly comprises browsers red deer roe and fallow deer triggered vegetation structures of diverse successional stages induced shifts in tree species composition and for a short time contributed to openness in forest gaps kuijper et al 2010a miscicki 2012 however it is unclear if selective habitat use for grazing and browsing by intermediate foraging herbivores truly combine these effects on vegetation because of their low density when compared to grazing systems and because their impacts on vegetation succession influence each other under forest canopy thinned by browsing the herb layer provides more forage for grazing similar to traditional pasture woodlands so called hudewald e g kirby 2004 on the one hand side low grazing pressure on grasslands allow shrub development which provides browse forage outside forest such browse might be preferred by herbivores because it is easy to access and the attractiveness of shrub species themselves e g calluna vulgaris lorenz et al 2016 it is therefore unclear if intermediate foraging herbivores will keep grasslands clear from shrub and tree as grazers do in pasture woodlands and if they will thin forest canopy as browsers do in closed forest these interactions are further complicated when considering edaphic heterogeneity in large nature reserves poor soils provide low quality herbaceous forage and these sites are poorly grazed and turn into forest in the long term in pasture woodlands the forest grassland mosaic patterns therefore strongly depend on the edaphic conditions e g lederbogen et al 2004 on the other hand side the naturally thin canopy forest on poor soil provides attractive browse altogether an integrative analysis is therefore required of grazing and browsing impacts on vegetation succession and long term landscape patterns especially maintenance of open habitats in german wilderness areas in which rewilding with intermediate foraging wild herbivores shall take place moreover climate change impacts need to be considered because of the long term development of woody species and because upcoming summer droughts may inhibit woody plant establishment on grasslands hopf 2016 trigger shifts in tree species composition of forest hofmann et al 2008 climate change may therefore alter the future course of succession schulze et al 2016 several previous studies already addressed landscape development under herbivore pressure with special regard to the influence of large wild herbivores on forest development open landscape conservation respectively jorritsma et al 1999 danell et al 2006 kramer et al 2003 weisberg et al 2005 these studies either focused on browsing or were spatially implicit and therefore disregarded the complexity of intermediate foraging in heterogeneous landscapes in our modelling study we analyze the long term interactions among grazing and browsing by intermediate foraging wild herbivores and herb layer and woody plant vegetation dynamics using the wilderness area döberitzer heide as study site we put the fundamental process to pattern relationships shown in fig 1 into the context of edaphic heterogeneity and climate change fernandez et al 2017 jeltsch et al 1997 central to our approach is the implementation of a quantitative food chain for herbivore grazing and browsing into the spatially explicit model of pasture woodland ecosystem dynamics woodpam gillet 2008 peringer et al 2013 2015 2016 over long time scales the balance between herbivores forage demand and supply from vegetation is fundamental for semi open landscape development in wilderness areas the mutualistic herbivore habitat use of combined browsing and grazing intensities control vegetation patterns vera 2009 fernandez et al 2017 in comparison to previous studies jorritsma et al 1999 kramer et al 2003 weisberg et al 2005 our model for the first time spatially explicitly analyses the effects of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores in heterogeneous landscapes and thereby links processes to mosaic patterns we explored the herbivore and climate change driven landscape dynamics starting from three artificial initial landscapes that represent characteristic elements of the real landscape mosaic in order to separately analyze succession dynamics regression progression and neighboring effects in open treeless landscape forest edge and forest in scenario simulations we aim to find out q1 can intermediate foraging of wild large herbivores at low natural densities maintain and create semi open landscapes as suggested by the megaherbivore theory q2 how does selective habitat use for grazing and browsing of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores modify landscape patterns 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the döberitzer heide is a former military training ground in northeastern germany n 52 511528 e 12 977092 fig 2 with gravelly sandy substratum and subcontinental climate annual mean temperature was 9 4 c mean annual precipitation was 582 mm in the reference period 1961 2014 military use started in 1713 in 1990 the site was abandoned since 2004 it belongs to the heinz sielmann stiftung which declared 1 860 ha as wilderness area in 2010 common wild herbivores red deer cervus elaphus roe deer capreolus capreolus fallow deer dama dama were complemented with wisent bison bonasus and wild horse equus ferus przewalski in the fenced wilderness core area the current numbers of individuals considered in this study are given in table 1 2 2 the woodpam model woodpam is a grid based model square cell size is 25 m that operates at a yearly time step at the cell level it simulates the dispersal establishment and growth of tree species and shrubs and the succession of herb layer communities at the landscape level it simulates the neighborhood dispersal and the long distance dispersal of tree species as well as the selective habitat use of livestock habitat selectivity considers the availability of herbaceous forage and browse and tree cover thereby a feedback is established in the model among the vegetation patterns at landscape scale and the grazing and browsing impacts on woody plants and the herb layer dynamics at the local scale of grid cells general framework in peringer et al 2013 2015 2017 the baseline parameterization of herbivores habitat use reflected the preferences of cattle which focuses on productive grasslands and disregards dense tree canopies for foraging kohler et al 2006 for our study we newly implemented the browsing behavior of wild intermediate herbivores our newly implemented browsing routine was inspired by the approach of hudjetz et al 2014 who considered the factors of mean plant woody biomass mean body weight and seasonal forage consumption of red deer simulated browsing impact on tree species was determined by the balance among forage demand kg dry woody matter of seedlings twigs bark for each herbivore species and browse availability from tree species and shrub kilograms dry matter of edible browse based on estimations kalén and bergquist 2004 annighöfer et al 2016 kalén and bergquist 2004 annighöfer et al 2016 browsing impact caused mortality of seedlings and reduces growth rates of saplings and shrubs based on the browsing tolerance index established in the landclim forest model schumacher and bugmann 2006 herbivores preferences for certain tree species were modelled based on observations by kuijper et al 2010b who established a selectivity index for browsing we therefore simulated a selective browsing behavior so that habitat use related to tree species and overall browse availability for adaptation of woodpam to the study site we modified the submodels of tree shrub and the herb layer the supplementary material provides a detailed description of our model modifications fig 3 2 3 simulated landscapes we performed simulations in a planar artificial model landscape of one km² size 40 40 grid cells in this model landscape heterogeneous edaphic conditions were represented by a central area of drought stressed shallow soils and surrounding deep soils see fig 4 moreover a watering point was included which attracts herbivores to the southern landscape edge in order to compare landscape dynamics on attractive and remote sites of the wilderness area however the watering point had no effect on vegetation growth the simulated climate is based on a combination of observed climate from year 1901 to 2015 ad data source pik and dwd and of a reconstructed climate time series from year 1 to 1900 ad moberg et al 2005 in monthly resolution for temperature and precipitation we chose a moderate future climate change scenario with a temperature increase of 2 6 c from 2011 to 2100 ad rcp4 5 data source pik 2 4 design of simulations in a two step procedure we first ran a spin up simulation starting from 10 seedlings of each tree species per grid cell towards the development of a mixed forest that approximates the current forest composition from 1850 to 1990 ad a dense mixed oak birch poplar and beech hornbeam forest with only a few forest glades fig 5 the results demonstrate the realistic parameterization of tree species competition and were used to calibrate the newly implemented tree species parameters the simulation ran along the climate time series and considered the mortality of old trees in terms of a yearly gap creation in 0 25 and shrub mortality in 2 of the landscape number of cells respectively these values relate to the maximum age of trees and shrub from which decay the corresponding gaps emerge refer to chapter 2 7 in the supplementary material from the vegetation data of this landscape tree and herb layer we created three distinct landscapes in order to initialize the model for scenario simulations in the second step see fig 4 in each landscape we simulated long term vegetation development reaching from 1990 to 2300 ad for two scenarios absence or presence of the current herds of intermediate herbivores table 1 for 365 days per year from 2010 ad onwards we numbered the landscape scenarios according to their initial landscape state at topmost level the open landscape scenarios belong to the scenario family 1 forest edge 2 and forest 3 at sub level the numbering indicated which scenario type was simulated the absence of large herbivores 1 or the presence of large herbivores 2 the simulated herds sum up to a density of 0 1 individuals hectare with an intermediate forage demand comprising 67 herbaceous forbs grasses fruits and 33 woody twigs seedlings saplings forage matter ca 14 8 daily forage consumption kg individual we lacked long term data on herbivore population dynamics and to avoid uncertain variability in simulations we therefore simulated the status quo density for details on the estimate of stock density and diet composition refer to the supplementary material 2 5 model plausibility testing the tree species competition and sequence of successional stages was subject to calibration in the spin up simulations the climate sensitivity of tree species was tested for historical climate fluctuations in schulze et al 2016 and led to plausible results the herbivore impact on vegetation development builds on our bottom up approach that balances foraging demand and available herbal and woody forage in terms of biomass kilogram dry matter based on observed data the general framework of herbivore behavior at landscape scale was tested many times in previous studies in pasture woodlands peringer et al 2013 2015 2016 2 6 landscape analysis for the analysis of landscape structures we recorded habitat diversity and spatial distribution of habitats at landscape scale along all scenario simulations the habitat types were defined following gallandat et al 1995 according to tree cover table 2 in order to explain habitat formation and quality mechanistically we also recorded the distribution of tree species the cover of herb layer communities and the habitat use of herbivores in terms of residence time per grid cell 3 results the temporal development of landscape structures and corresponding habitat diversity differed strongly between all scenario simulations i e for initial landscape states open landscape forest edge and forest and for the presence of herbivores in the following we characterize major aspects in landscape dynamics that correspond to our research questions 3 1 conservation of open landscape in the open landscape scenario and the forest edge scenario without herbivores scenarios 1 1 and 2 1 progressive succession towards forest occurred within one century fig 6 successional trajectories on open landscape showed fluctuating lines of habitat types that indicate the fast replacement of treeless grassland and thin canopy early successional woods by forest within a few decades these shifts among habitat types did not occur uniformly across the landscape but in a mosaic of successional stages the temporary decrease of the landscape structural diversity ail in fig 6 indicates structurally diverse mosaics however the general trend towards densely wooded habitats is uniform to the contrary in open landscape and forest edge scenarios with herbivores progressive succession was slowed for almost a century densely wooded habitats emerged around 2050 ad in scenario 1 1 but around 2150 ad in scenario 1 2 fig 6 in the forest edge scenario with herbivores scenario 2 2 the cover of sparsely wooded habitats remained consistent in the very long term in the open landscape with herbivores scenario 1 2 progressive succession was only partly inhibited sparsely wooded habitats accounted for the major part of landscape structure and dominated around the watering point in the southern landscape part fig 7 in the remote northern part a mosaic of sparsely and densely wooded habitats emerged and increase landscape structural diversity decrease of the ail in fig 6 3 2 regressive succession in forest in all scenarios without herbivores closed forest persisted where initially present figs 6 and 7 scenarios 2 1 and 3 1 climate change drove a tree species shift from beech hornbeam oak to oak pine forest figs 10 and 11 however thin canopy forest in a mosaic pattern emerged only temporarily decrease of the ail and increase of densely wooded habitat scenarios 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 in fig 6 in the forest and forest edge scenarios herbivores triggered regressive succession by thinning out of tree cover of forest towards densely wooded habitats with 50 to 70 tree cover scenarios 2 2 and 3 2 fig 7 in the forest scenario herbivores developed a structurally rich mosaic of sparsely medium wooded and densely wooded habitats from initially homogeneous closed forest scenario 3 2 fig 6 in the forest edge scenario herbivores selectively opened forest to medium wooded habitats close to the watering point in southern part of the landscape but failed to do so in the remote northern part scenario 2 2 fig 6 in all herbivore scenarios light demanding tree species poplar birch pine enriched tree species diversity of the forest stands on the cost of today present beech and hornbeam figs 9 11 oak persisted in all scenarios where initially present 3 3 the role of an edaphic mosaic landscape the habitat use of herbivores for grazing fig 8 was strongly determined by edaphic conditions fig 4 high grazing intensities fig 8 occurred on deep soils with productive grasslands fig a 1 in the supplementary material and in sparsely to medium wooded habitats compare figs 7 and 8 in the open landscape and the forest edge scenario the poor grasslands on shallow soils were disregarded for grazing scenarios 1 2 and 2 2 in fig 8 woody plant succession was the consequence fig 7 in the forest and in the open landscape scenarios the habitat use for browsing was more distinctly distributed according to edaphic conditions scenarios 1 2 and 3 2 in fig 8 in the forest scenario the understory on rich soil was preferred to poor soil in the open landscape scenario and later on after canopy thinning in the forest scenario patches of early successional tree species and shrubs were preferred fig 9 in the open landscape scenario even the poor soils partly became attractive for browsing because of their density of attractive tree species 4 discussion our scenario simulations of long term wilderness development suggest that herds of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores may maintain semi open landscapes in subcontinental heathlands and oak forests when moderate climate change is considered for the future in the following we first discuss the accuracy of our modelling of specific processes and patterns of intermediate foraging of wild herbivores and then the realism of our simulation outcomes in relation to the research questions the model validation regarding reproduction of current tree species composition and outpost tree colonization patterns on open landscape is discussed in chapter 3 in the supplementary material 4 1 the accuracy of simulated intermediate foraging behavior weisberg et al 2006 argue that the representation of herbivore vegetation interactions requires the integration of multiple ecosystem compartments most importantly vegetation and herbivores in a balanced manner regarding their properties tree shrub and herb layer foraging type of herbivores processes plant growth herbivore behavior and habitat use and the consideration of spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics otherwise the goal of integrative ecosystem analysis cannot be reached our modifications of the woodpam model aimed to establish such a balanced model formulation for wilderness development with special regard to the combination of grazing and browsing by intermediate foraging wild herbivores woodpam was already successfully used to analyze herbivore vegetation climate interactions in cattle grazed pasture woodlands in the swiss jura mountains peringer et al 2013 2015 2016 accordingly our modelling of browsing by intermediate foraging wild herbivores was strongly oriented on the existing process formulations for grazing behavior of cattle and established a second pathway of forage consumption and impact on vegetation that was parallel and symmetric to grazing therefore our browsing routines that were inspired by the approach of hudjetz et al 2014 fitted well into the existing model framework regarding a balanced level of mathematical detail quantitative estimate of food chain refer to chapter 2 1 in the supplementary material and their interaction with vegetation was plausible for wild large herbivores the landscape scale balance among the demand for and the availability of forage is central to survive and also an important determinant for the openness and tree species composition of wilderness areas jorritsma et al 1999 based on our quantitative estimate of the food chain regarding grazing and newly established browsing following hudjetz et al 2014 fig 1 we could verify our modelling regarding the fact that during the past years herbivore effects were observed almost everywhere in our study area but plenty of forage remained by the end of the year p nitschke pers comm the simulated utilization rates of browse reached about 50 and of course never exceeded browse supply fig a 2 supplementary material fundamental to this realistic balance among forage demand and supply was our explicit modelling of herbivores diet and tree seedlings proportion of edible biomass in terms of kilograms dry matter of woody browse furthermore we therefore successfully modelled the two main factors for browsing habitat use which are the availability of woody browse and its digestibility kalén and bergquist 2004 the simulated pattern of herbivore habitat use showed higher browsing activity in the forest area due to higher abundance of seedlings and saplings when compared to a treeless open landscape however browsing was also strong in the open landscape area when pioneer tree species had established and provided browse of high digestibility poplar birch finally the simulated browsing selectivity for certain tree species basically the preference birch and hornbeam realistically shifted tree species composition and distribution under herbivore pressure kuijper et al 2009 in forest scenarios the cover of hornbeam decreased because it is the most preferred among all tree species kuijper et al 2010a in open landscape scenarios herbivore browsing reduced the cover of pioneer species birch poplar pine for centuries scenarios 1 1 and 1 2 until 2200 ad lorenz et al 2016 our model did not simulate nursery effects by shrubs for tree species establishment vandenberghe et al 2009 smit et al 2007 vera 2000 we dedicate this to the low browsing pressure in our wilderness area when compared to low intensity grazing systems a limitation of our simulation results is our disregard of herbivore population dynamics fluctuations in herbivore densities correlate with fluctuations of tree species in forest community and density shifts are known to have strong impact on landscape structure kuijper et al 2009 marris 2009 cornelissen 2017 however we lacked long term data about the coupled population dynamics of wisent and horse under the conditions of the study area and when in competition for grazing resources further no data was available about population dynamics under natural conditions without human interferences of supplementary feeding or population regulation a population increase may have unexpected effects on herbivore interspecific competition as observed in the grazer dominated rewilding project oostvaardersplassen cornelissen 2017 further a fivefold decrease of browsing pressure by red and roe deer affected tree regeneration of deciduous tree species positively in the short term and in the long term influenced the loss of open habitats kuiters and slim 2002 we therefore preferred to simulate the status quo herbivore densities for which the carrying capacity of the study area is sufficient instead of the introduction of uncertain variability in our simulations 4 2 maintenance of semi open landscape by intermediate foraging large wild herbivores our scenario simulations suggested the potential of intermediate foraging herbivores at natural low densities to maintain and create semi open landscapes this simulated effect on open landscape conservation was reliable because it built on our modelling of the quantitative food chain regarding the combination of grazing and browsing which is specific for intermediate herbivores chapter 4 1 a semi open mosaic landscape was achieved similar to applications of low intensity grazing systems by nature conservation cornelissen 2017 lorenz et al 2016 finck et al 2009 although the density of intermediate herbivores was much lower than of grazers we dedicate this simulated efficiency of intermediate herbivores to their combined impact on both the herbaceous vegetation by grazing and the tree and shrub vegetation by browsing vera et al 2006 and to the impact of climate change similar low densities of browser dominated herbivore communities red roe and fallow deer did not maintain forest gaps samojlik and kuijper 2013 we consider future climate induced drought stress on tree species regeneration to play a crucial role because recent observations indicate that summer droughts restrict the establishment of pioneer tree species in the open landscape refer to the high mortality of birch in the experiments of hopf 2016 historical observations might not provide a basis for the future landscape dynamics schulze et al 2016 with our integrative analysis of herbivore vegetation interactions in the light of climate change we complement the analysis of historic landscape dynamics and gained new insights on the potential of intermediate herbivores for open landscape conservation in wilderness areas our results support that intermediate large herbivores are indispensable for the maintenance of landscape mosaics of grassland shrub and forest habitats bakker et al 2016 vera 2000 4 3 modification of landscape patterns by selective habitat use of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores similar to observations in low intensity pasture woodlands that were dominated by grazers the grassland forest mosaics that were created by intermediate foraging wild herbivores in our simulations showed the segregation of grasslands on main foraging sites from woods on poor soils with unattractive forest such forest grassland segregation is generally evaluated negative from the nature conservation perspective because forest development leads to habitat loss for threatened species that depend on e g dry grasslands as shown in the case of lime stone ridges in the pasture woodlands of the swiss jura mountains dufour et al 2006 on grazed oligotrophic fens the case of northern pre alpine pasture woodlands lederbogen et al 2004 and in our simulation the habitat quality for threatened species of dry grassland habitats e g ffh code 4030 ffh code 9190 dipner 2005 however in contrast to the grazer dominated systems the woods on poor soil did not develop towards dense forest but towards thin canopy forest in turn a high nature conservation value dipner 2005 was maintained on these sites because of their richness in tree species diversity and indicated habitat for grassland species in the understory this development depended on the natural browsing demand of intermediate foraging herbivores which in contrast to grazers browsed the unattractive forage sites where pioneer tree species provided attractive forage birch poplar the simulated effects of mutualistic habitat use support the hypotheses that in the past multispecies communities of large herbivores triggered successional pathways towards a decrease of woody cover and increase in light demanding species vera 2000 bakker et al 2016 our simulations thereby demonstrated that intermediate foraging large herbivores have the potential to evoke species rich semi open habitats on drought prone shallow soils that are otherwise disregarded by grazers and habitats are lost 4 4 conclusions for nature conservation our simulations suggested the capability of intermediate foraging wild large herbivores to play a crucial role for open landscape conservation in wilderness reserves even at low densities their mutualistic habitat use covered the entire landscape and showed positive effects in both open habitats and forest regarding nature conservation value thus they do not require additional winter forage open habitats were partly conserved by herbivores dry heathlands and secondary forest as well as today s forest were enriched in tree species diversity mixed stands with birch and poplar instead of pure pine stands even on sites with unattractive forage dry grasslands on shallow soil browsing thinned out forest canopy towards the development of a steppe heath structure regardless regressive succession today s forest showed a strong legacy effect regarding spatial distribution and dominant species which is of specific importance for the habitat continuity for the rich biodiversity of oak stands considering these positive effects we therefore argue to integrate large herbivore communities with distinct foraging

25289,rapid urbanization greatly accelerated economic and social development in key river basins of china but also created numerous environmental problems from the local to the global scale including increased air and water pollution and decreased water supply local climate alteration and increased energy demands as well as a major reduction in natural vegetation production and carbon storage sequestration the correlation analysis between urban economy and pollution transfer among cities in river basins has become one of highlights in current researches based on the netlogo software platform this paper establishes a correlation model among cities in the same river basin from the point of view of multi agent simulation moreover it assesses the relationship between urban economic development and pollution transfer from three aspects network concentration network size link intensity the influence of network concentration and link intensity on the total economic size and pollution transfer of the entire river basin is similar in parallel the influence of network size on the two modelled variables shows an opposite trend demonstrating that network size has a greater impact on the city by comparing the trend of economic size and pollution transfer with the change of network concentration in the context of different economic transfer thresholds results demonstrate that with the increase of network concentration the influence becomes more pronounced appropriate error analysis was used to validate the simulation results in particular according to it the error between 10 time and 20 time steps simulation is less than 10 consequently the simulation results are valid this paper deepening the research on the correlation among river basin cities lays the foundation for further research on the directional transmission of the economy and pollution keywords urbanization netlogo multi agent simulation economy pollution nexus 1 introduction since its reform and opening up china has witnessed a great breakthrough in its economy however this was followed by a variety of environmental pollution problems which have become the toughest and the most concerning issues in the context of chinese urbanization urbanization is causing serious disturbances and destruction of the ecological environment in river basins xu 2011 both environmental and resources related problems in river basins which were caused by urbanization are mainly reflected into water and air pollution water shortages over exploitation of groundwater as well as local health problems caused by polluted air the adverse effects of urbanization on basins water quality has recently become a hot issue the widely reported cases of cancer villages in the huaihe river basin china whose distribution declines from east to west reflecting also economic development and environmental pollution between eastern and western china is one among the possible examples the atlas of the water environment and digestive tumor cancer mortality in the huaihe river basin published in year 2013 first confirmed the direct relationship between the high incidence of cancer and water pollution in the huaihe river basin approximately 60 of cancer villages are found within 3 km from rivers while 81 are within 5 km from rivers this demonstrates that rivers water quality is an important factor on cancer villages gong and zhang 2013 the urbanization spatial and socio economical dynamics are closely related to the emergence of these environmental hotpots on one hand as a consequence of the further urban economic development cities cannot meet the needs of their inhabitants via their own development thus cities need to enhance their economic interactions or trade with surrounding cities on the other hand urban economic activities produce pollution of all types thus affecting the environment quality and the population health through a variety of media with the increase of population density and the expansion of space multiple and trans boundary pollution effects occur this phenomenon called pollution transfer as are already reported in the scientific literature e g casazza et al 2017 li et al 2017a liu et al 2017 in particular many scholars studied pollution transfer caused by economic trade several studies focused on the environmental pollution caused by inter regional trade for example okadera et al 2006 calculated the overall virtual water and pollution discharges in the yangtze river basin based on a regional input output model discussing about the influence of the final consumption by other regions on yangtze river basin li et al 2013 analyzed the embodied pollution inter regional transfer in china in particular they constructed an evaluation model of the embodied pollution inter regional transfer and calculated the pollution amount from four typical industrial pollutants on the basis of an input output table their results demonstrated that embodied pollution transfer in china is mainly directed from central and western china less developed to the more developed eastern coastal areas in fact the eastern areas shift their burden of pollution discharge to the central and western areas by inter regional trade tan and chen 2015 calculated the implicit carbon trade between china and the eu based on the multi regional input output model their work showed that the total amount of carbon embodied in trade between china and eu is increasing gao and liu 2016 calculated china s carbon emissions with respect to import and export from 38 countries moreover they compared the difference of virtual import emissions and actual import emissions between china and european countries meanwhile zhang 2016a targeted the embodied carbon emissions in export trade in sichuan province and measured the amount of the embodied carbon emissions by systematic analysis of the export data he then performed a comparative analysis between the results and the amount of national export embodied carbon emissions john 2014 analyzed the boundary conditions leading to positive welfare effects in particular in the case of trade with an embodied pollution transfer his results showed that countries welfare doesn t necessarily increase proportionally with distance from the pollution source location instead it grows in proportion both with the marginal disposition to consume the good and with its characteristics and substitutability as well as with the pollutant spatial separability lee and roland holst 2002 analyzed the trade induced pollution transfer studying its implications for japan s investment and assistance dong and bai 2015 evaluated the influence of environmental regulation on the industrial location choice as well as the effect of pollution heaven in china their results showed that this kind of effect is significant in particular pollution intensive industries tend to move toward the central and western regions where the environmental regulations are weaker weng et al 2017 analyzed the driving factors of pollutants emission based on the data of 285 cities in china from 2004 to 2013 part of results showed that with the increase of population density and the expansion of space a pollution transfer occurred among different scales and degrees of economic development the above mentioned studies mainly focused on static data and relationship studies however the environmental impacts of inter city economic trade still need to be discussed available studies coupling urban economy with pollution mainly related to traditional panel data and environmental kuznets curves ekcs more in detail tian and xie 2017 studied the relationship between china s agricultural per capita carbon dioxide emissions per capita and gross national product per capita this work demonstrated that the relationship between the two is consistent with kuznets theory fan and ma 2016 calculated the land carbon and water footprints using an input output approach then they integrated the footprints using the vertical and horizontal deviation maximization method analyzing the environmental kuznets curve of the footprints synthesis index as well as the indicators of footprints family wang and chen 2016 applied a cluster analysis to statistical economic and pollution data for 20 major city clusters in china in 2013 the purpose was to fit the ekcs of all city clusters they classified the 20 city clusters and quantitatively determined the relevant relationships between economic development and environmental pollution as well as the turning point of development in each type of cluster lu et al 2017 calculated the relationship among energy economy and environment 3e by constructing a coupled model showing that the economic and environmental comprehensive index for several provinces continuously tended to rise while more specifically energy index has a stable positive trend with little fluctuations wang 2016 analyzed the relationship between the economic growth and pollution load for beijing based on the ekcs from year 1990 to year 2014 their results showed that the total amount for most of the emissions remains at a high level while the intensity for most of the pollutants arrived at a turning point around 2006 mazur et al 2015 explored the relationship between carbon dioxide and economic growth for european union countries from 1992 to 2010 their research didn t confirm empirically the existence of any u shaped ekc almeida et al 2017 used the modified composite index of environmental performance mciep as a measure of environmental damage gdp per capita was also considered to represent economic growth their results confirmed that at present the ekc hypothesis is not proved moreover economic growth alone is not enough to improve environmental quality liddle 2015 tested an inverted u relationship between gdp per capita and three urban transport related emissions in particular they found that per capita emissions of co vhc and nox in relation to urban transport firstly increased and then declined depending on the observed individual income levels biswas et al 2012 based their work on a two stage game theory model using the panel data referred to the years 1999 2005 of more than 100 countries they studied in this way the influence of shadow economy on pollution as well as the impacts of corruption on such dynamics results showed that the relationship between the shadow economy and the levels of pollution are dependent on the levels of corruption liu et al 2015 applied a system dynamics method and built a beijing urban passenger transport carbon model this model included different subsystems economy population transport energy consumption and co2 emission subsystems and set different scenarios a special reason for interest is the use of flow diagrams which are able to unveil the causal flow connections along processes results showed that administrative rules and regulations management arm had the best overall effect of the individual policies on both energy savings and emission reductions similarly the work by liu et al 2017 focused on the quantification of traffic atmospheric environmental capacity taec and total atmospheric environmental carrying capacity taecc demonstrated the ability of capturing within a model both complexity and interactions within the same mode their results applying this approach showed that nox carrying capacity is a key restraining factor of taec moreover the change of taecc and taecc s service life under the circumstance of clean vehicle strategy and mobility management strategy was analyzed brouwer et al 2018 introduced the concept of nexus pointing out that ignoring synergies and trade offs between energy and natural flows misleading modeling outcomes can be obtained most of current studies mainly focus on the static data and static analysis on the relationship between the economy and pollution thus we are still at the initial period of studying the coupling relationship between urban economy and pollution by constructing a network model being able to provide new perspectives in this field despite the large number of available studies the use of network models for highlighting the coupling between urban economy and pollution is still limited in fact present studies mostly focus on static indicators related to environmental and economic variables almost ignoring the dynamics behind urban economy and pollution interactions at river basin scale instead it is known that urban development nearby rivers adversely impact on riverine ecosystems consequently it would be urgent to develop and test new network models to track the relationships between the direct indirect transfer of regional pollutants and economic development moreover under the framework of river basin studies both human geography and sustainable development studies pay a great attention to the development of city spaces and the coupling relationship between economy and pollution at local and regional scales this paper is focused on the construction of a coupling model of urban economy and pollution at the river basin scale simulating its evolution as a complex network system all the cities in the network are regarded as the agents each urban behavioral pattern is analyzed by considering three aspects for all the agents network concentration network size link intensity the final aim is to determine the possible impacts of economic interaction among cities coupled with the overall environmental quality of the river basin the process involved the definition of a virtual network environment through computer system in particular a certain number of agents i e cities was fixed identifying their unique attributes consequently this study establishes an ideal and conceptual model in which the nodes in the model are cities instead of countries different agents interactions were tested in order to reproduce the macroscopic characteristics of the system as a whole meanwhile different groups of indicators were used to analyze the features of the observed macro complex system whose overall characteristics and evolution were also studied finally the interactive development of cities in the entire river basin was considered looking to the driving factors of coupled economic interaction and pollution transfer among cities in the same basin 2 methods 2 1 modeling tool simulation approach and model hypothesis network analysis is a method for studying the relationships among the components of a network ecological network analysis represents its application to a given ecosystem e g hannon 1990 gattie et al 2006 dame and christian 2008a b mao et al 2010 mao and yang 2012 chen and chen 2015 in recent years ecological network analysis was applied also to coupled social economic systems ecological network analysis method ena was widely used in urban ecosystem for example zhang et al 2014 analyzed china s basic metabolic processes and the network relationships within the components of the system these were divided into seven parts internal environment agricultural sector manufacturing sector domestic sector recycling sector and external environment then producers consumers and decomposers were identified to analyze the trophic level of the system mao and yang 2012 studied the interaction among different trade sectors in baiyangdian basin using network control analysis utility analysis unit environ and final ratio liu et al 2010 established an urban metabolic network model for beijing china based on its extended exergy of utilization to assess its metabolic processes this paper showed the major controlling factors and the factors which have the larger environmental burden yang et al 2012 identified and quantified the mutual interactions and control relationships within an embodied pm2 5 network model this included 15 components based on an input output analysis ioa liu et al 2015 aimed to improve reserve design and connectivity of wuyishan nature reserve consequently network cyclicity degree of cyclicity and degree of connectedness were introduced both to measure the presence and strength of cyclic pathways in a network and to reflect the network s ability to transfer bio fluxes in fact these indicators can quantify the integrity and continuity of a network as well as the relation between network organization and ecological process this research which included a 10 year time interval identified different areas of wuyishan city which went through landscape degradation and restoration zhang et al 2016 analyzed the delivery and transformation processes and internal characteristics of the industrial metabolic processes for sulfur in the shandong lubei eco industrial park ecological network analysis method was used to analyze structural and functional characteristics of this network from the perspective of nodes and paths and identified the key peripheral nodes and paths in the network currently the study of ecological network analysis applied to urban industrial sectors ignores the transfer of factors at the regional scale the spatial analysis model also ignores the consistency of spatial dependency and spatial relation structures therefore the present key problem is to study the relationships between regional pollutants transfer and economic growth by network analysis among the possible approaches multi agent simulation method already showed its capability in being effective for this purpose in recent years it was increasingly used for social and ecological studies han et al 2017 liu et al 2017 avci and selim 2016 wang 2016 and it is now mainly used to assess the interaction and relationship among small agents at network scale bousquet and le page 2004 proposed a detailed review on the development and use of multi agent simulations mas for ecosystem management in their paper the authors pointed out that mas are useful for the problems including social and spatial aspects in addition the authors also thought that the mas can be used in the ecosystem management to go beyond the role of individual and to study more deeply on the organization and interactions among different organization levels therefore this paper chose the mas as the main method to study the relationship and interaction of cities in the river basin scale among all the available simulation environments we choose the netlogo software which was developed at northwestern university https ccl northwestern edu netlogo netlogo is ideal for the problem investigated in this study since it can represent agents cities that are both spatially distributed and also embodied within networks for trading since its development netlogo has been widely used for different applications in the field of environmental ecology due to its simplicity and ease of operation for example banitz et al 2015 simulated the mineralization of carbon and nitrogen in soils through the interaction with soil microbes by constructing netlogo models zhang 2016b used this software to establish a cooperative behavior simulation model and added a third party supervisor which re allocated resources among participants his results showed that the survival space for cooperators can be expanded and system robustness can be increased after adding the re allocator in the system chiacchio et al 2014 made a review and gave some future perspectives about the netlogo applications to immunology fu 2014 used the netlogo software to simulate the agents behaviors based on an evolutionary model he found that opponents would dominate in a world without punishments and their behaviors would also increase pollution anderson et al 2017 simulated animals individual behaviors within a community setting four scenarios the results showed that this framework can provide an effective alternative to traditional animal movement simulation methods barau and qureshi 2015 analyzed the iskandar malaysia s current and future fragmentation dynamics finding that in the future fragmentation and landscape homogenization will intensify posing more risks to landscape quality functions and socio ecological services gao et al 2016 calculated the high speed railway carrying capacity of beijing shanghai by using netlogo software showing that the proposed multi agent method is feasible for this purpose wang 2016 verified the effectiveness of the cr bdi model by using netlogo software a comparison between cr bdi and bdi modeling results was performed assessing that cr bdi is a better option karsai et al 2016 simulated the relationship between the occurrence of forest fires and the distribution of organisms in the forest this study demonstrated that the main cause of forest fire lies in the superposition of at least two different organisms rather than a single organism liu and chen 2014 constructed a co evolution game model applied to an unexpected environmental pollution major accident performing a simulation analysis based on a multi agent society qiu et al 2016 built a multi agent simulation model of the emission permits trading system on the basis of the complex adaptive system cas and multi agent system mas in particular they simulated the agents behavior in the emission permits trading system their results demonstrated that the trade costs gradually decrease as the amount of trade increases they also showed that government regulations could effectively reduce collusion behavior however when the level of the regulation reaches a certain point the effect is small due to the increase of regulatory input apart from its applications to ecology and environmental studies netlogo has also been widely used in social and economic development research such as enterprise economy industrial economy agricultural economy trading economy as well as computer software development and applications this paper used link intensity network size and network concentration as characteristic variables the main assumptions are described in the following sub sections this paper was developed on the basis of network grow theory whose basic law is that growth obeys to a certain power law distribution which should be identified as a special case there is the linear increase of resources in several network real case studies this study is aimed at defining a model which can well approximate real resources flows and couplings in order to identify the dynamics which regulates the network structure and its modification during the flow of various elements network growth model attributes some simple rules to the existing nodes whose interaction can eventually emerge through real observations or statistical analyses under this framework the most well known rule is the priority linking one that is the nodes in the network are more likely to be connected with nodes with higher connection degree price 1965 studied a network representing papers citations he built a model with continuously new published articles added to the citation network by this model the author found that the probability of being cited is directly proportional to the number of citations barabasi and frangos 2014 proposed a scale free ba network based on price model the model had two evolution mechanism growth and priority connection the probability of priority connection depends on the amount of resources owned by each agent barabasi et al 2001 proposed a fitness model again based on price model due to the fact that this work is focused on many cities within a basin the environmental kuznets curve ekc approach cannot be used since ekc is mainly used to study the relationship between the economy and pollution in a single country or city this is done through the collection and collation of economic and pollution data instead by building a network model it is possible to analyze the various relationships that exist between the various components in the system moreover compared with ekc the network modeling method can better observe the flow of various flows in the system so as to more dynamically study the economic pollution relationships existing between cities the approach discussed in this paper has a complementary purpose with respect to the application of pollutant diffusion models in fact the application of models broadly aimed at identifying the sources paths and targets of dispersed pollutants are necessary for intervention purposes in order to identify and protect the potential targets of harmful emissions however the focus on who should be responsible to act first is only implicit in this case this is instead relevant from a legal and administration perspective considering that many public bodies and different administrative levels are usually involved at the basin scale identifying the structure and complexity of production flows and the emission potentially associated to each step of such productions a sort of hierarchy of responsibilities is identified this responsibility chain and hierarchy identifies also who should pay first for it only within this context the use of economic structure and production flows to represent the economic complexity within a basin is sufficient obviously on the other side this model is not able to capture the targets with the same quality of diffusion model such as wrf chem or other assessed atmospheric diffusion models combined with the use of monitoring networks this is why we indicate such an approach as important but complementary consequently the complexity of geographical and atmospheric factors like orography surface parameters quality of inventories and measures seasonality model resolution and uncertainties whose importance for diffusion models is assessed by the scientific literature e g arciszewska and mcclatchey 2001 casazza et al 2013 scarino et al 2014 pan et al 2015 beegum et al 2016 oda et al 2017 are not taken into account here this paper will also apply the same property to define the proposed model however in order to reduce the simulation uncertainties we run the simulation process for 10 time and 20 time respectively to verify the errors between the two simulation processes 2 1 1 invariant network size the network size is the number of nodes in a network to a certain degree it represents the amount of resources in the entire network organization but also reflects the amount of resources that can be transferred among nodes in the network in our case a larger network size can increase the frequency and intensity of inter city economic trades consequently a variety of economic factors can be more widely transmitted and at the same time the strength of economic interaction among cities can also make the city more willing to pay attention to pollution control enhancing the environmental quality of the entire river basin therefore being the network size an important structural feature of the network organization it is maintained relatively stable within the simulation process highlighting the impact of other factors and simplifying the research process 2 1 2 link intensity link intensity including strong and weak connections refers to the interaction frequency among nodes in a given network organization connection strength mainly depends on a certain degree of cooperation among the components of a system for example this connection mainly exists in agents with similar social and economic activities in this case the probability of interaction among them increases due to the similarity and complementary in economic activities in our model each city is represented as agent has the tendency to establish a connection with those having a bigger economic scale instead a weak connection is a source of heterogeneous information in the network organization becoming also the basis for an expanding interaction within the network organization here a special attention is given to the inter city pollution transfer caused by the economic trade activities in cities weaker links representing here the pollution sources are associated to pollution transfer resulting from the economic interactions among cities the used model is based on the assumption that pollution transfer among cities is partly caused by economic trade such weak links are also the basis of the expansion of scope of agents interactions in the network accordingly this interaction will display other corresponding impacts on economic connections moreover agents with strong connections generally will have an established higher degree of trust having similar characteristics due to this kind of similarity and complementary their probability of interaction in the network increases finally the interaction strength among cities will affect their economic at different degrees the intensity of the connection is mainly expressed by quantifying the interaction frequency of the connection with the formula 1 l i n where l represents the link intensity in the network while i is the number of nodes in the network finally n represents the number of nodes in the network 2 1 3 network centrality concentration network concentration reflects the degree of centralization and the distribution of economic development in the network it is indirectly related both to the status and to the degree of pollution transfer in this paper the concentration rate index cr is mainly used to measure the concentration degree of urban economic development in the chosen region in particular cr is defined as the proportion of the economic development level of bigger cities in the river basin with respect to the overall development of all the cities in the whole river basin the formula is as follows 2 c r n i 1 n x i i 1 n x i where crn represents the concentration of n large cities in the network xi represents the gdp of the i th city in the network and n represents the total number of cities in the network 2 1 4 connection setting for nodes of the city pollution transfer among nodes in the network and the selection of economic connection targets are completed simultaneously in our simulation process simulation step length of 1 is repeated for a defined number of times during these steps pollution transfer gradually evolves among nodes representing the interacting cities in this study it is assumed that cities tend to have economic interactions with other cities having higher levels of economic development this is broadly the same statement of hidalgo and hausmann 2009 who demonstrated the existing relation between complex product flows directions and areas with higher know how and gdp moreover the transfer of economic factors is viewed as related to each city s absorptive capacity economic transformation capacity and economic level in the next section mediating variables which are related to the process of economic and pollutants transfer will be introduced that is how the economic flows affect the generation and transmission of pollution between cities 2 2 mediating variables economic absorptive capacity and pollution transfer capacity network organizations usually displays complex social and ecological relationships in our case the city is the node of the network formed by these relationships the driving force of economic interactions in cities results from the difference in their economic development which requires trade in order to achieve a certain level of economic complementary in this case the economic absorptive capacity of the less developed cities which receive the economic flows from urban centers with relatively higher economic development plays an important role in the characteristic of network organization however at the same time economic trade parallels a corresponding pollution transfer consequently this type of pollution transfer may lead to a spillover effect i e small cities will be polluted through accepting the economic flow from big cities thus the determination of the relationship between economic trade and pollution transfer becomes crucial during the simulation of combined economy pollution transfer in the network the economic absorptive capacity and the nodes ability for pollution transfer are taken into account due to the different level of economic development among cities a bound exists among cities with higher and lower economic development the economic potential difference between cities leads to the inter city economic flows here we consider the gdp level of each city in order to simplify the simulation process more in detail economic flows are generally directed toward cities with lower economic potential being originated from urban centers with higher economic potential on the basis of each city s existing gdp a given absorption coefficient indicates how much economic flows are absorbed by the cities with low economic potential the absorption coefficient of the i th node is indicated with ci ci changes with the node of gdp as a random variable here multi agent simulation is used to study the influence of micro agents interactions on the whole system using a bottom up approach property values of each agent are randomly set meanwhile the parameter α i is associated to ci represents a correction factor consistent with the observed growth rate of the gdp level xi on this basis the absorption coefficient formula is obtained 3 c i 1 1 e α i x i the same formula is derived from zhang 2015 who developed it to represent the knowledge transfer among agents of a network during such a process the nodes knowledge absorption capacity and innovation capacity were considered in particular based on the existing knowledge stocks for each agent an absorption coefficient was given to the absorption capacity of the agent which was expressed as a function of the existing knowledge stock and absorption coefficient the endowment of each agent in the network is different and the initial stock based on this is the initial state based on the above contents about network knowledge transfer this paper also gave an economic absorption coefficient and a pollution transfer coefficient to the economic interaction activities among cities in the river basin respectively to indicate the level of absorption of economic flows and the level of pollution generation and transfer among cities in the river basin the coefficient ai in the formula is mainly used to control the rate of increase of ci with gdp level in the network agents i e cities implement economic trade while a corresponding pollution transfer also occurs therefore for every node a coefficient ω i of pollution transfer which is the pollution transfer coefficient of the node in the economic interaction is assigned a coefficient γ i is defined to control the growth ceiling while another coefficient β i is used to fix the speed of ω i with the increase of xi thus the formula is as follows 4 ω i γ i 1 e β i x i inter city economic interactions in the network are consistent with pollution transfer the amount of pollution transfer is based on the inter city economic interaction when a city receives the economic flow from other cities it will further develop and produce new pollution and then transfer the pollution generated by itself here we combined the above pollution transfer coefficient and city economic level to quantify the existing relationship between inter city pollution transfer using the following formula 5 w i i 1 n ω x n in the formula wi represents the amount of pollution transferred between two cities x represents the level of urban economic growth ω is the pollution transfer coefficient of the city and n represents the number of cities finally according to the above analysis the model of urban pollution transfer in river basins is obtained 6 y c 1 ωi rij s where r represents the economic difference between the two cities i and j and s is an arbitrary constant 2 3 netlogo software modeling netlogo software was developed by northwestern university in 2002 and it was programmable modeling environment for the simulation of natural and social phenomena it is particularly suitable for modeling complex systems that evolve over time wilensky 1999 the simulation processes can be understood from three aspects agents spatial expression and simulation advance 1 agents the virtual world of netlogo was comprised by agents turtles and the agents perform related activities by accepting some rules the agents in the world interact with each other and influence each other in the world 2 spatial expression this refers to the virtual coordinates of patches and turtles in the netlogo space the attributes of each agent include their positions in the world 3 simulation advance the simulation process is recycling and specific simulation advancements include initial procedure and running procedure the initial procedure can generate multiple agents and give the agents different initial state on the basis of initial procedure the go procedure achieves the activities of the agents and repeat the implementation until the simulation process stops 2 3 1 settings for simulation parameters various simulation situations are simulated by adjusting the parameters in the procedure table 1 details the specific names of parameters and settings for attributes the basis for the initial values in the table 1 the initial value of number of nodes is set to 40 the reason is that we selected 40 cities as the agents of the network 2 the initial value of absorb coefficient is set to 0 02 this implies that 2 of the economic flows are absorbed by cities which receive the economic flow 3 the initial value of pollution transfer is set to 0 02 this is due to the fact that about 2 of pollution is generated and transferred among cities in the river basin 4 the initial value of pollution transfer upper growth limit was set to 0 5 this upper limit was set to control the value of pollution transfer in the whole river basin 5 other parameters like gdp level network center degree link intensity network size and economic transfer thresholds were all given within range of values this means that these values are adjustable and controllable within the model 2 3 2 simulation procedures the simulation procedures of this study is represented in fig 1 the first step determines whether the number of simulations reaches the maximum if it does then end the procedure otherwise continue to the next the maximum number of this study was 100 steps the second step determines the existing connections of the node if there is a connection then perform pollution transfer otherwise go to the fourth step in the city interaction and the establishment of a connection the third step follows to select interactive targets according to the economic scale of city cities tend to connect to nodes of higher economic scale pollution transfer is related to the absorptive capacity of the node pollution transfer ability and the size of the economy after completing a transfer the simulation enters in the fourth step which is aimed to establish new connections with cities the probability for a city to establish a connection relates to the economic scale of a city 2 3 3 simulation scheme design initial values for each indicator formulas and additional conditions were detailed before now each scenario is detailed accordingly 2 3 3 1 scenario one with the network evolution progress the main simulation changes the initialconcentration of the network fixes other parameters and analyzes the level of economic development and pollution transfer of a city in the whole network system here we set the parameters as follows the scale of the network organization was 40 meaning 40 cities in the network connection intensity was 1 meaning the frequency of inter city interaction in the network is 1 the threshold value of economic transfer was 1 3 of the economic difference the absorption coefficient α was 0 02 the coefficient β controlling the growth rate of the pollution transfer coefficient was 0 02 and the pollution transfer coefficient growth ceiling γ was 0 5 the economic development in city and pollution transfer were analyzed in the network by changing the initial concentration rate cr from 0 1 0 8 2 3 3 2 scenario two along with the advance of network evolution the main simulation changes scale fixes other parameters and analyzes of the level of economic development and pollution transfer of a city in the entire network system here the parameters were as follows the initial concentration and connection intensity were quantitative with the initial concentration for a higher level of economic development in experiment 1 being 0 2 with a connection intensity of 1 meaning the frequency of inter city interaction in the network was 1 the threshold value of economic transfer was 1 3 of the economic difference and absorption coefficient α was 0 02 the coefficient β controlling the growth rate of the pollution transfer coefficient was 0 02 and the pollution transfer coefficient growth ceiling γ was 0 5 the city economic development and pollution transfer were analyzed in the network by changing the scale of the network from 40 to 200 2 3 3 3 scenario three along with the advance of network evolution the main simulation changes the connection intensity of the network fixes other parameters and analyzes of the level of economic development and pollution transfer of a city in the entire network system here the parameters were as follows the initial concentration and connection intensity were quantitative with the initial concentration for a higher level of economic development in experiment 1 being 0 2 and the number of cities being 40 the threshold value of economic transfer was 1 3 of the economic difference and the absorption coefficient α was 0 02 the coefficient β controlling the growth rate of the pollution transfer coefficient was 0 02 and the pollution transfer coefficient growth ceiling γ was 0 5 the city economic development and pollution transfer in the network were analyzed by changing the connection intensity from 0 5 to 3 2 3 3 4 scenario four along with the advance of network evolution the main simulation changes economic development thresholds fixes other parameters and analyzes of the level of economic development and pollution transfer of a city in the entire network system here the parameters were as follows the initial concentration and connection intensity were quantitative with the initial concentration for a higher level of economic development in experiment 1 being 0 2 and the number of cities being 40 the connection intensity is 1 and the absorption coefficient α was 0 02 the coefficient β controlling the growth rate of the pollution transfer coefficient was 0 02 and the pollution transfer coefficient growth ceiling γ was 0 5 the city economic development and pollution transfer in the network were analyzed by changing the economic development thresholds with 1 2 1 3 1 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation output in this process of simulation the simulation of the network was designed to stop at 100 steps because the evolution law of the overall network can be observed after that figs 2 and 3 show the initial state and the completion status of a simulation process in figs 2 and 3 the dots indicate the cities in the network the links between the dots indicate the economic relationship between the cities while the number above each dot represents the economic development of every city fig 3 was obtained after the completion of the simulation as can be seen in fig 3 the economic development level of each city increased after the establishment of an economic link between cities at the same time the degree of connection of the entire network was greatly increased figs 4 and 5 show the specific numerical output images of figs 1 and 2 and were more convenient to obtain the conclusions that we want as it can be seen with the advance of the simulation process both the economic scale of the network and the amount of pollution transfer increased to different degrees the conclusions of whether this change will occur in different situations can be drawn from the results of this study 3 2 simulation results and analysis 3 2 1 simulation results and analysis of scenario one in scenario one keeping other variables unchanged and only altering the network concentration the changing trend of the overall urban economy size and the amount of pollution transfer in the network was analyzed when the network concentration rate increased the results of the simulation data are shown as follows after analysis as can be seen in figs 6 and 7 the economic development and pollution transfer in the whole network show the same trend with the increase of network concentration with two inverted u curves when cr is 0 3 and 0 5 respectively in other cases economic size and pollution transfer are at a low level we can conclude that when the network centrality is not 0 3 or 0 5 a core city exists in the network the core city is often higher in status and more easily obtains the required resources from other cities from trade cooperation due to the different statuses of cities the efficiency of economic flow is low and the efficiency of pollution decreases thus the transfer of pollution is reduced however when the network centrality is 0 3 and 0 5 the status of cities in the network is fairly equal the efficiency of economic flow becomes high and the efficiency of pollution increases thus the transfer of pollution goes up therefore the coupling of economy and pollution will only lead to an irreversible chain reaction of the greater concentration rate of city narrowing scale of economy and small transfer of pollution according to the existing state of development scenario one was mainly used to analyze the economic development of the whole city and the situation of pollution transfer by changing the concentration rate of the network the results indicate that when the cr is around 0 4 the economic size is higher therefore the economic scale of small and medium sized cities should be expanded in an appropriate way and the economic differences between large and small cities should be reduced however the small and medium sized cities should not be increased to the same extent as the big cities due to the increase of pollution from the results of error analysis as reported in table 2 we can see that the error between the 10 time simulation and 20 time simulation is less than 10 according to several previous works sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a b when the error is around 20 results are considered valid therefore the results of this paper are reliable and give the proof of the influence of cr on the relationship between total amount of economic size and pollution transfer in the whole river basin the processes of validation for scenarios 2 4 are same as the validation of scenario 1 thus we will only show the error analysis chart in the first three scenarios tables 3 7 3 2 2 simulation results and analysis of scenario two in scenario two only the network size was changed which is the number of cities in the network the changing trend of the overall urban economy size and the amount of pollution transfer in network was then analyzed when the network size increases the results of the simulation data are shown as follows after analysis as seen in figs 8 and 9 the level of economic development and the amount of pollution transfer change differently when the network size increases in particular when the city number increases the level of economic development in the network increases on the other side the pollution transfer amount remains the same with the increase of the network size even declining slightly there may be two reasons for this 1 the increase in the number of cities dilutes pollution considering the degree of each city to accommodate pollution taking into account the disposal of pollution in all cities thus after the increase of nodes efforts to dispose of the pollution increases while the achieved effect is exactly the overall reduction of the pollution transfer amount 2 trade is one way to realize the transfer of pollution each city can share a certain amount of pollution through multilateral trade therefore taking preventative measures pollution transfer in the whole area will be eased scenario two analyzed the overall economic development and pollution transfer in the region by changing the network size i e the number of cities the results show that the economic size increases with the increase in network size number of cities while the amount of pollution transfer decreases with the increase in network size here we mainly considered the dilution level of the city on pollution and the impact of multilateral trade in cities on the amount of pollution transfer therefore an appropriate increase in the number of cities in the economic linkage network will balance the relationship between economic size and pollution transfer when economic efficiency increases more and more cities will participate in the process of economic interaction at this time economic activities will become more frequent therefore more and more pollutants will be produced this phenomenon also known as rebound effect is well assessed in the literature e g figge et al 2014 li et al 2017b ouyang et al 2018 in this case as far as the previous assumptions are concerned not only will there be economic exchanges and pollution transfer processes among cities but more cities will also pay more attention to the disposal of pollution so the efficiency of the treatment of pollution will further increase ultimately the overall environmental quality of the entire basin will be improved to some extent 3 2 3 simulation results and analysis of scenario three in scenario three only the link intensity was changed the varying trend of the overall urban economy size and the amount of pollution transfer in the network were analyzed when the link intensity increases as is seen in figs 10 and fig 11 when the link intensity is around 1 the economic size and the amount of pollution transfer are at the highest levels this demonstrates that the intensity of the connection between the cities is not necessarily the bigger the better or the smaller the better moreover there is a link to the most suitable interval in particular when the link intensity reaches 1 the economic size and the amount of pollution transfer rises after reaching 1 the level of economic size and pollution transfer are lower like the inverted u curves therefore appropriate control of the number of connections between cities may enlarge the economic scale of the entire network however due to the number of cities and the fact that urban sewage capacity is limited the regional pollution emissions may increase 3 2 4 simulation results and analysis of scenario four in scenario four only the economic development threshold was changed the changing trend of the overall urban economy scale and the amount of pollution transfer in the network was analyzed when the economic development threshold was changed the results of the simulation data are shown as follows after analysis figs 12 19 show the trends of the overall urban economy and pollution transfer in the region with the increase of urban network concentration in the context of three different economic transfer thresholds three cases show an approximate trend in the range of 0 3 0 5 the economic size and pollution transfer levels are high figs 18 and 19 compares the three cases in particular when the network concentration of the city is within the range of 0 1 0 3 the change of the economic transfer threshold has little effect on the economic size and the pollution transfer with the increase of the initial concentration the threshold effect on the two gradually increased especially when the initial concentration is 0 7 0 8 the greatest impact was recorded this shows that if the economic differences between the city is too large this will affect the measure of defined variables scenario four mainly analyzed the overall economic development and pollution transfer in the region by changing the economic transfer thresholds between cities results indicate that when the initial concentration of the city is within the range of 0 1 0 3 the change of the economic transfer threshold has little effect on the economic size and the pollution transfer moreover with the increase of the initial concentration the threshold effect on the two gradually increased especially in the case of initial concentration values of 0 7 0 8 when the greatest impact is recorded thus it is important to narrow the economic differences between cities 3 3 discussion our results can be summarized as follows 1 when the initial centrality of big cities in a network is from 0 1 to 0 3 and from 0 4 to 0 5 the economic scale and the amount of pollution transfer goes up the changing trends of these two being nearly the same when the centrality of the network is neither 0 3 not 0 5 a core city exists in the network with fairly high status which more easily gains wanted resources via trade among cooperating cities however due to the difference in status the efficiency of economic flow becomes low and the efficiency of producing pollution decreases thus the amount of pollution transfer diminishes 2 when the centrality of the network is 0 3 and 0 5 the status of cities in the network is equal while the efficiencies of economic flow and of producing pollution increase thus the amount of pollution transfer increases therefore it is necessary to appropriately increase the economic scale of small and medium sized cities to reduce the economic differences among large medium and small scale cities as well as to appropriately regulate the relationship between the scale of economic development and environmental pollution in the region 3 the level of economic development and the amount of pollution transfer change display an opposite trend with respect to the increase of urban scale in particular with the increase of cities number the level of economic development in the network increases while the amount of pollution transfer decreases the possible reason is that the increase in the number of cities dilutes the pollution and increases the intensity of pollution disposal it is also possible that the inter city multilateral trade in the region transfers pollution to different cities reducing the amount of pollutants shared by each of them and reducing the total amount of pollutants to a certain extent 4 when the connection intensity is 1 the levels of economic development and the amount of pollution transfer reach a maximum value this indicates that high or low connection intensity among cities does not indicate better economic development on the contrary when economic interaction is more frequent the phenomenon of pollution transfer is more serious the scale of economy and the amount of pollution transfer reach a peak at 1 the corresponding curve inverted u shape therefore the appropriate control of the number of connections among cities may enlarge the economic scale of the entire network however due to the number of cities and urban sewage capacity the pollution emissions in the region increase 5 the difference in urban economic transfer thresholds will also lead to changes of the overall economic size and pollution transfer the higher threshold of economic links among cities will inhibit the economic scale growth in the network the effect of economic transfer threshold on the overall economic scale and pollution transfer in the region increases with the increase of the initial concentration therefore in order to promote the regional economy and the environmental sustainability the nodes in the network should be in a reasonable open state both with respect to the economic level of the city economic and trade and with respect to pollution transfer control due to the complexity of economic trade and pollution transmission processes there are many points which require further investigation model building the economic trade and pollution transmission between cities are affected by many factors the influencing factors selected by this study are only part of them using this part we put forward the ideal and conceptual model which may be biased for the results so this is the next step needed for more in depth consideration of the study resistance interface this study is mainly to model the ideal states without considering the resistance interface such as the direction of river flow propagation distance and trade which makes the study proceed smoothly but also makes the results of the study cannot accurately reflect the reality therefore in the next step we will consider the influence of the resistance interface and establish the resistance model which is compared with the result of the ideal model this will make the research more practical significance further integration and validation through 3d environmental monitoring while this study is focused on creating different reference scenarios within a river basin aimed at integrating socio economic and environmental pollutant dynamics appropriate monitoring technologies presently allow to develop 3d monitoring of pollutants and their dynamics lega and persechino 2014 lega et al 2014 errico et al 2015 lin et al 2015 casazza et al 2018 these data their analysis and spatial representation through gis tools could complement and further validate the results of our models 4 conclusions this paper studies the relationship between economy and pollution by constructing a model of inter city economic trade in river basin scale some preliminary conclusions have been made and the cities in the basin are regarded as different agents in the network and the interaction between cities is realized by simulation method as remarked in the premises the application of the defined method which identifies the connection among production flows economic structure complexity and emissions is able to highlight the hierarchy of responsibilities among agents in polluting the atmosphere thus evidencing who should pay and intervene first this approach obviously is complementary but not substitute to other models which support the assessment of sources paths and targets and are crucial in determining the characteristics of interventions and planning actions results support the following statements 1 the most suitable network concentration for the economic size and pollution transfer is not the biggest one but the middle one 0 3 0 5 which means there is a most suitable interval for this kind of influence 2 after the increase of cities efforts to dispose of the pollution increases and the actual effect achieved is also increased trade is one way to realize the transfer of pollution each city can share a certain amount of pollution through multilateral trade 3 the link intensity between the cities is not necessarily the bigger the better or the smaller the better and there is a most suitable interval 4 the difference of urban economic development will also lead to changes of the overall economic size and pollution transfer the higher economic difference between cities will inhibit the growth of the scale of the economy in the network in general there is still a lot of space for the study of the economic pollution relationship among cities at river basin scale in particular after the introduction of the simulation research method the static network research can be dynamically expanded to make it more practical however we still have to consider a variety of factors as well as the establishment of a more realistic model of the simulation model in particular due to the complexity of inter urban economic exchange and pollution transmission this research will require further developments with a more systematical perspective which will allow to implement the knowledge of economy and pollution directional transmission among cities within the same river basin acknowledgments this work is supported by national key r d program of china no 2016yfc0502800 projects of

25289,rapid urbanization greatly accelerated economic and social development in key river basins of china but also created numerous environmental problems from the local to the global scale including increased air and water pollution and decreased water supply local climate alteration and increased energy demands as well as a major reduction in natural vegetation production and carbon storage sequestration the correlation analysis between urban economy and pollution transfer among cities in river basins has become one of highlights in current researches based on the netlogo software platform this paper establishes a correlation model among cities in the same river basin from the point of view of multi agent simulation moreover it assesses the relationship between urban economic development and pollution transfer from three aspects network concentration network size link intensity the influence of network concentration and link intensity on the total economic size and pollution transfer of the entire river basin is similar in parallel the influence of network size on the two modelled variables shows an opposite trend demonstrating that network size has a greater impact on the city by comparing the trend of economic size and pollution transfer with the change of network concentration in the context of different economic transfer thresholds results demonstrate that with the increase of network concentration the influence becomes more pronounced appropriate error analysis was used to validate the simulation results in particular according to it the error between 10 time and 20 time steps simulation is less than 10 consequently the simulation results are valid this paper deepening the research on the correlation among river basin cities lays the foundation for further research on the directional transmission of the economy and pollution keywords urbanization netlogo multi agent simulation economy pollution nexus 1 introduction since its reform and opening up china has witnessed a great breakthrough in its economy however this was followed by a variety of environmental pollution problems which have become the toughest and the most concerning issues in the context of chinese urbanization urbanization is causing serious disturbances and destruction of the ecological environment in river basins xu 2011 both environmental and resources related problems in river basins which were caused by urbanization are mainly reflected into water and air pollution water shortages over exploitation of groundwater as well as local health problems caused by polluted air the adverse effects of urbanization on basins water quality has recently become a hot issue the widely reported cases of cancer villages in the huaihe river basin china whose distribution declines from east to west reflecting also economic development and environmental pollution between eastern and western china is one among the possible examples the atlas of the water environment and digestive tumor cancer mortality in the huaihe river basin published in year 2013 first confirmed the direct relationship between the high incidence of cancer and water pollution in the huaihe river basin approximately 60 of cancer villages are found within 3 km from rivers while 81 are within 5 km from rivers this demonstrates that rivers water quality is an important factor on cancer villages gong and zhang 2013 the urbanization spatial and socio economical dynamics are closely related to the emergence of these environmental hotpots on one hand as a consequence of the further urban economic development cities cannot meet the needs of their inhabitants via their own development thus cities need to enhance their economic interactions or trade with surrounding cities on the other hand urban economic activities produce pollution of all types thus affecting the environment quality and the population health through a variety of media with the increase of population density and the expansion of space multiple and trans boundary pollution effects occur this phenomenon called pollution transfer as are already reported in the scientific literature e g casazza et al 2017 li et al 2017a liu et al 2017 in particular many scholars studied pollution transfer caused by economic trade several studies focused on the environmental pollution caused by inter regional trade for example okadera et al 2006 calculated the overall virtual water and pollution discharges in the yangtze river basin based on a regional input output model discussing about the influence of the final consumption by other regions on yangtze river basin li et al 2013 analyzed the embodied pollution inter regional transfer in china in particular they constructed an evaluation model of the embodied pollution inter regional transfer and calculated the pollution amount from four typical industrial pollutants on the basis of an input output table their results demonstrated that embodied pollution transfer in china is mainly directed from central and western china less developed to the more developed eastern coastal areas in fact the eastern areas shift their burden of pollution discharge to the central and western areas by inter regional trade tan and chen 2015 calculated the implicit carbon trade between china and the eu based on the multi regional input output model their work showed that the total amount of carbon embodied in trade between china and eu is increasing gao and liu 2016 calculated china s carbon emissions with respect to import and export from 38 countries moreover they compared the difference of virtual import emissions and actual import emissions between china and european countries meanwhile zhang 2016a targeted the embodied carbon emissions in export trade in sichuan province and measured the amount of the embodied carbon emissions by systematic analysis of the export data he then performed a comparative analysis between the results and the amount of national export embodied carbon emissions john 2014 analyzed the boundary conditions leading to positive welfare effects in particular in the case of trade with an embodied pollution transfer his results showed that countries welfare doesn t necessarily increase proportionally with distance from the pollution source location instead it grows in proportion both with the marginal disposition to consume the good and with its characteristics and substitutability as well as with the pollutant spatial separability lee and roland holst 2002 analyzed the trade induced pollution transfer studying its implications for japan s investment and assistance dong and bai 2015 evaluated the influence of environmental regulation on the industrial location choice as well as the effect of pollution heaven in china their results showed that this kind of effect is significant in particular pollution intensive industries tend to move toward the central and western regions where the environmental regulations are weaker weng et al 2017 analyzed the driving factors of pollutants emission based on the data of 285 cities in china from 2004 to 2013 part of results showed that with the increase of population density and the expansion of space a pollution transfer occurred among different scales and degrees of economic development the above mentioned studies mainly focused on static data and relationship studies however the environmental impacts of inter city economic trade still need to be discussed available studies coupling urban economy with pollution mainly related to traditional panel data and environmental kuznets curves ekcs more in detail tian and xie 2017 studied the relationship between china s agricultural per capita carbon dioxide emissions per capita and gross national product per capita this work demonstrated that the relationship between the two is consistent with kuznets theory fan and ma 2016 calculated the land carbon and water footprints using an input output approach then they integrated the footprints using the vertical and horizontal deviation maximization method analyzing the environmental kuznets curve of the footprints synthesis index as well as the indicators of footprints family wang and chen 2016 applied a cluster analysis to statistical economic and pollution data for 20 major city clusters in china in 2013 the purpose was to fit the ekcs of all city clusters they classified the 20 city clusters and quantitatively determined the relevant relationships between economic development and environmental pollution as well as the turning point of development in each type of cluster lu et al 2017 calculated the relationship among energy economy and environment 3e by constructing a coupled model showing that the economic and environmental comprehensive index for several provinces continuously tended to rise while more specifically energy index has a stable positive trend with little fluctuations wang 2016 analyzed the relationship between the economic growth and pollution load for beijing based on the ekcs from year 1990 to year 2014 their results showed that the total amount for most of the emissions remains at a high level while the intensity for most of the pollutants arrived at a turning point around 2006 mazur et al 2015 explored the relationship between carbon dioxide and economic growth for european union countries from 1992 to 2010 their research didn t confirm empirically the existence of any u shaped ekc almeida et al 2017 used the modified composite index of environmental performance mciep as a measure of environmental damage gdp per capita was also considered to represent economic growth their results confirmed that at present the ekc hypothesis is not proved moreover economic growth alone is not enough to improve environmental quality liddle 2015 tested an inverted u relationship between gdp per capita and three urban transport related emissions in particular they found that per capita emissions of co vhc and nox in relation to urban transport firstly increased and then declined depending on the observed individual income levels biswas et al 2012 based their work on a two stage game theory model using the panel data referred to the years 1999 2005 of more than 100 countries they studied in this way the influence of shadow economy on pollution as well as the impacts of corruption on such dynamics results showed that the relationship between the shadow economy and the levels of pollution are dependent on the levels of corruption liu et al 2015 applied a system dynamics method and built a beijing urban passenger transport carbon model this model included different subsystems economy population transport energy consumption and co2 emission subsystems and set different scenarios a special reason for interest is the use of flow diagrams which are able to unveil the causal flow connections along processes results showed that administrative rules and regulations management arm had the best overall effect of the individual policies on both energy savings and emission reductions similarly the work by liu et al 2017 focused on the quantification of traffic atmospheric environmental capacity taec and total atmospheric environmental carrying capacity taecc demonstrated the ability of capturing within a model both complexity and interactions within the same mode their results applying this approach showed that nox carrying capacity is a key restraining factor of taec moreover the change of taecc and taecc s service life under the circumstance of clean vehicle strategy and mobility management strategy was analyzed brouwer et al 2018 introduced the concept of nexus pointing out that ignoring synergies and trade offs between energy and natural flows misleading modeling outcomes can be obtained most of current studies mainly focus on the static data and static analysis on the relationship between the economy and pollution thus we are still at the initial period of studying the coupling relationship between urban economy and pollution by constructing a network model being able to provide new perspectives in this field despite the large number of available studies the use of network models for highlighting the coupling between urban economy and pollution is still limited in fact present studies mostly focus on static indicators related to environmental and economic variables almost ignoring the dynamics behind urban economy and pollution interactions at river basin scale instead it is known that urban development nearby rivers adversely impact on riverine ecosystems consequently it would be urgent to develop and test new network models to track the relationships between the direct indirect transfer of regional pollutants and economic development moreover under the framework of river basin studies both human geography and sustainable development studies pay a great attention to the development of city spaces and the coupling relationship between economy and pollution at local and regional scales this paper is focused on the construction of a coupling model of urban economy and pollution at the river basin scale simulating its evolution as a complex network system all the cities in the network are regarded as the agents each urban behavioral pattern is analyzed by considering three aspects for all the agents network concentration network size link intensity the final aim is to determine the possible impacts of economic interaction among cities coupled with the overall environmental quality of the river basin the process involved the definition of a virtual network environment through computer system in particular a certain number of agents i e cities was fixed identifying their unique attributes consequently this study establishes an ideal and conceptual model in which the nodes in the model are cities instead of countries different agents interactions were tested in order to reproduce the macroscopic characteristics of the system as a whole meanwhile different groups of indicators were used to analyze the features of the observed macro complex system whose overall characteristics and evolution were also studied finally the interactive development of cities in the entire river basin was considered looking to the driving factors of coupled economic interaction and pollution transfer among cities in the same basin 2 methods 2 1 modeling tool simulation approach and model hypothesis network analysis is a method for studying the relationships among the components of a network ecological network analysis represents its application to a given ecosystem e g hannon 1990 gattie et al 2006 dame and christian 2008a b mao et al 2010 mao and yang 2012 chen and chen 2015 in recent years ecological network analysis was applied also to coupled social economic systems ecological network analysis method ena was widely used in urban ecosystem for example zhang et al 2014 analyzed china s basic metabolic processes and the network relationships within the components of the system these were divided into seven parts internal environment agricultural sector manufacturing sector domestic sector recycling sector and external environment then producers consumers and decomposers were identified to analyze the trophic level of the system mao and yang 2012 studied the interaction among different trade sectors in baiyangdian basin using network control analysis utility analysis unit environ and final ratio liu et al 2010 established an urban metabolic network model for beijing china based on its extended exergy of utilization to assess its metabolic processes this paper showed the major controlling factors and the factors which have the larger environmental burden yang et al 2012 identified and quantified the mutual interactions and control relationships within an embodied pm2 5 network model this included 15 components based on an input output analysis ioa liu et al 2015 aimed to improve reserve design and connectivity of wuyishan nature reserve consequently network cyclicity degree of cyclicity and degree of connectedness were introduced both to measure the presence and strength of cyclic pathways in a network and to reflect the network s ability to transfer bio fluxes in fact these indicators can quantify the integrity and continuity of a network as well as the relation between network organization and ecological process this research which included a 10 year time interval identified different areas of wuyishan city which went through landscape degradation and restoration zhang et al 2016 analyzed the delivery and transformation processes and internal characteristics of the industrial metabolic processes for sulfur in the shandong lubei eco industrial park ecological network analysis method was used to analyze structural and functional characteristics of this network from the perspective of nodes and paths and identified the key peripheral nodes and paths in the network currently the study of ecological network analysis applied to urban industrial sectors ignores the transfer of factors at the regional scale the spatial analysis model also ignores the consistency of spatial dependency and spatial relation structures therefore the present key problem is to study the relationships between regional pollutants transfer and economic growth by network analysis among the possible approaches multi agent simulation method already showed its capability in being effective for this purpose in recent years it was increasingly used for social and ecological studies han et al 2017 liu et al 2017 avci and selim 2016 wang 2016 and it is now mainly used to assess the interaction and relationship among small agents at network scale bousquet and le page 2004 proposed a detailed review on the development and use of multi agent simulations mas for ecosystem management in their paper the authors pointed out that mas are useful for the problems including social and spatial aspects in addition the authors also thought that the mas can be used in the ecosystem management to go beyond the role of individual and to study more deeply on the organization and interactions among different organization levels therefore this paper chose the mas as the main method to study the relationship and interaction of cities in the river basin scale among all the available simulation environments we choose the netlogo software which was developed at northwestern university https ccl northwestern edu netlogo netlogo is ideal for the problem investigated in this study since it can represent agents cities that are both spatially distributed and also embodied within networks for trading since its development netlogo has been widely used for different applications in the field of environmental ecology due to its simplicity and ease of operation for example banitz et al 2015 simulated the mineralization of carbon and nitrogen in soils through the interaction with soil microbes by constructing netlogo models zhang 2016b used this software to establish a cooperative behavior simulation model and added a third party supervisor which re allocated resources among participants his results showed that the survival space for cooperators can be expanded and system robustness can be increased after adding the re allocator in the system chiacchio et al 2014 made a review and gave some future perspectives about the netlogo applications to immunology fu 2014 used the netlogo software to simulate the agents behaviors based on an evolutionary model he found that opponents would dominate in a world without punishments and their behaviors would also increase pollution anderson et al 2017 simulated animals individual behaviors within a community setting four scenarios the results showed that this framework can provide an effective alternative to traditional animal movement simulation methods barau and qureshi 2015 analyzed the iskandar malaysia s current and future fragmentation dynamics finding that in the future fragmentation and landscape homogenization will intensify posing more risks to landscape quality functions and socio ecological services gao et al 2016 calculated the high speed railway carrying capacity of beijing shanghai by using netlogo software showing that the proposed multi agent method is feasible for this purpose wang 2016 verified the effectiveness of the cr bdi model by using netlogo software a comparison between cr bdi and bdi modeling results was performed assessing that cr bdi is a better option karsai et al 2016 simulated the relationship between the occurrence of forest fires and the distribution of organisms in the forest this study demonstrated that the main cause of forest fire lies in the superposition of at least two different organisms rather than a single organism liu and chen 2014 constructed a co evolution game model applied to an unexpected environmental pollution major accident performing a simulation analysis based on a multi agent society qiu et al 2016 built a multi agent simulation model of the emission permits trading system on the basis of the complex adaptive system cas and multi agent system mas in particular they simulated the agents behavior in the emission permits trading system their results demonstrated that the trade costs gradually decrease as the amount of trade increases they also showed that government regulations could effectively reduce collusion behavior however when the level of the regulation reaches a certain point the effect is small due to the increase of regulatory input apart from its applications to ecology and environmental studies netlogo has also been widely used in social and economic development research such as enterprise economy industrial economy agricultural economy trading economy as well as computer software development and applications this paper used link intensity network size and network concentration as characteristic variables the main assumptions are described in the following sub sections this paper was developed on the basis of network grow theory whose basic law is that growth obeys to a certain power law distribution which should be identified as a special case there is the linear increase of resources in several network real case studies this study is aimed at defining a model which can well approximate real resources flows and couplings in order to identify the dynamics which regulates the network structure and its modification during the flow of various elements network growth model attributes some simple rules to the existing nodes whose interaction can eventually emerge through real observations or statistical analyses under this framework the most well known rule is the priority linking one that is the nodes in the network are more likely to be connected with nodes with higher connection degree price 1965 studied a network representing papers citations he built a model with continuously new published articles added to the citation network by this model the author found that the probability of being cited is directly proportional to the number of citations barabasi and frangos 2014 proposed a scale free ba network based on price model the model had two evolution mechanism growth and priority connection the probability of priority connection depends on the amount of resources owned by each agent barabasi et al 2001 proposed a fitness model again based on price model due to the fact that this work is focused on many cities within a basin the environmental kuznets curve ekc approach cannot be used since ekc is mainly used to study the relationship between the economy and pollution in a single country or city this is done through the collection and collation of economic and pollution data instead by building a network model it is possible to analyze the various relationships that exist between the various components in the system moreover compared with ekc the network modeling method can better observe the flow of various flows in the system so as to more dynamically study the economic pollution relationships existing between cities the approach discussed in this paper has a complementary purpose with respect to the application of pollutant diffusion models in fact the application of models broadly aimed at identifying the sources paths and targets of dispersed pollutants are necessary for intervention purposes in order to identify and protect the potential targets of harmful emissions however the focus on who should be responsible to act first is only implicit in this case this is instead relevant from a legal and administration perspective considering that many public bodies and different administrative levels are usually involved at the basin scale identifying the structure and complexity of production flows and the emission potentially associated to each step of such productions a sort of hierarchy of responsibilities is identified this responsibility chain and hierarchy identifies also who should pay first for it only within this context the use of economic structure and production flows to represent the economic complexity within a basin is sufficient obviously on the other side this model is not able to capture the targets with the same quality of diffusion model such as wrf chem or other assessed atmospheric diffusion models combined with the use of monitoring networks this is why we indicate such an approach as important but complementary consequently the complexity of geographical and atmospheric factors like orography surface parameters quality of inventories and measures seasonality model resolution and uncertainties whose importance for diffusion models is assessed by the scientific literature e g arciszewska and mcclatchey 2001 casazza et al 2013 scarino et al 2014 pan et al 2015 beegum et al 2016 oda et al 2017 are not taken into account here this paper will also apply the same property to define the proposed model however in order to reduce the simulation uncertainties we run the simulation process for 10 time and 20 time respectively to verify the errors between the two simulation processes 2 1 1 invariant network size the network size is the number of nodes in a network to a certain degree it represents the amount of resources in the entire network organization but also reflects the amount of resources that can be transferred among nodes in the network in our case a larger network size can increase the frequency and intensity of inter city economic trades consequently a variety of economic factors can be more widely transmitted and at the same time the strength of economic interaction among cities can also make the city more willing to pay attention to pollution control enhancing the environmental quality of the entire river basin therefore being the network size an important structural feature of the network organization it is maintained relatively stable within the simulation process highlighting the impact of other factors and simplifying the research process 2 1 2 link intensity link intensity including strong and weak connections refers to the interaction frequency among nodes in a given network organization connection strength mainly depends on a certain degree of cooperation among the components of a system for example this connection mainly exists in agents with similar social and economic activities in this case the probability of interaction among them increases due to the similarity and complementary in economic activities in our model each city is represented as agent has the tendency to establish a connection with those having a bigger economic scale instead a weak connection is a source of heterogeneous information in the network organization becoming also the basis for an expanding interaction within the network organization here a special attention is given to the inter city pollution transfer caused by the economic trade activities in cities weaker links representing here the pollution sources are associated to pollution transfer resulting from the economic interactions among cities the used model is based on the assumption that pollution transfer among cities is partly caused by economic trade such weak links are also the basis of the expansion of scope of agents interactions in the network accordingly this interaction will display other corresponding impacts on economic connections moreover agents with strong connections generally will have an established higher degree of trust having similar characteristics due to this kind of similarity and complementary their probability of interaction in the network increases finally the interaction strength among cities will affect their economic at different degrees the intensity of the connection is mainly expressed by quantifying the interaction frequency of the connection with the formula 1 l i n where l represents the link intensity in the network while i is the number of nodes in the network finally n represents the number of nodes in the network 2 1 3 network centrality concentration network concentration reflects the degree of centralization and the distribution of economic development in the network it is indirectly related both to the status and to the degree of pollution transfer in this paper the concentration rate index cr is mainly used to measure the concentration degree of urban economic development in the chosen region in particular cr is defined as the proportion of the economic development level of bigger cities in the river basin with respect to the overall development of all the cities in the whole river basin the formula is as follows 2 c r n i 1 n x i i 1 n x i where crn represents the concentration of n large cities in the network xi represents the gdp of the i th city in the network and n represents the total number of cities in the network 2 1 4 connection setting for nodes of the city pollution transfer among nodes in the network and the selection of economic connection targets are completed simultaneously in our simulation process simulation step length of 1 is repeated for a defined number of times during these steps pollution transfer gradually evolves among nodes representing the interacting cities in this study it is assumed that cities tend to have economic interactions with other cities having higher levels of economic development this is broadly the same statement of hidalgo and hausmann 2009 who demonstrated the existing relation between complex product flows directions and areas with higher know how and gdp moreover the transfer of economic factors is viewed as related to each city s absorptive capacity economic transformation capacity and economic level in the next section mediating variables which are related to the process of economic and pollutants transfer will be introduced that is how the economic flows affect the generation and transmission of pollution between cities 2 2 mediating variables economic absorptive capacity and pollution transfer capacity network organizations usually displays complex social and ecological relationships in our case the city is the node of the network formed by these relationships the driving force of economic interactions in cities results from the difference in their economic development which requires trade in order to achieve a certain level of economic complementary in this case the economic absorptive capacity of the less developed cities which receive the economic flows from urban centers with relatively higher economic development plays an important role in the characteristic of network organization however at the same time economic trade parallels a corresponding pollution transfer consequently this type of pollution transfer may lead to a spillover effect i e small cities will be polluted through accepting the economic flow from big cities thus the determination of the relationship between economic trade and pollution transfer becomes crucial during the simulation of combined economy pollution transfer in the network the economic absorptive capacity and the nodes ability for pollution transfer are taken into account due to the different level of economic development among cities a bound exists among cities with higher and lower economic development the economic potential difference between cities leads to the inter city economic flows here we consider the gdp level of each city in order to simplify the simulation process more in detail economic flows are generally directed toward cities with lower economic potential being originated from urban centers with higher economic potential on the basis of each city s existing gdp a given absorption coefficient indicates how much economic flows are absorbed by the cities with low economic potential the absorption coefficient of the i th node is indicated with ci ci changes with the node of gdp as a random variable here multi agent simulation is used to study the influence of micro agents interactions on the whole system using a bottom up approach property values of each agent are randomly set meanwhile the parameter α i is associated to ci represents a correction factor consistent with the observed growth rate of the gdp level xi on this basis the absorption coefficient formula is obtained 3 c i 1 1 e α i x i the same formula is derived from zhang 2015 who developed it to represent the knowledge transfer among agents of a network during such a process the nodes knowledge absorption capacity and innovation capacity were considered in particular based on the existing knowledge stocks for each agent an absorption coefficient was given to the absorption capacity of the agent which was expressed as a function of the existing knowledge stock and absorption coefficient the endowment of each agent in the network is different and the initial stock based on this is the initial state based on the above contents about network knowledge transfer this paper also gave an economic absorption coefficient and a pollution transfer coefficient to the economic interaction activities among cities in the river basin respectively to indicate the level of absorption of economic flows and the level of pollution generation and transfer among cities in the river basin the coefficient ai in the formula is mainly used to control the rate of increase of ci with gdp level in the network agents i e cities implement economic trade while a corresponding pollution transfer also occurs therefore for every node a coefficient ω i of pollution transfer which is the pollution transfer coefficient of the node in the economic interaction is assigned a coefficient γ i is defined to control the growth ceiling while another coefficient β i is used to fix the speed of ω i with the increase of xi thus the formula is as follows 4 ω i γ i 1 e β i x i inter city economic interactions in the network are consistent with pollution transfer the amount of pollution transfer is based on the inter city economic interaction when a city receives the economic flow from other cities it will further develop and produce new pollution and then transfer the pollution generated by itself here we combined the above pollution transfer coefficient and city economic level to quantify the existing relationship between inter city pollution transfer using the following formula 5 w i i 1 n ω x n in the formula wi represents the amount of pollution transferred between two cities x represents the level of urban economic growth ω is the pollution transfer coefficient of the city and n represents the number of cities finally according to the above analysis the model of urban pollution transfer in river basins is obtained 6 y c 1 ωi rij s where r represents the economic difference between the two cities i and j and s is an arbitrary constant 2 3 netlogo software modeling netlogo software was developed by northwestern university in 2002 and it was programmable modeling environment for the simulation of natural and social phenomena it is particularly suitable for modeling complex systems that evolve over time wilensky 1999 the simulation processes can be understood from three aspects agents spatial expression and simulation advance 1 agents the virtual world of netlogo was comprised by agents turtles and the agents perform related activities by accepting some rules the agents in the world interact with each other and influence each other in the world 2 spatial expression this refers to the virtual coordinates of patches and turtles in the netlogo space the attributes of each agent include their positions in the world 3 simulation advance the simulation process is recycling and specific simulation advancements include initial procedure and running procedure the initial procedure can generate multiple agents and give the agents different initial state on the basis of initial procedure the go procedure achieves the activities of the agents and repeat the implementation until the simulation process stops 2 3 1 settings for simulation parameters various simulation situations are simulated by adjusting the parameters in the procedure table 1 details the specific names of parameters and settings for attributes the basis for the initial values in the table 1 the initial value of number of nodes is set to 40 the reason is that we selected 40 cities as the agents of the network 2 the initial value of absorb coefficient is set to 0 02 this implies that 2 of the economic flows are absorbed by cities which receive the economic flow 3 the initial value of pollution transfer is set to 0 02 this is due to the fact that about 2 of pollution is generated and transferred among cities in the river basin 4 the initial value of pollution transfer upper growth limit was set to 0 5 this upper limit was set to control the value of pollution transfer in the whole river basin 5 other parameters like gdp level network center degree link intensity network size and economic transfer thresholds were all given within range of values this means that these values are adjustable and controllable within the model 2 3 2 simulation procedures the simulation procedures of this study is represented in fig 1 the first step determines whether the number of simulations reaches the maximum if it does then end the procedure otherwise continue to the next the maximum number of this study was 100 steps the second step determines the existing connections of the node if there is a connection then perform pollution transfer otherwise go to the fourth step in the city interaction and the establishment of a connection the third step follows to select interactive targets according to the economic scale of city cities tend to connect to nodes of higher economic scale pollution transfer is related to the absorptive capacity of the node pollution transfer ability and the size of the economy after completing a transfer the simulation enters in the fourth step which is aimed to establish new connections with cities the probability for a city to establish a connection relates to the economic scale of a city 2 3 3 simulation scheme design initial values for each indicator formulas and additional conditions were detailed before now each scenario is detailed accordingly 2 3 3 1 scenario one with the network evolution progress the main simulation changes the initialconcentration of the network fixes other parameters and analyzes the level of economic development and pollution transfer of a city in the whole network system here we set the parameters as follows the scale of the network organization was 40 meaning 40 cities in the network connection intensity was 1 meaning the frequency of inter city interaction in the network is 1 the threshold value of economic transfer was 1 3 of the economic difference the absorption coefficient α was 0 02 the coefficient β controlling the growth rate of the pollution transfer coefficient was 0 02 and the pollution transfer coefficient growth ceiling γ was 0 5 the economic development in city and pollution transfer were analyzed in the network by changing the initial concentration rate cr from 0 1 0 8 2 3 3 2 scenario two along with the advance of network evolution the main simulation changes scale fixes other parameters and analyzes of the level of economic development and pollution transfer of a city in the entire network system here the parameters were as follows the initial concentration and connection intensity were quantitative with the initial concentration for a higher level of economic development in experiment 1 being 0 2 with a connection intensity of 1 meaning the frequency of inter city interaction in the network was 1 the threshold value of economic transfer was 1 3 of the economic difference and absorption coefficient α was 0 02 the coefficient β controlling the growth rate of the pollution transfer coefficient was 0 02 and the pollution transfer coefficient growth ceiling γ was 0 5 the city economic development and pollution transfer were analyzed in the network by changing the scale of the network from 40 to 200 2 3 3 3 scenario three along with the advance of network evolution the main simulation changes the connection intensity of the network fixes other parameters and analyzes of the level of economic development and pollution transfer of a city in the entire network system here the parameters were as follows the initial concentration and connection intensity were quantitative with the initial concentration for a higher level of economic development in experiment 1 being 0 2 and the number of cities being 40 the threshold value of economic transfer was 1 3 of the economic difference and the absorption coefficient α was 0 02 the coefficient β controlling the growth rate of the pollution transfer coefficient was 0 02 and the pollution transfer coefficient growth ceiling γ was 0 5 the city economic development and pollution transfer in the network were analyzed by changing the connection intensity from 0 5 to 3 2 3 3 4 scenario four along with the advance of network evolution the main simulation changes economic development thresholds fixes other parameters and analyzes of the level of economic development and pollution transfer of a city in the entire network system here the parameters were as follows the initial concentration and connection intensity were quantitative with the initial concentration for a higher level of economic development in experiment 1 being 0 2 and the number of cities being 40 the connection intensity is 1 and the absorption coefficient α was 0 02 the coefficient β controlling the growth rate of the pollution transfer coefficient was 0 02 and the pollution transfer coefficient growth ceiling γ was 0 5 the city economic development and pollution transfer in the network were analyzed by changing the economic development thresholds with 1 2 1 3 1 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation output in this process of simulation the simulation of the network was designed to stop at 100 steps because the evolution law of the overall network can be observed after that figs 2 and 3 show the initial state and the completion status of a simulation process in figs 2 and 3 the dots indicate the cities in the network the links between the dots indicate the economic relationship between the cities while the number above each dot represents the economic development of every city fig 3 was obtained after the completion of the simulation as can be seen in fig 3 the economic development level of each city increased after the establishment of an economic link between cities at the same time the degree of connection of the entire network was greatly increased figs 4 and 5 show the specific numerical output images of figs 1 and 2 and were more convenient to obtain the conclusions that we want as it can be seen with the advance of the simulation process both the economic scale of the network and the amount of pollution transfer increased to different degrees the conclusions of whether this change will occur in different situations can be drawn from the results of this study 3 2 simulation results and analysis 3 2 1 simulation results and analysis of scenario one in scenario one keeping other variables unchanged and only altering the network concentration the changing trend of the overall urban economy size and the amount of pollution transfer in the network was analyzed when the network concentration rate increased the results of the simulation data are shown as follows after analysis as can be seen in figs 6 and 7 the economic development and pollution transfer in the whole network show the same trend with the increase of network concentration with two inverted u curves when cr is 0 3 and 0 5 respectively in other cases economic size and pollution transfer are at a low level we can conclude that when the network centrality is not 0 3 or 0 5 a core city exists in the network the core city is often higher in status and more easily obtains the required resources from other cities from trade cooperation due to the different statuses of cities the efficiency of economic flow is low and the efficiency of pollution decreases thus the transfer of pollution is reduced however when the network centrality is 0 3 and 0 5 the status of cities in the network is fairly equal the efficiency of economic flow becomes high and the efficiency of pollution increases thus the transfer of pollution goes up therefore the coupling of economy and pollution will only lead to an irreversible chain reaction of the greater concentration rate of city narrowing scale of economy and small transfer of pollution according to the existing state of development scenario one was mainly used to analyze the economic development of the whole city and the situation of pollution transfer by changing the concentration rate of the network the results indicate that when the cr is around 0 4 the economic size is higher therefore the economic scale of small and medium sized cities should be expanded in an appropriate way and the economic differences between large and small cities should be reduced however the small and medium sized cities should not be increased to the same extent as the big cities due to the increase of pollution from the results of error analysis as reported in table 2 we can see that the error between the 10 time simulation and 20 time simulation is less than 10 according to several previous works sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2017a b when the error is around 20 results are considered valid therefore the results of this paper are reliable and give the proof of the influence of cr on the relationship between total amount of economic size and pollution transfer in the whole river basin the processes of validation for scenarios 2 4 are same as the validation of scenario 1 thus we will only show the error analysis chart in the first three scenarios tables 3 7 3 2 2 simulation results and analysis of scenario two in scenario two only the network size was changed which is the number of cities in the network the changing trend of the overall urban economy size and the amount of pollution transfer in network was then analyzed when the network size increases the results of the simulation data are shown as follows after analysis as seen in figs 8 and 9 the level of economic development and the amount of pollution transfer change differently when the network size increases in particular when the city number increases the level of economic development in the network increases on the other side the pollution transfer amount remains the same with the increase of the network size even declining slightly there may be two reasons for this 1 the increase in the number of cities dilutes pollution considering the degree of each city to accommodate pollution taking into account the disposal of pollution in all cities thus after the increase of nodes efforts to dispose of the pollution increases while the achieved effect is exactly the overall reduction of the pollution transfer amount 2 trade is one way to realize the transfer of pollution each city can share a certain amount of pollution through multilateral trade therefore taking preventative measures pollution transfer in the whole area will be eased scenario two analyzed the overall economic development and pollution transfer in the region by changing the network size i e the number of cities the results show that the economic size increases with the increase in network size number of cities while the amount of pollution transfer decreases with the increase in network size here we mainly considered the dilution level of the city on pollution and the impact of multilateral trade in cities on the amount of pollution transfer therefore an appropriate increase in the number of cities in the economic linkage network will balance the relationship between economic size and pollution transfer when economic efficiency increases more and more cities will participate in the process of economic interaction at this time economic activities will become more frequent therefore more and more pollutants will be produced this phenomenon also known as rebound effect is well assessed in the literature e g figge et al 2014 li et al 2017b ouyang et al 2018 in this case as far as the previous assumptions are concerned not only will there be economic exchanges and pollution transfer processes among cities but more cities will also pay more attention to the disposal of pollution so the efficiency of the treatment of pollution will further increase ultimately the overall environmental quality of the entire basin will be improved to some extent 3 2 3 simulation results and analysis of scenario three in scenario three only the link intensity was changed the varying trend of the overall urban economy size and the amount of pollution transfer in the network were analyzed when the link intensity increases as is seen in figs 10 and fig 11 when the link intensity is around 1 the economic size and the amount of pollution transfer are at the highest levels this demonstrates that the intensity of the connection between the cities is not necessarily the bigger the better or the smaller the better moreover there is a link to the most suitable interval in particular when the link intensity reaches 1 the economic size and the amount of pollution transfer rises after reaching 1 the level of economic size and pollution transfer are lower like the inverted u curves therefore appropriate control of the number of connections between cities may enlarge the economic scale of the entire network however due to the number of cities and the fact that urban sewage capacity is limited the regional pollution emissions may increase 3 2 4 simulation results and analysis of scenario four in scenario four only the economic development threshold was changed the changing trend of the overall urban economy scale and the amount of pollution transfer in the network was analyzed when the economic development threshold was changed the results of the simulation data are shown as follows after analysis figs 12 19 show the trends of the overall urban economy and pollution transfer in the region with the increase of urban network concentration in the context of three different economic transfer thresholds three cases show an approximate trend in the range of 0 3 0 5 the economic size and pollution transfer levels are high figs 18 and 19 compares the three cases in particular when the network concentration of the city is within the range of 0 1 0 3 the change of the economic transfer threshold has little effect on the economic size and the pollution transfer with the increase of the initial concentration the threshold effect on the two gradually increased especially when the initial concentration is 0 7 0 8 the greatest impact was recorded this shows that if the economic differences between the city is too large this will affect the measure of defined variables scenario four mainly analyzed the overall economic development and pollution transfer in the region by changing the economic transfer thresholds between cities results indicate that when the initial concentration of the city is within the range of 0 1 0 3 the change of the economic transfer threshold has little effect on the economic size and the pollution transfer moreover with the increase of the initial concentration the threshold effect on the two gradually increased especially in the case of initial concentration values of 0 7 0 8 when the greatest impact is recorded thus it is important to narrow the economic differences between cities 3 3 discussion our results can be summarized as follows 1 when the initial centrality of big cities in a network is from 0 1 to 0 3 and from 0 4 to 0 5 the economic scale and the amount of pollution transfer goes up the changing trends of these two being nearly the same when the centrality of the network is neither 0 3 not 0 5 a core city exists in the network with fairly high status which more easily gains wanted resources via trade among cooperating cities however due to the difference in status the efficiency of economic flow becomes low and the efficiency of producing pollution decreases thus the amount of pollution transfer diminishes 2 when the centrality of the network is 0 3 and 0 5 the status of cities in the network is equal while the efficiencies of economic flow and of producing pollution increase thus the amount of pollution transfer increases therefore it is necessary to appropriately increase the economic scale of small and medium sized cities to reduce the economic differences among large medium and small scale cities as well as to appropriately regulate the relationship between the scale of economic development and environmental pollution in the region 3 the level of economic development and the amount of pollution transfer change display an opposite trend with respect to the increase of urban scale in particular with the increase of cities number the level of economic development in the network increases while the amount of pollution transfer decreases the possible reason is that the increase in the number of cities dilutes the pollution and increases the intensity of pollution disposal it is also possible that the inter city multilateral trade in the region transfers pollution to different cities reducing the amount of pollutants shared by each of them and reducing the total amount of pollutants to a certain extent 4 when the connection intensity is 1 the levels of economic development and the amount of pollution transfer reach a maximum value this indicates that high or low connection intensity among cities does not indicate better economic development on the contrary when economic interaction is more frequent the phenomenon of pollution transfer is more serious the scale of economy and the amount of pollution transfer reach a peak at 1 the corresponding curve inverted u shape therefore the appropriate control of the number of connections among cities may enlarge the economic scale of the entire network however due to the number of cities and urban sewage capacity the pollution emissions in the region increase 5 the difference in urban economic transfer thresholds will also lead to changes of the overall economic size and pollution transfer the higher threshold of economic links among cities will inhibit the economic scale growth in the network the effect of economic transfer threshold on the overall economic scale and pollution transfer in the region increases with the increase of the initial concentration therefore in order to promote the regional economy and the environmental sustainability the nodes in the network should be in a reasonable open state both with respect to the economic level of the city economic and trade and with respect to pollution transfer control due to the complexity of economic trade and pollution transmission processes there are many points which require further investigation model building the economic trade and pollution transmission between cities are affected by many factors the influencing factors selected by this study are only part of them using this part we put forward the ideal and conceptual model which may be biased for the results so this is the next step needed for more in depth consideration of the study resistance interface this study is mainly to model the ideal states without considering the resistance interface such as the direction of river flow propagation distance and trade which makes the study proceed smoothly but also makes the results of the study cannot accurately reflect the reality therefore in the next step we will consider the influence of the resistance interface and establish the resistance model which is compared with the result of the ideal model this will make the research more practical significance further integration and validation through 3d environmental monitoring while this study is focused on creating different reference scenarios within a river basin aimed at integrating socio economic and environmental pollutant dynamics appropriate monitoring technologies presently allow to develop 3d monitoring of pollutants and their dynamics lega and persechino 2014 lega et al 2014 errico et al 2015 lin et al 2015 casazza et al 2018 these data their analysis and spatial representation through gis tools could complement and further validate the results of our models 4 conclusions this paper studies the relationship between economy and pollution by constructing a model of inter city economic trade in river basin scale some preliminary conclusions have been made and the cities in the basin are regarded as different agents in the network and the interaction between cities is realized by simulation method as remarked in the premises the application of the defined method which identifies the connection among production flows economic structure complexity and emissions is able to highlight the hierarchy of responsibilities among agents in polluting the atmosphere thus evidencing who should pay and intervene first this approach obviously is complementary but not substitute to other models which support the assessment of sources paths and targets and are crucial in determining the characteristics of interventions and planning actions results support the following statements 1 the most suitable network concentration for the economic size and pollution transfer is not the biggest one but the middle one 0 3 0 5 which means there is a most suitable interval for this kind of influence 2 after the increase of cities efforts to dispose of the pollution increases and the actual effect achieved is also increased trade is one way to realize the transfer of pollution each city can share a certain amount of pollution through multilateral trade 3 the link intensity between the cities is not necessarily the bigger the better or the smaller the better and there is a most suitable interval 4 the difference of urban economic development will also lead to changes of the overall economic size and pollution transfer the higher economic difference between cities will inhibit the growth of the scale of the economy in the network in general there is still a lot of space for the study of the economic pollution relationship among cities at river basin scale in particular after the introduction of the simulation research method the static network research can be dynamically expanded to make it more practical however we still have to consider a variety of factors as well as the establishment of a more realistic model of the simulation model in particular due to the complexity of inter urban economic exchange and pollution transmission this research will require further developments with a more systematical perspective which will allow to implement the knowledge of economy and pollution directional transmission among cities within the same river basin acknowledgments this work is supported by national key r d program of china no 2016yfc0502800 projects of
