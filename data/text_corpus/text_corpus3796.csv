18980,the removal of organic micropollutants mps from water by means of adsorption is determined by the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent and the mps it is challenging to predict the removal of mps by specific adsorbents due to the extreme diversity in physicochemical properties among mps of interest in this research we established quantitative structure activity relationships qsars between the physicochemical properties of a diverse set of mps and their distribution coefficients k d measured on coconut shell activated carbon ccac and porous β cyclodextrin polymer p cdp adsorbents we conducted batch experiments with a mixture of 200 mps and used the data to calculate k d values for each mp on each adsorbent under conditions of infinite dilution i e low adsorbate concentrations we used computational software to calculate 3656 molecular descriptors for each mp we then developed and applied a model selection workflow to identify the most significant molecular descriptors for each adsorbent the functional stability and predictive power of the resulting qsars were confirmed with internal cross validation and external validation the applicability domain of the qsars was defined based on the most significant molecular descriptors selected into each qsar the qsars are predictive tools for evaluating adsorption based water treatment processes and provide

has become an important treatment technology for mp removal during water and wastewater treatment bonvin et al 2015 liu et al 2015 margot et al 2013 snyder et al 2007 whereas activated carbon ac is an inexpensive and widely available adsorbent its hydrophobic and non selective surfaces are readily fouled by natural organic matter nom and its porous structure results in rather slow diffusion limited kinetics bonvin et al 2015 kennedy et al 2014 sgroi et al 2018 these deficiencies have motivated studies into alternative adsorbents for mp removal during water and wastewater treatment for example porous β cyclodextrin polymers p cdp crosslinked with tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile rapidly remove mps from water with little or no interference from nom ling et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 though mp uptake on p cdp is rather selective and favors mps with certain undefined physicochemical properties li et al 2018a regardless of the adsorbent selected for mp removal during water or wastewater treatment performance prediction is difficult due to the extreme diversity in the chemical structures among mps of interest benotti et al 2009 fenner and tratnyek 2017 distribution coefficients k d are frequently used to describe the affinity of an adsorbate for an adsorbent and are used to predict the performance of adsorption processes blum et al 1994 kamlet et al 1985 luehrs et al 1996 k d values measured under conditions of infinite dilution i e low adsorbate concentrations are used to represent the linear range of non linear isotherms and to predict the extent of adsorption of adsorbates present at low concentrations luehrs et al 1996 therefore k d values for mps measured under conditions of infinite dilution can be used to predict mp adsorption behavior within the full linear range of the adsorption isotherm which is the relevant range for mps that are present in water at trace concentrations i e μg l 1 or lower k d values measured at environmentally relevant concentrations have been reported for some mps on ac apul et al 2013 de ridder et al 2013 dickenson and drewes 2010 but few k d values have been reported for mps on other alternative adsorbents considering the large number of mps of interest in water and wastewater treatment and the increasing types of adsorbents available for implementation in adsorption processes experimental measurements of k d values at environmentally relevant concentrations for all mps on all adsorbents would be time consuming and cost prohibitive therefore there is a need for tools that can provide accurate quantitative estimates of k d values at environmentally relevant concentrations for many mps on a variety of adsorbents quantitative structure activity relationships qsars are regression or classification models that relate a set of predictor variables to the potency of a response variable qsars have been widely applied in pharmacology chemical engineering and environmental engineering to build predictive models between molecular descriptors and different functional endpoints danishuddin and khan 2016 fenner and tratnyek 2017 mamy et al 2015 su et al 2018 for example qsars have been used to predict the oxidation of organic contaminants by taml h2o2 su et al 2018 the rejection of haloacetic acids by reverse osmosis wang et al 2018 the partitioning behavior of organic molecules between different phases brown 2014 ternes et al 2004 and k d values of organic molecules on ac and engineered adsorbents apul et al 2013 brasquet c boueges b le cloirec 1999 bunmahotama et al 2015 hüffer et al 2014 shih and gschwend 2009 these latter studies demonstrate the power and utility of qsars to predict k d values of organic molecules on different adsorbents though the applicability domain of the resulting qsars is limited because they were trained on data from sets of simple organic molecules with similar structures apul et al 2013 brasquet and le cloirec 1999 hüffer et al 2014 or from a limited number of mps to simplify model selection dickenson and drewes 2010 as a result there are no qsars to predict k d values of mps with diverse chemical structures on ac or p cdp or other alternative adsorbents advances in this area have been limited by a lack of experimentally derived k d values for diverse sets of mps and challenges associated with model selection for high dimensional datasets qsars that predict k d values can also be interpreted to derive insights on the mechanistic aspects of adsorption processes although the major mechanisms that drive mp adsorption on ac have been previously reported de ridder et al 2013 redding et al 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2017 we have a limited understanding of the mechanisms that drive adsorption on p cdp the objectives of this study were to 1 experimentally derive k d values for 200 structurally diverse mps on coconut shell activated carbon ccac and p cdp adsorbents and 2 develop qsars between the physicochemical properties of the mps and their measured k d values we performed batch adsorption experiments with 200 mps under conditions of infinite dilution and used the data to calculate k d values for 169 and 181 mps on ccac and p cdp respectively which were used for model training and validation we used the dragon 7 software to calculate 3656 molecular descriptors for each mp that include both 2d and 3d descriptors we developed and applied a model selection workflow to parameterize a multiple linear regression model that is initiated with an elastic net regularization and further culled by both direction stepwise regression and all possible regression analyses the final qsars contain 14 and 8 molecular descriptors for ccac and p cdp respectively and we define an applicability domain based on the three most significant molecular descriptors selected in each qsar the qsars have utility as predictive tools for evaluating adsorption based water treatment processes and provide new insights into ccac and p cdp adsorption mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and adsorbents all experiments were performed with modified nanopure water at ph of 6 6 which was confirmed to be stable by measuring ph at the beginning and the end of each experiment we selected 200 mps that are environmentally relevant bradley et al 2017 carpenter and helbling 2018 pochodylo and helbling 2017 have been previously studied for adsorption on ccac de ridder et al 2013 rossner et al 2009 and are representative of a broad range of physicochemical properties including ionization potential a list of all mps along with their 2d structures and respective charge state at ph 6 6 is provided in table s1 of the supplementary data sd stock solutions of each mp and an analytical mixture containing all 200 mps were prepared as previously described li et al 2018a ccac and p cdp adsorbents were prepared and synthesized respectively using previously established methods alsbaiee et al 2015 ling et al 2017 the characterization of particle sizes surface area and porosity for both adsorbents were reported in our previous publications alsbaiee et al 2015 ling et al 2017 the surface charges of ccac and p cdp are positive and negative at ph 6 6 respectively de ridder et al 2013 klemes et al 2018 2 2 experiments to calculate distribution coefficients under conditions of infinite dilution experiments to calculate distribution coefficients were performed in 125 ml glass erlenmeyer flasks with magnetic stir bars on a multi position stirrer vwr with a stirring rate of 400 revolutions per minute rpm at 23 c under conditions of infinite dilution the k d value of an mp will remain constant over a range of equilibrium adsorption scenarios i e equilibrium will represent the linear range of the non linear isotherm luehrs et al 1996 to ensure we were measuring k d values under conditions of infinite dilution mps were spiked to generate an initial concentration of each adsorbate of 2 μg l 1 and we performed experiments with ccac at adsorbent doses of 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 and experiments with p cdp at adsorbent doses of 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 these adsorbate and adsorbent doses were selected according to previous research investigating adsorption onto ccac and p cdp and were expected to yield suitable estimates of the distribution coefficient k d for each mp under conditions of infinite dilution ling et al 2017 the restoration of the dried adsorbents was performed as previously described to generate a suspension of each adsorbent ling et al 2017 following this restoration procedure appropriate volumes of nanopure water the analytical mp mixture 100 μg l 1 and the adsorbent suspension 1 g l 1 were added to each flask successively samples were collected in 8 ml volumes at predetermined sampling times 1 h for p cdp 4 h for ccac and filtered through a 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filter restek though most mps require more than 2 days to achieve 100 adsorption equilibrium on ccac at least 95 of the equilibrium adsorption capacity was achieved within 4 h for all mps on ccac in this study the rapid adsorption equilibrium could be attributed to the smaller particle size the relatively high ratio of adsorbents to adsorbates and the relatively clean matrix i e nanopure water employed in this study control experiments to account for other mp losses were performed under the same conditions with no addition of adsorbent the mp recovery rate was evaluated as the average recovery of all mps in the control experiments which was determined to be 96 5 all experiments including controls were performed with 5 replicates the samples were analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms to determine the aqueous phase concentration of each mp the equilibrium concentration of mps on the solid phase was determined by the following equation 1 q e c 0 c e c a where q e mg g 1 is the amount of a mp adsorbed on the solid phase at equilibrium c 0 mg l 1 is the average concentration of a mp in the samples of the control experiments c e mg l 1 is the average concentration of a mp in the liquid phase at equilibrium and c a g l 1 is the concentration of adsorbent the distribution coefficient k d l g 1 can then be determined as 2 k d q e c e 2 3 analytical methods the quantification of analytes was performed by hplc ms ms qexactive thermofisher scientific with a previously described analytical method incorporating large volume injection ling et al 2017 analytical details used for the detection and quantification of each analyte can be found in a previously published work li et al 2018a 2 4 qsar descriptors we used the dragon 7 software kode srl 2017 to calculate 3656 qsar descriptors for each mp as potential predictor variables the descriptors can be classified into eight major categories based on the physicochemical properties they represent including 1 electrostatic interactions e g charges ionization potential and electronegativity 2 hydrophilicity lipophilicity and hydrogen bonding capacity 3 molecular size mass and shape 4 constitutional information e g atoms bonds and functional groups 5 molecular connectivity 6 drug like molecular structures 7 geometrical information and 8 molecular topology and symmetry danishuddin and khan 2016 the descriptors from these eight categories are denoted as c1 through c8 in the following discussion we also used the padel yap 2011 and marvin chemaxon 2017 software to calculate 1188 additional qsar descriptors for each mp we used this independent set of molecular descriptors to develop a second set of qsars as a means to validate our mechanistic interpretations 2 5 development of qsar models we used our experimentally derived k d values as response variables and the comprehensive suite of qsar descriptors as predictor variables to generate qsars for each adsorbent we assumed that log 10 k d values could be predicted as an additive and linear combination of transformed and untransformed predictor variables in the following form as has been previously described apul et al 2013 blum et al 1994 brasquet c boueges b le cloirec 1999 3 log 10 k d β 0 x 1 β 1 x 2 β 2 x n β n where β i are the parameters of the model to be estimated and x i are the predictor variables it is worth noting that some predictor variables calculated by dragon 7 are provided as untransformed variables and in a mathematically transformed space e g logarithmic transformation in the event that any monotonic but non linear relationship exists between these predictor variables and log 10 k d values a schematic describing the overall framework for data preparation and quality control data partitioning model selection and model validation is provided in fig 1 and a brief description follows we first examined the full set of calculated k d values for each mp on each adsorbent and selected only those k d values for which the coefficient of variation cov across all adsorbent doses and replicates was less than 2 for use in model training and validation this conservative criterion was implemented as a quality control measure to ensure that we were selecting constant k d values that represent the linear range of the non linear isotherm and that no experimental or analytical biases were introduced into the qsar we next randomly partitioned the selected k d values for each mp on each adsorbent into training data 80 of the observations and validation data 20 of the observations using a previously described approach linden et al 2017 the validation data were only used to evaluate the predictive power of the final qsars the model selection workflow that we developed includes elastic net en regularization followed sequentially by both direction stepwise regression and all possible regression apr the en regularization is a necessary initial step to address the ill posed problem and the expected inter correlation among the predictor variables helbling et al 2015 kubik and wiczling 2016 zou and hastie 2005 we employed en with the package glmnet in r version 3 4 1 the parameters written as the vector β can be estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared errors sses and applying a penalty function that includes a hybrid ridge and lasso regression regularization term friedman et al 2010 4 min β 0 β ℝ p 1 1 2 n i 1 n log 10 k d i β 0 x i t β 2 λ p α β where 5 p α β 1 α 1 2 β l 2 2 α β l 1 in equation 5 p α β is the en penalty function and is controlled with the mixing parameter α that can range between 0 ridge regularization and 1 lasso regularization zou and hastie 2005 the weight of the regularization is controlled by the value of λ in equation 4 with larger values of λ leading to more regularization zou and hastie 2005 we used a random leave 20 out cross validation over 5000 iterations to identify the value of λ that optimizes the predictive performance measured as root mean squared error rmse of the qsar for the training data hastie et al 2017 wasserman and roeder 2009 we simultaneously varied the magnitude of α between 0 and 1 0 at steps of 0 025 to identify the optimal combination of λ and α that results in a qsar with a low rmse and a relatively small number of predictor variables it is worth noting that in this study we employed the en exclusively as an initial model selection technique rather than a final regression technique because the penalty function decreases the influence of the most significant predictor variables making it difficult to interpret the contribution of the selected predictor variables when evaluating adsorption mechanisms chong and jun 2005 wasserman and roeder 2009 zou and hastie 2005 in other words the en was used primarily as a means to reduce the number of molecular descriptors from 3656 1188 for padel and marvin models to several dozen molecular descriptors that optimize the predictive performance within the en framework to obtain more mechanistically interpretable qsars we used a both direction stepwise regression routine implemented in r version 3 4 1 to select the most significant predictor variables from the set of predictor variables selected by the en kubik and wiczling 2016 we cross validated the results of the both direction stepwise regression by randomly partitioning the training data into a new training set 80 of the original training data and validation set 20 of the original training data and performing an ordinary least squares regression over 5000 iterations we calculated the average coefficient of determination q c v 2 of the validation sets among the 5000 iterations and defined the model as functionally stable if the q c v 2 was greater than 0 8 and the difference between the adjusted r2 r a d j 2 and the q c v 2 was less than 10 li et al 2018b xia et al 2010 finally we implemented an apr analysis using a self developed script for r version 3 4 1 to evaluate the importance and significance of each of the predictor variables selected by the both direction stepwise regression hastie et al 2017 all possible model scenarios containing every combination of predictor variables were constructed and evaluated based on the r a d j 2 and the coefficient of determination q2 of the original validation data removed at the start of the workflow hastie et al 2017 olejnik et al 2000 2 6 defining the applicability domain applicability domains ads were defined for each of the final qsars based on the most significant predictor variables selected into each qsar as previously described li et al 2018b briefly the values of the three most significant predictor variables for each of the mps included in the original training data were plotted in three dimensional space and the average coordinates of those points were determined the euclidian distance between the coordinates of each mp in three dimensional predictor space to the average coordinates was calculated and a boundary value for the euclidian distance was defined as the ad 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimentally derived kd values we performed adsorption experiments to calculate the k d values of 200 mps on ccac and p cdp the analytical data allowed us to calculate k d values for 175 and 186 mps on ccac and p cdp respectively we then used the conservative criterion that the coefficient of variation across all experimental replicates must be less than 2 to select 169 and 181 k d values for qsar building for ccac and p cdp respectively this criterion ensures that all k d values remain constant across experiments with all adsorbent doses confirming that they adequately represent the linear range of the non linear isotherm and can be used to predict adsorption behavior of mps at environmentally relevant concentrations the log10 k d values for each mp on each adsorbent are provided in table s1 of the sd the log10 k d values of the mps range between 0 7 and 4 1 and 0 7 to 3 9 on ccac and p cdp respectively the magnitudes of these values reflect adsorption affinities in a similar range for each adsorbent though the wider range of k d values for p cdp suggests greater mp selectivity as was previously reported ling et al 2017 3 2 qsar model selection for k d values on ccac we first randomly partitioned our dataset of 169 k d values into training data 136 observations and validation data 33 observations using a previously described approach linden et al 2017 we then used en regularization with leave 20 out cross validation helbling et al 2015 to identify the optimized value of λ and simultaneously varied the magnitude of α between 0 and 1 0 at steps of 0 025 to identify the optimized value of α hastie et al 2017 wasserman and roeder 2009 the optimized en model has λ 0 0279 α 1 0 pure lasso regularization and 71 of the 3656 predictor variables are selected into the model after employing en regularization as an initial model selection technique we next used both direction stepwise regression to evaluate the significance of each of the predictor variables selected by the en and to generate mechanistically interpretable qsars kubik and wiczling 2016 both direction stepwise regression reduced the number of predictor variables selected into the qsar from 71 to 26 the internal cross validation routine resulted in an average coefficient of determination q c v 2 of 0 85 with the difference between the r a d j 2 and the q c v 2 less than 10 verifying the functional stability of this qsar li et al 2018b xia et al 2010 the q2 for this qsar is 0 52 and the r a d j 2 is 0 88 demonstrating outstanding predictive power and ability to fit the calculated k d values moreover there is little influence of multicollinearity because the overall variance inflation factor vif is less than five apul et al 2013 chong and jun 2005 therefore we conclude that the both direction stepwise regression identifies the most significant combination of predictor variables from the optimized en regularization scenario we present a comparison of the predicted and calculated k d values resulting from this model selection in fig 2 a the blue circles represent the 136 k d values included in the model training and the red triangles represent the 33 k d values of the external validation data according to point distribution no mp among the training data nor in the validation data exhibits more than one log unit deviation from the best prediction line demonstrating the outstanding statistical significance and predictive power of this qsar though this qsar is statistically significant and can perform reliable prediction of k d values among the mps studied it is possible to use multiple linear regression techniques to discover qsars with fewer predictors and similar performance bertsimas et al 2016 hastie et al 2017 therefore we employed an apr analysis to explore qsars derived from an exhaustive set of sub combinations of the 26 predictor variables selected into the hybrid en both direction stepwise regression qsar i e a total of 226 scenarios we used the values of r a d j 2 and q2 to evaluate the performance of each qsar and identify the best performing qsars containing 1 to 26 predictor variables the results presented in fig 2 b show the r a d j 2 and the q2 for each of the best performing qsars containing 11 to 26 predictor variables those with fewer than 10 predictor variables had relatively poor performance and are not considered further interestingly the r a d j 2 increases as the number of predictor variables selected into the qsar increases and the q2 increases and then decreases as the number of predictor variables selected into the qsar increases this observation indicates that selecting more predictor variables increases the fitting of the training set at the sacrifice of out of sample predictive power to minimize over fitting and improve out of sample prediction we used the optimal combination of r a d j 2 and q2 to select the qsar containing 14 parameters as the best performing qsar olejnik et al 2000 the final qsar has an r a d j 2 of 0 84 which is almost unchanged from the qsar derived from the hybrid en both direction stepwise regression and the q2 increased from 0 55 to 0 70 demonstrating the greatly improved predictive power of the final qsar we present a comparison of the predicted and measured k d values of the final qsar in fig 2 c similar to our observation in fig 2 a the 136 training mps and 33 validation mps are all within one log unit of the best prediction line this demonstrates that reducing the number of predictor variables did not substantively lower the predictive power of the qsar but generated a more generalizable qsar for the prediction of k d values on ccac the latter point is not entirely unexpected because models with large numbers of predictor variables have low degrees of freedom and high restrictions which could result in high predictive errors importantly although this qsar was built with a set of mps that are representative of a broad range of physicochemical properties including ionization potential the predictive accuracy is higher than other qsars developed in previous studies using sets of simple organic molecules with similar structures apul et al 2013 xia et al 2010 the predictor variables selected into the final qsar along with their parameters are provided in table 1 the statistical tests of the final qsar are presented in tables s2 and s3 of the sd 3 3 mechanistic interpretation of mp adsorption on ccac although the major mechanisms that drive mp adsorption on ac have been previously reported de ridder et al 2013 redding et al 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2017 we did not preselect representative molecular descriptors from among the 3656 qsar descriptors therefore we can examine the physicochemical properties represented by each of the predictor variables selected in the final qsar to evaluate whether our model selection procedure generated mechanistically meaningful qsars based on our fundamental understanding of mp adsorption on ccac de ridder et al 2013 redding et al 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2017 we expect that predictor variables representing electrostatic interactions c1 hydrophobic interactions c2 and molecular size c3 would be selected in the final qsar one predictor variable representing electrostatic interactions c1 was selected in the final qsar this variable is defined as gats1s in the dragon 7 software and is assigned the identifier cd c1a in this work see footnote of table 1 for details on identifiers electrostatic interactions are one of the most important factors that can influence the adsorption affinity of mps on acs de ridder et al 2013 cd c1a represents the charge potential of a mp and high values of cd c1a indicate a high positive charge potential the negative sign of the parameter for cd c1a indicates that cd c1a is negatively correlated with the k d values this agrees with our expectation that because the surface of the ccac is positively charged at neutral ph de ridder et al 2013 the mps of high cd c1a exhibit low k d values on this ccac due to repulsive electrostatic interactions three predictor variables representing hydrophobic interactions c2 were selected in the final qsar including cats2d 03 nl cd c2a cats2d 04 dl cd c2b and cats3d 11 pl cd c2c cd c2a represents the hydrophilicity of a mp and cd c2c represents the lipophilicity of a mp the parameters of cd c2a and cd c2c are negative and positive respectively agreeing with our expectation about the role hydrophobic interactions play in mp adsorption on ccac de ridder et al 2013 cd c2b is a descriptor for the hydrogen donating capacity of a mp the negative correlation between cd c2b and the k d values suggests a weaker hydrogen accepting capacity of ccac compared with water in other words the mps that are good hydrogen donors tend to stay in the aqueous phase instead of adsorbing on ccac and this is an important and significant determinant of mp adsorption on ccac four predictor variables representing molecular size mass and shape c3 were selected in the final qsar including tdb07v cd c3a sph cd c3b tdb04v cd c3c and tdb09m cd c3d cd c3a cd c3c and cd c3d each represent the size of an mp with larger values of these predictor variables indicating larger molecular size larger molecules are generally more hydrophobic due to the energy required for cavity formation in water apul et al 2013 the positive correlations between cd c3a cd c3c and cd c3d and the k d values suggest greater affinity of larger molecules for ccac supporting this expectation cd c3b represents the sphericity of a mp and also exhibits a positive correlation with the k d values this observation highlights the importance of the shape of a mp for its adsorption on ccac and suggests that mps with regular shapes could have a better chance to bind to the surface of ccac compared with branched and irregularly shaped mps the mechanistic interpretation of the c1 c2 and c3 predictor variables strongly suggests that our model selection procedure generated a mechanistically meaningful qsar in addition there were six predictor variables representing constitutional information e g atoms bonds and functional groups c4 or molecular connectivity c5 selected in the final qsar including chi dt cd c4a b05 c n cd c5a h 046 cd c5b nrnr2 cd c5c b02 n n cd c5d and noxiranes cd c5e we have no a priori expectation as to how the c4 and c5 predictor variables may contribute to mp affinity for ccac and the physicochemical properties of the c4 and c5 predictor variables are more difficult to interpret for example cd c4a represents the extent of branching of the carbon atom skeleton of saturated hydrocarbons dvořák et al 2011 the negative correlation between cd c4a and the k d values suggests that more branching results in a lower affinity for ccac but the mechanistic explanation of this relationship remains unclear therefore we note these relationships as new insights into the determinants of mp affinity on ccac and provide detailed descriptions of these predictor variables in table s2 to further evaluate the ability of our model selection procedure to generate mechanistically meaningful qsars we repeated the model selection workflow using 1188 qsar descriptors derived from the padel yap 2011 and marvin chemaxon 2017 software the fitting summary of this qsar is provided in table s4 and performance and diagnostic data are provided in fig s1 the best performing qsar following apr contains 16 predictor variables among the predictor variables are analogues that represent the physicochemical properties described for the c1 c2 and c3 dragon descriptors for example cp c1a represents positive charge potential cp c2a and cp c2b represent the hydrogen accepting and donating ability of mps and cp c3a cp c3c and cp c3d represent the size of an mp the parameters of these descriptors likewise support our mechanistic interpretation of mp affinity for ccac therefore the qsar built from the padel and marvin descriptors adds support that our model selection procedure generates mechanistically meaningful qsars this evidence further confirms that our model selection workflow can be used to develop qsars for adsorbents for which we know less about adsorption mechanisms and derive new knowledge about those adsorption processes 3 4 qsar model selection for k d values on p cdp we next sought to generate a qsar for p cdp using the validated model selection procedure developed for ccac because little is known about the adsorption mechanisms that drive the selective uptake of mps on p cdp a qsar for p cdp will provide a means to derive insights on the mechanistic aspects of mp adsorption on p cdp we partitioned our dataset of 181 k d values into training data 145 observations and validation data 36 observations the optimized en model has λ 0 2099 α 0 35 and 109 predictor variables are selected into the model both direction stepwise regression reduced the number of predictor variables selected into the qsar from 109 to 17 the internal cross validation routine resulted in an average coefficient of determination q c v 2 of 0 86 with the difference between the r a d j 2 and the q c v 2 less than 10 the external validation coefficient q2 is 0 70 and the r a d j 2 of the qsar is 0 90 a comparison of the predicted and measured k d values is presented in fig 3 a where no mp exhibits more than a 1 5 log unit deviation from the best prediction line we then employed the apr analysis to explore qsars derived from an exhaustive set of sub combinations of the 17 predictor variables selected into the hybrid en both direction stepwise regression qsar the results presented in fig 3 b show the r a d j 2 and the q2 for each of the best performing qsars containing 6 to 17 predictor variables we used the optimal combination of r a d j 2 and q2 to select the qsar containing 8 parameters as the best performing qsar olejnik et al 2000 this final qsar has an r a d j 2 of 0 79 and the q2 increased to 0 81 from 0 70 for the hybrid en both direction stepwise regression we present a comparison of the predicted and measured k d values of the final qsar in fig 3 c as we noted for the qsar developed for ccac the final qsar for p cdp exhibits higher generalizability relative to the qsar with 17 predictor variables for the prediction of mp affinity the predictor variables selected into the final qsar along with their parameters are provided in table 2 the statistical tests of the final qsar are presented in tables s5 and s6 of the sd 3 5 mechanistic interpretation of mp adsorption on p cdp p cdp is a polymer of β cyclodextrin crosslinked with tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile that rapidly removes many types of mps from water but exhibits a selectivity that is not fully understood based on our previous study we expect that positively charged mps will have a high affinity for p cdp due to a negative surface charge resulting from phenolates in the crosslinker klemes et al 2018 ling et al 2017 and neutral or negatively charged mps of a certain size will have high affinity for p cdp due to host guest complex formation in the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomers ling et al 2017 therefore we would expect that predictor variables representing electrostatic interactions c1 and molecular size c3 would be selected in the final qsar however it remains unclear whether these or other molecular descriptors would be the best predictors of mp affinity on p cdp three predictor variables representing electrostatic interactions c1 were selected in the final qsar including qpmax pd c1a and spmin5 bhs pd c1c which represent the amount of total positive charge and the positive charge potential of mps respectively the positive correlations between these two predictors and the k d values corroborate our previous observations ling et al 2017 and provide a new quantitative metric by which to evaluate the relationship between positive charge and mp affinity for p cdp the third c1 predictor variable was psi e a pd c1b which represents the electron donating capacity of a mp the negative correlation of this predictor variable with the k d values likewise agrees with our expectation arising from the negative surface charge of p cdp p vsa ppp a pd c2a is a predictor variable representing hydrophobic interactions c2 and represents the hydrogen accepting capacity of mps pd c2a is negatively correlated with the k d values indicating that p cdp is a weaker hydrogen donor than water as could be expected though selection of this predictor variable into the final qsar provides new insight on the mechanisms that determine mp affinity for p cdp tdb06v pd c3a is a predictor representing the van der waals volume of a mp pd c3a is positively correlated with the k d values indicating that larger sized molecules have a higher affinity for p cdp this predictor agrees with our expectation that small mps do not interact strongly with the binding sites within the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomers of in p cdp though the increasing hydrophobicity of mps of increasing van der waals volume may also play a role in this predictor being selected into the qsar as discussed with respect to ccac the three c4 and c5 predictor variables including hats6u pd c4a t s f pd c5a and f06 n cl pd c5b are more difficult to interpret and we refer the reader to table s5 for detailed descriptions of these predictor variables kode srl 2017 we also repeated the model selection workflow for p cdp using the 1188 qsar descriptors derived from the padel and marvin software yap 2011 the fitting summary of this qsar is provided in table s7 and performance and diagnostic data are provided in fig s2 the best performing qsar following apr contains 9 predictor variables we again find analogues for the c1 c2 and c3 descriptors in the padel and marvin qsars for example pp c1a pp c1b and pp c1c represent positive charge potential pp c2a represents the hydrogen donating ability of mps and cp c3a and cp c3b represent the size of an mp the apparent overlap in the mechanistic interpretation of the independently developed qsars using dragon or padel and marvin descriptors again provides support that our model selection approach generates mechanistically interpretable qsars 3 6 applicability domain of the final qsars we defined the ad of the qsars developed for ccac and p cdp by using the three most important and significant predictor variables selected in the respective qsars li et al 2018b the importance and significance of each predictor variable in the final qsars for ccac and p cdp are summarized in figs 2 d and 3 d respectively the importance is measured as the decrease of r a d j 2 when the respective predictor variable is removed from the qsar model grömping 2015 the significance is measured by taking negative log10 of the p value of the t test for each predictor variable we identified the descriptors chi dt cd c4a sph cd c3b and tdb07v cd c3a and the descriptors qpmax pd c1a spmin5 bh s pd c1c and tdb06v pd c3a as the most important and significant predictor variables for ccac and p cdp respectively the three dimensional predictor space for ccac and p cdp is presented in figs s3 and s5 of the sd respectively the euclidean distance of each mp is defined as the distance between the location of the mp in the predictor space and the center of the space of which the coordinates are the average values of the three predictors among the training data based on the euclidian distances of the mps in the training data ad boundary values of 1 95 and 2 04 are defined for ccac and p cdp respectively the ads for ccac and p cdp are presented along with the standardized residuals of each mp in figs s4 and s6 respectively the euclidean distance of all mps among the validation data for ccac and p cdp are lower than their respective boundary values indicating the validation data falls within the ad of each qsar further all mps among the training and validation data for ccac and p cdp exhibit standardized residuals less than 3 indicating that there are no outliers in the training and validation sets therefore we conclude that k d values on ccac and p cdp for mps within our defined ad can be predicted by our developed qsars with respect to p cdp it is important to note that there is expected to be an upper boundary for tdb06v pd c3a above which an mp is not expected to fit inside the cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomer however we did not observe any size exclusion among the mps selected for this study and the ad excludes large molecules from the prediction space 4 conclusions we measured distribution coefficients k d for nearly 200 mps on ccac and p cdp adsorbents in batch adsorption experiments conducted under conditions of infinite dilution the resulting k d values selected for model training and validation were constant across experiments conducted with a range of adsorbent doses confirming that the k d values adequately represent the linear range of the non linear isotherm and can be used to predict adsorption behavior of mps at environmentally relevant concentrations we developed applied and validated a novel model selection workflow that generated qsars to predict k d values for mps on ccac and p cdp within the linear range of the non linear isotherm this is the environmentally relevant range for mps that are present in water at trace concentrations the qsars can be used to predict the adsorption behavior of mps whose structures are contained within the applicability domain ad during water or wastewater treatment the novel model selection workflow can also be used to derive mechanistic interpretations of the adsorption processes the qsar developed for ccac contains descriptors that match our previous mechanistic understanding of adsorption on activated carbon the qsar developed for p cdp contains descriptors that support our previous mechanistic observations and provide a quantitative link between those descriptors and mp adsorption on p cdp the model selection workflow is fully adaptable and can be used to generate mechanistically meaningful qsars for other adsorbents or response variables our mechanistic interpretations provide strong evidence for distinct adsorption mechanisms of ccac and p cdp suggesting that these two materials can be complementary in water and wastewater treatment processes additionally the mechanistic interpretations of p cdp can lead to rational modification of cyclodextrin polymers to increase the adsorption affinity of specific mps on p cdp for example a polymer prepared with α cd monomers could exhibit greater affinity toward small mps or a polymer prepared with functionalized cyclodextrins or crosslinkers that impart a positive surface charge may enhance the affinity for negatively charged mps declaration of interests cornell university has filed us and international

18980,the removal of organic micropollutants mps from water by means of adsorption is determined by the physicochemical properties of the adsorbent and the mps it is challenging to predict the removal of mps by specific adsorbents due to the extreme diversity in physicochemical properties among mps of interest in this research we established quantitative structure activity relationships qsars between the physicochemical properties of a diverse set of mps and their distribution coefficients k d measured on coconut shell activated carbon ccac and porous β cyclodextrin polymer p cdp adsorbents we conducted batch experiments with a mixture of 200 mps and used the data to calculate k d values for each mp on each adsorbent under conditions of infinite dilution i e low adsorbate concentrations we used computational software to calculate 3656 molecular descriptors for each mp we then developed and applied a model selection workflow to identify the most significant molecular descriptors for each adsorbent the functional stability and predictive power of the resulting qsars were confirmed with internal cross validation and external validation the applicability domain of the qsars was defined based on the most significant molecular descriptors selected into each qsar the qsars are predictive tools for evaluating adsorption based water treatment processes and provide

has become an important treatment technology for mp removal during water and wastewater treatment bonvin et al 2015 liu et al 2015 margot et al 2013 snyder et al 2007 whereas activated carbon ac is an inexpensive and widely available adsorbent its hydrophobic and non selective surfaces are readily fouled by natural organic matter nom and its porous structure results in rather slow diffusion limited kinetics bonvin et al 2015 kennedy et al 2014 sgroi et al 2018 these deficiencies have motivated studies into alternative adsorbents for mp removal during water and wastewater treatment for example porous β cyclodextrin polymers p cdp crosslinked with tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile rapidly remove mps from water with little or no interference from nom ling et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 though mp uptake on p cdp is rather selective and favors mps with certain undefined physicochemical properties li et al 2018a regardless of the adsorbent selected for mp removal during water or wastewater treatment performance prediction is difficult due to the extreme diversity in the chemical structures among mps of interest benotti et al 2009 fenner and tratnyek 2017 distribution coefficients k d are frequently used to describe the affinity of an adsorbate for an adsorbent and are used to predict the performance of adsorption processes blum et al 1994 kamlet et al 1985 luehrs et al 1996 k d values measured under conditions of infinite dilution i e low adsorbate concentrations are used to represent the linear range of non linear isotherms and to predict the extent of adsorption of adsorbates present at low concentrations luehrs et al 1996 therefore k d values for mps measured under conditions of infinite dilution can be used to predict mp adsorption behavior within the full linear range of the adsorption isotherm which is the relevant range for mps that are present in water at trace concentrations i e μg l 1 or lower k d values measured at environmentally relevant concentrations have been reported for some mps on ac apul et al 2013 de ridder et al 2013 dickenson and drewes 2010 but few k d values have been reported for mps on other alternative adsorbents considering the large number of mps of interest in water and wastewater treatment and the increasing types of adsorbents available for implementation in adsorption processes experimental measurements of k d values at environmentally relevant concentrations for all mps on all adsorbents would be time consuming and cost prohibitive therefore there is a need for tools that can provide accurate quantitative estimates of k d values at environmentally relevant concentrations for many mps on a variety of adsorbents quantitative structure activity relationships qsars are regression or classification models that relate a set of predictor variables to the potency of a response variable qsars have been widely applied in pharmacology chemical engineering and environmental engineering to build predictive models between molecular descriptors and different functional endpoints danishuddin and khan 2016 fenner and tratnyek 2017 mamy et al 2015 su et al 2018 for example qsars have been used to predict the oxidation of organic contaminants by taml h2o2 su et al 2018 the rejection of haloacetic acids by reverse osmosis wang et al 2018 the partitioning behavior of organic molecules between different phases brown 2014 ternes et al 2004 and k d values of organic molecules on ac and engineered adsorbents apul et al 2013 brasquet c boueges b le cloirec 1999 bunmahotama et al 2015 hüffer et al 2014 shih and gschwend 2009 these latter studies demonstrate the power and utility of qsars to predict k d values of organic molecules on different adsorbents though the applicability domain of the resulting qsars is limited because they were trained on data from sets of simple organic molecules with similar structures apul et al 2013 brasquet and le cloirec 1999 hüffer et al 2014 or from a limited number of mps to simplify model selection dickenson and drewes 2010 as a result there are no qsars to predict k d values of mps with diverse chemical structures on ac or p cdp or other alternative adsorbents advances in this area have been limited by a lack of experimentally derived k d values for diverse sets of mps and challenges associated with model selection for high dimensional datasets qsars that predict k d values can also be interpreted to derive insights on the mechanistic aspects of adsorption processes although the major mechanisms that drive mp adsorption on ac have been previously reported de ridder et al 2013 redding et al 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2017 we have a limited understanding of the mechanisms that drive adsorption on p cdp the objectives of this study were to 1 experimentally derive k d values for 200 structurally diverse mps on coconut shell activated carbon ccac and p cdp adsorbents and 2 develop qsars between the physicochemical properties of the mps and their measured k d values we performed batch adsorption experiments with 200 mps under conditions of infinite dilution and used the data to calculate k d values for 169 and 181 mps on ccac and p cdp respectively which were used for model training and validation we used the dragon 7 software to calculate 3656 molecular descriptors for each mp that include both 2d and 3d descriptors we developed and applied a model selection workflow to parameterize a multiple linear regression model that is initiated with an elastic net regularization and further culled by both direction stepwise regression and all possible regression analyses the final qsars contain 14 and 8 molecular descriptors for ccac and p cdp respectively and we define an applicability domain based on the three most significant molecular descriptors selected in each qsar the qsars have utility as predictive tools for evaluating adsorption based water treatment processes and provide new insights into ccac and p cdp adsorption mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and adsorbents all experiments were performed with modified nanopure water at ph of 6 6 which was confirmed to be stable by measuring ph at the beginning and the end of each experiment we selected 200 mps that are environmentally relevant bradley et al 2017 carpenter and helbling 2018 pochodylo and helbling 2017 have been previously studied for adsorption on ccac de ridder et al 2013 rossner et al 2009 and are representative of a broad range of physicochemical properties including ionization potential a list of all mps along with their 2d structures and respective charge state at ph 6 6 is provided in table s1 of the supplementary data sd stock solutions of each mp and an analytical mixture containing all 200 mps were prepared as previously described li et al 2018a ccac and p cdp adsorbents were prepared and synthesized respectively using previously established methods alsbaiee et al 2015 ling et al 2017 the characterization of particle sizes surface area and porosity for both adsorbents were reported in our previous publications alsbaiee et al 2015 ling et al 2017 the surface charges of ccac and p cdp are positive and negative at ph 6 6 respectively de ridder et al 2013 klemes et al 2018 2 2 experiments to calculate distribution coefficients under conditions of infinite dilution experiments to calculate distribution coefficients were performed in 125 ml glass erlenmeyer flasks with magnetic stir bars on a multi position stirrer vwr with a stirring rate of 400 revolutions per minute rpm at 23 c under conditions of infinite dilution the k d value of an mp will remain constant over a range of equilibrium adsorption scenarios i e equilibrium will represent the linear range of the non linear isotherm luehrs et al 1996 to ensure we were measuring k d values under conditions of infinite dilution mps were spiked to generate an initial concentration of each adsorbate of 2 μg l 1 and we performed experiments with ccac at adsorbent doses of 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 and experiments with p cdp at adsorbent doses of 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 these adsorbate and adsorbent doses were selected according to previous research investigating adsorption onto ccac and p cdp and were expected to yield suitable estimates of the distribution coefficient k d for each mp under conditions of infinite dilution ling et al 2017 the restoration of the dried adsorbents was performed as previously described to generate a suspension of each adsorbent ling et al 2017 following this restoration procedure appropriate volumes of nanopure water the analytical mp mixture 100 μg l 1 and the adsorbent suspension 1 g l 1 were added to each flask successively samples were collected in 8 ml volumes at predetermined sampling times 1 h for p cdp 4 h for ccac and filtered through a 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filter restek though most mps require more than 2 days to achieve 100 adsorption equilibrium on ccac at least 95 of the equilibrium adsorption capacity was achieved within 4 h for all mps on ccac in this study the rapid adsorption equilibrium could be attributed to the smaller particle size the relatively high ratio of adsorbents to adsorbates and the relatively clean matrix i e nanopure water employed in this study control experiments to account for other mp losses were performed under the same conditions with no addition of adsorbent the mp recovery rate was evaluated as the average recovery of all mps in the control experiments which was determined to be 96 5 all experiments including controls were performed with 5 replicates the samples were analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms to determine the aqueous phase concentration of each mp the equilibrium concentration of mps on the solid phase was determined by the following equation 1 q e c 0 c e c a where q e mg g 1 is the amount of a mp adsorbed on the solid phase at equilibrium c 0 mg l 1 is the average concentration of a mp in the samples of the control experiments c e mg l 1 is the average concentration of a mp in the liquid phase at equilibrium and c a g l 1 is the concentration of adsorbent the distribution coefficient k d l g 1 can then be determined as 2 k d q e c e 2 3 analytical methods the quantification of analytes was performed by hplc ms ms qexactive thermofisher scientific with a previously described analytical method incorporating large volume injection ling et al 2017 analytical details used for the detection and quantification of each analyte can be found in a previously published work li et al 2018a 2 4 qsar descriptors we used the dragon 7 software kode srl 2017 to calculate 3656 qsar descriptors for each mp as potential predictor variables the descriptors can be classified into eight major categories based on the physicochemical properties they represent including 1 electrostatic interactions e g charges ionization potential and electronegativity 2 hydrophilicity lipophilicity and hydrogen bonding capacity 3 molecular size mass and shape 4 constitutional information e g atoms bonds and functional groups 5 molecular connectivity 6 drug like molecular structures 7 geometrical information and 8 molecular topology and symmetry danishuddin and khan 2016 the descriptors from these eight categories are denoted as c1 through c8 in the following discussion we also used the padel yap 2011 and marvin chemaxon 2017 software to calculate 1188 additional qsar descriptors for each mp we used this independent set of molecular descriptors to develop a second set of qsars as a means to validate our mechanistic interpretations 2 5 development of qsar models we used our experimentally derived k d values as response variables and the comprehensive suite of qsar descriptors as predictor variables to generate qsars for each adsorbent we assumed that log 10 k d values could be predicted as an additive and linear combination of transformed and untransformed predictor variables in the following form as has been previously described apul et al 2013 blum et al 1994 brasquet c boueges b le cloirec 1999 3 log 10 k d β 0 x 1 β 1 x 2 β 2 x n β n where β i are the parameters of the model to be estimated and x i are the predictor variables it is worth noting that some predictor variables calculated by dragon 7 are provided as untransformed variables and in a mathematically transformed space e g logarithmic transformation in the event that any monotonic but non linear relationship exists between these predictor variables and log 10 k d values a schematic describing the overall framework for data preparation and quality control data partitioning model selection and model validation is provided in fig 1 and a brief description follows we first examined the full set of calculated k d values for each mp on each adsorbent and selected only those k d values for which the coefficient of variation cov across all adsorbent doses and replicates was less than 2 for use in model training and validation this conservative criterion was implemented as a quality control measure to ensure that we were selecting constant k d values that represent the linear range of the non linear isotherm and that no experimental or analytical biases were introduced into the qsar we next randomly partitioned the selected k d values for each mp on each adsorbent into training data 80 of the observations and validation data 20 of the observations using a previously described approach linden et al 2017 the validation data were only used to evaluate the predictive power of the final qsars the model selection workflow that we developed includes elastic net en regularization followed sequentially by both direction stepwise regression and all possible regression apr the en regularization is a necessary initial step to address the ill posed problem and the expected inter correlation among the predictor variables helbling et al 2015 kubik and wiczling 2016 zou and hastie 2005 we employed en with the package glmnet in r version 3 4 1 the parameters written as the vector β can be estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared errors sses and applying a penalty function that includes a hybrid ridge and lasso regression regularization term friedman et al 2010 4 min β 0 β ℝ p 1 1 2 n i 1 n log 10 k d i β 0 x i t β 2 λ p α β where 5 p α β 1 α 1 2 β l 2 2 α β l 1 in equation 5 p α β is the en penalty function and is controlled with the mixing parameter α that can range between 0 ridge regularization and 1 lasso regularization zou and hastie 2005 the weight of the regularization is controlled by the value of λ in equation 4 with larger values of λ leading to more regularization zou and hastie 2005 we used a random leave 20 out cross validation over 5000 iterations to identify the value of λ that optimizes the predictive performance measured as root mean squared error rmse of the qsar for the training data hastie et al 2017 wasserman and roeder 2009 we simultaneously varied the magnitude of α between 0 and 1 0 at steps of 0 025 to identify the optimal combination of λ and α that results in a qsar with a low rmse and a relatively small number of predictor variables it is worth noting that in this study we employed the en exclusively as an initial model selection technique rather than a final regression technique because the penalty function decreases the influence of the most significant predictor variables making it difficult to interpret the contribution of the selected predictor variables when evaluating adsorption mechanisms chong and jun 2005 wasserman and roeder 2009 zou and hastie 2005 in other words the en was used primarily as a means to reduce the number of molecular descriptors from 3656 1188 for padel and marvin models to several dozen molecular descriptors that optimize the predictive performance within the en framework to obtain more mechanistically interpretable qsars we used a both direction stepwise regression routine implemented in r version 3 4 1 to select the most significant predictor variables from the set of predictor variables selected by the en kubik and wiczling 2016 we cross validated the results of the both direction stepwise regression by randomly partitioning the training data into a new training set 80 of the original training data and validation set 20 of the original training data and performing an ordinary least squares regression over 5000 iterations we calculated the average coefficient of determination q c v 2 of the validation sets among the 5000 iterations and defined the model as functionally stable if the q c v 2 was greater than 0 8 and the difference between the adjusted r2 r a d j 2 and the q c v 2 was less than 10 li et al 2018b xia et al 2010 finally we implemented an apr analysis using a self developed script for r version 3 4 1 to evaluate the importance and significance of each of the predictor variables selected by the both direction stepwise regression hastie et al 2017 all possible model scenarios containing every combination of predictor variables were constructed and evaluated based on the r a d j 2 and the coefficient of determination q2 of the original validation data removed at the start of the workflow hastie et al 2017 olejnik et al 2000 2 6 defining the applicability domain applicability domains ads were defined for each of the final qsars based on the most significant predictor variables selected into each qsar as previously described li et al 2018b briefly the values of the three most significant predictor variables for each of the mps included in the original training data were plotted in three dimensional space and the average coordinates of those points were determined the euclidian distance between the coordinates of each mp in three dimensional predictor space to the average coordinates was calculated and a boundary value for the euclidian distance was defined as the ad 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimentally derived kd values we performed adsorption experiments to calculate the k d values of 200 mps on ccac and p cdp the analytical data allowed us to calculate k d values for 175 and 186 mps on ccac and p cdp respectively we then used the conservative criterion that the coefficient of variation across all experimental replicates must be less than 2 to select 169 and 181 k d values for qsar building for ccac and p cdp respectively this criterion ensures that all k d values remain constant across experiments with all adsorbent doses confirming that they adequately represent the linear range of the non linear isotherm and can be used to predict adsorption behavior of mps at environmentally relevant concentrations the log10 k d values for each mp on each adsorbent are provided in table s1 of the sd the log10 k d values of the mps range between 0 7 and 4 1 and 0 7 to 3 9 on ccac and p cdp respectively the magnitudes of these values reflect adsorption affinities in a similar range for each adsorbent though the wider range of k d values for p cdp suggests greater mp selectivity as was previously reported ling et al 2017 3 2 qsar model selection for k d values on ccac we first randomly partitioned our dataset of 169 k d values into training data 136 observations and validation data 33 observations using a previously described approach linden et al 2017 we then used en regularization with leave 20 out cross validation helbling et al 2015 to identify the optimized value of λ and simultaneously varied the magnitude of α between 0 and 1 0 at steps of 0 025 to identify the optimized value of α hastie et al 2017 wasserman and roeder 2009 the optimized en model has λ 0 0279 α 1 0 pure lasso regularization and 71 of the 3656 predictor variables are selected into the model after employing en regularization as an initial model selection technique we next used both direction stepwise regression to evaluate the significance of each of the predictor variables selected by the en and to generate mechanistically interpretable qsars kubik and wiczling 2016 both direction stepwise regression reduced the number of predictor variables selected into the qsar from 71 to 26 the internal cross validation routine resulted in an average coefficient of determination q c v 2 of 0 85 with the difference between the r a d j 2 and the q c v 2 less than 10 verifying the functional stability of this qsar li et al 2018b xia et al 2010 the q2 for this qsar is 0 52 and the r a d j 2 is 0 88 demonstrating outstanding predictive power and ability to fit the calculated k d values moreover there is little influence of multicollinearity because the overall variance inflation factor vif is less than five apul et al 2013 chong and jun 2005 therefore we conclude that the both direction stepwise regression identifies the most significant combination of predictor variables from the optimized en regularization scenario we present a comparison of the predicted and calculated k d values resulting from this model selection in fig 2 a the blue circles represent the 136 k d values included in the model training and the red triangles represent the 33 k d values of the external validation data according to point distribution no mp among the training data nor in the validation data exhibits more than one log unit deviation from the best prediction line demonstrating the outstanding statistical significance and predictive power of this qsar though this qsar is statistically significant and can perform reliable prediction of k d values among the mps studied it is possible to use multiple linear regression techniques to discover qsars with fewer predictors and similar performance bertsimas et al 2016 hastie et al 2017 therefore we employed an apr analysis to explore qsars derived from an exhaustive set of sub combinations of the 26 predictor variables selected into the hybrid en both direction stepwise regression qsar i e a total of 226 scenarios we used the values of r a d j 2 and q2 to evaluate the performance of each qsar and identify the best performing qsars containing 1 to 26 predictor variables the results presented in fig 2 b show the r a d j 2 and the q2 for each of the best performing qsars containing 11 to 26 predictor variables those with fewer than 10 predictor variables had relatively poor performance and are not considered further interestingly the r a d j 2 increases as the number of predictor variables selected into the qsar increases and the q2 increases and then decreases as the number of predictor variables selected into the qsar increases this observation indicates that selecting more predictor variables increases the fitting of the training set at the sacrifice of out of sample predictive power to minimize over fitting and improve out of sample prediction we used the optimal combination of r a d j 2 and q2 to select the qsar containing 14 parameters as the best performing qsar olejnik et al 2000 the final qsar has an r a d j 2 of 0 84 which is almost unchanged from the qsar derived from the hybrid en both direction stepwise regression and the q2 increased from 0 55 to 0 70 demonstrating the greatly improved predictive power of the final qsar we present a comparison of the predicted and measured k d values of the final qsar in fig 2 c similar to our observation in fig 2 a the 136 training mps and 33 validation mps are all within one log unit of the best prediction line this demonstrates that reducing the number of predictor variables did not substantively lower the predictive power of the qsar but generated a more generalizable qsar for the prediction of k d values on ccac the latter point is not entirely unexpected because models with large numbers of predictor variables have low degrees of freedom and high restrictions which could result in high predictive errors importantly although this qsar was built with a set of mps that are representative of a broad range of physicochemical properties including ionization potential the predictive accuracy is higher than other qsars developed in previous studies using sets of simple organic molecules with similar structures apul et al 2013 xia et al 2010 the predictor variables selected into the final qsar along with their parameters are provided in table 1 the statistical tests of the final qsar are presented in tables s2 and s3 of the sd 3 3 mechanistic interpretation of mp adsorption on ccac although the major mechanisms that drive mp adsorption on ac have been previously reported de ridder et al 2013 redding et al 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2017 we did not preselect representative molecular descriptors from among the 3656 qsar descriptors therefore we can examine the physicochemical properties represented by each of the predictor variables selected in the final qsar to evaluate whether our model selection procedure generated mechanistically meaningful qsars based on our fundamental understanding of mp adsorption on ccac de ridder et al 2013 redding et al 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2017 we expect that predictor variables representing electrostatic interactions c1 hydrophobic interactions c2 and molecular size c3 would be selected in the final qsar one predictor variable representing electrostatic interactions c1 was selected in the final qsar this variable is defined as gats1s in the dragon 7 software and is assigned the identifier cd c1a in this work see footnote of table 1 for details on identifiers electrostatic interactions are one of the most important factors that can influence the adsorption affinity of mps on acs de ridder et al 2013 cd c1a represents the charge potential of a mp and high values of cd c1a indicate a high positive charge potential the negative sign of the parameter for cd c1a indicates that cd c1a is negatively correlated with the k d values this agrees with our expectation that because the surface of the ccac is positively charged at neutral ph de ridder et al 2013 the mps of high cd c1a exhibit low k d values on this ccac due to repulsive electrostatic interactions three predictor variables representing hydrophobic interactions c2 were selected in the final qsar including cats2d 03 nl cd c2a cats2d 04 dl cd c2b and cats3d 11 pl cd c2c cd c2a represents the hydrophilicity of a mp and cd c2c represents the lipophilicity of a mp the parameters of cd c2a and cd c2c are negative and positive respectively agreeing with our expectation about the role hydrophobic interactions play in mp adsorption on ccac de ridder et al 2013 cd c2b is a descriptor for the hydrogen donating capacity of a mp the negative correlation between cd c2b and the k d values suggests a weaker hydrogen accepting capacity of ccac compared with water in other words the mps that are good hydrogen donors tend to stay in the aqueous phase instead of adsorbing on ccac and this is an important and significant determinant of mp adsorption on ccac four predictor variables representing molecular size mass and shape c3 were selected in the final qsar including tdb07v cd c3a sph cd c3b tdb04v cd c3c and tdb09m cd c3d cd c3a cd c3c and cd c3d each represent the size of an mp with larger values of these predictor variables indicating larger molecular size larger molecules are generally more hydrophobic due to the energy required for cavity formation in water apul et al 2013 the positive correlations between cd c3a cd c3c and cd c3d and the k d values suggest greater affinity of larger molecules for ccac supporting this expectation cd c3b represents the sphericity of a mp and also exhibits a positive correlation with the k d values this observation highlights the importance of the shape of a mp for its adsorption on ccac and suggests that mps with regular shapes could have a better chance to bind to the surface of ccac compared with branched and irregularly shaped mps the mechanistic interpretation of the c1 c2 and c3 predictor variables strongly suggests that our model selection procedure generated a mechanistically meaningful qsar in addition there were six predictor variables representing constitutional information e g atoms bonds and functional groups c4 or molecular connectivity c5 selected in the final qsar including chi dt cd c4a b05 c n cd c5a h 046 cd c5b nrnr2 cd c5c b02 n n cd c5d and noxiranes cd c5e we have no a priori expectation as to how the c4 and c5 predictor variables may contribute to mp affinity for ccac and the physicochemical properties of the c4 and c5 predictor variables are more difficult to interpret for example cd c4a represents the extent of branching of the carbon atom skeleton of saturated hydrocarbons dvořák et al 2011 the negative correlation between cd c4a and the k d values suggests that more branching results in a lower affinity for ccac but the mechanistic explanation of this relationship remains unclear therefore we note these relationships as new insights into the determinants of mp affinity on ccac and provide detailed descriptions of these predictor variables in table s2 to further evaluate the ability of our model selection procedure to generate mechanistically meaningful qsars we repeated the model selection workflow using 1188 qsar descriptors derived from the padel yap 2011 and marvin chemaxon 2017 software the fitting summary of this qsar is provided in table s4 and performance and diagnostic data are provided in fig s1 the best performing qsar following apr contains 16 predictor variables among the predictor variables are analogues that represent the physicochemical properties described for the c1 c2 and c3 dragon descriptors for example cp c1a represents positive charge potential cp c2a and cp c2b represent the hydrogen accepting and donating ability of mps and cp c3a cp c3c and cp c3d represent the size of an mp the parameters of these descriptors likewise support our mechanistic interpretation of mp affinity for ccac therefore the qsar built from the padel and marvin descriptors adds support that our model selection procedure generates mechanistically meaningful qsars this evidence further confirms that our model selection workflow can be used to develop qsars for adsorbents for which we know less about adsorption mechanisms and derive new knowledge about those adsorption processes 3 4 qsar model selection for k d values on p cdp we next sought to generate a qsar for p cdp using the validated model selection procedure developed for ccac because little is known about the adsorption mechanisms that drive the selective uptake of mps on p cdp a qsar for p cdp will provide a means to derive insights on the mechanistic aspects of mp adsorption on p cdp we partitioned our dataset of 181 k d values into training data 145 observations and validation data 36 observations the optimized en model has λ 0 2099 α 0 35 and 109 predictor variables are selected into the model both direction stepwise regression reduced the number of predictor variables selected into the qsar from 109 to 17 the internal cross validation routine resulted in an average coefficient of determination q c v 2 of 0 86 with the difference between the r a d j 2 and the q c v 2 less than 10 the external validation coefficient q2 is 0 70 and the r a d j 2 of the qsar is 0 90 a comparison of the predicted and measured k d values is presented in fig 3 a where no mp exhibits more than a 1 5 log unit deviation from the best prediction line we then employed the apr analysis to explore qsars derived from an exhaustive set of sub combinations of the 17 predictor variables selected into the hybrid en both direction stepwise regression qsar the results presented in fig 3 b show the r a d j 2 and the q2 for each of the best performing qsars containing 6 to 17 predictor variables we used the optimal combination of r a d j 2 and q2 to select the qsar containing 8 parameters as the best performing qsar olejnik et al 2000 this final qsar has an r a d j 2 of 0 79 and the q2 increased to 0 81 from 0 70 for the hybrid en both direction stepwise regression we present a comparison of the predicted and measured k d values of the final qsar in fig 3 c as we noted for the qsar developed for ccac the final qsar for p cdp exhibits higher generalizability relative to the qsar with 17 predictor variables for the prediction of mp affinity the predictor variables selected into the final qsar along with their parameters are provided in table 2 the statistical tests of the final qsar are presented in tables s5 and s6 of the sd 3 5 mechanistic interpretation of mp adsorption on p cdp p cdp is a polymer of β cyclodextrin crosslinked with tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile that rapidly removes many types of mps from water but exhibits a selectivity that is not fully understood based on our previous study we expect that positively charged mps will have a high affinity for p cdp due to a negative surface charge resulting from phenolates in the crosslinker klemes et al 2018 ling et al 2017 and neutral or negatively charged mps of a certain size will have high affinity for p cdp due to host guest complex formation in the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomers ling et al 2017 therefore we would expect that predictor variables representing electrostatic interactions c1 and molecular size c3 would be selected in the final qsar however it remains unclear whether these or other molecular descriptors would be the best predictors of mp affinity on p cdp three predictor variables representing electrostatic interactions c1 were selected in the final qsar including qpmax pd c1a and spmin5 bhs pd c1c which represent the amount of total positive charge and the positive charge potential of mps respectively the positive correlations between these two predictors and the k d values corroborate our previous observations ling et al 2017 and provide a new quantitative metric by which to evaluate the relationship between positive charge and mp affinity for p cdp the third c1 predictor variable was psi e a pd c1b which represents the electron donating capacity of a mp the negative correlation of this predictor variable with the k d values likewise agrees with our expectation arising from the negative surface charge of p cdp p vsa ppp a pd c2a is a predictor variable representing hydrophobic interactions c2 and represents the hydrogen accepting capacity of mps pd c2a is negatively correlated with the k d values indicating that p cdp is a weaker hydrogen donor than water as could be expected though selection of this predictor variable into the final qsar provides new insight on the mechanisms that determine mp affinity for p cdp tdb06v pd c3a is a predictor representing the van der waals volume of a mp pd c3a is positively correlated with the k d values indicating that larger sized molecules have a higher affinity for p cdp this predictor agrees with our expectation that small mps do not interact strongly with the binding sites within the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomers of in p cdp though the increasing hydrophobicity of mps of increasing van der waals volume may also play a role in this predictor being selected into the qsar as discussed with respect to ccac the three c4 and c5 predictor variables including hats6u pd c4a t s f pd c5a and f06 n cl pd c5b are more difficult to interpret and we refer the reader to table s5 for detailed descriptions of these predictor variables kode srl 2017 we also repeated the model selection workflow for p cdp using the 1188 qsar descriptors derived from the padel and marvin software yap 2011 the fitting summary of this qsar is provided in table s7 and performance and diagnostic data are provided in fig s2 the best performing qsar following apr contains 9 predictor variables we again find analogues for the c1 c2 and c3 descriptors in the padel and marvin qsars for example pp c1a pp c1b and pp c1c represent positive charge potential pp c2a represents the hydrogen donating ability of mps and cp c3a and cp c3b represent the size of an mp the apparent overlap in the mechanistic interpretation of the independently developed qsars using dragon or padel and marvin descriptors again provides support that our model selection approach generates mechanistically interpretable qsars 3 6 applicability domain of the final qsars we defined the ad of the qsars developed for ccac and p cdp by using the three most important and significant predictor variables selected in the respective qsars li et al 2018b the importance and significance of each predictor variable in the final qsars for ccac and p cdp are summarized in figs 2 d and 3 d respectively the importance is measured as the decrease of r a d j 2 when the respective predictor variable is removed from the qsar model grömping 2015 the significance is measured by taking negative log10 of the p value of the t test for each predictor variable we identified the descriptors chi dt cd c4a sph cd c3b and tdb07v cd c3a and the descriptors qpmax pd c1a spmin5 bh s pd c1c and tdb06v pd c3a as the most important and significant predictor variables for ccac and p cdp respectively the three dimensional predictor space for ccac and p cdp is presented in figs s3 and s5 of the sd respectively the euclidean distance of each mp is defined as the distance between the location of the mp in the predictor space and the center of the space of which the coordinates are the average values of the three predictors among the training data based on the euclidian distances of the mps in the training data ad boundary values of 1 95 and 2 04 are defined for ccac and p cdp respectively the ads for ccac and p cdp are presented along with the standardized residuals of each mp in figs s4 and s6 respectively the euclidean distance of all mps among the validation data for ccac and p cdp are lower than their respective boundary values indicating the validation data falls within the ad of each qsar further all mps among the training and validation data for ccac and p cdp exhibit standardized residuals less than 3 indicating that there are no outliers in the training and validation sets therefore we conclude that k d values on ccac and p cdp for mps within our defined ad can be predicted by our developed qsars with respect to p cdp it is important to note that there is expected to be an upper boundary for tdb06v pd c3a above which an mp is not expected to fit inside the cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomer however we did not observe any size exclusion among the mps selected for this study and the ad excludes large molecules from the prediction space 4 conclusions we measured distribution coefficients k d for nearly 200 mps on ccac and p cdp adsorbents in batch adsorption experiments conducted under conditions of infinite dilution the resulting k d values selected for model training and validation were constant across experiments conducted with a range of adsorbent doses confirming that the k d values adequately represent the linear range of the non linear isotherm and can be used to predict adsorption behavior of mps at environmentally relevant concentrations we developed applied and validated a novel model selection workflow that generated qsars to predict k d values for mps on ccac and p cdp within the linear range of the non linear isotherm this is the environmentally relevant range for mps that are present in water at trace concentrations the qsars can be used to predict the adsorption behavior of mps whose structures are contained within the applicability domain ad during water or wastewater treatment the novel model selection workflow can also be used to derive mechanistic interpretations of the adsorption processes the qsar developed for ccac contains descriptors that match our previous mechanistic understanding of adsorption on activated carbon the qsar developed for p cdp contains descriptors that support our previous mechanistic observations and provide a quantitative link between those descriptors and mp adsorption on p cdp the model selection workflow is fully adaptable and can be used to generate mechanistically meaningful qsars for other adsorbents or response variables our mechanistic interpretations provide strong evidence for distinct adsorption mechanisms of ccac and p cdp suggesting that these two materials can be complementary in water and wastewater treatment processes additionally the mechanistic interpretations of p cdp can lead to rational modification of cyclodextrin polymers to increase the adsorption affinity of specific mps on p cdp for example a polymer prepared with α cd monomers could exhibit greater affinity toward small mps or a polymer prepared with functionalized cyclodextrins or crosslinkers that impart a positive surface charge may enhance the affinity for negatively charged mps declaration of interests cornell university has filed us and international

18981,ecotoxicological risks of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in surface waters are difficult to model because data on pfass distribution in multiple compartments sediments suspended particles and aqueous phase are difficult to predict this study quantified the distribution of 21 pfass including pfcas c6 c13 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates c4 c6 c8 and c10 perfluoroalkane sulfonates 5 perfluorooctane sulfonamide substances fosams including etfosa fosa mefosaa etfosaa fosaa 2 n alkyl perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoethanols mefose and etfose bis perfluorooctyl phosphinic acid c8 c8 pfpia and 5 3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid 5 3 acid between bulk water and suspended particles in water column and pore water and benthic sediments from a tropical urban water body the distribution of pfass between sorbed and dissolved phase was largely dependent on the perfluoroalkyl chain length ncf2 pfcas with ncf2 11 and perfluorodecane sulfonate pfds ncf2 10 were found predominantly in the suspended particles and sediments by contrast short chain pfass ncf2 7 were detected predominantly in the dissolved phase sediment acts as a sink for long chain pfass while short chain pfass are more easily transported via the aqueous phase compared with benthic sediments suspended particles especially those in the top water layer carried much higher concentrations of pfass by a factor of 100 indicating the stronger sorption capability of suspended particles the wide variation in pfas concentrations in suspended particles pfass concentrations 26 8 1 284 ng g d w suggests that some suspended particles were preloaded with different concentrations of pfass in the water column which could highly affect the distribution of pfass in the aquatic environment pore water contained 1 2 times higher concentrations of pfass pfass 20 25 159 34 ng l than overlying bulk water pfass 14 2 79 98 ng l indicating the accumulation of pfass in pore water distribution coefficients kd were calculated using paired solids concentration and dissolved concentration in both water and sediment column kd sp and kd sed respectively and were compared with values derived from a laboratory batch experiment the averaged log kd sp log kd sed showed significant positive correlation with ncf2 except for short chain pfass ncf2 5 which presented higher log kd values than estimated the discrepancies found between kd log kd sp log kd desorption log kd sorption log kd sed suggest that the distribution of pfass in the field especially between suspended particles and bulk water could not be well represented by lab results and that using the water concentrations in the bottom layer for estimation of pore water concentrations could lead to bias results graphical abstract image 1 keywords pfass suspended particles pore water sediments distribution coefficients 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass such as perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas have emerged as global environmental contaminants due to their persistence kissa 2001 bioaccumulation potential conder et al 2008 lindstrom et al 2011 and toxicological effects kennedy et al 2004 lau et al 2007 their unique and so far unmatched properties including high surface activity thermal and acid resistance and water and oil repellency have led to their wide use in residential commercial and industrial products for instance as stain repellents aqueous film form foams afffs and surfactants in fluoropolymer production ahrens and bundschuh 2014 giesy and kannan 2002 since the first report on the ubiquity of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass especially perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in the environment giesy and kannan 2001 2002 investigations on the environmental occurrence and health effects of pfass have grown rapidly buck et al 2011 krafft and riess 2015 however predicting their fate in urban surface waters is still difficult because there is limited data on the origin of pfass and their distribution of pfass between the aqueous phase and suspended particles and sediments pfass can be classified as long and short carbon chain pfass based on their tendency to bioaccumulate buck et al 2011 oecd 2013 the classification depends on the type of head group long chain pfass refer to perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids cnf2n 1cooh pfcas with more than 6 perfluoroalkyl carbons ncf2 6 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids cnf2n 1so3h pfsas with more than 5 perfluoroalkyl carbons ncf2 5 and substances that can be potentially degraded to long chain pfcas and pfsas oecd 2013 previously much attention has focused on long chain pfass due to their bioaccumulation potential conder et al 2008 concerns regarding these pfass have led to manufacturers decreasing production of long chain pfass especially for pfos and its related c8 based chemistry weppner 2000 meanwhile it has prompted production shifts towards short chain pfass such as perfluorobutanoate c3f7cooh pfba and perfluorobutane sulfonate c4f9so3h pfbs which are considered to be less bioaccumulative buhrke et al 2013 or pfass with ether bonds such as perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids cnf2n 1 cn f2n 1 p o oh pfpias which are perceived to be less persistent buck et al 2011 wang et al 2013 data on the behavior of these pfass substitutes are limited xiao 2017 during their usage disposal and manufacturing processes pfass can be released into the environment giesy and kannan 2002 current contaminations of pfass mainly arise from stockpiles of previous applications of longer chain pfass and current applications of alternatives lu et al 2015 environmental monitoring studies have reported the presence of pfass in water boulanger et al 2004 dufkova et al 2012 nguyen et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 sediments and particles bao et al 2009 becker et al 2008 chen et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 in aquatic systems short chain pfcas were exclusively detected in the dissolved phase while long chain pfcas pfsas and two perfluorooctane sulfonamide substances fosams n ethylperfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid etfosaa and perfluorooctane sulfonamide fosa bind more strongly to particles ahrens et al 2010 one of the main factors that affect the transport and fate of pfass especially pfcas and pfsas is the interaction of pfass in water with particles the key parameter for modelling this interaction is the distribution coefficient kd which is defined as the ratio between solid phase concentration cs and aqueous phase concentration cw kd can be estimated by lab absorption experiments where pfass are spiked in a water sediment system and cs cw are measured and calculated after reaching equilibrium another way of kd estimation is through field measurements where sediment and water samples are collected and analysed to determine the cs and cw sediment has been considered as one of the important sinks for pfass especially for long chain pfass ahrens et al 2009 higgins and luthy 2006 prevedouros et al 2006 sediment associated pfass show a high bioavailability and can accumulate through aquatic food chains higgins et al 2007 several studies have described the partition behaviour of pfass between surface water and sediments and documented the sediment water kd values and organic carbon oc normalised coefficients koc kwadijk et al 2010 labadie and chevreuil 2011 pico et al 2012 the overlaying water concentrations are usually assumed to be equal to the pore water concentration and are used as the cw in the calculation of sediment water kd munoz et al 2015 nguyen et al 2016 however many studies have reported differences in concentrations of various organic contaminants between overlying water and pore water including bp type uv filters mao et al 2018 pesticides and insecticides wang et al 2012 antibiotics xu et al 2014 and pfass ahrens et al 2009 in addition studies have shown that the toxicity of polluted sediments is more closely related to the concentration of contaminants in pore water than in the bulk sediments landrum 1989 ma et al 2000 contaminants in pore water can be readily exchanged with the water column when sediments are removed from the aquatic system during dredging operations determination of concentrations in pore water is useful in the assessment of sediment contamination and its possible contribution to the pollution of the overlaying water column ma et al 2000 despite the well reported concentrations of pfass in sediments data on the concentrations of pfass in pore water and the partition behaviour between pore water and benthic sediments kd sed are scarce pore water concentrations of pfass were determined for the first time in ahrens et al 2009 and 11 pfass were detected at concentrations below 26 1 ng l with pfba pfoa and pfna being dominant in the upper sediment layer in addition no correlations were found for pfass concentrations in pore water and dry sediments except for etfosaa non linear correlation ahrens et al 2009 indicating that it may not be suitable to use kd or koc to describe partitioning behaviour suspended particles play a key role in the bioavailability transport and fate of contaminants in the aquatic environment because of their episodic resuspension deposition and high reactivities turner and millward 2002 despite the reported sediment water distribution coefficients data on the concentrations of pfass in suspended particles sp and the partitioning of pfass between sp and bulk water are scarce ahrens et al 2010 detected total pfas concentrations of 6 4 15 1 ng g 1 dry weight in the sp fraction which were higher than those in sediments by a factor of 30 40 in addition the distribution coefficients between sp and dissolved phase kd sp were more than 1 order of magnitude higher than the coefficients between sediments and overlaying bulk water kd sw ahrens et al 2010 this could be explained by the fact that the sp and sediments represent two different time periods of contamination their structure could be different and that the concentrations measured in the sp and water were not in equilibrium ahrens et al 2010 chen et al 2015 observed relatively higher particulate bound pfas fraction for long chain pfcas and suggest that environmental load of these pfass in water could be underestimated if the particulate phase concentrations were neglected despite the reported kd sw studies on the partitioning between sediments and pore water suspended particles and bulk water are scarce in this study concentrations of pfass in multi compartments including bulk water dissolved phase suspended particles dry sediments and pore water were determined simultaneously the objective of this study was to develop distribution data that can be used to model the fate and transport in a surface water body specific objectives were to 1 determine the distribution coefficients of suspended particles bulk water kd sp and benthic sediment porewater kd sed 2 infer the potential of sediments as sinks for pfass in surface water 3 evaluate the structure kd correlations and 4 compare kd values derived from laboratory batch experiments and field data to the best of our knowledge this is the first study quantifying kd sp kd sed and the commonly estimated kd sw at the same time compared with lab derived values results could provide new insights into the true distribution of pfass under field conditions and are useful for modelling the fate of pfass in the aquatic environment the terminology and acronyms in this study followed buck et al 2011 except for fosams which encompasses pfass containing c8f17so2n 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

spiked with 1 2 ng absolute of an analyte and internal standards mixture and analysed 8 times within one day s acquisition sequence and in different day s acquisitions to evaluate the repeatability

membrane blanks n 3 for each were analysed for each sampling on each sampling date three 250 ml bottles filled with milli q water were carried into the field as field water blanks field water blanks were processed together with samples the membrane used for field water blanks were also analysed as membrane blanks kaolinite natural sigma aldrich were used as procedural blanks for sediment samples all analytes in these blanks were below mdls indicating no significant contamination in sampling and analytical process 2 7 calculation of field based distribution coefficients solids water

calculation kd sp and kd sed were shown to be correlated with the organic carbon oc fraction foc of the solids ahrens et al 2010 higgins and luthy 2006 implying the organic matter content is a major

standard deviation sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas in the dissolved phase bulk water and pore water of the 21 pfass monitored 8 pfcas 4 pfsas 5 fosams 2 foses 1 pfpia and 1 n 3 acid 18 were detected in bulk water with total pfass pfass concentrations ranging from 14 2 79 98 ng l and 13 6 154 67 ng l in the basin and tributaries fig s1 and table s6 respectively in bulk water the pfca distribution was often dominated by congeners with chain lengths shorter than c11 i e pfhxa 1 95 10 3 ng l pfhpa 1 58 9 4 ng l pfoa 2 62 19 58 ng l pfna 0 9 10 92 ng l pfda 0 63 9 32 ng l and pfunda 0 11 4 5 ng l and the pfsas by congeners with chain lengths shorter than c10 i e pfbs 1 49 14 74 ng l pfhxs 0 52 21 52 ng l and pfos 1 65 45 56 ng l pfdoa 0 072 1 63 ng l four fosams mefosaa 0 06 1 31 ng l etfosaa 0 018 1 31 ng l fosaa 0 036 0 42 ng l and fosa 0 03 1 06 ng l and 5 3 acid 0 072 8 3 ng l were detected at much lower concentrations pfcas with chain length c11 i e pftrda pfds etfosa and others mefose etfose and c8 c8 pfpia were not detected in the aqueous phase above the method quantification limit averaged over all six samples pfass concentrations in the water basin site r1 r2 and r3 were relatively constant 43 02 3 07 ng l pfass were detected at relatively higher concentrations in tributary c1 except for december samples fig s1 for example the concentrations of pfbs pfhxs and pfos were 12 65 21 1 and 45 55 ng l respectively at tributary c1 in september 2014 compared to other sites pfos occurred at relatively higher concentrations at tributary c1 with median concentrations of 11 19 ng l it should be noted that c1 is adjacent to high density commercial areas with a large number of dining and entertainment facilities pfos related substances are used in fast food packaging materials schaider et al 2017 cleaning agents for glass cleaning poulsen et al waxes and floor polishes borg and ivarsson 2017 the proximity to these urban facilities could have resulted in the relatively higher levels of pfos in tributary c1 in pore water pfass distribution was similar to that in bulk water pfcas with chain lengths c10 pfbs pfhxs and pfos were found more frequently and at higher concentrations than the longer chain congeners table s7 however concentrations of pfass in pore water were detected at relatively higher concentrations compared to that in water samples fig 1 for example averaged concentrations of pfhxa and pfoa in pore water were 11 15 and 12 78 ng l respectively which were higher than the averaged concentrations found in bulk water samples by a factor of 2 mao et al 2018 also reported higher levels of benzophenone concentrations in pore water than in bulk water in the same area pore water in sediments is an organic rich matrix mao et al 2018 which could be a depository for compounds with strong hydrophobicity and could be a secondary contamination source for the overlying water column alvarez et al 2012 averaged dissolved total fosams concentrations 5 04 ng l were also higher than in water column samples 0 92 ng l etfosa was not detected in either bulk water or pore water while etfosaa mefosaa fosaa and fosa were detected in both bulk water and pore water with concentrations higher in the latter phase ranging from 0 02 to 5 18 0 18 5 32 0 04 1 56 and 0 07 1 34 ng l respectively the 3 perfluoropentyl propanic acid 5 3 acid concentrations were much higher ranging from 0 08 to 47 12 ng l in pore water strong sorption of 5 3 acid to sediments was previously observed in sludge and soil samples liu et al 2010 wang et al 2011a b in addition 5 3 acid is a major stable transformation product of tridecafluorohexyl ethanol 6 2 ftoh and this process is widely accepted to be the only source of 5 3 acid zhao et al 2013 the observed higher concentrations in pore water suggest that it may represent a previous contaminant event of 6 2 ftoh to our knowledge only one study has reported the occurrence of pfass in pore water from tokyo bay where the concentrations were generally lower e g pfhxs 0 1 0 54 ng l pfos 0 1 3 49 ng l pfhxa 1 17 4 74 ng l and pfoa 0 44 11 ng l ahrens et al 2009 than the concentrations in the present study 0 94 4 93 ng l for pfhxs 0 93 10 1 ng l for pfos 4 48 20 69 ng l for pfhxa and 8 09 18 51 ng l for pfoa also in contrast to the present study ahrens et al 2009 reported approximately 10 times lower concentrations in pore water than the maximum found in surface water this may be due to the much higher salinity in tokyo bay around 30 g kg than the surface water in the present study maximum 0 45 g kg which enhanced pfass sorption onto sediment zhang et al 2012 overall the observed relatively higher concentrations of pfass in pore water here especially pfhxa and pfoa suggest that these compounds could potentially diffuse back into the water column or be released by sediment resuspension 3 2 pfas in the solids phase suspended particles and benthic sediments the concentrations and detection frequencies df of pfass in suspended particles and benthic sediments in the downstream water basin are summarized in table 1 the pfass distribution in suspended particles and benthic sediments showed a markedly different profile in suspended particles the most frequently detected pfass df 70 were pfca congeners with chain lengths c8 i e pfoa 3 2 199 1 ng g d w pfna 0 26 208 9 ng g d w pfda 5 2 125 7 ng g d w pfunda 1 7 66 5 ng g d w pfdoa 7 8 89 3 ng g d w pftrda 1 05 207 8 ng g d w pfbs 0 09 49 3 ng g d w pfos 2 17 76 6 ng g d w and fosa 0 1 29 3 ng g d w pfass concentrations ranged widely from 26 8 to 1 284 ng g d w in comparison pfass concentrations from tokyo bay suspended particulates were much lower than present study and ranged narrowly between 6 4 ng g d w and 15 1 ng g d w which is consistent to the observation of lower aqueous concentration in tokyo bay ahrens et al 2010 than observed in the present study algae suspended in the water samples see appearance of suspended particles collected on membrane fig s2 may also contribute to the higher concentration in suspended particles in present study nguyen et al 2016 also detected high concentration of pfass especially during the wet season up to 30 000 ng g d w in suspended particles in the same area in 2011 however in contrast to the unexpectedly high concentration of etfosa 286 7 42 561 6 ng g d w detected in the previous study nguyen et al 2016 etfosa was consistently below detection limit both in aqueous and solid phases in the present study the earlier peak occurrence was suspected to stem from a singular perhaps accidental release over the years pesticide products containing sulfluramid have been phased out worldwide i e etfosa usepa 2002 and the higher transformation rate of etfosa compared to the other fosams lange 2000 rhoads et al 2008 yin et al 2018 may also have contributed to the lower concentrations observed in recent events for example yin et al 2018 found that transformation rates of etfosa were between 0 45 and 0 92 d 1 while the transformation of other fosams varied from 0 018 to 0 18 d 1 it is noted that the concentration of pfos in suspended particles was found to be much higher in c1 in september 2014 629 1 ng g d w as depicted in fig s3 this agrees with the notably higher concentrations of dissolved pfos found in the same sample indicating a one time release of pfos at site c1 similar to pfass in suspended particles the longer chain length pfcas pfbs pfos and fosa in sediment samples were frequently detected df 85 however the detected concentrations of pfass in sediments were typically more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than pfass in suspended particles with pfass concentrations ranging from 2 84 to 8 38 ng g d w ahrens et al 2010 also observed 30 40 times lower concentrations in sediments than those in the suspended particulates the differences in the solid phase concentrations can be explained by the following factors first bioaccumulation of pfass in algae and higher organic content oc in the suspend particles may result greater in sorption to oc ahrens et al 2010 higgins et al 2007 second benthic sediments originate from the settling of suspended particles during which they tend to aggregate to form bigger particles with lower surface area to volume ratio thus leading to lower sorption capacity mao et al 2018 turner and millward 2002 furthermore concentrations of pfass on suspended particles and benthic sediments represent different time periods of contamination mefosaa etfosaa and fosaa were more frequently detected in sediments than in suspended particles although at typically at very low levels 0 4 ng g d w in addition etfose mefose and c8 c8 pfpia were also detected in sediments at concentrations less than 0 08 ng g d w but not detected in suspended particles a greater sample amount i e 1g was used in the extraction of sediment which resulted in a lower detection limit for sediment samples as discussed in ahrens et al 2010 overall the high and widely varying suspended particles concentrations are consistent with suspended particles being carriers for long chain pfass 3 3 vertical profiles of pfass in the water column the vertical profiles of pfass in the particulate phase and dissolved phase are shown in fig 2 no significant difference in the total individual pfas concentrations in the dissolved phase were found in the three layers surface 0 1 m below surface b s middle 1 5 2 5 m b s bottom 3 5 m b s conversely total concentrations of pfass in per gram of suspended particles in surface and middle layer were found to be significantly different from bottom layers with the surface layer particles carrying the highest concentration of pfass p 0 01 the difference is especially significant for relatively long chain pfcas pfna pfda pfunda and pfdoa this may be due to higher surface area to volume ratios of the particles in the upper layer leading to a stronger sorption capacity another possibility is that algae with higher organic contents which mostly exist in the upper layer fig s2 contribute to the stronger sorption of pfass although particles in the surface layer carriers higher concentration of pfass 360 ng g d w the volumetric concentrations were actually lower than the bottom layer 5 3 ng l this can be explained by the higher tss concentration in the bottom layer table s3 particles tend to aggregate and form bigger particles as they reach the bottom layer and accordingly carry higher amounts of pfass mao et al 2018 taken together these results show that concentrations of pfass in the dissolved phase were relatively constant throughout the water column nevertheless particles in different layers were quite heterogeneous with respect to pfas loading and sorption properties in particular it appears that there were some particles in the upper layer although in relatively small amounts which carried high concentrations of pfass 3 4 solid liquid distribution of pfass in basin water and sediments the averaged distributions between sorbed and dissolved pfass in the water column and bottom sediments are shown in table 2 and fig s4 data from the water column were based on paired dissolved concentrations and suspended particle concentrations while sediment data were based on average pore water and sediment concentrations the percentages are expected to vary under different environmental conditions especially the total suspended particles concentration and sediment moisture the determining factor affecting the distribution between the suspended particles and the dissolved phase was the perfluoroalkyl chain length as expected pfcas with a chain length 11 and perfluorodecane sulfonate pfds were transported mostly via suspended particles in contrast pfcas with chain length 8 pfbs and pfhxs were predominantly present in the dissolved phase with less than 10 in the suspended particulate phase therefore their transport is not expected to be influenced by the fate of suspended particles as reported earlier chen et al 2016 nguyen et al 2016 for pfna pfda and pfunda pfos etfosaa fosaa and fosa distribution was intermediate with 10 40 sorbed by suspended particulates in the sediment column pfass were mostly sorbed except for pfhxa pfhpa pfhxs and 5 3 acid which occurred predominantly in the pore water 60 fig s4 considering the significant difference in the concentrations of pfhxa in pore water and bulk water it can be expected to diffuse back into the water column pfoa pfna and most sulfonamides n mefosaa n etfosaa fosaa and fosa which occurred predominantly in the dissolved phase were enriched in the benthic sediments this indicated the transformation of n substituted precursors such as etfose which was found occasionally in the particles of the tributaries as depicted in table 2 benskin et al 2013 mejia avendaño and liu 2015 rhoads et al 2008 3 5 structure log kd correlations the averaged log kd sp log kd sed and log koc sed values are summarized in table 2 log koc sp data could not be determined because the mass of suspended particles in 1 l bulk water samples was insufficient to determine the oc the log kd sp of pfass in the catchment ranged from 3 31 pfhxs to 5 09 pfdoa which falls in the range reported by nguyen et al 2016 but were 0 7 1 1 log units higher than values reported by ahrens et al 2010 1 9 l kg pfhpa 4 2 l kg pfunda in contrast the log koc sed in this study were 0 3 1 0 log unit lower than that reported by ahrens et al 2010 with the exception of pfoa and pfna although the organic carbon fractions of the sediments in the present study were higher 1 59 7 47 compared to 1 58 it should be noted that previous studies used bottom water layer for estimation of pore water concentration in the calculation of log kd sed however our study used the actual detected pore water concentration as discussed in section 3 1 pfass were generally detected at higher concentrations in pore water than in bulk water this resulting in the lower log kd sed in addition the available sediment pore water log kd sed values for all pfass were around 2 orders of magnitude lower than the sp water log kd sp values table 2 fig 3 a b as discussed in 3 1 the detected concentrations of pfass in sediments were typically more than 2 order of magnitude lower than pfass in suspended particles the high variation in the concentrations of pfass in suspended particles especially in the upper layer suggest that suspended particles are heterogeneous with respect to sorption properties which resulted in the higher distribution coefficients observed in the water column another possible explanation for the higher log kd sp than log kd sed is that pfass enter the water body in sorbed phase as highly loaded particles and desorption is slow and could not reach equilibrium chen et al 2016 interestingly although concentrations of pfass in suspended particles varied widely a significant positive correlation p 0 01 was observed between the averaged log kd sp log kd sed and the perfluoroalkyl chain length for c8 c12 pfcas pfoa to pfdoa fig 3a and c6 and c8 pfsas fig 3b with each additional cf2 moiety the log kd sp and log kd sed increased by 0 35 and 0 6 log units for pfcas respectively this was also observed in previous studies on the sorption of pfass on sediments higgins and luthy 2006 nguyen et al 2016 however the log kd sp for short chain pfcas e g pfhpa and pfhxa were higher than expected and remained nearly invariable 3 66 0 4 3 49 0 3 l kg respectively compared to pfoa 3 58 0 4 l kg as same as for log kd sed similarly pfbs although with only 4 fluorinated carbons its log kd values were comparable and even higher than pfhxs ncf2 6 the relationship of log koc sed and log kow shown in fig 3c indicates a significant positive correlation between the averaged log koc sed and the log kow for c8 c12 pfcas c6 and c8 pfsas this positive correlation indicates that the distribution of c8 c12 pfcas c6 and c8 pfsas between solid and dissolved phase was highly affected by hydrophobic interactions and the sorption potential increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl chain length as reported earlier chen et al 2016 higgins and luthy 2006 kwadijk et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 however the inconsistent higher values of log kd log koc for short chain pfass with lower log kow values suggest the possibility of other sorption mechanism for short chain pfass li et al 2018 found that sorption behaviour of pfass could not be explained by a single sediment property such as organic content to compare the distribution coefficients derived from the field and lab studies lab based data from chen et al 2016 using sediments from the present study area as sorbents were included in fig 3a b distribution coefficients from the sorption experiment were calculated based on the sorption isotherms which were developed in batch tests at a solid to water ratio of 5g 40 ml after 5 days of equilibration coefficients from the desorption experiment in fig 3 were the maximum value calculated based on the desorption isotherms which were developed by equilibrating batches for 5 days followed by replacing the supernatant with pfas free solution the figure shows that kd values from lab sorption were 0 5 0 9 orders of magnitude lower than kd sed from field measurements and that kd values from lab desorption were close to pfna and pfos or even higher than pfda kd sed in addition kd sp were consistently higher than kd values from both lab sorption and desorption data this is consistent with the assumption that particles enter the waterbody loaded with pfass and that the apparent equilibrium is reached after desorption during transport 3 6 implications the paired suspended particles bulk water sediment pore water concentrations are shown in fig 4 the dashed line shows the sorption isotherm derived from lab experiments fitted to a linear model as depicted in this figure the concentrations of pfna pfda and pfos were much higher in suspended particles than in sediments in addition the paired solid water concentrations could not be fitted to a linear model which is inconsistent with the forward sorption linear isotherm in the lab batch experiments using the lab derived sorption isotherm could largely underestimate the sorptive pfass in the water column the contamination level of pfass could be underestimated if only the pfass in bulk water phase were considered this could also suggest that some particles are sorbed with pfass before being washed into the reservoir but could not release pfass in a short time in fact the large discrepancy between the paired csp cw points to the lab sorption isotherm suggests that the particles loaded with pfass could be an important long term contamination source and that the interaction between the particles and surrounding water in the field study could not be estimated by lab sorption experiments in the sediment column the paired csed cpw points were relatively more consistent with the lab sorption isotherm however the lab sorption isotherms failed to match with the field measurements when cw fell into the lower range i e 4 ng l there are two possible reasons i lab sorption experiments are usually conducted at higher concentrations μg l which may not represent actual field conditions where pfass are usually detected at ng l levels and the non linear nature of sorption isotherms zareitalabad et al 2013 ii some particles are pre loaded with pfass and tend to aggregate and settle down to the sediment column which are not in equilibrium with pore water the irreversible sorption of pfass to particles could result in the disequilibrium observed chen et al 2016 4 conclusions this study provides comprehensive data on the occurrence distribution of 21 pfass in bulk water pore water suspended particle and benthic sediment which can help to improve the understanding of the behaviour and fate of pfass thus paving the way to development of fate and transport models for pfass eighteen pfass were more frequently detected in bulk water in which compounds with chain length c11 were the most predominant compounds the occurrence pattern of pfass in pore water was similar to that in bulk water in suspended particles pfcas with chain length c8 were also more often found with df 70 for benthic sediments longer chain length such as pfcas pfbs pfos and fosa were more frequently detected df 85 the concentrations of pfass in benthic sediment were significantly lower than those in suspended particles perfluoroalkyl chain length seemed to play a significant role in the distribution of pfass between suspended particle and dissolved phase e g pfcas with a chain length c11 were transported via suspended particles while pfass c8 tended to be predominantly present in dissolved phase this work also found positive correlations between log kow perfluoroalkyl chain length and log kd there were differences in distribution coefficients between field based calculations and lab based experiments in which logkd sp log kd desorption log kd

18981,ecotoxicological risks of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in surface waters are difficult to model because data on pfass distribution in multiple compartments sediments

acid c8 c8 pfpia and 5 3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid 5 3 acid between bulk water and suspended particles in water column and pore water and benthic sediments from a tropical urban water body the distribution of pfass between sorbed and dissolved phase was largely dependent on the perfluoroalkyl chain length ncf2 pfcas with ncf2 11 and perfluorodecane sulfonate pfds ncf2 10 were found predominantly in the suspended particles and sediments by contrast short chain pfass ncf2 7 were detected predominantly in the dissolved phase sediment acts as a sink for long chain pfass while short chain pfass are more easily transported via the aqueous phase compared with benthic sediments suspended particles especially those in the top water layer carried much higher concentrations of pfass by a factor of 100 indicating the stronger sorption capability of suspended particles the wide variation in pfas concentrations in suspended particles pfass concentrations 26 8 1 284 ng g d w suggests that some suspended particles were preloaded with different concentrations of pfass in the water column which could highly affect the distribution of pfass in the aquatic environment pore water contained 1 2 times higher concentrations of pfass pfass 20 25 159 34 ng l than overlying bulk water pfass 14 2 79 98 ng l indicating the accumulation of pfass in pore water distribution coefficients kd were calculated using paired solids concentration and dissolved concentration in both water and sediment column kd sp and kd sed respectively and were compared with values derived from a laboratory batch experiment the averaged log kd sp log kd sed showed significant positive correlation with ncf2 except for short chain pfass ncf2 5 which presented higher log kd values than estimated the discrepancies found between kd log kd sp log kd desorption log kd sorption log kd sed suggest that the distribution of pfass in the field especially between suspended particles and bulk water could not be well represented by lab results and that using the water concentrations in the bottom layer for estimation of pore water concentrations could lead to bias results graphical abstract image 1 keywords pfass suspended particles pore water sediments distribution coefficients 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass such as perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas have emerged as global environmental contaminants due to their persistence kissa 2001 bioaccumulation potential conder et al 2008 lindstrom et al 2011 and toxicological effects kennedy et al 2004 lau et al 2007 their unique and so far unmatched properties including high surface activity thermal and acid resistance and water and oil repellency have led to their wide use in residential commercial and industrial products for instance as stain repellents aqueous film form foams afffs and surfactants in fluoropolymer production ahrens and bundschuh 2014 giesy and kannan 2002 since the first report on the ubiquity of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass especially perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in the environment giesy and kannan 2001 2002 investigations on the environmental occurrence and health effects of pfass have grown rapidly buck et al 2011 krafft and riess 2015 however predicting their fate in urban surface waters is still difficult because there is limited data on the origin of pfass and their distribution of pfass between the aqueous phase and suspended particles and sediments pfass can be classified as long and short carbon chain pfass based on their tendency to bioaccumulate buck et al 2011 oecd 2013 the classification depends on the type of head group long chain pfass refer to perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids cnf2n 1cooh pfcas with more than 6 perfluoroalkyl carbons ncf2 6 perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids cnf2n 1so3h pfsas with more than 5 perfluoroalkyl carbons ncf2 5 and substances that can be potentially degraded to long chain pfcas and pfsas oecd 2013 previously much attention has focused on long chain pfass due to their bioaccumulation potential conder et al 2008 concerns regarding these pfass have led to manufacturers decreasing production of long chain pfass especially for pfos and its related c8 based chemistry weppner 2000 meanwhile it has prompted production shifts towards short chain pfass such as perfluorobutanoate c3f7cooh pfba and perfluorobutane sulfonate c4f9so3h pfbs which are considered to be less bioaccumulative buhrke et al 2013 or pfass with ether bonds such as perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids cnf2n 1 cn f2n 1 p o oh pfpias which are perceived to be less persistent buck et al 2011 wang et al 2013 data on the behavior of these pfass substitutes are limited xiao 2017 during their usage disposal and manufacturing processes pfass can be released into the environment giesy and kannan 2002 current contaminations of pfass mainly arise from stockpiles of previous applications of longer chain pfass and current applications of alternatives lu et al 2015 environmental monitoring studies have reported the presence of pfass in water boulanger et al 2004 dufkova et al 2012 nguyen et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 sediments and particles bao et al 2009 becker et al 2008 chen et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 in aquatic systems short chain pfcas were exclusively detected in the dissolved phase while long chain pfcas pfsas and two perfluorooctane sulfonamide substances fosams n ethylperfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid etfosaa and perfluorooctane sulfonamide fosa bind more strongly to particles ahrens et al 2010 one of the main factors that affect the transport and fate of pfass especially pfcas and pfsas is the interaction of pfass in water with particles the key parameter for modelling this interaction is the distribution coefficient kd which is defined as the ratio between solid phase concentration cs and aqueous phase concentration cw kd can be estimated by lab absorption experiments where pfass are spiked in a water sediment system and cs cw are measured and calculated after reaching equilibrium another way of kd estimation is through field measurements where sediment and water samples are collected and analysed to determine the cs and cw sediment has been considered as one of the important sinks for pfass especially for long chain pfass ahrens et al 2009 higgins and luthy 2006 prevedouros et al 2006 sediment associated pfass show a high bioavailability and can accumulate through aquatic food chains higgins et al 2007 several studies have described the partition behaviour of pfass between surface water and sediments and documented the sediment water kd values and organic carbon oc normalised coefficients koc kwadijk et al 2010 labadie and chevreuil 2011 pico et al 2012 the overlaying water concentrations are usually assumed to be equal to the pore water concentration and are used as the cw in the calculation of sediment water kd munoz et al 2015 nguyen et al 2016 however many studies have reported differences in concentrations of various organic contaminants between overlying water and pore water including bp type uv filters mao et al 2018 pesticides and insecticides wang et al 2012 antibiotics xu et al 2014 and pfass ahrens et al 2009 in addition studies have shown that the toxicity of polluted sediments is more closely related to the concentration of contaminants in pore water than in the bulk sediments landrum 1989 ma et al 2000 contaminants in pore water can be readily exchanged with the water column when sediments are removed from the aquatic system during dredging operations determination of concentrations in pore water is useful in the assessment of sediment contamination and its possible contribution to the pollution of the overlaying water column ma et al 2000 despite the well reported concentrations of pfass in sediments data on the concentrations of pfass in pore water and the partition behaviour between pore water and benthic sediments kd sed are scarce pore water concentrations of pfass were determined for the first time in ahrens et al 2009 and 11 pfass were detected at concentrations below 26 1 ng l with pfba pfoa and pfna being dominant in the upper sediment layer in addition no correlations were found for pfass concentrations in pore water and dry sediments except for etfosaa non linear correlation ahrens et al 2009 indicating that it may not be suitable to use kd or koc to describe partitioning behaviour suspended particles play a key role in the bioavailability transport and fate of contaminants in the aquatic environment because of their episodic resuspension deposition and high reactivities turner and millward 2002 despite the reported sediment water distribution coefficients data on the concentrations of pfass in suspended particles sp and the partitioning of pfass between sp and bulk water are scarce ahrens et al 2010 detected total pfas concentrations of 6 4 15 1 ng g 1 dry weight in the sp fraction which were higher than those in sediments by a factor of 30 40 in addition the distribution coefficients between sp and dissolved phase kd sp were more than 1 order of magnitude higher than the coefficients between sediments and overlaying bulk water kd sw ahrens et al 2010 this could be explained by the fact that the sp and sediments represent two different time periods of contamination their structure could be different and that the concentrations measured in the sp and water were not in equilibrium ahrens et al 2010 chen et al 2015 observed relatively higher particulate bound pfas fraction for long chain pfcas and suggest that environmental load of these pfass in water could be underestimated if the particulate phase concentrations were neglected despite the reported kd sw studies on the partitioning between sediments and pore water suspended particles and bulk water are scarce in this study concentrations of pfass in multi compartments including bulk water dissolved phase suspended particles dry sediments and pore water were determined simultaneously the objective of this study was to develop distribution data that can be used to model the fate and transport in a surface water body specific objectives were to 1 determine the distribution coefficients of suspended particles bulk water kd sp and benthic sediment porewater kd sed 2 infer the potential of sediments as sinks for pfass in surface water 3 evaluate the structure kd correlations and 4 compare kd values derived from laboratory batch experiments and field data to the best of our knowledge this is the first study quantifying kd sp kd sed and the commonly estimated kd sw at the same time compared with lab derived values results could provide new insights into the true distribution of pfass under field conditions and are useful for modelling the fate of pfass in the aquatic environment the terminology and acronyms in this study followed buck et al 2011 except for fosams which encompasses pfass containing c8f17so2n 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

and quality control two mrm transitions si were acquired for all analytes except for internal standards etfose and mefose internal standard method with 7 12 calibration standards prepared in 70 30 methanol 10 mm aqueous ammonium acetate spanning 0 0045 90 ng ml range was used for quantification before injection samples were mixed with 10 mm aqueous ammonium acetate to achieve the same 70 30 solvent water ratio the quantification method followed epa method 1694 epa 2007 calibration standards were injected at the beginning and end of every sample batch the correlation coefficients r2 were greater than 0 99 for all calibration curve and the relative standard deviation rsd of response factor rf was less than 20 the accuracy of all active points in the calibration curve were in the range of 80 120 solvent blanks and calibration verification standards were injected after every 10 samples to monitor instrument background and the validity of the calibration calibration verification standards were consistently within 20 of the expected values the instrument detection limits idls and quantification limits iqls were determined by injection of mix pfass standards with concentration ranges from 0 0006 to 90 ng ml to produce a peak with a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 and 10 respectively the method detection limits mdls and quantification limits mqls were determined based on idls and iqls and are a function of sample mass taken for analysis e g 250 ml of water or 1 g of sediments and final extract volume kim and kannan 2007 details can be found in table s5 sample extract was spiked with 1 2 ng absolute of an analyte and internal standards mixture and analysed 8 times within one day s acquisition sequence and in different day s acquisitions to evaluate the repeatability

were processed together with samples the membrane used for field water blanks were also analysed as membrane blanks kaolinite natural sigma aldrich were used as procedural blanks for sediment samples all analytes in these blanks were below mdls indicating no significant contamination in sampling and analytical process 2 7 calculation of field based distribution coefficients solids water distribution coefficients of pfass were calculated using the measured solids and dissolved concentrations of paired bulk water and suspended particle samples and paired pore water and sediment samples

calculation kd sp and kd sed were shown to be correlated with the organic carbon oc fraction foc of the solids ahrens et al 2010 higgins and luthy 2006 implying the organic matter content is a major factor contributing to sorption the organic carbon normalised distribution coefficient koc is defined as 3 k o c s e d k d s e d f o c the fraction contained in the suspended particles of 1 l

standard deviation sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas in the dissolved phase bulk water and pore water of the 21 pfass monitored 8 pfcas 4 pfsas 5 fosams 2 foses 1 pfpia and 1 n 3 acid 18 were detected in bulk water with total pfass pfass concentrations ranging from 14 2 79 98 ng l and 13 6 154 67 ng l in the basin and tributaries fig s1 and table s6 respectively in bulk water the pfca distribution was often dominated by congeners with chain lengths shorter than c11 i e pfhxa 1 95 10 3 ng l pfhpa 1 58 9 4 ng l pfoa 2 62 19 58 ng l pfna 0 9 10 92 ng l pfda 0 63 9 32 ng l and pfunda 0 11 4 5 ng l and the pfsas by congeners with chain lengths shorter than c10 i e pfbs 1 49 14 74 ng l pfhxs 0 52 21 52 ng l and pfos 1 65 45 56 ng l pfdoa 0 072 1 63 ng l four fosams mefosaa 0 06 1 31 ng l etfosaa 0 018 1 31 ng l fosaa 0 036 0 42 ng l and fosa 0 03 1 06 ng l and 5 3 acid 0 072 8 3 ng l were detected at much lower concentrations pfcas with chain length c11 i e pftrda pfds etfosa and others mefose etfose and c8 c8 pfpia were not detected in the aqueous phase above the method quantification limit averaged over all six samples pfass concentrations in the water basin site r1 r2 and r3 were relatively constant 43 02 3 07 ng l pfass were detected at relatively higher concentrations in tributary c1 except for december samples fig s1 for example the concentrations of pfbs pfhxs and pfos were 12 65 21 1 and 45 55 ng l respectively at tributary c1 in september 2014 compared to other sites pfos occurred at relatively higher concentrations at tributary c1 with median concentrations of 11 19 ng l it should be noted that c1 is adjacent to high density commercial areas with a large number of dining and entertainment facilities pfos related substances are used in fast food packaging materials schaider et al 2017 cleaning agents for glass cleaning poulsen et al waxes and floor polishes borg and ivarsson 2017 the proximity to these urban facilities could have resulted in the relatively higher levels of pfos in tributary c1 in pore water pfass distribution was similar to that in bulk water pfcas with chain lengths c10 pfbs pfhxs and pfos were found more frequently and at higher concentrations than the longer chain congeners table s7 however concentrations of pfass in pore water were detected at relatively higher concentrations compared to that in water samples fig 1 for example averaged concentrations of pfhxa and pfoa in pore water were 11 15 and 12 78 ng l respectively which were higher than the averaged concentrations found in bulk water samples by a factor of 2 mao et al 2018 also reported higher levels of benzophenone concentrations in pore water than in bulk water in the same area pore water in sediments is an organic rich matrix mao et al 2018 which could be a depository for compounds with strong hydrophobicity and could be a secondary contamination source for the overlying water column alvarez et al 2012 averaged dissolved total fosams concentrations 5 04 ng l were also higher than in water column samples 0 92 ng l etfosa was not detected in either bulk water or pore water while etfosaa mefosaa fosaa and fosa were detected in both bulk water and pore water with concentrations higher in the latter phase ranging from 0 02 to 5 18 0 18 5 32 0 04 1 56 and 0 07 1 34 ng l respectively the 3 perfluoropentyl propanic acid 5 3 acid concentrations were much higher ranging from 0 08 to 47 12 ng l in pore water strong sorption of 5 3 acid to sediments was previously observed in sludge and soil samples liu et al 2010 wang et al 2011a b in addition 5 3 acid is a major stable transformation product of tridecafluorohexyl ethanol 6 2 ftoh and this process is widely accepted to be the only source of 5 3 acid zhao et al 2013 the observed higher concentrations in pore water suggest that it may represent a previous contaminant event of 6 2 ftoh to our knowledge only one study has reported the occurrence of pfass in pore water from tokyo bay where the concentrations were generally lower e g pfhxs 0 1 0 54 ng l pfos 0 1 3 49 ng l pfhxa 1 17 4 74 ng l and pfoa 0 44 11 ng l ahrens et al 2009 than the concentrations in the present study 0 94 4 93 ng l for pfhxs 0 93 10 1 ng l for pfos 4 48 20 69 ng l for pfhxa and 8 09 18 51 ng l for pfoa also in contrast to the present study ahrens et al 2009 reported approximately 10 times lower concentrations in pore water than the maximum found in surface water this may be due to the much higher salinity in tokyo bay around 30 g kg than the surface water in the present study maximum 0 45 g kg which enhanced pfass sorption onto sediment zhang et al 2012 overall the observed relatively higher concentrations of pfass in pore water here especially pfhxa and pfoa suggest that these compounds could potentially diffuse back into the water column or be released by sediment resuspension 3 2 pfas in the solids phase suspended particles and benthic sediments the concentrations and detection frequencies df of pfass in suspended particles and benthic sediments in the downstream water basin are summarized in table 1 the pfass distribution in suspended particles and benthic sediments showed a markedly different profile in suspended particles the most frequently detected pfass df 70 were pfca congeners with chain lengths c8 i e pfoa 3 2 199 1 ng g d w pfna 0 26 208 9 ng g d w pfda 5 2 125 7 ng g d w pfunda 1 7 66 5 ng g d w pfdoa 7 8 89 3 ng g d w pftrda 1 05 207 8 ng g d w pfbs 0 09 49 3 ng g d w pfos 2 17 76 6 ng g d w and fosa 0 1 29 3 ng g d w pfass concentrations ranged widely from 26 8 to 1 284 ng g d w in comparison pfass concentrations from tokyo bay suspended particulates were much lower than present study and ranged narrowly between 6 4 ng g d w and 15 1 ng g d w which is consistent to the observation of lower aqueous concentration in tokyo bay ahrens et al 2010 than observed in the present study algae suspended in the water samples see appearance of suspended particles collected on membrane fig s2 may also contribute to the higher concentration in suspended particles in present study nguyen et al 2016 also detected high concentration of pfass especially during the wet season up to 30 000 ng g d w in suspended particles in the same area in 2011 however in contrast to the unexpectedly high concentration of etfosa 286 7 42 561 6 ng g d w detected in the previous study nguyen et al 2016 etfosa was consistently below detection limit both in aqueous and solid phases in the present study the earlier peak occurrence was suspected to stem from a singular perhaps accidental release over the years pesticide products containing sulfluramid have been phased out worldwide i e etfosa usepa 2002 and the higher transformation rate of etfosa compared to the other fosams lange 2000 rhoads et al 2008 yin et al 2018 may also have contributed to the lower concentrations observed in recent events for example yin et al 2018 found that transformation rates of etfosa were between 0 45 and 0 92 d 1 while the transformation of other fosams varied from 0 018 to 0 18 d 1 it is noted that the concentration of pfos in suspended particles was found to be much higher in c1 in september 2014 629 1 ng g d w as depicted in fig s3 this agrees with the notably higher concentrations of dissolved pfos found in the same sample indicating a one time release of pfos at site c1 similar to pfass in suspended particles the longer chain length pfcas pfbs pfos and fosa in sediment samples were frequently detected df 85 however the detected concentrations of pfass in sediments were typically more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than pfass in suspended particles with pfass concentrations ranging from 2 84 to 8 38 ng g d w ahrens et al 2010 also observed 30 40 times lower concentrations in sediments than those in the suspended particulates the differences in the solid phase concentrations can be explained by the following factors first bioaccumulation of pfass in algae and higher organic content oc in the suspend particles may result greater in sorption to oc ahrens et al 2010 higgins et al 2007 second benthic sediments originate from the settling of suspended particles during which they tend to aggregate to form bigger particles with lower surface area to volume ratio thus leading to lower sorption capacity mao et al 2018 turner and millward 2002 furthermore concentrations of pfass on suspended particles and benthic sediments represent different time periods of contamination mefosaa etfosaa and fosaa were more frequently detected in sediments than in suspended particles although at typically at very low levels 0 4 ng g d w in addition etfose mefose and c8 c8 pfpia were also detected in sediments at concentrations less than 0 08 ng g d w but not detected in suspended particles a greater sample amount i e 1g was used in the extraction of sediment which resulted in a lower detection limit for sediment samples as discussed in ahrens et al 2010 overall the high and widely varying suspended particles concentrations are consistent with suspended particles being carriers for long chain pfass 3 3 vertical profiles of pfass in the water column the vertical profiles of pfass in the particulate phase and dissolved phase are shown in fig 2 no significant difference in the total individual pfas concentrations in the dissolved phase were found in the three layers surface 0 1 m below surface b s middle 1 5 2 5 m b s bottom 3 5 m b s conversely total concentrations of pfass in per gram of suspended particles in surface and middle layer were found to be significantly different from bottom layers with the surface layer particles carrying the highest concentration of pfass p 0 01 the difference is especially significant for relatively long chain pfcas pfna pfda pfunda and pfdoa this may be due to higher surface area to volume ratios of the particles in the upper layer leading to a stronger sorption capacity another possibility is that algae with higher organic contents which mostly exist in the upper layer fig s2 contribute to the stronger sorption of pfass although particles in the surface layer carriers higher concentration of pfass 360 ng g d w the volumetric concentrations were actually lower than the bottom layer 5 3 ng l this can be explained by the higher tss concentration in the bottom layer table s3 particles tend to aggregate and form bigger particles as they reach the bottom layer and accordingly carry higher amounts of pfass mao et al 2018 taken together these results show that concentrations of pfass in the dissolved phase were relatively constant throughout the water column nevertheless particles in different layers were quite heterogeneous with respect to pfas loading and sorption properties in particular it appears that there were some particles in the upper layer although in relatively small amounts which carried high concentrations of pfass 3 4 solid liquid distribution of pfass in basin water and sediments the averaged distributions between sorbed and dissolved pfass in the water column and bottom sediments are shown in table 2 and fig s4 data from the water column were based on paired dissolved concentrations and suspended particle concentrations while sediment data were based on average pore water and sediment concentrations the percentages are expected to vary under different environmental conditions especially the total suspended particles concentration and sediment moisture the determining factor affecting the distribution between the suspended particles and the dissolved phase was the perfluoroalkyl chain length as expected pfcas with a chain length 11 and perfluorodecane sulfonate pfds were transported mostly via suspended particles in contrast pfcas with chain length 8 pfbs and pfhxs were predominantly present in the dissolved phase with less than 10 in the suspended particulate phase therefore their transport is not expected to be influenced by the fate of suspended particles as reported earlier chen et al 2016 nguyen et al 2016 for pfna pfda and pfunda pfos etfosaa fosaa and fosa distribution was intermediate with 10 40 sorbed by suspended particulates in the sediment column pfass were mostly sorbed except for pfhxa pfhpa pfhxs and 5 3 acid which occurred predominantly in the pore water 60 fig s4 considering the significant difference in the concentrations of pfhxa in pore water and bulk water it can be expected to diffuse back into the water column pfoa pfna and most sulfonamides n mefosaa n etfosaa fosaa and fosa which occurred predominantly in the dissolved phase were enriched in the benthic sediments this indicated the transformation of n substituted precursors such as etfose which was found occasionally in the particles of the tributaries as depicted in table 2 benskin et al 2013 mejia avendaño and liu 2015 rhoads et al 2008 3 5 structure log kd correlations the averaged log kd sp log kd sed and log koc sed values are summarized in table 2 log koc sp data could not be determined because the mass of suspended particles in 1 l bulk water samples was insufficient to determine the oc the log kd sp of pfass in the catchment ranged from 3 31 pfhxs to 5 09 pfdoa which falls in the range reported by nguyen et al 2016 but were 0 7 1 1 log units higher than values reported by ahrens et al 2010 1 9 l kg pfhpa 4 2 l kg pfunda in contrast the log koc sed in this study were 0 3 1 0 log unit lower than that reported by ahrens et al 2010 with the exception of pfoa and pfna although the organic carbon fractions of the sediments in the present study were higher 1 59 7 47 compared to 1 58 it should be noted that previous studies used bottom water layer for estimation of pore water concentration in the calculation of log kd sed however our study used the actual detected pore water concentration as discussed in section 3 1 pfass were generally detected at higher concentrations in pore water than in bulk water this resulting in the lower log kd sed in addition the available sediment pore water log kd sed values for all pfass were around 2 orders of magnitude lower than the sp water log kd sp values table 2 fig 3 a b as discussed in 3 1 the detected concentrations of pfass in sediments were typically more than 2 order of magnitude lower than pfass in suspended particles the high variation in the concentrations of pfass in suspended particles especially in the upper layer suggest that suspended particles are heterogeneous with respect to sorption properties which resulted in the higher distribution coefficients observed in the water column another possible explanation for the higher log kd sp than log kd sed is that pfass enter the water body in sorbed phase as highly loaded particles and desorption is slow and could not reach equilibrium chen et al 2016 interestingly although concentrations of pfass in suspended particles varied widely a significant positive correlation p 0 01 was observed between the averaged log kd sp log kd sed and the perfluoroalkyl chain length for c8 c12 pfcas pfoa to pfdoa fig 3a and c6 and c8 pfsas fig 3b with each additional cf2 moiety the log kd sp and log kd sed increased by 0 35 and 0 6 log units for pfcas respectively this was also observed in previous studies on the sorption of pfass on sediments higgins and luthy 2006 nguyen et al 2016 however the log kd sp for short chain pfcas e g pfhpa and pfhxa were higher than expected and remained nearly invariable 3 66 0 4 3 49 0 3 l kg respectively compared to pfoa 3 58 0 4 l kg as same as for log kd sed similarly pfbs although with only 4 fluorinated carbons its log kd values were comparable and even higher than pfhxs ncf2 6 the relationship of log koc sed and log kow shown in fig 3c indicates a significant positive correlation between the averaged log koc sed and the log kow for c8 c12 pfcas c6 and c8 pfsas this positive correlation indicates that the distribution of c8 c12 pfcas c6 and c8 pfsas between solid and dissolved phase was highly affected by hydrophobic interactions and the sorption potential increased with increasing perfluoroalkyl chain length as reported earlier chen et al 2016 higgins and luthy 2006 kwadijk et al 2010 zhou et al 2013 however the inconsistent higher values of log kd log koc for short chain pfass with lower log kow values suggest the possibility of other sorption mechanism for short chain pfass li et al 2018 found that sorption behaviour of pfass could not be explained by a single sediment property such as organic content to compare the distribution coefficients derived from the field and lab studies lab based data from chen et al 2016 using sediments from the present study area as sorbents were included in fig 3a b distribution coefficients from the sorption experiment were calculated based on the sorption isotherms which were developed in batch tests at a solid to water ratio of 5g 40 ml after 5 days of equilibration coefficients from the desorption experiment in fig 3 were the maximum value calculated based on the desorption isotherms which were developed by equilibrating batches for 5 days followed by replacing the supernatant with pfas free solution the figure shows that kd values from lab sorption were 0 5 0 9 orders of magnitude lower than kd sed from field measurements and that kd values from lab desorption were close to pfna and pfos or even higher than pfda kd sed in addition kd sp were consistently higher than kd values from both lab sorption and desorption data this is consistent with the assumption that particles enter the waterbody loaded with pfass and that the apparent equilibrium is reached after desorption during transport 3 6 implications the paired suspended particles bulk water sediment pore water concentrations are shown in fig 4 the dashed line shows the sorption isotherm derived from lab experiments fitted to a linear model as depicted in this figure the concentrations of pfna pfda and pfos were much higher in suspended particles than in sediments in addition the paired solid water concentrations could not be fitted to a linear model which is inconsistent with the forward sorption linear isotherm in the lab batch experiments using the lab derived sorption isotherm could largely underestimate the sorptive pfass in the water column the contamination level of pfass could be underestimated if only the pfass in bulk water phase were considered this could also suggest that some particles are sorbed with pfass before being washed into the reservoir but could not release pfass in a short time in fact the large discrepancy between the paired csp cw points to the lab sorption isotherm suggests that the particles loaded with pfass could be an important long term contamination source and that the interaction between the particles and surrounding water in the field study could not be estimated by lab sorption experiments in the sediment column the paired csed cpw points were relatively more consistent with the lab sorption isotherm however the lab sorption isotherms failed to match with the field measurements when cw fell into the lower range i e 4 ng l there are two possible reasons i lab sorption experiments are usually conducted at higher concentrations μg l which may not represent actual field conditions where pfass are usually detected at ng l levels and the non linear nature of sorption isotherms zareitalabad et al 2013 ii some particles are pre loaded with pfass and tend to aggregate and settle down to the sediment column which are not in equilibrium with pore water the irreversible sorption of pfass to particles could result in the disequilibrium observed chen et al 2016 4 conclusions this study provides comprehensive data on the occurrence distribution of 21 pfass in bulk water pore water suspended particle and benthic sediment which can help to improve the understanding of the behaviour and fate of pfass thus paving the way to development of fate and transport models for pfass eighteen pfass were more frequently detected in bulk water in which compounds with chain length c11 were the most predominant compounds the occurrence pattern of pfass in pore water was similar to that in bulk water in suspended particles pfcas with chain length c8 were also more often found with df 70 for benthic sediments longer chain length such as pfcas pfbs pfos and fosa were more frequently detected df 85 the concentrations of pfass in benthic sediment were significantly lower than those in suspended particles perfluoroalkyl chain length seemed to play a significant role in the distribution of pfass between suspended particle and dissolved phase e g pfcas with a chain length c11 were transported via suspended particles while pfass c8 tended to be predominantly present in dissolved phase this work also found positive correlations between log kow perfluoroalkyl chain length and log kd there were differences in distribution coefficients between field based calculations and lab based experiments in which logkd sp log kd desorption log kd sorption log kd sed this study also found that suspended particles could serve as pfas carriers in the aquatic environment acknowledgments this research was funded by the singapore national research

18982,the currently accepted biochemistry and bioenergetics of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob show an inefficient metabolism only 53 8 of the energy released when a mole of ammonia is oxidised and less than two of the electrons liberated can be directed to the autotrophic anabolism however paradoxically aob seem to thrive in challenging conditions growing readily in virtually most aerobic environment yet limited aob exist in pure culture in this study a comprehensive model of the biochemistry of the metabolism of aob is presented using bioenergetics calculations and selecting the minimum estimation for the energy dissipated in each of the metabolic steps the model predicts the highest possible true yield of 0 16 gbio gn and a yield of 0 13 gbio gn when cellular maintenance is considered observed yields should always be lower than these values but the range of experimental values in literature vary between 0 04 and 0 45 gbio gn in this work we discuss if this variance of observed values for aob growth yield could be understood if other non considered alternative energy sources are present in the biochemistry of aob we analyse how the predicted maximum growth yield of aob changes considering co metabolism the use of hydroxylamine as a substrate the abiotic oxidation of no energy harvesting in the monooxygenase enzyme or the use of organic carbon sources keywords ammonia oxidizing bacteria bioenergetics growth yield co metabolisim 1 introduction ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob have a fundamental role in the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and their presence both in natural and engineered industrial systems is generally desired as a mechanism to regulate the supply of loss of nitrogen from the environment prosser 2005 for these reasons aob have been studied and their growth parameters have been extensively assessed kowalchuk and stephen 2001 chain et al 2003 geets et al 2006 they are able to oxidize nh3 to no2 to generate energy and reducing power for autotrophic growth sayavedra soto and arp 2011 following the catabolic steps showed in equations 1 4 1 nh3 o2 2 h 2e nh2oh h2o δg01 170 49 kj mol nh3 e01 883 52 mv 2 nh2oh h2o no2 5 h 4e δg01 28 60 kj mol nh2oh e01 74 11 mv 3 0 5 o2 2 h 2e h2o δg01 165 46 kj mol h2o e01 857 45 mv 4 total nh3 1 5 o2 no2 h2o h δg01 307 35 kj mol nh3 the catabolism of aob begins with the reaction catalysed by ammonia monooxygenase amo in which nh3 is oxidised to hydroxylamine with concomitant reduction of oxygen to water equation 1 the reaction is highly exergonic it was initially assumed that this energy is harvested by the cell drozd 1976 hollocher et al 1982 but no experimental evidence has been provided sayavedra soto and arp 2011 thus the energy of this reaction is considered dissipated and therefore the only energy available for growth is a maximum of 136 86 kj per mole of nh3 recovered from the electron transport chain equation 3 and corresponding to a 53 8 of the total energy of the catabolic process 307 35 kj mol nh3 equation 4 besides the two electrons released from the nh3 oxidation to hydroxylamine another two electrons are needed to turn over the amo enzyme these are coming from the subsequent hydroxylamine oxidation equation 2 further reducing the number of electrons available for growth fig 1 overall less than 53 8 of the energy released from catabolism and less than two of the electrons liberated from nh3 oxidation are available for growth there appears to be a paradox for aob have metabolically speaking one hand tied behind their back and yet seem to thrive in challenging conditions for example i aob only consume free ammonia nh3 rather than the much more abundant ammonium ion nh4 suzuki et al 1974 at ph 7 only 0 6 is in the form of nh3 and compete with microorganisms that have more affinity for it prosser 2005 ii aob are found in conditions of low oxygen sliekers et al 2005 or competing with microorganisms that have higher oxygen affinity geets et al 2006 and iii amo exhibits high co metabolic activity fig 1 this enzyme oxidises many substrates other than ammonia for no apparent energy gain and without further oxidation of the metabolite produced arp et al 2002 moreover aob grow better in complex natural or engineered systems but few are available in pure cultures kowalchuk and stephen 2001 nearly all wastewater treatment plants can be induced to grow aob but few laboratories are able to sustain this group in pure culture finally there appears to be a stable and little understood interdependence between aob and heterotrophs khunjar et al 2011 keluskar et al 2013 in this work we aim to describe in detail how aob can harvest from the environment the energy and electrons necessary to grow on inorganic carbon known biochemistry and bioenergetics of the metabolic process are studied and a comprehensive model for aob metabolism is proposed we have used only thermodynamics analysis to calculate the maximum possible energy harvest per mole of nh3 consumed the minimum values for energy dissipation were selected through all the calculation process therefore the yield calculated could be considered the maximum theoretically possible for aob growth our results are compared against the theoretical and experimental values reported in literature other possible hypotheses about the biochemistry of aob are also discussed and the growth yields associated to these are calculated the bioenergetics analysis of the aob metabolism aims to understand better its survival and therefore to be able to design more efficient processes for removal of nitrogen or other co metabolites 2 materials and methods 2 1 thermodynamic analysis of aob metabolism and growth yield calculation the biochemistry and bioenergetics of aob metabolism are analysed in detail in the following sections by means of this analysis we approximate the energy harvested in each of the steps of the catabolic activity of the aob per mole of nitrogen consumed δge n equation 5 we do this by calculating the gibbs energy of each chemical reaction of the catabolism and estimating the associated energy dissipation at the same time the energy required for each of the anabolic steps to form 1 mol of new biomass is approximated δge bio equation 5 for this an average formula of biomass of c5h7o2n is considered with a molecular weight of 113 gbio mol and a degree of reduction of 4 mccarty 2007 further details on these calculations are presented in section s1 and detailed in the excel of supplementary information the energy balance of the aob metabolism equation 5 is calculated closing the carbon nitrogen and electron balances of the catabolic and anabolic reactions with this methodology the maximum growth yield yxs max in units of mole of biomass formed per mole of nitrogen consumed together with the overall stoichiometry of the aob metabolism can be assessed 5 1 y xs max j 1 j s a n a δ g e b i o i 1 i s c a t δ g e n 1 in equation 5 to calculate the energy balance between anabolism and catabolism 1 mol of ammonia per mole of biomass is added in order to account for the nitrogen necessary to build new biomass c5h7o2n s cat and s ana are the number of catabolic and anabolic steps respectively considered in the metabolism of aob based on the analysis presented the growth yield of aob is calculated and compared with the experimental values in the literature and those obtained applying two other widely used generic methods for yield calculation the thermodynamic electron equivalents revised model teem2 and the energy dissipation method see section s2 and excel of supplementary information for the description of these methods and the detailed calculation 2 2 the biochemistry and bioenergetics of aob catabolism the catabolic process of aob can be divided into three main steps as presented in equations 1 4 and further detailed in fig 2 overall the maximum energy available is 307 35 kj per mole of nh3 equation 4 however not all this energy can be used effectively by the cell as there are biochemical limitations the biochemistry and bioenergetics of each of the catabolic steps are evaluated in detail in the subsequent sections 2 3 first step ammonia oxidation to hydroxylamine the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine by amo occurs with the concomitant reduction of one molecule of oxygen to water and releasing energy one molecule of ammonia releases two electrons when oxidised to hydroxylamine while four electrons are required to reduce one molecule of oxygen therefore two electrons have to come from some other electron donor since hydroxylamine oxidation is the only known source of electrons in the metabolism of aob hydroxylamine has to be the source of these two electrons figs 2 and 3 how the electrons are transported to the amo enzyme is still not elucidated ubiquinol has been proposed as electron donor but without experimental evidence simon and klotz 2013 although this is an exergonic reaction there is no known mechanism for capturing the energy released which has led to the assumption that this energy is fully dissipated as heat yuan and vanbriesen 2002 this is the case of a wasteful metabolism the energy released in amo reaction 170 49 kj mol nh3 represents 55 47 of the total amount of energy available in the aob catabolism 307 35 kj mol nh3 and it is enough to translocate up to 10 2 protons from the negative to the positive side of the cell membrane calculated estimating the proton motive force according equation s 1 of supplementary information 2 4 second step hydroxylamine oxidation to nitrite the second step is the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite and occurs in the periplasm mediated by a bundle of enzymes in the hydroxylamine ubiquinone redox module recently the discovery of no as the product of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme hao added a new and currently unknown enzyme to the diagram that is responsible of carrying the oxidation of no to no2 caranto and lancaster 2017 in this bundle of enzymes the flow is assumed to be sequential and electroneutral sequential because the electrons flow from hydroxylamine to cytochrome c554 then to cytochrome cm552 and then to reduce ubiquinone to ubiquinol uq uqh2 fig 2 electroneutral because protons released in the reaction are consumed by the reduction of uq uqh2 simon and klotz 2013 in standard conditions hydroxylamine oxidation is endergonic 28 60 kj mol nh2oh and none of these enzymes have been described coupled with energy sources nevertheless four positive charges are generated in this reaction as the cytochromes only accept the four electrons fig 2 because the reaction is confined to the periplasm this increases the membrane potential of the cell but also makes the gibbs energy of the reaction highly dependent on the ph of the environment the gibbs energy calculations for this reaction predict that it would only be feasible at ph 8 fig 3 the reaction of hydroxylamine oxidation is only possible if it couples with the reduction of two mole of ubiquinone using the protons released to the periplasm then the overall reaction becomes exergonic for a larger range of ph ph 5 fig 3 the two moles of ubiquinol produced are the only source of reductive power generated in the catabolic process the ubiquinol produced feeds with electrons the amo enzyme the oxygen reduction and the anabolism of aob fig 1 2 5 third step oxygen reduction to water the reduction of oxygen to water occurs at the end of the electron transport chain the electrons flow from the oxidation of hydroxylamine and enter in the respiratory chain at the potential level of ubiquionone chain et al 2003 simon and klotz 2013 this is the only electron transport in the catabolic process of aob proven to be coupled with proton translocations that lead to atp production chain et al 2003 in fig 2 the complex iii ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase and complex iv cytochrome c oxidase are both coupling sites i e the electron flow is coupled with proton translocations across the membrane the consensus is that four protons are translocated for every two electrons traveling through complex iii and two in complex iv which implies a total of six protons are translocated white 2007 if no energy was dissipated the gibbs energy calculated is enough for the translocation of 8 8 protons if six protons are assumed translocated then the process has an efficiency of 68 56 in energy transfer this is a conservative assumption lower energy dissipation is assumed than by other methods proposed mccarty 2007 2 6 the energetics demand of the aob anabolism formation of biomass requires energy in the literature there are several theoretical and experimental approaches presented for estimating this necessary amount earlier reports showed that the energetic requirement may depend on the carbon source used the type of microbial cell and the conditions of the experiment farmer and jones 1976 stouthamer and bettenhaussen 1977 nevertheless some authors have proposed a fixed energy requirement to simplify the estimation of growth yield for different functional groups for example stouthamer and bettenhaussen 1973 suggested an average maximum value of 25 g dry weight biomass mol atp for the formation of any microbial cell although lower yields were measured when using glucose as carbon source in aerobic conditions farmer and jones 1976 in this case to analyse the complex anabolic process we divide it in several steps reversed electron transport fixation of inorganic carbon and biomass formation from glucose table 1 aob uses inorganic carbon as main carbon source therefore the first step is to fix the co2 in the calvin cycle chain et al 2003 in this process 3 mol of co2 are reduced to 1 mol of phosphoglyceraldehyde pgal consuming 9 mol of atp white 2007 pgal is used as building block to produce the necessary proteins phosphates lipids and amino acids that generate new cells chain et al 2003 the reduction of co2 in the calvin cycle requires 20 electrons per mole of biomass because the electron donor is nad p h this in turn requires the reduction of nad p which further increases the energy demand of autotrophic growth and reduces the growth yield the reduction of nad p is known to be energetically costly as it requires an increase in membrane potential which is thought to promote higher rates of energy dissipation sarewicz and osyczka 2015 and therefore significantly decrease the maximum growth yield liu et al 2007 heijnen and kleerebezem 2010 heijnen and van dijken 1992 five times more energy is needed to transport electrons backwards in the electron transport chain than the energy harvested when the electrons flow goes forward kim and geoffrey michael 2008 the electrons used to reduce nad p in aob metabolism can only come from the oxidation of hydroxylamine fig 1 chain et al 2003 the work of aleem 1966 gives the stoichiometry of cytochrome c oxidised by nadp versus atp consumed as cytochrome c is previously reduced by hydroxylamine and by neglecting the energy difference that could exist between nadh and nadph in physiological conditions spaans et al 2015 we can calculate the amount of energy consumed by reverse electron transport and add it to the overall energy demand see section s1 in supplementary information to simplify the complex formation of new cells we assume the formation of glucose from pgal which releases 2 mol of atp and we estimate the energy demand for the further formation of biomass from glucose using the value proposed by mccarty mccarty 1971 2007 rittmann and mccarty 2001 of 10 5 g dry weight biomass mol atp when glucose is the carbon source enref 8 we consider this value conservative as kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 have shown that it underestimates the energy needed for cell formation 2 7 summary the bioenergetics of aob metabolism the bioenergetics calculations for the overall aob metabolism are presented in table 1 the detailed balance of electrons carbon and nitrogen used to calculate the maximum growth yield is presented in the excel of the supplementary information together with the energy needed for the formation of new biomass some energy is required for maintenance of the actual cells and to compare the experimental yield with the one obtained theoretically this energy requirement also needs to be evaluated this is not trivial as it is not clear if maintenance is a constant because it could decrease in periods of starvation geets et al 2006 the calculation of the energy requirement for maintenance is discussed in section s2 and detailed in the excel of the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield calculation comparison with other methods based on the methods and assumptions described above we have estimated the maximum growth yield yxs max for aob to be 0 16 gbio gn nh3 this value drops to 0 13 gbio gn nh3 when maintenance was considered see section s2 and excel of supplementary information the calculation is conservative as low values of energy dissipation were considered no losses of energy in proton translocations or in the atp formation are assumed and the conservative value of mccarty 2007 together with the energy estimated to fix co2 was used to calculate the energy requirements in the formation of new cells kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 therefore the resulting yield can be considered a maximum thermodynamic threshold for aob in table 2 we compared our results with the maximum growth yield given by the energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 and the teem2 mccarty 2007 see section s2 and excel of supplementary information the calculation approximated by applying the teem2 method directly gives a value of 0 59 gbio gn nh3 far larger than the one calculated here and the one estimated by the energy dissipation method in mccarty 2007 a modification of the method is introduced to correct the growth yield overestimation when an oxygenase reaction is involved in the catabolic process the energy of this reaction is considered fully dissipated so it must be removed from the overall energy of the catabolic process yuan and vanbriesen 2002 if the correction is applied to the aob metabolism the teem2 method returns a value of 0 43 table 2 still far larger than the value calculated by the calculations presented in this manuscript the growth yield obtained with the energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 is similar to the one presented in this study however when we directly apply this method we close the energy balance considering the full energy released in the oxidation of nh3 307 35 kj mol nh3 and therefore we implicitly assume that the energy of the monooxygenase reaction is harvested kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 also claim that a teem2 type correction is necessary for the monooxygenase reaction this correction means subtracting the energy of the monooxygenase reaction from the overall δg01 value of catabolism however when the correction is applied the calculated yield reduces to 0 06 gbio gn nh3 a very low value for the aob growth yield if we compare it with the experimental values presented in table 3 see excel of supplementary information for detailed calculations 3 2 yield calculation comparison with experimental values the experimental growth yield values measured for aob encompass the full range between 0 04 and 0 45 gbio gn nh3 table 3 this makes the comparison between experimental and theoretical calculations rather difficult considering that the calculations conducted in this study are conservative with the estimations of the energy losses in the metabolic process the values observed experimentally are expected to be in all cases lower than the calculated ones this is true for the values reported in pure culture however the values reported when measured in experiments with mixed cultures are in average 65 higher than the observed yield predicted through the metabolic analysis nevertheless the results observed by ciudad et al 2006 blackburne et al 2007 jubany et al 2008 and fang et al 2009 agree with the theoretical value estimated in our calculations 3 3 yield calculation no2 as a nonenzymatic product of no oxidation the possibility that no is oxidised abiotically is discussed in caranto and lancaster 2017 in the presence of o2 nonenzymatic no oxidation to no2 occurs and could compete with the activity of the unknown enzyme that carries this last step in aob metabolism caranto and lancaster 2017 show that the gibbs energy of the oxidation of hydroxylamine is higher if no instead no2 is the product we also observe this but as the oxidation of hydroxylamine is not coupled with energy harvesting and its oxidation to no only releases three electrons instead of the four released when it is oxidised to no2 the maximum yield calculated for aob when no is considered the final product drops to 0 10 gbio gn nh3 0 08 gbio gn nh3 including maintenance see excel of supplementary information comparing these values with the experimental ones presented in table 3 they can be considered too low and therefore the abiotic no oxidation not representative 3 4 is the energy of the ammonia oxidation fully wasted the amo reaction has not been shown to be coupled with any known energy harvesting mechanism simon and klotz 2013 and therefore it is considered as a necessary first metabolic step but without energetic benefit chain et al 2003 whittaker et al 2000 vajrala et al 2013 however how the electrons released in the hydroxylamine oxidation are provided to the amo enzyme is also not solved and this electron transport could be associated with some energy harvesting process like proton translocation if no energy harvesting is coupled with amo activity then the ammonia oxidizing bacteria will only harvest the energy of two electrons released from the oxidation of the hydroxylamine the same number of electrons that are entering the electron transport chain for the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob this can sound contradictory as the growth yield of nob is lower than half of the value of the growth yield of aob blackburne et al 2007 jubany et al 2008 the explanation comes from the energy balance of the metabolism of nob the electron transfer for nob is not fully elucidated simon and klotz 2013 however the oxidation of hno2 into hno3 has a reduction potential around of 328 mv which implies that ubiquinone cannot be considered the electron carrier of the reaction uq uqh2 100 mv therefore because electrons cannot enter at the level of the ubiquinone in the electron transport chain the number of translocated protons per mole of nitrate consumed must be lower than six an analysis of the energy balance of nob is presented in the excel of supplementary information assuming the same process for the anabolism of nob as for the aob a maximum growth yield of 0 10 gbio gn no2 is calculated this value perfectly agrees with the values presented by jubany et al 2008 and blackburne et al 2007 the idea that the energy of the amo reaction is lost is also supported because aob fed hydroxylamine have shown a higher yield than aob fed with nh3 vajrala et al 2013 de bruijn et al 1995 this observation agrees with our model if we calculate the growth yield considering hydroxylamine as substrate it reaches a value of 0 31 gbio gn nh2oh 0 27 gbio gn nh2oh including maintenance see excel of supplementary information 3 5 is the low selectivity of amo enzyme of any benefit for aob growth aob are known to co oxidize a broad spectrum of different substrates carbon monoxide methane hydrocarbons aromatic compounds etc sayavedra soto and arp 2011 this secondary activity is considered as a fortuitous degradation and attributed to the low selectivity of the amo it is classified as co metabolism occurring concomitantly with nh3 oxidation and it is considered a futile microbial activity that is not yet fully biochemically described or understood wackett 1996 co oxidation of substrates other than nh3 will lead to the futile use of electrons electrons that will then not be available for microbial growth in general aob cannot oxidize the product of these co metabolisms or use them as carbon source therefore the co oxidation of substrates other than nh3 will inevitably reduce the growth yield of aob in some laboratory experiments the ratio of co oxidation of other molecules to ammonia has surprisingly high values hyman et al 1985 hyman and wood 1984 if a ratio of 2 1 nh3 to co metabolite oxidised is considered then the estimated true yield is just of 0 09 gbio gn nh3 see excel of supplementary information the growth yield of aob with intense co metabolic activity has not been extensively documented taher and chandran 2013 reported a biomass production unaffected by high co metabolic activity and other authors claim to observe aob cultures maintained only by degrading co substrates forrez et al 2009 de gusseme et al 2009 clearly if we assume that the current biochemical model for aob metabolism is correct this cannot be possible concomitant consumption of nh3 is needed to observe co metabolic activity the energy released in the amo reaction allows for the maximum translocation of 10 protons if for example only the translocation of 2 protons are considered coupled to the amo reaction which implies an 80 42 of energy dissipation the maximum possible growth yield calculated would increase to 0 21 gbio gn nh3 0 18 gbio gn nh3 including maintenance see excel of supplementary information this could be a plausible value if we consider the range presented in table 3 however to date we were not able to find any strong reason that supports energy harvesting in the amo enzyme activity this implies that aob do not benefit from co metabolism and indeed this can only be detrimental for its growth 3 6 is the presence of heterotrophic bacteria beneficial to aob growth heterotrophs and aob are competitors for ammonia and especially oxygen nevertheless in conditions of low organic matter concentrations commensalism between aob and heterotrophs has been proven with aob releasing organic compounds which are substrates for heterotrophs rittmann et al 1994 dolinšek et al 2013 moreover heterotrophs can degrade the products of the co oxidation reactions catalysed by the amo enzyme this reduces the product inhibition observed in aob and favours the complete degradation of complex molecules khunjar et al 2011 taher and chandran 2013 at the same time heterotrophs are known to degrade organic matter to easily degradable substrates like pyruvate lactate acetate known carbon sources for aob in specific conditions chain et al 2003 schmidt 2009 the use of an organic carbon for growth not only reduces the energetic cost of new biomass formation but also the electrons needed for the process all together increasing aob capacity to survive in unfavourable conditions it has been observed that the growth yield of aob increases 130 when using organic substrates prosser 2005 in our study if pyruvate is assumed to be the only carbon source for aob a maximum yield of 0 61 gbio gn nh3 0 35 gbio gn nh3 including maintenance see excel of supplementary information is obtained however aob heterotrophic activity does not occur easily for unidentified reasons the growth of aob on organic sources is inhibited at higher concentrations of potential carbon sources prosser 2005 or by co2 presence schmidt 2009 the metabolism of aob could be more nuanced than previously thought it is possible that ammonia oxidizers harvest small amounts of energy from the co metabolism of a variety of substrates or by partial use of organic carbon sources to grow this could explain why observed yields of aob are often higher than conventional theory would predict especially when aob grows in mixed microbial communities there may exist a mutual benefit between aob and heterotrophs sedlacek et al 2016 but it might be difficult to observe because it may rely on secondary substrates for both bacterial populations however in unfavourable conditions this commensalism could be a source of small quantities of energy harvested per mole of electron donor or carbon source and co metabolism in aob could not have a direct energy benefit but could help promote the presence of heterotrophs around aob colonies 4 conclusions an in depth analysis of the bioenergetics of the catabolism of aob could not find strong reasons to conclude a direct benefit from ammonia oxidation other than the production of hydroxylamine as a source of electrons for the reductive catabolic and anabolic processes needed for aob survival this implies that co metabolic activity would be always detrimental for aob as it is a futile loss of highly necessary electrons nevertheless even assuming a high co metabolic activity of 2 1 nh3 co metabolite the growth yield calculated would allow aob to survive 0 08 gbio gn nh3 when comparing our predicted growth yield with the one obtained by generic methods for the calculation of microbial growth yields the latter were found wanting the application of the teem2 method resulted in higher growth yields than observed and the dissipation method gives a value smaller than most of the experimental values table 3 a maximum true yield yxs max of 0 16 gbio gn nh3 0 13 gbio gn nh3 when maintenance was considered is predicted in our analysis these values are in concordance with the experimental ones observed by blackburne et al 2007 jubany et al 2008 and others although in the literature there is a large range of experimental values and the average of these are above the one theoretically presented in this study the higher yields observed versus the ones theoretically predicted could only be explained with non considered energy sources in the biochemistry of the aob possibilities for aob to harvest more energy per mole of nh3 oxidised could be by either the aforementioned hypothetical energy coupling in the amo enzyme reaction or the feasible consumption of organic carbon sources that might occur in specific conditions both could be the explanation of a more robust growth of aob within mixed cultures with heterotrophic activity conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments the authors want to thank prof ian head

18982,the currently accepted biochemistry and bioenergetics of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob show an inefficient metabolism only 53 8 of the energy released when a mole of ammonia is oxidised and less than two of the electrons liberated can be directed to the autotrophic anabolism however paradoxically aob seem to thrive in challenging conditions growing readily in virtually most aerobic environment yet limited aob exist in pure culture in this study a comprehensive model of the biochemistry of the metabolism of aob is presented using bioenergetics calculations and selecting the minimum estimation for the energy dissipated in each of the metabolic steps the model predicts the highest possible true yield of 0 16 gbio gn and a yield of 0 13 gbio gn when cellular maintenance is considered observed yields should always be lower than these values but the range of experimental values in literature vary between 0 04 and 0 45 gbio gn in this work we discuss if this variance of observed values for aob growth yield could be understood if other non considered alternative energy sources are present in the biochemistry of aob we analyse how the predicted maximum growth yield of aob changes considering co metabolism the use of hydroxylamine as a substrate the abiotic oxidation of no energy harvesting in the monooxygenase enzyme or the use of organic carbon sources keywords

δg01 28 60 kj mol nh2oh e01 74 11 mv 3 0 5 o2 2 h 2e h2o δg01 165 46 kj mol h2o e01 857 45 mv 4 total nh3 1 5 o2 no2 h2o h δg01 307 35 kj mol nh3 the catabolism of aob begins with the reaction catalysed by ammonia monooxygenase amo in which nh3 is oxidised to hydroxylamine with concomitant reduction of oxygen to water equation 1 the reaction is highly exergonic it was initially assumed that this energy is harvested by the cell drozd 1976 hollocher et al 1982 but no experimental evidence has been provided sayavedra soto and arp 2011 thus the energy of this reaction is considered dissipated and therefore the only energy available for growth is a maximum of 136 86 kj per mole of nh3 recovered from the electron transport chain equation 3 and corresponding to a 53 8 of the total energy of the catabolic process 307 35 kj mol nh3 equation 4 besides the two electrons released from the nh3 oxidation to hydroxylamine another two electrons are needed to turn over the amo enzyme these are coming from the subsequent hydroxylamine oxidation equation 2 further reducing the number of electrons available for growth fig 1 overall less than 53 8 of the energy released from catabolism and less than two of the electrons liberated from nh3 oxidation are available for growth there appears to be a paradox for aob have metabolically speaking one hand tied behind their back and yet seem to thrive in challenging conditions for example i aob only consume free ammonia nh3 rather than the much more abundant ammonium ion nh4 suzuki et al 1974 at ph 7 only 0 6 is in the form of nh3 and compete with microorganisms that have more affinity for it prosser 2005 ii aob are found in conditions of low oxygen sliekers et al 2005 or competing with microorganisms that have higher oxygen affinity geets et al 2006 and iii amo exhibits high co metabolic activity fig 1 this enzyme oxidises many substrates other than ammonia for no apparent energy gain and without further oxidation of the metabolite produced arp et al 2002 moreover aob grow better in complex natural or engineered systems but few are available in pure cultures kowalchuk and stephen 2001 nearly all wastewater treatment plants can be induced to grow aob but few laboratories are able to sustain this group in pure culture finally there appears to be a stable and little understood interdependence between aob and heterotrophs khunjar et al 2011 keluskar et al 2013 in this work we aim to describe in detail how aob can harvest from the environment the energy and electrons necessary to grow on inorganic carbon known biochemistry and bioenergetics of the metabolic process are studied and a comprehensive model for aob metabolism is proposed we have used only thermodynamics analysis to calculate the maximum possible energy harvest per mole of nh3 consumed the minimum values for energy dissipation were selected through all the calculation process therefore the yield calculated could be considered the maximum theoretically possible for aob growth our results are compared against the theoretical and experimental values reported in literature other possible hypotheses about the biochemistry of aob are also discussed and the growth yields associated to these are calculated the bioenergetics analysis of the aob metabolism aims to understand better its survival and therefore to be able to design more efficient processes for removal of nitrogen or other co metabolites 2 materials and methods 2 1 thermodynamic analysis of aob metabolism and growth yield calculation the biochemistry and bioenergetics of aob metabolism are analysed in detail in the following sections by means of this analysis we approximate the energy harvested in each of the steps of the catabolic activity of the aob per mole of nitrogen consumed δge n equation 5 we do this by calculating the gibbs energy of each chemical reaction of the catabolism and estimating the associated energy dissipation at the same time the energy required for each of the anabolic steps to form 1 mol of new biomass is approximated δge bio equation 5 for this an average formula of biomass of c5h7o2n is considered with a molecular weight of 113 gbio mol and a degree of reduction of 4 mccarty 2007 further details on these calculations are presented in section s1 and detailed in the excel of supplementary information the energy balance of the aob metabolism equation 5 is calculated closing the carbon nitrogen and electron balances of the catabolic and anabolic reactions with this methodology the maximum growth yield yxs max in units of mole of biomass formed per mole of nitrogen consumed together with the overall stoichiometry of the aob metabolism can be assessed 5 1 y xs max j 1 j s a n a δ g e b i o i 1 i s c a t δ g e n 1 in equation 5 to calculate the energy balance between anabolism and catabolism 1 mol of ammonia per mole of biomass is added in order to account for the nitrogen necessary to build new biomass c5h7o2n s cat and s ana are the number of catabolic and anabolic steps respectively considered in the metabolism of aob based on the analysis presented the growth yield of aob is calculated and compared with the experimental values in the literature and those obtained applying two other widely used generic methods for yield calculation the thermodynamic electron equivalents revised model teem2 and the energy dissipation method see section s2 and excel of supplementary information for the description of these methods and the detailed calculation 2 2 the biochemistry and bioenergetics of aob catabolism the catabolic process of aob can be divided into three main steps as presented in equations 1 4 and further detailed in fig 2 overall the maximum energy available is 307 35 kj per mole of nh3 equation 4 however not all this energy can be used effectively by the cell as there are biochemical limitations the biochemistry and bioenergetics of each of the catabolic steps are evaluated in detail in the subsequent sections 2 3 first step ammonia oxidation to hydroxylamine the oxidation of ammonia to hydroxylamine by amo occurs with the concomitant reduction of one molecule of oxygen to water and releasing energy one molecule of ammonia releases two electrons when oxidised to hydroxylamine while four electrons are required to reduce one molecule of oxygen therefore two electrons have to come from some other electron donor since hydroxylamine oxidation is the only known source of electrons in the metabolism of aob hydroxylamine has to be the source of these two electrons figs 2 and 3 how the electrons are transported to the amo enzyme is still not elucidated ubiquinol has been proposed as electron donor but without experimental evidence simon and klotz 2013 although this is an exergonic reaction there is no known mechanism for capturing the energy released which has led to the assumption that this energy is fully dissipated as heat yuan and vanbriesen 2002 this is the case of a wasteful metabolism the energy released in amo reaction 170 49 kj mol nh3 represents 55 47 of the total amount of energy available in the aob catabolism 307 35 kj mol nh3 and it is enough to translocate up to 10 2 protons from the negative to the positive side of the cell membrane calculated estimating the proton motive force according equation s 1 of supplementary information 2 4 second step hydroxylamine oxidation to nitrite the second step is the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite and occurs in the periplasm mediated by a bundle of enzymes in the hydroxylamine ubiquinone redox module recently the discovery of no as the product of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase enzyme hao added a new and currently unknown enzyme to the diagram that is responsible of carrying the oxidation of no to no2 caranto and lancaster 2017 in this bundle of enzymes the flow is assumed to be sequential and electroneutral sequential because the electrons flow from hydroxylamine to cytochrome c554 then to cytochrome cm552 and then to reduce ubiquinone to ubiquinol uq uqh2 fig 2 electroneutral because protons released in the reaction are consumed by the reduction of uq uqh2 simon and klotz 2013 in standard conditions hydroxylamine oxidation is endergonic 28 60 kj mol nh2oh and none of these enzymes have been described coupled with energy sources nevertheless four positive charges are generated in this reaction as the cytochromes only accept the four electrons fig 2 because the reaction is confined to the periplasm this increases the membrane potential of the cell but also makes the gibbs energy of the reaction highly dependent on the ph of the environment the gibbs energy calculations for this reaction predict that it would only be feasible at ph 8 fig 3 the reaction of hydroxylamine oxidation is only possible if it couples with the reduction of two mole of ubiquinone using the protons released to the periplasm then the overall reaction becomes exergonic for a larger range of ph ph 5 fig 3 the two moles of ubiquinol produced are the only source of reductive power generated in the catabolic process the ubiquinol produced feeds with electrons the amo enzyme the oxygen reduction and the anabolism of aob fig 1 2 5 third step oxygen reduction to water the reduction of oxygen to water occurs at the end of the electron transport chain the electrons flow from the oxidation of hydroxylamine and enter in the respiratory chain at the potential level of ubiquionone chain et al 2003 simon and klotz 2013 this is the only electron transport in the catabolic process of aob proven to be coupled with proton translocations that lead to atp production chain et al 2003 in fig 2 the complex iii ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase and complex iv cytochrome c oxidase are both coupling sites i e the electron flow is coupled with proton translocations across the membrane the consensus is that four protons are translocated for every two electrons traveling through complex iii and two in complex iv which implies a total of six protons are translocated white 2007 if no energy was dissipated the gibbs energy calculated is enough for the translocation of 8 8 protons if six protons are assumed translocated then the process has an efficiency of 68 56 in energy transfer this is a conservative assumption lower energy dissipation is assumed than by other methods proposed mccarty 2007 2 6 the energetics demand of the aob anabolism formation of biomass requires energy in the literature there are several theoretical and experimental approaches presented for estimating this necessary amount earlier reports showed that the energetic requirement may depend on the carbon source used the type of microbial cell and the conditions of the experiment farmer and jones 1976 stouthamer and bettenhaussen 1977 nevertheless some authors have proposed a fixed energy requirement to simplify the estimation of growth yield for different functional groups for example stouthamer and bettenhaussen 1973 suggested an average maximum value of 25 g dry weight biomass mol atp for the formation of any microbial cell although lower yields were measured when using glucose as carbon source in aerobic conditions farmer and jones 1976 in this case to analyse the complex anabolic process we divide it in several steps reversed electron transport fixation of inorganic carbon and biomass formation from glucose table 1 aob uses inorganic carbon as main carbon source therefore the first step is to fix the co2 in the calvin cycle chain et al 2003 in this process 3 mol of co2 are reduced to 1 mol of phosphoglyceraldehyde pgal consuming 9 mol of atp white 2007 pgal is used as building block to produce the necessary proteins phosphates lipids and amino acids that generate new cells chain et al 2003 the reduction of co2 in the calvin cycle requires 20 electrons per mole of biomass because the electron donor is nad p h this in turn requires the reduction of nad p which further increases the energy demand of autotrophic growth and reduces the growth yield the reduction of nad p is known to be energetically costly as it requires an increase in membrane potential which is thought to promote higher rates of energy dissipation sarewicz and osyczka 2015 and therefore significantly decrease the maximum growth yield liu et al 2007 heijnen and kleerebezem 2010 heijnen and van dijken 1992 five times more energy is needed to transport electrons backwards in the electron transport chain than the energy harvested when the electrons flow goes forward kim and geoffrey michael 2008 the electrons used to reduce nad p in aob metabolism can only come from the oxidation of hydroxylamine fig 1 chain et al 2003 the work of aleem 1966 gives the stoichiometry of cytochrome c oxidised by nadp versus atp consumed as cytochrome c is previously reduced by hydroxylamine and by neglecting the energy difference that could exist between nadh and nadph in physiological conditions spaans et al 2015 we can calculate the amount of energy consumed by reverse electron transport and add it to the overall energy demand see section s1 in supplementary information to simplify the complex formation of new cells we assume the formation of glucose from pgal which releases 2 mol of atp and we estimate the energy demand for the further formation of biomass from glucose using the value proposed by mccarty mccarty 1971 2007 rittmann and mccarty 2001 of 10 5 g dry weight biomass mol atp when glucose is the carbon source enref 8 we consider this value conservative as kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 have shown that it underestimates the energy needed for cell formation 2 7 summary the bioenergetics of aob metabolism the bioenergetics calculations for the overall aob metabolism are presented in table 1 the detailed balance of electrons carbon and nitrogen used to calculate the maximum growth yield is presented in the excel of the supplementary information together with the energy needed for the formation of new biomass some energy is required for maintenance of the actual cells and to compare the experimental yield with the one obtained theoretically this energy requirement also needs to be evaluated this is not trivial as it is not clear if maintenance is a constant because it could decrease in periods of starvation geets et al 2006 the calculation of the energy requirement for maintenance is discussed in section s2 and detailed in the excel of the supplementary information 3 results and discussion 3 1 yield calculation comparison with other methods based on the methods and assumptions described above we have estimated the maximum growth yield yxs max for aob to be 0 16 gbio gn nh3 this value drops to 0 13 gbio gn nh3 when maintenance was considered see section s2 and excel of supplementary information the calculation is conservative as low values of energy dissipation were considered no losses of energy in proton translocations or in the atp formation are assumed and the conservative value of mccarty 2007 together with the energy estimated to fix co2 was used to calculate the energy requirements in the formation of new cells kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 therefore the resulting yield can be considered a maximum thermodynamic threshold for aob in table 2 we compared our results with the maximum growth yield given by the energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 and the teem2 mccarty 2007 see section s2 and excel of supplementary information the calculation approximated by applying the teem2 method directly gives a value of 0 59 gbio gn nh3 far larger than the one calculated here and the one estimated by the energy dissipation method in mccarty 2007 a modification of the method is introduced to correct the growth yield overestimation when an oxygenase reaction is involved in the catabolic process the energy of this reaction is considered fully dissipated so it must be removed from the overall energy of the catabolic process yuan and vanbriesen 2002 if the correction is applied to the aob metabolism the teem2 method returns a value of 0 43 table 2 still far larger than the value calculated by the calculations presented in this manuscript the growth yield obtained with the energy dissipation method heijnen and van dijken 1992 is similar to the one presented in this study however when we directly apply this method we close the energy balance considering the full energy released in the oxidation of nh3 307 35 kj mol nh3 and therefore we implicitly assume that the energy of the monooxygenase reaction is harvested kleerebezem and van loosdrecht 2010 also claim that a teem2 type correction is necessary for the monooxygenase reaction this correction means subtracting the energy of the monooxygenase reaction from the overall δg01 value of catabolism however when the correction is applied the calculated yield reduces to 0 06 gbio gn nh3 a very low value for the aob growth yield if we compare it with the experimental values presented in table 3 see excel of supplementary information for detailed calculations 3 2 yield calculation comparison with experimental values the experimental growth yield values measured for aob encompass the full range between 0 04 and 0 45 gbio gn nh3 table 3 this makes the comparison between experimental and theoretical calculations rather difficult considering that the calculations conducted in this study are conservative with the estimations of the energy losses in the metabolic process the values observed experimentally are expected to be in all cases lower than the calculated ones this is true for the values reported in pure culture however the values reported when measured in experiments with mixed cultures are in average 65 higher than the observed yield predicted through the metabolic analysis nevertheless the results observed by ciudad et al 2006 blackburne et al 2007 jubany et al 2008 and fang et al 2009 agree with the theoretical value estimated in our calculations 3 3 yield calculation no2 as a nonenzymatic product of no oxidation the possibility that no is oxidised abiotically is discussed in caranto and lancaster 2017 in the presence of o2 nonenzymatic no oxidation to no2 occurs and could compete with the activity of the unknown enzyme that carries this last step in aob metabolism caranto and lancaster 2017 show that the gibbs energy of the oxidation of hydroxylamine is higher if no instead no2 is the product we also observe this but as the oxidation of hydroxylamine is not coupled with energy harvesting and its oxidation to no only releases three electrons instead of the four released when it is oxidised to no2 the maximum yield calculated for aob when no is considered the final product drops to 0 10 gbio gn nh3 0 08 gbio gn nh3 including maintenance see excel of supplementary information comparing these values with the experimental ones presented in table 3 they can be considered too low and therefore the abiotic no oxidation not representative 3 4 is the energy of the ammonia oxidation fully wasted the amo reaction has not been shown to be coupled with any known energy harvesting mechanism simon and klotz 2013 and therefore it is considered as a necessary first metabolic step but without energetic benefit chain et al 2003 whittaker et al 2000 vajrala et al 2013 however how the electrons released in the hydroxylamine oxidation are provided to the amo enzyme is also not solved and this electron transport could be associated with some energy harvesting process like proton translocation if no energy harvesting is coupled with amo activity then the ammonia oxidizing bacteria will only harvest the energy of two electrons released from the oxidation of the hydroxylamine the same number of electrons that are entering the electron transport chain for the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob this can sound contradictory as the growth yield of nob is lower than half of the value of the growth yield of aob blackburne et al 2007 jubany et al 2008 the explanation comes from the energy balance of the metabolism of nob the electron transfer for nob is not fully elucidated simon and klotz 2013 however the oxidation of hno2 into hno3 has a reduction potential around of 328 mv which implies that ubiquinone cannot be considered the electron carrier of the reaction uq uqh2 100 mv therefore because electrons cannot enter at the level of the ubiquinone in the electron transport chain the number of translocated protons per mole of nitrate consumed must be lower than six an analysis of the energy balance of nob is presented in the excel of supplementary information assuming the same process for the anabolism of nob as for the aob a maximum growth yield of 0 10 gbio gn no2 is calculated this value perfectly agrees with the values presented by jubany et al 2008 and blackburne et al 2007 the idea that the energy of the amo reaction is lost is also supported because aob fed hydroxylamine have shown a higher yield than aob fed with nh3 vajrala et al 2013 de bruijn et al 1995 this observation agrees with our model if we calculate the growth yield considering hydroxylamine as substrate it reaches a value of 0 31 gbio gn nh2oh 0 27 gbio gn nh2oh including maintenance see excel of supplementary information 3 5 is the low selectivity of amo enzyme of any benefit for aob growth aob are known to co oxidize a broad spectrum of different substrates carbon monoxide methane hydrocarbons aromatic compounds etc sayavedra soto and arp 2011 this secondary activity is considered as a fortuitous degradation and attributed to the low selectivity of the amo it is classified as co metabolism occurring concomitantly with nh3 oxidation and it is considered a futile microbial activity that is not yet fully biochemically described or understood wackett 1996 co oxidation of substrates other than nh3 will lead to the futile use of electrons electrons that will then not be available for microbial growth in general aob cannot oxidize the product of these co metabolisms or use them as carbon source therefore the co oxidation of substrates other than nh3 will inevitably reduce the growth yield of aob in some laboratory experiments the ratio of co oxidation of other molecules to ammonia has surprisingly high values hyman et al 1985 hyman and wood 1984 if a ratio of 2 1 nh3 to co metabolite oxidised is considered then the estimated true yield is just of 0 09 gbio gn nh3 see excel of supplementary information the growth yield of aob with intense co metabolic activity has not been extensively documented taher and chandran 2013 reported a biomass production unaffected by high co metabolic activity and other authors claim to observe aob cultures maintained only by degrading co substrates forrez et al 2009 de gusseme et al 2009 clearly if we assume that the current biochemical model for aob metabolism is correct this cannot be possible concomitant consumption of nh3 is needed to observe co metabolic activity the energy released in the amo reaction allows for the maximum translocation of 10 protons if for example only the translocation of 2 protons are considered coupled to the amo reaction which implies an 80 42 of energy dissipation the maximum possible growth yield calculated would increase to 0 21 gbio gn nh3 0 18 gbio gn nh3 including maintenance see excel of supplementary information this could be a plausible value if we consider the range presented in table 3 however to date we were not able to find any strong reason that supports energy harvesting in the amo enzyme activity this implies that aob do not benefit from co metabolism and indeed this can only be detrimental for its growth 3 6 is the presence of heterotrophic bacteria beneficial to aob growth heterotrophs and aob are competitors for ammonia and especially oxygen nevertheless in conditions of low organic matter concentrations commensalism between aob and heterotrophs has been proven with aob releasing organic compounds which are substrates for heterotrophs rittmann et al 1994 dolinšek et al 2013 moreover heterotrophs can degrade the products of the co oxidation reactions catalysed by the amo enzyme this reduces the product inhibition observed in aob and favours the complete degradation of complex molecules khunjar et al 2011 taher and chandran 2013 at the same time heterotrophs are known to degrade organic matter to easily degradable substrates like pyruvate lactate acetate known carbon sources for aob in specific conditions chain et al 2003 schmidt 2009 the use of an organic carbon for growth not only reduces the energetic cost of new biomass formation but also the electrons needed for the process all together increasing aob capacity to survive in unfavourable conditions it has been observed that the growth yield of aob increases 130 when using organic substrates prosser 2005 in our study if pyruvate is assumed to be the only carbon source for aob a maximum yield of 0 61 gbio gn nh3 0 35 gbio gn nh3 including maintenance see excel of supplementary information is obtained however aob heterotrophic activity does not occur easily for unidentified reasons the growth of aob on organic sources is inhibited at higher concentrations of potential carbon sources prosser 2005 or by co2 presence schmidt 2009 the metabolism of aob could be more nuanced than previously thought it is possible that ammonia oxidizers harvest small amounts of energy from the co metabolism of a variety of substrates or by partial use of organic carbon sources to grow this could explain why observed yields of aob are often higher than conventional theory would predict especially when aob grows in mixed microbial communities there may exist a mutual benefit between aob and heterotrophs sedlacek et al 2016 but it might be difficult to observe because it may rely on secondary substrates for both bacterial populations however in unfavourable conditions this commensalism could be a source of small quantities of energy harvested per mole of electron donor or carbon source and co metabolism in aob could not have a direct energy benefit but could help promote the presence of heterotrophs around aob colonies 4 conclusions an in depth analysis of the bioenergetics of the catabolism of aob could not find strong reasons to conclude a direct benefit from ammonia oxidation other than the production of hydroxylamine as a source of electrons for the reductive catabolic and anabolic processes needed for aob survival this implies that co metabolic activity would be always detrimental for aob as it is a futile loss of highly necessary electrons nevertheless even assuming a high co metabolic activity of 2 1 nh3 co metabolite the growth yield calculated would allow aob to survive 0 08 gbio gn nh3 when comparing our predicted growth yield with the one obtained by generic methods for the calculation of microbial growth yields the latter were found wanting the application of the teem2 method resulted in higher growth yields than observed and the dissipation method gives a value smaller than most of the experimental values table 3 a maximum true yield yxs max of 0 16 gbio gn nh3 0 13 gbio gn nh3 when maintenance was considered is predicted in our analysis these values are in concordance with the experimental ones observed by blackburne et al 2007 jubany et al 2008 and others although in the literature there is a large range of experimental values and the average of these are above the one theoretically presented in this study the higher yields observed versus the ones theoretically predicted could only be explained with non considered energy sources in the biochemistry of the aob possibilities for aob to harvest more energy per mole of nh3 oxidised could be by either the aforementioned hypothetical energy coupling in the amo enzyme reaction or the feasible consumption of organic carbon sources that might occur in specific conditions both could be the explanation of a more robust growth of aob within mixed cultures with heterotrophic activity conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments the authors want to thank prof ian head

18983,in reverse osmosis ro system for wastewater reclamation biofouling is an inevitable issue chlorine disinfection is commonly used in pretreatment to control biofouling some chlorine resistant bacteria could survive after chlorine disinfection and the microbial community structure in feed water changes significantly thus leading to the change of biofouling potential in this study the effect of chlorine disinfection on the biofouling of ro membrane was investigated using a laboratory cross flow ro system chlorine disinfection inactivated most bacteria in feed water however during the operation of ro system with the increase of chlorine dosage the flux decline became more severe after a period of operation the final normalized flux after 21 days was 0 27 0 26 0 20 and 0 21 with 0 1 5 and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine as pretreatment respectively after the operation the numbers of active bacteria in the foulants on the fouled membrane were on the same level regardless of the chlorine dosage whereas the thickness of the foulants increased with the chlorine dosage significantly additionally the higher total organic carbon concentration indicated more extracellular polymeric substances eps in foulants microbial community structure analysis showed that the abundance and the species number of chlorine resistant bacteria increased significantly with the chlorine dosage typical chlorine resistant bacteria including methylobacterium pseudomonas sphingomonas and acinetobacter were identified as significantly distinctive genera in the foulants after the pretreatment by 15 mg cl2 l chlorine compared with the bacteria without chlorine disinfection these remaining bacteria produced more eps with higher molecular weight which could be the major contribution to more severe ro membrane fouling after chlorine disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis biofouling potential membrane fouling chlorine disinfection reclaimed water microbial community structure 1 introduction municipal wastewater reclamation is one of the most reliable approaches to solve the problem of water scarcity especially in water shortage countries such as china in these areas reclaimed water gradually became the secondary water source of the cities and the primary water source of industry to satisfy the growing demands of industrial reuse and potable reuse reverse osmosis ro process has been applied extensively in municipal wastewater reclamation due to the high quality of the permeate ease of automatic operation and so on shannon et al 2008 wang et al 2015 werber et al 2016 however ro membrane fouling would deteriorate the permeate and increase the operational cost of ro process jiang et al 2017 kang and cao 2012 shenvi et al 2015 among the complex and various kinds of ro membrane fouling biofouling is the limitation during operation which needs to be prevented and controlled flemming et al 1997 khedr 2000 basically the development process of biofouling includes a series of events cell attachment cell growth and the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps matin et al 2011 epss surrounding bacterial cells were the main structural components of the foulant and played a key role in biofouling herzberg and elimelech 2007 eps could cause the increase of hydraulic resistance and thus the decline of permeate flux herzberg et al 2009 furthermore recent research indicated that eps secreted by different bacteria showed different characteristics and thus different levels of biofouling potential yu et al 2018 to prevent and control ro membrane fouling many approaches were used including membrane modification applying chemicals a and pretreatment many researches have been focused on ro membrane modification to enhance the resistance to fouling werber et al 2016 yang et al 2014 at this stage most of these efforts are still limited to laboratory scale and the performance in wastewater reclamation needs to be further investigated non oxidizing biocides such as methylisothiazolinone mit were widely used to prevent the bacterial growth on the ro membrane surface but it increased the operational cost and might bring extra chemical pollutants and environmental ecological and toxicological problems nguyen et al 2012 once biofouling occurred on the ro membrane surface it was extremely difficult to be wiped out by chemical cleaning yu et al 2017 in the pretreatment it was thought that once the amount of microbes in the feed water was controlled biofouling could be prevented as one of the most widely used disinfectants chlorine was used to inactivate bacteria in the feed water economically and efficiently zhang et al 2015 in china the residual chlorine concentration in the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plant must meet the national standards gb t 18920 2002 wang et al 2019 however although the concentration of bacteria in the feed water did decrease significantly after chlorine disinfection it was difficult to inactivate all the bacteria completely and control their regrowth besides in the industrial ro process in order to protect ro membranes from oxidation dechlorination was usually conducted before ro unit thus these surviving bacteria could accumulate and regrow on the ro membrane and the biofouling control effect of chlorine disinfection would deteriorate actually chlorine disinfection could not always prevent the biofouling of ro system in some projects of seawater desalination khan et al 2015 obaid and ben hamida 1998 the phenomenon of chlorine adaptation of bacterial population in the ro system for seawater desalination has been reported by khan et al 2015 it still needs systematic investigation whether chlorine disinfection in the pretreatment could relieve the biofouling in wastewater reclamation or not in the previous studies some researchers found that chlorine disinfection changed significantly the microbial community structure in domestic secondary effluent bridier et al 2011 pang et al 2016 shi et al 2013 as highlighted in the research of yu et al 2018 the fouling potential of eps secreted by different bacterial strains varied widely therefore it could be expected that chlorine disinfection would change the microbial community structure in the feed water of ro system and thus the development process of biofouling the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of chlorine disinfection on the fouling of ro membrane used for municipal wastewater reclamation the change of permeate flux and quality with and without chlorine disinfection during the whole operation process were recorded and compared after that the foulants on the ro membrane were analyzed systematically using heterotrophic plate counts hpc method laser scanning confocal microscope lscm field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem microbial community analysis etc furthermore the properties of the eps secreted by the bacteria which survived after chlorine disinfection were also investigated based on these results the mechanism of chlorine disinfection affecting the biofouling of ro system was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water and chlorine disinfection membrane bioreactor mbr effluent was taken from a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in beijing china and set as the feed water of the ro system the vessels of the water samples were sterilized using a high pressure steam sterilization pot before sampling the water samples were sealed and stored at 4 c the basic water qualities were measured and shown in table s1 mbr effluent water samples were conducted in four sterile and lightproof 5 l beakers 5 0 l water sample for each beakers naclo solution 2 30 g l was added into the four samples with four different volumes to simulate four different chlorine dosages 0 1 5 and 15 mg cl2 l after 30 min the same volume of na2s2o3 solution 2 was added into the beakers to stop the reaction extra naclo solution 2 30 g cl2 l and na2s2o3 solution 2 were mixed with equal volume and then added into the beakers with 0 1 and 5 mg cl2 l chlorine with certain volumes to achieve the same ionic strength as that in the beakers with 15 mg cl2 l chlorine during disinfection the residual chlorine after 5 min and 30 min were detected using an hi96734 pocket colorimeter hanna italy after disinfection the residual bacteria were counted using the hpc method yu et al 2018 2 2 reverse osmosis system a cross flow ro system consisted of four flat ro membrane cells were used to simulate the ro membrane

and collected by a computer the temperature would fluctuate around room temperature 25 2 c and the data of temperature were monitored by a sensor and collected by a computer the permeate flux j was corrected by the temperature data based on the arrhenius equation and calculated by following eq 1 1 j δ m ρ a δ t 1 024 25 t where j is permeate flux m3 m2 s at time t δm is the mass difference of the mass of ro permeate at 30 min before and after that time point kg ρ is the density of feed water 103 kg m3 a is the area of the ro membrane coupon 8 04 10 4 m2 δt is the time difference which is 3600 s 60 min here t is the temperature at that time point c after correction the flux was normalized based on the initial flux j 0 in the first 30 min of operation the normalized flux was written as j j 0 the normalized flux decline curves were fitted using the intermediate blocking model ochando pulido and martinez ferez 2017 the model was shown as the following equation eq 2 2 j j 0 j pss exp k

unit of total volume permeated through the membrane which could represent the fouling potential of the water sample m 1 the feed tanks were covered tightly and allowed the air to flow in through a 0 45 μm filter to avoid other bacteria entering the system the flow rate of the feed water was 1 0 ml min after about 3 day running the 5 0 l water sample after disinfection should have been used up therefore chlorine disinfection was conducted every 3 days and then the water samples were used as the feed water of the ro system to guarantee the 21 day continuous running 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1

shimadzu japan the conductivity and temperature during the operation were measured with an s230 seven compact conductivity detector mettler toledo switzerland 2 3 2 membrane foulants analysis at the end of the operation of the ro system the fouled membrane coupons were taken out from the ro cell for further analysis the bacteria number in the foulants was characterized by hpc yu et al 2018 a piece of 20 mm2 fouled membrane was cut and the precise area was measured the bacteria on the coupon was suspended by 0 5 ml normal saline and then cultured in r2a agar plates at 25 c for 5 days the organic matters in the foulant were characterized by doc concentration tang et al 2016 a piece of 40 mm2 fouled membrane was cut and the precise area was measured the coupon was placed in 5 ml naoh solution ph 12 and shaken by shaking table at 100 rpm for 2 h after that the ph of the solution was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 and the volume of the solution was fixed to 15 ml with water then the solution was immediately filtered using 0 45 μm nylon membrane whatman england the doc of the solution was measured with the toc 5000a analyzer and the doc density of the membrane was converted the foulant

sem fei usa a piece of 20 mm2 of fouled membrane coupons was used for the analysis the accelerating voltage was as low as 5 kv to protect the foulant as well as the membrane materials for microbial community analysis a piece of 100 mm2 of fouled membrane coupons was cut and separated in triplicate to prepare parallel samples the microbial community analysis was conducted as described in the literature yu et al 2017 the analysis methods followed a series of steps including dna extraction pcr amplification of v4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna genes sequencing on illumina miseq platform pe300 illumina usa clustering sequences into operational taxonomic units otus otus classification and the alpha and beta diversity analyzing all analyzed sequences were submitted to the ncbi sra database under accession number prjna505949 2 3 3 bacteria cultivation and eps characterization the bacteria in the feed water were also inoculated in r2a broth medium thayanukul et al 2013 and glucose medium glucose 1 0 g l nh4no3 0 5 g l kh2po4 0 5 g l na2hpo4 1 5 g l nacl 1 0 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g l yeast powder 0 25 g l at 25 c and 150 rpm bacteria were centrifugally separated from the medium at the stationary growth phase yu et al 2018 after that the eps was extracted using the methods described in the previous literature zhang et al 2016 the eps extraction methods followed 3 steps including water bath at 45 c for 1 h centrifugal separation at 12000 rpm for 20 min and filtration using a 0 2 μm membrane whatman england the quantity of eps was characterized by doc concentration the apparent molecular weight mw distribution of eps was determined as described in the previous literature wang et al 2017 the mw distribution was analyzed using a high performance size exclusion chromatograph hpsec lc20 ad shimadzu coupled with a photodiode array pda detector spd shimadzu the separation columns were the tandem of g3000pwxl and g2500pwxl tskgel columns and operated at 40 c the mobile phase consists of 25 mm na2so4 2 4 mm kh2po4 and 3 6 mm k2hpo4 and applied at 0 8 ml min the injected sample volume was 100 μl 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational performance of the ro systems using different concentrations of chlorine as disinfection pretreatment different concentrations of chlorine were added into the water samples for disinfection during disinfection the residual chlorine after 5 min and 30 min and the residual bacteria numbers were shown in table 1 the results showed that the higher concentration of chlorine was added the fewer active bacteria remained in the samples however even after disinfection by 15 mg cl2 l chlorine in 30 min some bacteria still survived and the remaining bacteria concentration was 17 cfu ml after dechlorination water samples were used as the feed water of the ro system the normalized flux decline curves of samples with different concentrations of chlorine as pretreatment were analyzed and shown in fig 2 a after 21 days operation the permeate volume of each ro cell was about 10 l the final normalized flux was 0 27 0 26 0 20 and 0 21 with the chlorine dosage of 0 1 5 15 mg cl2 l respectively chlorine disinfection could inactivate the bacteria in mbr effluent effectively however during the operation of the ro system with the increase of chlorine dosage the flux decline became more severe after a period of operation as shown in fig s1 in the first 10 days no significant difference was found in the four groups with different chlorine dosages in the first few days biofilm had not been developed and organic fouling were the main reason of flux declines chlorine did not change the fouling potential of the organic matter in feed water without bacterial action thus the differences of flux declines in this study might be caused mainly by the regrowth of different bacteria on the ro membranes the flux decline curves with different chlorine concentrations were fitted using eq 2 and shown in fig 2 b c d and e these results showed that the flux change during the operation could be described properly by the intermediate blocking model as indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 over 0 92 in each sample the model parameters in each sample were summarized in table 2 according to the results of model fitting using eq 2 the final normalized flux j pss of each sample was closed to zero suggesting that the membrane fouling would develop extremely severe table 2 the fouling potential parameter k of water samples after disinfection with 0 1 5 and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine were 0 123 0 003 0 139 0 004 0 153 0 007 and 0 152 0 006 m 1 respectively table 2 these results indicated that with the increase of chlorine concentration the ro membrane fouling potential of the water samples increased significantly the water quality of feed water permeate and concentrate were monitored during the 21 days operation fig s2 the doc concentration and conductivity of permeate feed water and concentrate in each sample were similar and changed similarly the doc and conductivity of feed water were stable at 3 1 0 2 mg l and 1046 79 μs cm suggesting the change of flux was mainly due to membrane fouling the doc and conductivity of permeate water remained at 0 2 0 4 mg l and 30 to 50 μs cm after 21 days indicating the intactness of the ro membranes 3 2 characterization of the foulants on the ro membranes the numbers of bacteria on the fouled membranes were shown in fig 3 a except for the sample with chlorine concentration of 1 mg l the numbers of bacteria on the membranes with different chlorine concentrations were in the range from 107 to 108 cfu cm2 however with the increase of chlorine dosage the doc concentration of the foulant increased obviously fig 3 b the doc concentration of the samples with chlorine concentration of 5 and 15 mg l was significantly higher than that of the sample without chlorine disinfection p 0 05 independent samples t test since the doc concentrations in the feed water of four different ro cells were almost the same these results indicated that more eps was produced in the samples with higher chlorine dosage the foulants on the ro membranes were stained and analyzed by lscm as shown in fig 3 c d e and f the average thickness of the foulants were 0 13 0 05 0 14 0 03 0 30 0 08 and 0 53 0 13 μm in the samples with 0 mg cl2 l 1 mg cl2 l 5 mg cl2 l and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine dosages respectively the thickness values were the average of 5 10 different spots on the membrane after disinfection with higher chlorine dosage the remaining bacteria attached and regrew on the ro membrane and developed thicker biofilm this phenomenon was in accordance with the decline of normalized flux and indicated that thicker foulants provided higher filtration resistance as shown in fig 2 the final normalized flux of groups with 5 and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine were almost the same however the average foulant thickness in the sample of 15 mg cl2 l was higher than that of 5 mg cl2 l these results indicated that the increase of the foulant thickness was not simply equal to the increase of filtration resistance when the thickness of the foulants was quite low with the increase of the thickness the filtration resistance increased significantly however when the thickness increased to some extent the filtration resistance would not increase too obviously facades of foulants on the membrane were photographed by lscm and digital camera and shown in fig s3 the distribution of total and dead cell the protein and the polysaccharide were different in each sample the color and surface morphology were also different obviously this phenomenon indicated that the biofilm component on the membrane might be different for further analysis sem images were obtained and shown in fig 4 according to sem images bacteria were clear visible in the foulants on the membrane these images were quite similar to the those with severe biofouling in previous literature jiang et al 2017 different bacteria species and eps morphology were found in different samples eps formed the net structure and supported the bacteria to develop the biofilm the net structure of eps in the sample with 15 mg cl2 l chlorine was more complete than the others the bacteria in the sample with 15 mg cl2 l chlorine was covered with deeper eps than those in the sample without chlorine the eps in the sample with 5 mg cl2 l chlorine was the ropiest it formed filamentous structure to wrap the bacteria more eps were secreted and bonded more closely with the bacteria in the samples with higher chlorine dosage 3 3 microbial communities structure of the microbial foulants on ro membranes the microbial communities in the foulants on the membranes were analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing and the results are shown in fig 5 regarding the microbial communities on the phylum level fig 5 a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were two predominant phylum in all samples the chloroflexi and cyanobacteria were detected in samples without chlorine dosage accounting for 5 8 6 2 and 1 2 1 6 respectively in the samples with chlorine dosages chloroflexi and cyanobacteria were not detected at the class level fig 5 b betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and sphingobacteriia were always dominant in all samples the relative abundances of alphaproteobacteria became higher along with the increase of chlorine dosage notably in the samples with chlorine dosages the relative abundance of flavobateria accounting for 20 6 29 3 was significantly higher than the samples without chlorine dosage only 4 4 4 6 at the family level fig 5 c chitinophagaceae and hydrogenophilaceae were dominant in the sample without chlorine dosage accounting for 16 3 17 8 and 19 5 21 4 flavobacteriaceae were the dominant class in the all samples with chlorine dosages halothiobacillaceae were the dominant class in the sample with 1 mg cl2 l chlorine dosage accounting for 21 0 22 4 however in the sample with 5 mg cl2 l and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine dosages the relative abundances of halothiobacillaceae became lower accounting for 10 1 10 6 and approximately 0 respectively the relative abundances of hydrogenophilaceae was the highest in samples with 5 mg cl2 l chlorine dosage accounting for 25 8 27 1 while the relative abundances of comamonadaceae was the highest in samples with 15 mg cl2 l chlorine dosage accounting for 25 9 31 7 these results indicated that the addition of chlorine significantly changed the microbial community structure of the foulants on the ro membranes the significant differences at the genus level among the samples were shown by heat maps in fig 6 a the triplicate samples were closely parallel significant differences were highlighted in different samples three clusters in the spatial distribution of the microbial community were identified by principal co ordinates analysis pcoa analysis fig 6 b the pc1 dimension could explain 63 04 information of the differences compared with samples without chlorine dosage pc1 scores of samples with chlorine dosage were all more positive which means they were more similar the samples with higher chlorine concentration 5 and 15 mg cl2 l were significant closer and far away from the samples with lower concentration of chlorine dosage 1 mg cl2 l or without chlorine dosage the information of significantly distinctive genera in each sample was fetched from the heat maps fig 6 a and shown in table 3 the significantly distinctive genera in each sample meant that the relative abundance of this genera in this sample was much higher than that in the other samples the chlorine resistant bacteria in the significantly distinctive genera in each sample were identified according to the literatures chu et al 2003 hiraishi et al 1995 lin et al 2014 simoes and simoes 2013 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 no significantly distinctive chlorine resistant bacteria were found in the sample without chlorine dosage and with 1 mg cl2 l chlorine dosage however one and four kinds of significantly distinctive chlorine resistant bacteria were found in the samples with 5 and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine which included methylobacterium pseudomonas sphingomonas and acinetobacter these results indicated the significant selection effect of chlorine on the chlorine resistant bacteria the alpha diversity was analyzed and shown in table 4 otu number and chao1 index reflected the species richness the shannon and simpson index reflected not only species richness but also evenness it was found that the aligned reads of samples without chlorine dosage were the least but the indexes of species richness and evenness were the largest the biodiversity of microbial community on the membrane without chlorine dosage was the richest the biodiversity of microbial communities on the membranes became poorer along with the increase of chlorine dosage the phenomenon above implied that the addition of chlorine significantly changed the development process of biofouling on ro membranes after the addition of chlorine fewer species of bacteria including chlorine resistant bacteria survived in the feed water of ro system some of the remaining chlorine resistant bacteria became dominant species attached on the ro membrane and developed biofilm the chlorine resistance of bacteria was closely related to the secretion of eps which could react with chlorine and protect bacterial cells from oxidative damage caused by chlorine lechevallier et al 1988 according to the results of foulant analysis fig 3 these remaining chlorine resistant bacteria might secrete more eps to form thicker foulants on the ro membrane thus causing more severe biofouling and flux decline 3 4 properties of the eps secreted by the bacteria survived after chlorine disinfection in order to further verify the explanation mentioned above and to investigate the properties of eps secreted by the bacteria survived after chlorine disinfection the bacteria in mbr effluent with and without chlorine disinfection were cultivated in different medium and their eps were extracted and analyzed in the r2a and glucose medium similar results were obtained as shown in fig 7 a and b under the same cultivation conditions the remaining bacteria after chlorine disinfection secreted more eps in the term of doc than those without chlorine disinfection p 0 05 independent samples t test furthermore according to apparent molecular weight mw distribution analysis more proportion of matter with high molecular weight was found in the eps of remaining bacteria after disinfection with higher chlorine dosage fig 7 c and d previous studies ang et al 2011 yu et al 2018 reported that the higher concentration and molecular weight of eps would cause more severe flux decline of ro membrane the cultivation of bacteria in the feed water simulated the long term growth of bacteria on the membrane the characteristics of the eps revealed that the bacteria in the feed water with chlorine disinfection might increase the membrane fouling potential in the long term operation based on these results above the mechanism of chlorine disinfection aggravating the biofouling of ro system could be concluded chlorine disinfection could inactivate most bacteria in the feed water of ro system and thus in the short term operation it might relieve the biofouling of ro system however most chlorine resistant bacteria which could secrete more eps to protect themselves from chlorine survived after chlorine disinfection regrew and developed biofilm and became the dominant species on the ro membrane therefore in the long term operation of the ro system chlorine disinfection would lead to the increase of eps secretion from the remaining bacteria and thus more severe biofouling and flux decline thus no excess chlorine dose was suggested to add in the feed water of ro process to prevent the chlorine resistant bacteria became dominant synergic disinfection with different processes such as chlorination uv ozonation were suggested to inactivate more bacteria species and non oxidizing biocides were suggested to control the bacterial regrowth on the ro membrane 4 conclusions chlorine disinfection could significantly inactivate the bacteria in the feed water of ro system however in the operation of the ro system with the increase of chlorine dosage the flux reduction became more severe after a period of operation at the end of operation hpc test showed that the numbers of active bacteria in the foulants with different chlorine dosages were on the same level however the thickness of the foulants increased significantly with the chlorine dosage and higher doc concentration indicated more eps in foulants which could be observed by sem the microbial community structure analysis revealed that the abundance and species number of chlorine resistant bacteria increased significantly with the increase of chlorine dosage these remaining bacteria were found to produce more eps with higher molecular weight compared with the bacteria without chlorine disinfection which could be the main cause of severe ro membrane fouling acknowledgments this study was supported by key program of the national natural science foundation of china no 51738005 and national key r d program of china

18983,in reverse osmosis ro system for wastewater reclamation biofouling is an inevitable issue chlorine disinfection is commonly used in pretreatment to control biofouling some chlorine resistant bacteria could survive after chlorine disinfection and the microbial community structure in feed water changes significantly thus leading to the change of biofouling potential in this study the effect of chlorine disinfection on the biofouling of ro membrane was investigated using a laboratory cross flow ro system chlorine disinfection inactivated most bacteria in feed water however during the operation of ro system with the increase of chlorine dosage the flux decline became more severe after a period of operation the final normalized flux after 21 days was 0 27 0 26 0 20 and 0 21 with 0 1 5 and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine as pretreatment respectively after the operation the numbers of active bacteria in the foulants on the fouled membrane were on the same level regardless of the chlorine dosage whereas the thickness of the foulants increased with the chlorine dosage significantly additionally the higher total organic carbon concentration indicated more extracellular polymeric substances eps in foulants microbial community structure analysis showed that the abundance and the species number of chlorine resistant bacteria increased significantly with the chlorine dosage typical chlorine resistant bacteria including methylobacterium pseudomonas sphingomonas and acinetobacter were identified as significantly distinctive genera in the foulants after the pretreatment by 15 mg cl2 l chlorine compared with the bacteria without chlorine disinfection these remaining bacteria produced more eps with higher molecular weight which could be the major contribution to more severe ro membrane fouling after chlorine disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords reverse osmosis biofouling potential membrane fouling chlorine disinfection reclaimed water microbial community structure 1 introduction municipal wastewater reclamation is one of the most reliable approaches to solve the problem of water scarcity especially in water shortage countries such as china in these areas reclaimed water gradually became the secondary water source of the cities and the primary water source of industry to satisfy the growing demands of industrial reuse and potable reuse reverse osmosis ro process has been applied extensively in municipal wastewater reclamation due to the high quality of the permeate ease of automatic operation and so on shannon et al 2008 wang et al 2015 werber et al 2016 however ro membrane fouling would deteriorate the permeate and increase the operational cost of ro process jiang et al 2017 kang and cao 2012 shenvi et al 2015 among the complex and various kinds of ro membrane fouling biofouling is the limitation during operation which needs to be prevented and controlled flemming et al 1997 khedr 2000 basically the development process of biofouling includes a series of events cell attachment cell growth and the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps matin et al 2011 epss surrounding bacterial cells were the main structural components of the foulant and played a key role in biofouling herzberg and elimelech 2007 eps could cause the increase of hydraulic resistance and thus the decline of permeate flux herzberg et al 2009 furthermore recent research indicated that eps secreted by different bacteria showed different characteristics and thus different levels of biofouling potential yu et al 2018 to prevent and control ro membrane fouling many approaches were used including membrane modification applying chemicals a and pretreatment many researches have been focused on ro membrane modification to enhance the resistance to fouling werber et al 2016 yang et al 2014 at this stage most of these efforts are still limited to laboratory scale and the performance in wastewater reclamation needs to be further investigated non oxidizing biocides such as methylisothiazolinone mit were widely used to prevent the bacterial growth on the ro membrane surface but it increased the operational cost and might bring extra chemical pollutants and environmental ecological and toxicological problems nguyen et al 2012 once biofouling occurred on the ro membrane surface it was extremely difficult to be wiped out by chemical cleaning yu et al 2017 in the pretreatment it was thought that once the amount of microbes in the feed water was controlled biofouling could be prevented as one of the most widely used disinfectants chlorine was used to inactivate bacteria in the feed water economically and efficiently zhang et al 2015 in china the residual chlorine concentration in the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plant must meet the national standards gb t 18920 2002 wang et al 2019 however although the concentration of bacteria in the feed water did decrease significantly after chlorine disinfection it was difficult to inactivate all the bacteria completely and control their regrowth besides in the industrial ro process in order to protect ro membranes from oxidation dechlorination was usually conducted before ro unit thus these surviving bacteria could accumulate and regrow on the ro membrane and the biofouling control effect of chlorine disinfection would deteriorate actually chlorine disinfection could not always prevent the biofouling of ro system in some projects of seawater desalination khan et al 2015 obaid and ben hamida 1998 the phenomenon of chlorine adaptation of bacterial population in the ro system for seawater desalination has been reported by khan et al 2015 it still needs systematic investigation whether chlorine disinfection in the pretreatment could relieve the biofouling in wastewater reclamation or not in the previous studies some researchers found that chlorine disinfection changed significantly the microbial community structure in domestic secondary effluent bridier et al 2011 pang et al 2016 shi et al 2013 as highlighted in the research of yu et al 2018 the fouling potential of eps secreted by different bacterial strains varied widely therefore it could be expected that chlorine disinfection would change the microbial community structure in the feed water of ro system and thus the development process of biofouling the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of chlorine disinfection on the fouling of ro membrane used for municipal wastewater reclamation the change of permeate flux and quality with and without chlorine disinfection during the whole operation process were recorded and compared after that the foulants on the ro membrane were analyzed systematically using heterotrophic plate counts hpc method laser scanning confocal microscope lscm field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem microbial community analysis etc furthermore the properties of the eps secreted by the bacteria which survived after chlorine disinfection were also investigated based on these results the mechanism of chlorine disinfection affecting the biofouling of ro system was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water and chlorine disinfection membrane bioreactor mbr effluent was taken from a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in beijing china and set as the feed water of the ro system the vessels of the water samples were sterilized using a high pressure steam sterilization pot before sampling the water samples were sealed and stored at 4 c the basic water qualities were measured and shown in table s1 mbr effluent water samples were conducted in four sterile and lightproof 5 l beakers 5 0 l water sample for each beakers naclo solution 2 30 g l was added into the four samples with four different volumes to simulate four different chlorine dosages 0 1 5 and 15 mg cl2 l after 30 min the same volume of na2s2o3 solution 2 was added into the beakers to stop the reaction extra naclo solution 2 30 g cl2 l and na2s2o3 solution 2 were mixed with equal volume and then added into the beakers with 0 1 and 5 mg cl2 l chlorine with certain volumes to achieve the same ionic strength as that in the beakers with 15 mg cl2 l chlorine during disinfection the residual chlorine after 5 min and 30 min were detected using an hi96734 pocket colorimeter hanna italy after disinfection the residual bacteria were counted using the hpc method yu et al 2018 2 2 reverse osmosis system a cross flow ro system consisted of four flat ro membrane cells were used to simulate the ro membrane

operational pressure was fixed at 1 2 mpa the permeate water and concentrate water weren t returned back to the feed tank in order to investigate the biofouling potential after chlorine disinfection no biocide was added to control bacterial regrowth the water samples disinfected by 0 1 5 and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine were set as the feed water of four different ro cells fig 1 the operation of the ro system lasted for 21 days and normalized flux data were collected and calculated every 12 h the mass variation data of permeate were monitored every 30 min by an electronic balance ek 4100i and japan and collected by a computer the temperature would fluctuate around room temperature 25 2 c and the data of temperature were monitored by a sensor and collected by a computer the permeate flux j was corrected by the temperature data based on the arrhenius equation and calculated by following eq 1 1 j δ m ρ a δ t 1 024 25 t where j is permeate flux m3 m2 s at time t δm is the mass difference of

3600 s 60 min here t is the temperature at that time point c after correction the flux was normalized based on the initial flux j 0 in the first 30 min of operation the normalized flux was written as j j 0 the normalized flux decline curves were fitted using the intermediate blocking model ochando pulido and martinez ferez 2017 the model was shown as the following equation eq 2 2 j j 0 j pss exp k j pss t j pss exp k j pss t 1 where j j 0 is the normalized flux at time t j pss is the final normalized flux at equilibrium phase where flux would not decline k is the membrane surface blocked per unit of total volume permeated through the membrane which could represent the fouling potential of the water sample m 1 the feed tanks were covered tightly and allowed the air to flow in through a 0 45 μm filter to avoid other bacteria entering the system the flow rate of the feed water was 1 0 ml min after about 3 day running the 5 0 l water sample after disinfection should have been used up therefore chlorine disinfection was conducted every 3 days and then the water samples were used as the feed water of the ro system to guarantee the 21 day continuous running 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1

ncbi sra database under accession number prjna505949 2 3 3 bacteria cultivation and eps characterization the bacteria in the feed water were also inoculated in r2a broth medium thayanukul et al 2013

the medium at the stationary growth phase yu et al 2018 after that the eps was extracted using the methods described in the previous literature zhang et al 2016 the eps extraction methods followed 3 steps including water bath at 45 c for 1 h centrifugal separation at 12000 rpm for 20 min and filtration using a 0 2 μm membrane whatman england the quantity of eps was characterized by doc concentration the apparent molecular weight mw distribution of eps was determined as described in the previous literature wang et al 2017 the mw distribution was analyzed using a high performance size exclusion chromatograph hpsec lc20 ad shimadzu coupled with a photodiode array pda detector spd shimadzu the separation columns were the tandem of g3000pwxl and g2500pwxl tskgel columns and operated at 40 c the mobile phase consists of 25 mm na2so4 2 4 mm kh2po4 and 3 6 mm k2hpo4 and applied at 0 8 ml min the injected sample volume was 100 μl 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational performance of the ro systems using different concentrations of chlorine as disinfection pretreatment different concentrations of chlorine were added into the water samples for disinfection during disinfection the residual chlorine after 5 min and 30 min and the residual bacteria numbers were shown in table 1 the results showed that the higher concentration of chlorine was added the fewer active bacteria remained in the samples however even after disinfection by 15 mg cl2 l chlorine in 30 min some bacteria still survived and the remaining bacteria concentration was 17 cfu ml after dechlorination water samples were used as the feed water of the ro system the normalized flux decline curves of samples with different concentrations of chlorine as pretreatment were analyzed and shown in fig 2 a after 21 days operation the permeate volume of each ro cell was about 10 l the final normalized flux was 0 27 0 26 0 20 and 0 21 with the chlorine dosage of 0 1 5 15 mg cl2 l respectively chlorine disinfection could inactivate the bacteria in mbr effluent effectively however during the operation of the ro system with the increase of chlorine dosage the flux decline became more severe after a period of operation as shown in fig s1 in the first 10 days no significant difference was found in the four groups with different chlorine dosages in the first few days biofilm had not been developed and organic fouling were the main reason of flux declines chlorine did not change the fouling potential of the organic matter in feed water without bacterial action thus the differences of flux declines in this study might be caused mainly by the regrowth of different bacteria on the ro membranes the flux decline curves with different chlorine concentrations were fitted using eq 2 and shown in fig 2 b c d and e these results showed that the flux change during the operation could be described properly by the intermediate blocking model as indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 over 0 92 in each sample the model parameters in each sample were summarized in table 2 according to the results of model fitting using eq 2 the final normalized flux j pss of each sample was closed to zero suggesting that the membrane fouling would develop extremely severe table 2 the fouling potential parameter k of water samples after disinfection with 0 1 5 and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine were 0 123 0 003 0 139 0 004 0 153 0 007 and 0 152 0 006 m 1 respectively table 2 these results indicated that with the increase of chlorine concentration the ro membrane fouling potential of the water samples increased significantly the water quality of feed water permeate and concentrate were monitored during the 21 days operation fig s2 the doc concentration and conductivity of permeate feed water and concentrate in each sample were similar and changed similarly the doc and conductivity of feed water were stable at 3 1 0 2 mg l and 1046 79 μs cm suggesting the change of flux was mainly due to membrane fouling the doc and conductivity of permeate water remained at 0 2 0 4 mg l and 30 to 50 μs cm after 21 days indicating the intactness of the ro membranes 3 2 characterization of the foulants on the ro membranes the numbers of bacteria on the fouled membranes were shown in fig 3 a except for the sample with chlorine concentration of 1 mg l the numbers of bacteria on the membranes with different chlorine concentrations were in the range from 107 to 108 cfu cm2 however with the increase of chlorine dosage the doc concentration of the foulant increased obviously fig 3 b the doc concentration of the samples with chlorine concentration of 5 and 15 mg l was significantly higher than that of the sample without chlorine disinfection p 0 05 independent samples t test since the doc concentrations in the feed water of four different ro cells were almost the same these results indicated that more eps was produced in the samples with higher chlorine dosage the foulants on the ro membranes were stained and analyzed by lscm as shown in fig 3 c d e and f the average thickness of the foulants were 0 13 0 05 0 14 0 03 0 30 0 08 and 0 53 0 13 μm in the samples with 0 mg cl2 l 1 mg cl2 l 5 mg cl2 l and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine dosages respectively the thickness values were the average of 5 10 different spots on the membrane after disinfection with higher chlorine dosage the remaining bacteria attached and regrew on the ro membrane and developed thicker biofilm this phenomenon was in accordance with the decline of normalized flux and indicated that thicker foulants provided higher filtration resistance as shown in fig 2 the final normalized flux of groups with 5 and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine were almost the same however the average foulant thickness in the sample of 15 mg cl2 l was higher than that of 5 mg cl2 l these results indicated that the increase of the foulant thickness was not simply equal to the increase of filtration resistance when the thickness of the foulants was quite low with the increase of the thickness the filtration resistance increased significantly however when the thickness increased to some extent the filtration resistance would not increase too obviously facades of foulants on the membrane were photographed by lscm and digital camera and shown in fig s3 the distribution of total and dead cell the protein and the polysaccharide were different in each sample the color and surface morphology were also different obviously this phenomenon indicated that the biofilm component on the membrane might be different for further analysis sem images were obtained and shown in fig 4 according to sem images bacteria were clear visible in the foulants on the membrane these images were quite similar to the those with severe biofouling in previous literature jiang et al 2017 different bacteria species and eps morphology were found in different samples eps formed the net structure and supported the bacteria to develop the biofilm the net structure of eps in the sample with 15 mg cl2 l chlorine was more complete than the others the bacteria in the sample with 15 mg cl2 l chlorine was covered with deeper eps than those in the sample without chlorine the eps in the sample with 5 mg cl2 l chlorine was the ropiest it formed filamentous structure to wrap the bacteria more eps were secreted and bonded more closely with the bacteria in the samples with higher chlorine dosage 3 3 microbial communities structure of the microbial foulants on ro membranes the microbial communities in the foulants on the membranes were analyzed by 16s rrna gene sequencing and the results are shown in fig 5 regarding the microbial communities on the phylum level fig 5 a proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were two predominant phylum in all samples the chloroflexi and cyanobacteria were detected in samples without chlorine dosage accounting for 5 8 6 2 and 1 2 1 6 respectively in the samples with chlorine dosages chloroflexi and cyanobacteria were not detected at the class level fig 5 b betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and sphingobacteriia were always dominant in all samples the relative abundances of alphaproteobacteria became higher along with the increase of chlorine dosage notably in the samples with chlorine dosages the relative abundance of flavobateria accounting for 20 6 29 3 was significantly higher than the samples without chlorine dosage only 4 4 4 6 at the family level fig 5 c chitinophagaceae and hydrogenophilaceae were dominant in the sample without chlorine dosage accounting for 16 3 17 8 and 19 5 21 4 flavobacteriaceae were the dominant class in the all samples with chlorine dosages halothiobacillaceae were the dominant class in the sample with 1 mg cl2 l chlorine dosage accounting for 21 0 22 4 however in the sample with 5 mg cl2 l and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine dosages the relative abundances of halothiobacillaceae became lower accounting for 10 1 10 6 and approximately 0 respectively the relative abundances of hydrogenophilaceae was the highest in samples with 5 mg cl2 l chlorine dosage accounting for 25 8 27 1 while the relative abundances of comamonadaceae was the highest in samples with 15 mg cl2 l chlorine dosage accounting for 25 9 31 7 these results indicated that the addition of chlorine significantly changed the microbial community structure of the foulants on the ro membranes the significant differences at the genus level among the samples were shown by heat maps in fig 6 a the triplicate samples were closely parallel significant differences were highlighted in different samples three clusters in the spatial distribution of the microbial community were identified by principal co ordinates analysis pcoa analysis fig 6 b the pc1 dimension could explain 63 04 information of the differences compared with samples without chlorine dosage pc1 scores of samples with chlorine dosage were all more positive which means they were more similar the samples with higher chlorine concentration 5 and 15 mg cl2 l were significant closer and far away from the samples with lower concentration of chlorine dosage 1 mg cl2 l or without chlorine dosage the information of significantly distinctive genera in each sample was fetched from the heat maps fig 6 a and shown in table 3 the significantly distinctive genera in each sample meant that the relative abundance of this genera in this sample was much higher than that in the other samples the chlorine resistant bacteria in the significantly distinctive genera in each sample were identified according to the literatures chu et al 2003 hiraishi et al 1995 lin et al 2014 simoes and simoes 2013 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 no significantly distinctive chlorine resistant bacteria were found in the sample without chlorine dosage and with 1 mg cl2 l chlorine dosage however one and four kinds of significantly distinctive chlorine resistant bacteria were found in the samples with 5 and 15 mg cl2 l chlorine which included methylobacterium pseudomonas sphingomonas and acinetobacter these results indicated the significant selection effect of chlorine on the chlorine resistant bacteria the alpha diversity was analyzed and shown in table 4 otu number and chao1 index reflected the species richness the shannon and simpson index reflected not only species richness but also evenness it was found that the aligned reads of samples without chlorine dosage were the least but the indexes of species richness and evenness were the largest the biodiversity of microbial community on the membrane without chlorine dosage was the richest the biodiversity of microbial communities on the membranes became poorer along with the increase of chlorine dosage the phenomenon above implied that the addition of chlorine significantly changed the development process of biofouling on ro membranes after the addition of chlorine fewer species of bacteria including chlorine resistant bacteria survived in the feed water of ro system some of the remaining chlorine resistant bacteria became dominant species attached on the ro membrane and developed biofilm the chlorine resistance of bacteria was closely related to the secretion of eps which could react with chlorine and protect bacterial cells from oxidative damage caused by chlorine lechevallier et al 1988 according to the results of foulant analysis fig 3 these remaining chlorine resistant bacteria might secrete more eps to form thicker foulants on the ro membrane thus causing more severe biofouling and flux decline 3 4 properties of the eps secreted by the bacteria survived after chlorine disinfection in order to further verify the explanation mentioned above and to investigate the properties of eps secreted by the bacteria survived after chlorine disinfection the bacteria in mbr effluent with and without chlorine disinfection were cultivated in different medium and their eps were extracted and analyzed in the r2a and glucose medium similar results were obtained as shown in fig 7 a and b under the same cultivation conditions the remaining bacteria after chlorine disinfection secreted more eps in the term of doc than those without chlorine disinfection p 0 05 independent samples t test furthermore according to apparent molecular weight mw distribution analysis more proportion of matter with high molecular weight was found in the eps of remaining bacteria after disinfection with higher chlorine dosage fig 7 c and d previous studies ang et al 2011 yu et al 2018 reported that the higher concentration and molecular weight of eps would cause more severe flux decline of ro membrane the cultivation of bacteria in the feed water simulated the long term growth of bacteria on the membrane the characteristics of the eps revealed that the bacteria in the feed water with chlorine disinfection might increase the membrane fouling potential in the long term operation based on these results above the mechanism of chlorine disinfection aggravating the biofouling of ro system could be concluded chlorine disinfection could inactivate most bacteria in the feed water of ro system and thus in the short term operation it might relieve the biofouling of ro system however most chlorine resistant bacteria which could secrete more eps to protect themselves from chlorine survived after chlorine disinfection regrew and developed biofilm and became the dominant species on the ro membrane therefore in the long term operation of the ro system chlorine disinfection would lead to the increase of eps secretion from the remaining bacteria and thus more severe biofouling and flux decline thus no excess chlorine dose was suggested to add in the feed water of ro process to prevent the chlorine resistant bacteria became dominant synergic disinfection with different processes such as chlorination uv ozonation were suggested to inactivate more bacteria species and non oxidizing biocides were suggested to control the bacterial regrowth on the ro membrane 4 conclusions chlorine disinfection could significantly inactivate the bacteria in the feed water of ro system however in the operation of the ro system with the increase of chlorine dosage the flux reduction became more severe after a period of operation at the end of operation hpc test showed that the numbers of active bacteria in the foulants with different chlorine dosages were on the same level however the thickness of the foulants increased significantly with the chlorine dosage and higher doc concentration indicated more eps in foulants which could be observed by sem the microbial community structure analysis revealed that the abundance and species number of chlorine resistant bacteria increased significantly with the increase of chlorine dosage these remaining bacteria were found to produce more eps with higher molecular weight compared with the bacteria without chlorine disinfection which could be the main cause

18984,a hydrodynamic separator hs is a common pre treatment unit operation uo for separating coarser particulate matter pm while hs designs have disparate internal geometries surface areas and volumes

after world war ii in the usa with the commensurate increase in impervious urban suburban areas and pavement as well as anthropogenic activity such as motor vehicle transport has significantly increased pm and chemical loads transported in the hydrologic cycle nichols et al 2015 sansalone et al 1998 in the usa the concept of best management practices bmps for urban drainage clarification was introduced in large part through the clean water act cwa 1972 for the goal of clarification and load reduction aside from hydrologic control bmps as a unit operation uo are now used extensively as a structural uo or non structural practice a hydrodynamic separator hs is one class of structural and proprietary uos that has evolved to fit within the geometric confines of urban drainage networks as such hs units are compact passive yet do not provide any flow volume mitigation proprietary hs units are contrasted with common structural non proprietary systems such as detention retention basins wetlands filter strips infiltration swales and combinations thereof tran and kang 2013 all of these uo systems provide varying levels of clarification for pm and any pm associated chemicals lee et al 2010 over 50 000 hs units have been installed in north america lee et al 2014 for the purpose of pre treatment thus in recent decades there has been increasing interest in examining the factors that impact the clarification functionality of hs units for uos designed for clarification separation of pm and debris is the most common assessment metric hs units are comparatively small structural uos that are most effective for temporarily separating coarse pm and debris schmitt et al 2014 all hs units function predominately as small footprint sedimentation units despite internal geometric variations between hs units such as screens or baffles the predominance of sedimentation as compared to other physical mechanisms has also been shown for uo that combine sedimentation and filtration whether depth or surficial in the same unit volume herr and sansalone 2015 liu et al 2010 pm is the primary vehicle for chemical and pathogen transport and separation thereof is the most common index for urban drainage treatment whether the metric is pm concentration historically measured as suspended sediment concentration ssc or total suspended solids tss or more recently as a particle size distribution psd of pm pm imparts oxygen demand generates turbidity thereby impacting photosynthesis while providing significant surface area for partitioning of chemicals to and from the aqueous and pm phases geronimo et al 2014 ma and zhu 2014 thompson et al 2016 sansalone and ying 2008 ying and sansalone 2010 hs units are most commonly located in urban source area watersheds these hs units are subject to highly unsteady and uncontrolled urban drainage transport such as mass or flow limited transport of non stationary pm granulometry and pm concentration which are coupled phenomena sansalone and pathapati 2009 kim and sansalone 2008 for a uo such as a hs loaded by hetero disperse psds generated from unsteady transport previous research has demonstrated a positive relationship between pm concentration as ssc and pm separation because higher concentrations were generated from predominately coarser pm sansalone and kim 2008 examination of pm separation from uncontrolled urban drainage treatment testing is more complex based on variable gravimetric pm concentrations and psds albeit preferably facilitated on a per particle size analysis based on discretizing the psd spelman and sansalone 2018 however variability of pm concentration and psd as well as hydraulic unsteadiness requires a more complex evaluation of a uo or comparison between uos as is carried out in this study for a series of hs units in contrast to the uncontrolled and highly variable loadings for in situ hs units subject to urban drainage conditions controlled testing of hs units is conducted with an invariable psd flowrate and sor notwithstanding the psd is a primary loading and granulometric parameter to test the response of a uo the importance of the psd applies whether examining separation or scour as is the use of a psd metric when comparing uos subject to the same controlled loading conditions a fixed psd pm concentration and sor in a testing protocol classical models such as ideal sor and more recently recent models such as computational fluid dynamics cfd are tools that have been suggested to predict validate or extrapolate the pm separation results of a physical hs model schmitt et al 2014 sansalone et al 2009 ying and sansalone 2011 carbone et al 2014 pathapati and sansalone 2011 2 objectives in order to physically and computationally model the pm separation of hs units subject to controlled testing four objectives were undertaken the first objective was to collect physical test data for two classes of commercial hs units of differing configuration and dimensions as part of the first objective the commonly used ideal sor model was applied as compared to physical and cfd models to evaluate pm separation for each unit with models of plain cylindrical tank units used as controls these steady results were extended to loadings based on a triangular sor loadgraph granulometric parameters in urban drainage loadings in particular the influent psd have a significant influence on pm separation for any uo njdep 2013 ca etv 2013 therefore for the second objective differences in pm separation were modeled as a function of psd deviations coarser or finer d50 with similar hetero dispersivity from a standard hetero disperse psd used in this study as the psd testing metric for the third objective the influence of size dispersivity for the psd psd shape on pm separation was tested using a mono medium and hetero disperse psd with a fixed d50 value the fourth objective compared measured pm separation with a cfd model based on selected discrete particle diameters to determine at which sor each particle diameter was completely separated by the hs unit 3 methodology the physical modeling methods are described herein the computational and analytical modeling methods are described and detailed in the supplemental information si 3 1 description of physical modeling system the physical model testing configuration for hs units is shown in fig 1 a as a plan view schematic of the water supply storage and influent pumping system the main components are two water tanks volume 45 000 l each supplied by a pressured 50 mm municipal potable water supply line and two berkeley centrifugal pumps model b3tpms 3 hp and model b6zpls 10 hp with a variable frequency drive vfd the potable water used during each physical hs test was collected and analyzed to determine eluted pm as ssc using astm d3977 97 astm 1997 the background samples ssc did not exceed 20 mg l mean 3 4 standard deviation 3 2 number of samples n 42 the turbidity of background samples

minute l min per square meter m2 of effective treatment area to quantify pm separation ca etv 2013 the effective area is the uo area over which sedimentation occurs the pumped flow rates associated with each sor were determined based the effective treatment area of the hs system tested a mass balance on pm was conducted for each separation test and included independent measurements of influent effluent separated pm and required a 90 recovery of pm mass the temperature of the influent flow to the hs units for all of the physical test did not exceed 26 c mean 73 f standard deviation 1 0 n 42 3 2 physical modeling methodology the physical monitoring campaign was configured to provide representative comparative data collection of pm separation for bhs units testing on each unit at each sor was initiated with a quiescent clean volume of water one turnover volume in the hs unit at each sor the flow duration and pm loading was a minimum of 25 min or the time required for eight turnover volumes whichever was greater ca etv 2013 a minimum of 12 kg of pm dry mass basis was fed into a hs during each test pm feed was injected into the potable water influent just upstream of the drop box three to five pipe diameters upstream of the hs six duplicates of portable water and six duplicate influent samples were taken at each sor for each sor at least 12 pair of duplicate effluent samples were taken at evenly spaced time increments throughout a run if the run duration exceeded 8 h the run was terminated until the next day when sampling resumed after three volume exchanges of influent at the nominal 200 mg l of pm were pumped through the hs before effluent sampling continued for the run duration samples were replicated and taken at regular intervals sor results were either examined separately or combined into a 1 h triangular sor loadgraph as shown in fig 2 a for stepwise steady modeling with cfd all physical model testing was conducted for a series of steady sor at 200 mg l 25 mg l of siliceous hetero disperse psd with a specific gravity sg of 2 65 the d50 of the psd metric shown in fig 2 b was 75 μm with gamma parameters of k 0 56 and λ 232 64 the sample bottles were 1 l wide mouth of pp polypropylene gravimetric pm analysis as ssc used vacuum filtration with 90 mm glass fiber filters nominal 1 μm and the entire sample volume instead of a sub aliquot of the sample thus providing more representative results and potential for a mass balance on pm because of the gravimetric pm analysis as ssc that required an entire 1 l sample separate paired 1 l samples for psd were taken with each ssc sample the analysis to determine psd consisted of two separate steps for the influent and effluent samples psd analysis was conducted with a malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments 2007 laser diffraction particle size analyzer in addition to aqueous influent and effluent pm samples pm separated by the hs was recovered from each sor run for each hs unit dried and the psd determined for separated pm in accordance with astm d422 astm 1993 pm separation for each sor was determined as summarized in eq 1 in this equation mean cin is the mean inlet concentration eq 2

for the bhs and shs units units of differing sump and internal geometries the rt50 also increased as a function of increasing hs diameter the morrill dispersion index mdi the ratio of τ90 τ10 an index

synthesizes results from nine hs units that range in diameter from 1 2 m 4 ft 1 8 m 6 ft and 2 4 m 8 ft bhs units and 0 9 m 3 ft 1 5 m 5 ft 1 8 m 6 ft and 2 1 m 7 ft shs units and also includes a bhs

the pm separation by these tanks are cfd modeled results the basic geometries are illustrated in fig 1 b through e the shaded area in fig 3 a approximates the envelope of the database trends for all hs units upper and lower bounds of this shaded envelope are logarithmic functions represented in the following equations 7 pm separation 10 4 ln sor 116 9 with r2 0 99 upper bound 8 pm separation 10 8

with a horizontal top and plain open tank both used for comparative control as cylindrical tanks have a statistically significantly α 0 05 lower pm separation as compared to the median results eq 8 from the measured datasets for the bhs and shs units the ideal sor model curve in fig 3 a assumed type i discrete particle settling and is the ideal limiting pm separation condition irrespective of the design and dimensions of the hs units no hs or plain open tank design exceeds the pm separation curve of the ideal sor model hazen s model eq s 15 with n 1 was also applied and plotted in fig 3 a to approximate a lower boundary of the measured datasets for pm separation for a non ideal and fully mixed hs condition to complement fig 3 a and b presents the volume weighted velocity magnitude m s for the different hs unit results in fig 3 a to provide an intuitive connection between velocity magnitude and pm separation 4 2 impact of psd size scaling variability on pm separation results testing protocols to examine pm separation specify a psd metric and will sometimes specify the allowable variability around a selected psd metric njdep 2013 ca etv 2013 in order to explore the impact of psd size variability on pm separation results seven different psds psd metric and six variants were tested for the 1 8 m bhs geometry the physically validated cfd model of the bhs was used to examine the pm separation the six psd variants tested had similar shape factors k for size hetero dispersivity to the psd metric the scaling factor γ as an index of the central tendency for the psd was varied for each psd variant with respect to the psd metric fig 2 b illustrates the psd variants and the hetero disperse psd metric these psd variants were tested with the cfd model at 2 4 and 6 coarser and finer with respect to the psd metric the indices for the psd variants are shown in table 2 table 2 also indicates that the d90 at 6 finer or coarser than the psd metric were relatively higher or lower in magnitude 265 531 μm as compared to the size variation of the d50 and d10 indices fig 4 summarizes the pm separation results based on cfd modeling of the psd variants summarized in table 2 and fig 2 b for the 1 8 m bhs to compares pm separation results for the psd variants fig 4 plots the cfd model results of the variants with respect to the psd metric results along with the measured results in a broad sor range 40 1400 l min m2 the null hypothesis is that the pm separation result of a psd variant as compared to the psd metric was not statistically different the pm separation from the validated cfd model for each different sor were weighted equally based on the same pm injection mass the chi squared test indicates that only the 2 variants with respect to the pm separation of the psd metric yielded no statistically difference p value less than α 0 05 the pm separation results for 4 and 6 psd variants produced results that were statistically significantly different as compared to the psd metric the measured data for 1 8 m bhs are also plotted in fig 4 there is no statistically significant difference between the cfd modeled and measured data p value less than α 0 05 based on testing with the psd metric within the range of hs units tested typical of source area hetero disperse psd loadings of hs units results indicate that a 2 variance is the proper psd variance range for controlled testing and comparison of pm separation by hs units 4 3 impact of psd shape hetero dispersivity variability on pm separation results the pm separation impact of psd hetero dispersivity shape with a constant scaling factor indexed as a d50 of 75 μm for two psd variants with respect to the hetero disperse psd metric were also generated with a physically validated cfd model of the 1 8 m bhs the supplemental information summarizes the two psd variants as compared to the hetero disperse psd metric k 0 56 λ 232 64 one psd variant was mono disperse k 505 25 λ 0 13 and the other psd was medium disperse k 2 32 λ 36 27 dickenson and sansalone 2009 fig 5 represents a comparison between the cfd model and the ideal sor model results for pm separation as a function of sor for the mono medium and hetero disperse psds from fig 5 a the cfd model reproduced the measured pm separation results rpd 4 3 for the hetero disperse psd loading of the 1 8 m bhs across the sor range from 0 to 1400 l min m2 the ideal sor model increasingly over predicted pm separation results as compared to the validated cfd model this over prediction by the sor model as compared to the cfd model increased 8 1 15 4 and 12 0 as the psd was altered from hetero to medium to mono disperse the increasing over prediction as the psd became more mono disperse occurs in part because the ideal sor model neglects hydrodynamics and internal geometry of the hs unit results indicate that the current hetero disperse psd used for regulatory testing allowing a 2 variance for finer or coarser based on results in figs 2 b and 5 represents a robust metric for hs units 4 4 effluent psd indices as a function of sor table 3 summarizes the trend in measured effluent psd indices and pm for the 1 8 m bhs the hetero disperse influent psd metric and pm concentration remained constant during the testing at each sor the cfd modeled effluent emcs event mean concentration for pm reproduced the trend of measured emcs within 10 at each sor noting that as sor increased the eluted pm as ssc towards the influent pm of 200 mg l size indices of d90 d50 d10 and gamma distribution scaling parameter indicated that the eluted psd became increasing coarser with increasing sor see table 4 in addition to emc results for pm fig 6 compares the measured and cfd modeled pm separation results for specific particle diameters within the silt settleable and fine sand size sediment range of the psd for five specific diameters 25 53 75 100 and 150 μm these results were developed across the tested sor range the modeled results reasonably reproduce the measured results from the physical model testing noting that in cfd a discrete particle diameter was modeled while the measured data was based on interpolating the discretized effluent psd data for the specific particle diameter examined while particle separation by sedimentation is clearly a function of particle diameter results in fig 6 indicate that the pm separation behavior for the baffled hs unit reached a common inflection point at approximately 450 l min m2 for each particle diameter for lower sor values up to 450 l min m2 the pm separation decreased more rapidly while for this unit above 450 l min m2 the decrease was more gradual and less sensitive to increasing sor as the eluted psd became coarser and ssc higher for all selected particle diameters the pm separation was decreased significantly as the sor increased the sor at which 100 pm separation occurred for the pm diameters shown in table 5 indicates that measured results were marginally lower than cfd model result within approximately 10 l min m2 4 5 pm separation with a 1 h triangular sor loadgraph as summarized in table 5 the pm separation results for the different hs designs of this study based on the cfd model of the 1 h triangular loadgraph shown in fig 2 are within a narrow range from 33 9 to 46 0 and these results are higher than the cylindrical tank designs of 30 9 33 5 the cfd model results provide the pm separation result at 40 80 200 400 600 1000 and 1400 l min m2 trend line function as eqs 7 9 was generated for each hs unit and calculated the pm separation result at 100 300 500 700 900 1100 and 1300 l min m2 the result shown in table 5 were calculated by multiplying the pm separation result at each sor and the area percentage of corresponding rectangle the hs designs provided a mean improvement of approximately 8 for pm separation as compared to a blank cylindrical tank the ideal sor result for pm separation during the 1 h sor loadgraph was 46 8 which was significantly greater than the pm separation results from the validated cfd model for all hs unit designs the effluent emcs for the nine hs design shown in table 5 was 122 8 mg l sd 7 0 rpd for minimum and maximum value are 12 1 and 7 7 and the d50 average was 28 6 μm sd 4 3 rpd for minimum and maximum value are 22 5 and 25 4 table 5 indicated that hs units with larger surface area provided an increase in pm separation of 3 between 1 2 m bhs and 2 4 m bhs such improved pm separation comes at an increase in structural unit costs and construction costs the constrained range of pm separation for all units subject to controlled testing suggests that uncontrolled and relatively poorly maintained in situ field conditions yield pm separation between hs units that may not be physically or potentially statistically different 5 conclusions hs designs have variable internal geometries surface areas and volumes this study examines a range of full scale physical validated cfd models and a sor model to evaluate hs functionality under steady loadings that are extended to an unsteady loadgraph the conclusions are as follows within the range of geometric factors tested for a given pm granulometry and sor pm separation for nine hs units declined with increasing sor logarithmically in a constrained range 10 clearly below the ideal sor and above the completely mixed tank n 1 limit the ideal sor model results were statistically significantly higher than results of the validated cfd model for all hs units for all hs units this constrained range in pm separation was relatively small when these results were compared to the higher ideal sor model predictions crucial for testing certification a validated cfd model demonstrates that pm separation was statistically different at more than 2 psd variability with respect to the influent psd metric results demonstrate that a validated cfd model reproduces pm separation results whether on a gravimetric basis for a given psd or on a particle diameter basis of a psd which allows portability of results for different psds ranges of sors or unsteady sor loadgraphs in contrast to the cfd model the sor model increasing over predicted pm separation as the psd shape dispersivity varied from hetero to mono disperse for hs units the sor model provides a hypothetical upper bound of ideal pm separation with the sor model error increasing as the psd becomes more mono disperse for a wide range of hs units a physically validated cfd model provides a valuable albeit under utilized tool to prototype test compare

after world war ii in the usa with the commensurate increase in impervious urban suburban areas and pavement as well as anthropogenic activity such as motor vehicle transport has significantly increased pm and chemical loads transported in the hydrologic cycle nichols et al 2015 sansalone et al 1998 in the usa the concept of best management practices bmps for urban drainage clarification was introduced in large part through the clean water act cwa 1972 for the goal of clarification and load reduction aside from hydrologic control bmps as a unit operation uo are now used extensively as a structural uo or non structural practice a hydrodynamic separator hs is one class of structural and proprietary uos that has evolved to fit within the geometric confines of urban drainage networks as such hs units are compact passive yet do not provide any flow volume mitigation proprietary hs units are contrasted with common structural non proprietary systems such as detention retention basins wetlands filter strips infiltration swales and combinations thereof tran and kang 2013 all of these uo systems provide varying levels of clarification for pm and any pm associated chemicals lee et al 2010 over 50 000 hs units have been installed in north america lee et al 2014 for the purpose of pre treatment thus in recent decades there has been increasing interest in examining the factors that impact the clarification functionality of hs units for uos designed for clarification separation of pm and debris is the most common assessment metric hs units are comparatively small structural uos that are most effective for temporarily separating coarse pm and debris schmitt et al 2014 all hs units function predominately as small footprint sedimentation units despite internal geometric variations between hs units such as screens or baffles the predominance of sedimentation as compared to other physical mechanisms has also been shown for uo that combine sedimentation and filtration whether depth or surficial in the same unit volume herr and sansalone 2015 liu et al 2010 pm is the primary vehicle for chemical and pathogen transport and separation thereof is the most common index for urban drainage treatment whether the metric is pm concentration historically measured as suspended sediment concentration ssc or total suspended solids tss or more recently as a particle size distribution psd of pm pm imparts oxygen demand generates turbidity thereby impacting photosynthesis while providing significant surface area for partitioning of chemicals to and from the aqueous and pm phases geronimo et al 2014 ma and zhu 2014 thompson et al 2016 sansalone and ying 2008 ying and sansalone 2010 hs units are most commonly located in urban source area watersheds these hs units are subject to highly unsteady and uncontrolled urban drainage transport such as mass or flow limited transport of non stationary pm granulometry and pm concentration which are coupled phenomena sansalone and pathapati 2009 kim and sansalone 2008 for a uo such as a hs loaded by hetero disperse psds generated from unsteady transport previous research has demonstrated a positive relationship between pm concentration as ssc and pm separation because higher concentrations were generated from predominately coarser pm sansalone and kim 2008 examination of pm separation from uncontrolled urban drainage treatment testing is more complex based on variable gravimetric pm concentrations and psds albeit preferably facilitated on a per particle size analysis based on discretizing the psd spelman and sansalone 2018 however variability of pm concentration and psd as well as hydraulic unsteadiness requires a more complex evaluation of a uo or comparison between uos as is carried out in this study for a series of hs units in contrast to the uncontrolled and highly variable loadings for in situ hs units subject to urban drainage conditions controlled testing of hs units is conducted with an invariable psd flowrate and sor notwithstanding the psd is a primary loading and granulometric parameter to test the response of a uo the importance of the psd applies whether examining separation or scour as is the use of a psd metric when comparing uos subject to the same controlled loading conditions a fixed psd pm concentration and sor in a testing protocol classical models such as ideal sor and more recently recent models such as computational fluid dynamics cfd are tools that have been suggested to predict validate or extrapolate the pm separation results of a physical hs model schmitt et al 2014 sansalone et al 2009 ying and sansalone 2011 carbone et al 2014 pathapati and sansalone 2011 2 objectives in order to physically and computationally model the pm separation of hs units subject to controlled testing four objectives were undertaken the first objective was to collect physical test data for two classes of commercial hs units of differing configuration and dimensions as part of the first objective the commonly used ideal sor model was applied as compared to physical and cfd models to evaluate pm separation for each unit with models of plain cylindrical tank units used as controls these steady results were extended to loadings based on a triangular sor loadgraph granulometric parameters in urban drainage loadings in particular the influent psd have a significant influence on pm separation for any uo njdep 2013 ca etv 2013 therefore for the second objective differences in pm separation were modeled as a function of psd deviations coarser or finer d50 with similar hetero dispersivity from a standard hetero disperse psd used in this study as the psd testing metric for the third objective the influence of size dispersivity for the psd psd shape on pm separation was tested using a mono medium and hetero disperse psd with a fixed d50 value the fourth objective compared measured pm separation with a cfd model based on selected discrete particle diameters to determine at which sor each particle diameter was completely separated by the hs unit 3 methodology the physical modeling methods are described herein the computational and analytical modeling methods are described and detailed in the supplemental information si 3 1 description of physical modeling system the physical model testing configuration for hs units is shown in fig 1 a as a plan view schematic of the water supply storage and influent pumping system the main components are two water tanks volume 45 000 l each supplied by a pressured 50 mm municipal potable water supply line and two berkeley centrifugal pumps model b3tpms 3 hp and model b6zpls 10 hp with a variable frequency drive vfd the potable water used during each physical hs test was collected and analyzed to determine eluted pm as ssc using astm d3977 97 astm 1997 the background samples ssc did not exceed 20 mg l mean 3 4 standard deviation 3 2 number of samples n 42 the turbidity of background samples

minute l min per square meter m2 of effective treatment area to quantify pm separation ca etv 2013 the effective area is the uo area over which sedimentation occurs the pumped flow rates associated with each sor were determined based the effective treatment area of the hs system tested a mass balance on pm was conducted for each separation test and included independent measurements of influent effluent separated pm and required a 90 recovery of pm mass the temperature of the influent flow to the hs units for all of the physical test did not exceed 26 c mean 73 f standard deviation 1 0 n 42 3 2 physical modeling methodology the physical monitoring campaign was configured to provide representative comparative data collection of pm separation for bhs units testing on each unit at each sor was initiated with a quiescent clean volume of water one turnover volume in the hs unit at each sor the flow duration and pm loading was a minimum of 25 min or the time required for eight turnover volumes whichever was greater ca etv 2013 a minimum of 12 kg of pm dry mass basis was fed into a hs during each test pm feed was injected into the potable water influent just upstream of the drop box three to five pipe diameters upstream of the hs six duplicates of portable water and six duplicate influent samples were taken at each sor for each sor at least 12 pair of duplicate effluent samples were taken at evenly spaced time increments throughout a run if the run duration exceeded 8 h the run was terminated until the next day when sampling resumed after three volume exchanges of influent at the nominal 200 mg l of pm were pumped through the hs before effluent sampling continued for the run duration samples were replicated and taken at regular intervals sor results were either examined separately or combined into a 1 h triangular sor loadgraph as shown in fig 2 a for stepwise steady modeling with cfd all physical model testing was conducted for a series of steady sor at 200 mg l 25 mg l of siliceous hetero disperse psd with a specific gravity sg of 2 65 the d50 of the psd metric shown in fig 2 b was 75 μm with gamma parameters of k 0 56 and λ 232 64 the sample bottles were 1 l wide mouth of pp polypropylene gravimetric pm analysis as ssc used vacuum filtration with 90 mm glass fiber filters nominal 1 μm and the entire sample volume instead of a sub aliquot of the sample thus providing more representative results and potential for a mass balance on pm because of the gravimetric pm analysis as ssc that required an entire 1 l sample separate paired 1 l samples for psd were taken with each ssc sample the analysis to determine psd consisted of two separate steps for the influent and effluent samples psd analysis was conducted with a malvern mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments 2007 laser diffraction particle size analyzer in addition to aqueous influent and effluent pm samples pm separated by the hs was recovered from each sor run for each hs unit dried and the psd determined for separated pm in accordance with astm d422 astm 1993 pm separation for each sor was determined as summarized in eq 1 in this equation mean cin is the mean inlet concentration eq 2

behavior mansouri et al 2012 mdi values greater than 1 indicates greater mixing for hs units the mdi has been correlated to the residence time distribution rtd cho and sansalone 2013b fig 3 a synthesizes results from nine hs units that range in diameter from 1 2 m 4 ft 1 8 m 6 ft and 2 4 m 8 ft bhs units and 0 9 m 3 ft 1 5 m 5 ft 1 8 m 6 ft and 2 1 m 7 ft shs units and also includes a bhs 1700 and bhs 3410 where these unit names represent the unit turnover volume in l the pm separation of bhs and shs units are also compared to plain tanks an open tank and a tank with a horizontal top the pm separation by these tanks are cfd modeled results the basic geometries are illustrated in fig 1 b through e the shaded area in fig 3 a approximates the envelope of the database trends for all hs units upper and lower bounds of this shaded envelope are logarithmic functions represented in the following equations 7 pm separation 10 4 ln sor 116 9 with r2 0 99 upper bound 8 pm separation 10 8 ln sor 112 9 with r2 0 99 median of dataset 9 pm separation 11 1 ln sor 109 0 with r2 0 99 lower bound in these equations sor has units of l min m2 the result in fig 3 a illustrate that the plain tank with a horizontal top and plain open tank both used for comparative control as cylindrical tanks have a statistically significantly α 0 05 lower pm separation as compared to the median results eq 8 from the measured datasets for the bhs and shs units the ideal sor model curve in fig 3 a assumed type i discrete particle settling and is the ideal limiting pm separation condition irrespective of the design and dimensions of the hs units no hs or plain open tank design exceeds the pm separation curve of the ideal sor model hazen s model eq s 15 with n 1 was also applied and plotted in fig 3 a to approximate a lower boundary of the measured datasets for pm separation for a non ideal and fully mixed hs condition to complement fig 3 a and b presents the volume weighted velocity magnitude m s for the different hs unit results in fig 3 a to provide an intuitive connection between velocity magnitude and pm separation 4 2 impact of psd size scaling variability on pm separation results testing protocols to examine pm separation specify a psd metric and will sometimes specify the allowable variability around a selected psd metric njdep 2013 ca etv 2013 in order to explore the impact of psd size variability on pm separation results seven different psds psd metric and six variants were tested for the 1 8 m bhs geometry the physically validated cfd model of the bhs was used to examine the pm separation the six psd variants tested had similar shape factors k for size hetero dispersivity to the psd metric the scaling factor γ as an index of the central tendency for the psd was varied for each psd variant with respect to the psd metric fig 2 b illustrates the psd variants and the hetero disperse psd metric these psd variants were tested with the cfd model at 2 4 and 6 coarser and finer with respect to the psd metric the indices for the psd variants are shown in table 2 table 2 also indicates that the d90 at 6 finer or coarser than the psd metric were relatively higher or lower in magnitude 265 531 μm as compared to the size variation of the d50 and d10 indices fig 4 summarizes the pm separation results based on cfd modeling of the psd variants summarized in table 2 and fig 2 b for the 1 8 m bhs to compares pm separation results for the psd variants fig 4 plots the cfd model results of the variants with respect to the psd metric results along with the measured results in a broad sor range 40 1400 l min m2 the null hypothesis is that the pm separation result of a psd variant as compared to the psd metric was not statistically different the pm separation from the validated cfd model for each different sor were weighted equally based on the same pm injection mass the chi squared test indicates that only the 2 variants with respect to the pm separation of the psd metric yielded no statistically difference p value less than α 0 05 the pm separation results for 4 and 6 psd variants produced results that were statistically significantly different as compared to the psd metric the measured data for 1 8 m bhs are also plotted in fig 4 there is no statistically significant difference between the cfd modeled and measured data p value less than α 0 05 based on testing with the psd metric within the range of hs units tested typical of source area hetero disperse psd loadings of hs units results indicate that a 2 variance is the proper psd variance range for controlled testing and comparison of pm separation by hs units 4 3 impact of psd shape hetero dispersivity variability on pm separation results the pm separation impact of psd hetero dispersivity shape with a constant scaling factor indexed as a d50 of 75 μm for two psd variants with respect to the hetero disperse psd metric were also generated with a physically validated cfd model of the 1 8 m bhs the supplemental information summarizes the two psd variants as compared to the hetero disperse psd metric k 0 56 λ 232 64 one psd variant was mono disperse k 505 25 λ 0 13 and the other psd was medium disperse k 2 32 λ 36 27 dickenson and sansalone 2009 fig 5 represents a comparison between the cfd model and the ideal sor model results for pm separation as a function of sor for the mono medium and hetero disperse psds from fig 5 a the cfd model reproduced the measured pm separation results rpd 4 3 for the hetero disperse psd loading of the 1 8 m bhs across the sor range from 0 to 1400 l min m2 the ideal sor model increasingly over predicted pm separation results as compared to the validated cfd model this over prediction by the sor model as compared to the cfd model increased 8 1 15 4 and 12 0 as the psd was altered from hetero to medium to mono disperse the increasing over prediction as the psd became more mono disperse occurs in part because the ideal sor model neglects hydrodynamics and internal geometry of the hs unit results indicate that the current hetero disperse psd used for regulatory testing allowing a 2 variance for finer or coarser based on results in figs 2 b and 5 represents a robust metric for hs units 4 4 effluent psd indices as a function of sor table 3 summarizes the trend in measured effluent psd indices and pm for the 1 8 m bhs the hetero disperse influent psd metric and pm concentration remained constant during the testing at each sor the cfd modeled effluent emcs event mean concentration for pm reproduced the trend of measured emcs within 10 at each sor noting that as sor increased the eluted pm as ssc towards the influent pm of 200 mg l size indices of d90 d50 d10 and gamma distribution scaling parameter indicated that the eluted psd became increasing coarser with increasing sor see table 4 in addition to emc results for pm fig 6 compares the measured and cfd modeled pm separation results for specific particle diameters within the silt settleable and fine sand size sediment range of the psd for five specific diameters 25 53 75 100 and 150 μm these results were developed across the tested sor range the modeled results reasonably reproduce the measured results from the physical model testing noting that in cfd a discrete particle diameter was modeled while the measured data was based on interpolating the discretized effluent psd data for the specific particle diameter examined while particle separation by sedimentation is clearly a function of particle diameter results in fig 6 indicate that the pm separation behavior for the baffled hs unit reached a common inflection point at approximately 450 l min m2 for each particle diameter for lower sor values up to 450 l min m2 the pm separation decreased more rapidly while for this unit above 450 l min m2 the decrease was more gradual and less sensitive to increasing sor as the eluted psd became coarser and ssc higher for all selected particle diameters the pm separation was decreased significantly as the sor increased the sor at which 100 pm separation occurred for the pm diameters shown in table 5 indicates that measured results were marginally lower than cfd model result within approximately 10 l min m2 4 5 pm separation with a 1 h triangular sor loadgraph as summarized in table 5 the pm separation results for the different hs designs of this study based on the cfd model of the 1 h triangular loadgraph shown in fig 2 are within a narrow range from 33 9 to 46 0 and these results are higher than the cylindrical tank designs of 30 9 33 5 the cfd model results provide the pm separation result at 40 80 200 400 600 1000 and 1400 l min m2 trend line function as eqs 7 9 was generated for each hs unit and calculated the pm separation result at 100 300 500 700 900 1100 and 1300 l min m2 the result shown in table 5 were calculated by multiplying the pm separation result at each sor and the area percentage of corresponding rectangle the hs designs provided a mean improvement of approximately 8 for pm separation as compared to a blank cylindrical tank the ideal sor result for pm separation during the 1 h sor loadgraph was 46 8 which was significantly greater than the pm separation results from the validated cfd model for all hs unit designs the effluent emcs for the nine hs design shown in table 5 was 122 8 mg l sd 7 0 rpd for minimum and maximum value are 12 1 and 7 7 and the d50 average was 28 6 μm sd 4 3 rpd for minimum and maximum value are 22 5 and 25 4 table 5 indicated that hs units with larger surface area provided an increase in pm separation of 3 between 1 2 m bhs and 2 4 m bhs such improved pm separation comes at an increase in structural unit costs and construction costs the constrained range of pm separation for all units subject to controlled testing suggests that uncontrolled and relatively poorly maintained in situ field conditions yield pm separation between hs units that may not be physically or potentially statistically different 5 conclusions hs designs have variable internal geometries surface areas and volumes this study examines a range of full scale physical validated cfd models and a sor model to evaluate hs functionality under steady loadings that are extended to an unsteady loadgraph the conclusions are as follows within the range of geometric factors tested for a given pm granulometry and sor pm separation for nine hs units declined with increasing sor logarithmically in a constrained range 10 clearly below the ideal sor and above the completely mixed tank n 1 limit the ideal sor model results were statistically significantly higher than results of the validated cfd model for all hs units for all hs units this constrained range in pm separation was relatively small when these results were compared to the higher ideal sor model predictions crucial for testing certification a validated cfd model demonstrates that pm separation was statistically different at more than 2 psd variability with respect to the influent psd metric results demonstrate that a validated cfd model reproduces pm separation results whether on a gravimetric basis for a given psd or on a particle diameter basis of a psd which allows portability of results for different psds ranges of sors or unsteady sor loadgraphs in contrast to the cfd model the sor model increasing over predicted pm separation as the psd shape dispersivity varied from hetero to mono disperse for hs units the sor model provides a hypothetical upper bound of ideal pm separation with the sor model error increasing as the psd becomes more mono disperse for a wide range of hs units a physically validated cfd model provides a valuable albeit under utilized tool to prototype test compare certify unit operations for regulatory approval and also yield portability of results in particular compared to the costs of additional physical modeling conflicts of interest the authors have no
