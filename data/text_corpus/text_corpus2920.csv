14600,the performance and calcium sulfate inhibition ratio csi of five scale inhibition mixtures consisting of aminotris methylenephosphonic acid atmp diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmpa and poly acrylic acid paa were studied at three elevated saturation indexes si the induction time effect was studied for 40min for each mixture the results revealed that the best inhibitive performance was achieved by mixture 3 at a 2 ppm dose on 3 76 si 4ppm on 5 80 si and 10ppm on 8 00 si in addition the induction time study confirmed that mixture 3 had the longest induction time at the two saturation indexes and different concentrations this high performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of atmp and dtpmpa in the calcium sulfate inhibitive mechanism this mixture showed better scale inhibition kinetics compared to polyacrylate inhibitors keywords scale inhibitor calcium sulfate atmp dtpmpa water treatment 1 introduction precipitation or scale formation of inorganic salts with low solubility is a costly and persistent problem in most water systems such as reverse osmosis systems boilers cooling towers heat exchangers washing machines thermal desalination plants and many others 1 3 the cost impact on scaling related problems was calculated to be 9 3 and 0 8 billion in the usa japan and great britain respectively 4 5 in essence when solubility limits are exceeded and the solution becomes oversaturated precipitation or crystallization occurs and scales start to build up on surfaces effectively forming an insulating layer especially at high temperatures and on heat transfer surfaces 6 in industrial applications scale formation is a massively troubling phenomenon that generates higher operational costs by impeding heat transfer reducing fluid flow and causing unscheduled equipment shutdown additionally the scaling problem is associated with a localized corrosion attack called under deposit corrosion 7 8 at present numerous physical chemical and mechanical procedures can be utilized to counteract scale formation among physical techniques magnetic scale inhibition treatment electric field implementation and sonic wave radiation were studied 6 9 however physical scale inhibition methods are still inefficient as the mechanisms are not yet clearly understood mechanical scale control methods are practiced but are indirectly related to water chemistry such as increasing the blow down in cooling towers or reducing reverse osmosis plant recovery unfortunately these methods increase water consumption and the associated operational costs while remaining insufficient to inhibit deposit formation 8 chemical scale inhibition methods consist of the addition of remarkable amounts of chemicals such as strong acids to bring down the ph e g sulfuric acid or chelating agents to complex ca 2 e g sodium salt of ethylenediamine tetraacetic edta that are considered corrosive chemicals in addition the chelation treatment method requires a low hardness in the water and may increase corrosion rates if not properly monitored 10 11 therefore traditional chemical methods such as these are quite expensive and can have negative impacts on water systems and the environment many new chemical inhibitors for scaling have been developed they are ordinarily known as threshold scale inhibition agents such as polyphosphates phosphonates or polycarboxylates they are highly effective because the inhibitive dosage is much lower than stoichiometric quantities of the scale and work at high levels of saturation indexes for certain salts in water systems such as caco3 caso4 baso4 and ca3 po4 2 12 most forms of inorganic scales are insoluble salts of carbonates sulfates hydroxides phosphates and silicates for alkaline earth metals especially calcium and magnesium salts alkaline scales can be effectively controlled by acidifying the water and keeping the ph below 7 5 but such a low ph can lead to additional problems related to metal corrosion calcium sulfate scale is viewed as a terrible scale in the field of water treatment because it has a low solubility independent of ph and cannot be removed by acid cleaning procedures thus calcium sulfate scale must always be prevented in earlier stages 13 a significant number of scale inhibitors for decreasing or preventing the crystallization of calcium sulfate dihydrate caso4 2h2o have been studied including phosphonates polyelectrolytes organic phosphate esters and special types of polymers 2 14 15 as copolymeric and terpolymeric scale inhibitors contain multi functional groups these could efficiently inhibit calcium sulfate dihydrate scale 16 17 calcium sulfate dihydrate makes up an overwhelming portion of calcium scales formed in various water processes since this salt has a very low solubility of 0 24g 100ml at 20 c 18 it has three crystal forms dihydrate caso4 2h2o gypsum hemihydrate caso4 ½ h2o and anhydrite caso4 many factors could affect nucleation crystal growth and the type of crystals formed such as saturation index temperature and water ionic strength in the media 2 induction time or delaying time provides useful insights into the scaling progression of a sampling solution under saturation concentrations of ions induction time is defined as the required period or by elapsed time to carry out initial changes in the physical properties of the solution at the onset of supersaturation via the formation of a solid phase of scale particles 19 20 based on this definition it is noted that each scale inhibitor is functioning as an inhibitor for a specific period after which it will gradually lose its efficiency and scale precipitation will start taking place there is no standard procedure to determine the parameter of induction time because it depends on many variables and cannot easily be controlled 21 however some researchers considered the electrical conductivity of a solution as an indicative technique to measure solution stability as a solution s conductivity value would decrease gradually over time due to solid scale precipitation 22 other techniques such as light scattering or turbidity were also utilized in which gradually after precipitation light transparency through the solution would decrease and turbidity would increase respectively 23 induction time is a key parameter that should be considered in the scale inhibitor s evaluation which reflects the age of scale inhibition or scaling power 20 24 in this study the inhibition performance of two phosphonic acids on calcium sulfate dihydrate scale was evaluated amino tris methylenephosphonic acid atmp and diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmpa their synergistic performances in different mixtures are shown in table 2 next these results were compared with a commonly used non phosphorous inhibitor of polyacrylic acid paa the comparison was conducted on three different saturation indexes si of calcium sulfate in solution the results present the ratio of calcium sulfate inhibition csi to select the best inhibition mixture all mixtures were evaluated for their induction times through measuring solution turbidity within a period of time finally some characterization techniques were used to gain insights on the crystalline changes in scale after the addition of inhibitors compared to the uninhibited scale accordingly x ray diffraction xrd energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and scanning electron microscope sem were utilized 2 experimental 2 1 materials deionized water di was used for experimental solutions and cleaning purposes the three samples of scale inhibitors atmp dtpmpa and paa were freshly prepared from commercial samples requested from taiwan k k corporation in taiwan with certificates of analysis the three inhibitors were in sodium form to ensure good solubility table 1 shows the names and compositions of these inhibitors with their molecular weights mw all other chemicals used in this work including cacl2 2h2o na2so4 10h2o edta eriochrome black t ammonium chloride and ammonia solution were purchased from sigma aldrich at analytical grade deionized water was used to prepare synthetic mother solutions while tap water was not used because ion concentrations in tap water are high and ionic strength could affect the solubility of calcium sulfate scale mother solutions of calcium and sulfate were prepared and stored in a dark enclosure for subsequent use in the experiments scale inhibition mother mixtures were prepared from the raw materials using deionized water as detailed in table 2 and then stored in a dark enclosure 2 2 apparatus scanning electronic microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx and powder x ray diffraction xrd were utilized to carry out characterization tests of the scale samples using a jeol jsm5800lv scanning microscope and a rigaku ultima iv x ray diffractometer in addition a turbidity meter 2100n model from hach co was used to measure the turbidity following the standard method apha 2130 b with results reported in nephelometric turbidity units ntu 25 2 3 analytical procedure synthetic testing solutions were mixed from the mother solutions by adding a certain volume of sulfate solution to deionized water to achieve the desired concentration of so4 2 then a specific dose of a freshly prepared inhibitor was added to solution finally a calculated volume of calcium solution was added to reach the target level of ca 2 concentration in solution three saturation index si values were considered in this comparative study which are calculated according to astm d 4328 03 including ionic strength consideration 26 all experiments were conducted under isothermal conditions at 25 c with different doses of inhibitors from 1 to 14ppm at a rotational mixing speed of 150rpm for 30min the solution ph was not adjusted as it was stable and ranged from 7 0 to 7 2 maximum after mixing solutions were filtered through a 0 45 μm filtration membrane and the dissolved filterable calcium was analyzed using an edta titrimetric method according to the standard method apha 3500 ca b 25 finally the calcium sulfate inhibition ratio csi was calculated by the following equation 27 28 c s i c a s a m p l e c a b l a n k c a i n i t i a l c a b l a n k the induction time effect was evaluated following a similar procedure and continuous analysis of turbidity every 5min until 40min neither filtration nor calcium analysis were required for these tests 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of inhibitor concentration three dimensional graphical representations were applied to compare the efficiency of the five mixtures in several repeating runs of different dosages of inhibitor mixtures the first set of experiments occurred against a saturated solution of 3500mg l ca 2 and 3500mg l so4 2 representing a saturation index si value of 3 76 fig 1 presents the results of the csi for each mixture at elevated dosages it is obvious that the efficiency of scale inhibition increases with increasing inhibitor dosage at 4 ppm dosage all mixtures achieved almost 100 inhibition efficiency which reflects the strength of these inhibitors compared to others however mixture 1 showed a relatively low efficiency at 1 2ppm dosages which reflects weaker inhibition properties of atmp compared to dtpmpa and paa scale inhibitors since this level of si is not very high the inhibitive properties of mixtures 2 3 4 and 5 were good and almost equivalent the second set of experiments occurred against a supersaturated solution of 5000mg l ca 2 and 5000mg l so4 2 representing a saturation index si value of 5 80 fig 2 presents the results of the csi for each mixture at elevated dosages from 1 to 14ppm it is confirmed that the performance of atmp in mixture 1 alone is weaker than the other inhibitors which was observed at lower si however the inhibition efficiency of dtpmpa alone in mixture 2 was lower than the synergized mixtures of atmp and dtpmpa in mixtures 3 and 4 paa showed good inhibition efficiency which is commonly used in desalination plants it is noticeable that mixture 3 has the best inhibition ratio compared to others by achieving almost 100 inhibition at 4 ppm dosage and 97 at 2ppm mixtures 4 and 5 showed good inhibition results at a 4 ppm dose and 100 at 6 ppm dosage the third set of experiments occurred against a supersaturated solution of 6500mg l ca 2 and 6500mg l so4 2 representing a saturation index si value of 8 00 fig 3 presents the results of the csi for each mixture at elevated dosages from 1 to 14ppm at these highly scaling conditions the results confirmed the above findings that mixture 3 has the strongest inhibition properties compared to single inhibitors of atmp dtpmpa and paa this could be attributed to the synergistic function between atmp and dtpmpa mixture 3 achieved approximately 100 inhibition efficiency at 10ppm dosage however there is a reduction in mixture 4 s performance compared to its performance at lower si levels mixtures 2 and 5 showed remarkably good results compared to mixtures 1 and 4 at all dosages in conclusion mixture 3 showed the best inhibition efficiency at three elevated saturation indexes where its composition was 1 1 atmp dtpmpa 3 2 effect of induction time similar preparation procedures were followed in this set of tests to evaluate the induction times for each scale inhibition mixture at different dosages and saturation indexes figs 4 8 present the turbidity changes over a period of 40min for the five scale inhibition mixtures at specific dosages compared to the blank solution fig 4 shows that after the addition of scale inhibitor mixtures scale formation delayed for a while for all mixtures this delay in scale formation was remarkably high with mixtures 2 3 and 5 while it was shorter with mixtures 1 and 4 this delay was observable in comparison to the crystallization growth in the blank sample without any scale inhibitor after this induction or delay time precipitation gradually occurred and the solution turbidity started increasing this turbidity level exceeded 10 ntu after 20min of mixing in the absence of scale inhibitors it can be seen that mixture 3 had an outstanding ability to delay the scale formation process for more than 40min without exceeding 3 ntu this delay reflects that the 1 1 mixture of atm and dtpmpa has the highest induction time under these conditions mixtures 2 and 5 showed high induction times as well in contrast mixtures 1 and 4 showed very low induction times fig 5 shows another set of experiments at the same conditions using a higher dose of scale inhibitor to evaluate the optimum dose of mixtures and their maximum induction times the findings are almost identical to the previous ones shown in fig 4 however at this higher dose of scale inhibitor 6ppm the induction times of all mixtures have increased especially for mixtures 1 and 4 but they were still shorter than those of other inhibitors fig 6 shows a set of experiments in a more stressed scaling condition of a 5 80 saturation index of calcium sulfate at a dose of 2mg l the induction time of all mixtures was quite fast and the precipitation process started early however mixture 3 showed a higher induction time and a better performance by controlling turbidity at less than 10 ntu for more than 30min in contrast mixture 1 had the lowest induction time compared to the other mixtures which reflects a low stability of calcium atmp complexes under these testing conditions however mixtures 3 and 4 showed the highest induction times prolonging the complexing stage of calcium and delaying caso4 precipitation fig 7 shows similar testing conditions with a higher dosage of scale inhibitor at 6mg l the results are compatible with previous ones and mixtures 3 and 4 presented the highest induction times this good performance of mixtures 3 and 4 can be attributed to the synergistic effect of atmp and dtpmpa in caso4 scale inhibition an additional experiment was conducted at 10mg l of inhibitor to evaluate the induction times at a higher dosage as presented in fig 8 the results showed a superior performance of mixture 3 in prolonging the scaling rate at 10mg l of inhibitor under these stressed scaling conditions the turbidity did not exceed 3 ntu after 40min of mixing time the induction time at higher saturation indexes of caso4 was not investigated because this saturation level was extremely high and the results could not be representative additionally this stressed saturation level generally does not exist in desalination plants 3 3 scale characterization sem eds and xrd methods were utilized to characterize the precipitate formed in the blank sample additionally sem images were taken for all precipitates to evaluate the crystal structures before and after the addition of each mixture fig 9 shows the crystalline structure of caso4 precipitates in the absence and presence of inhibitors at a 4 ppm dose it is noticeable from the sem micrographs that the absence of inhibitors allows clear homogeneous billet like crystals without distortion the addition of each mixture has changed the crystalline structure of caso4 scale and made clear distortions in the crystals this distortion by the scale inhibitor has obstructed the direct spontaneous precipitation reaction of calcium and sulfate ions fig 10 shows the eds spectrum of the formed scale in the blank sample in the absence of inhibitor the presence of a low concentration of chlorine atoms in the eds spectrum could be due to their adsorption on the scale surface fig 11 shows the xrd spectrum of the formed scale in the blank sample to identify the caso4 crystalline structure the result matches the spectrum of gypsum amorphous crystals caso4 2h2o which is normally formed under similar conditions 4 conclusion from the above study we can observe that atmp and dtpmpa work synergistically in a 1 1 ratio more efficiently than each as a single inhibitor the mechanism of this effect cannot easily be explained and requires further advanced studies this mixture of both inhibitors showed the highest csi ratio and showed the longest induction times at relatively low concentrations in addition this mixture worked efficiently under stressed scaling conditions when the saturation levels reached 5 80 and 8 00 furthermore it was demonstrated that each phosphorous based scale inhibitor could not reach a higher csi if used alone compared to the combined mixtures as shown with both mixtures 3 and 4 on the other hand polyacrylates work more efficiently in inhibiting calcium sulfate scale under various saturation indexes compared to atmp and dtpmpa single inhibitors induction time has remarkable importance in evaluating scale inhibitors and can be one the key factors in scale inhibition efficiency acknowledgements the

14601,linde type a lta zeolite nanoparticles were synthesized modified with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and then used for removal of cyanide from synthetic solution the synthesized adsorbent was characterized by means of xrd sem ftir and bet techniques results well revealed that the cyanide adsorption rate increased with increase in solution temperature and the pseudo second order model best describe the cyanide adsorption kinetics the changes in enthalpy δh and entropy δs were 434kj mol and 5 32kj molk respectively which substantiates the spontaneous and exothermic behaviour of the cyanide uptake by modified lta zeolite nanoparticles the experimental isotherm results were best fitted onto the langmuir monolayer model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 24 09mg g this value is higher than the previously reported values for other adsorbents and thereby demonstrates that modified lta zeolite is an efficient adsorbent material for cyanide removal keywords cyanide lta zeolite nano adsorption 1 introduction the increasing water resources contamination by industrial wastewater containing toxic materials possesses a critical environmental issue 1 cyanide is a hazardous pollutant of special interest that attracts considerable attention wing to its fatal effects on human health and environment 2 cyanide is extremely toxic to human health that is used in a several industries and detected in low amounts from car exhausts chronic exposure of humans to cyanide primarily has detrimental effects on the central nervous system 3 apart from affecting the cardiovascular and respiratory systems enlarging thyroid glands and causing irritation to the eyes and skin 4 no data are available on the carcinogenic effects of cyanide in humans as a consequence of its inhalation 3 although many researchers have reported adverse effects of cyanide cyanide is in two dangerous forms namely hcn and cn in water 5 cyanide contaminated wastewater are produced from several industries for example industrial effluents from gold extraction iron and steel oil extraction and refining as well as metal plating industries contain cyanide species above the maximum contaminant level allowed 6 7 therefore these effluents must be treated before discharging them into any aquatic environment for that reason and for environmental protection goals the environmental protection agency epa set strong standards on the acceptable cyanide levels in industrial wastewater effluent which is suggested to be below 0 2mg l prior to discharge into the environment 8 in the usa according to epa standards the allowed cyanide level in drinking water and aquatic environment are 200 and 50 ppb respectively and generally the local environmental discharge limit is 0 2ppm 9 10 numerous procedures have been proposed for cyanide treatment in wastewater including electro winning 11 hydrolysis distillation 9 flotation 12 iron cyanide precipitation 13 resin 14 acidification volatilisation re neutralisation 15 reverse osmosis 16 degradation by hydrogen peroxide 17 oxidation by caro s acid 18 and biosorption 19 in the design of appropriate treatment method the concentration of waste and the cost of treatment method must be taken into account 20 adsorption is a low cost simple and widely used method for treating various toxic materials 5 nowadays nanoadsorbent defined by including nano cavity have received great notice for the removal of pollutant due to their high surface area which is followed higher adsorption capacities recently adsorption using zeolitic materials in nano size has attracted much attention in environmental applications 21 22 moreover extraordinary adsorption catalysis and ion exchange properties of zeolite have found numerous industrial and research applications in the bulk powder form 23 linde type a lta zeolite materials are crystalline compounds with an extremely ordered and open microporous frame consisting of a three dimensional network of sio4 and alo4 tetrahedral 24 lta zeolite is a well known type of zeolitic material in terms of large scale commercial production and application 5 lta zeolite has been described as sodalite cages linked via four membered rings the bounding layout of the sodalite cages leads in the formation of a large central hole known as a super cage after that the lta zeolite is formed by bonding of this central cavity with six similar cavities via an eight ring window of an opening diameter of 4 2å the synthetic lta zeolite has a si al ratio of 1 however higher ratios up to 1 7 may be observed when tetramethylammonium is used as starting materials in the synthesis of lta zeolite 5 to enhance the adsorption capacity lta zeolite nanoparticles may be subjected to a sequence of processes in order to modify its surface which can be done using a cationic surfactant by modification of zeolites with cationic surfactant a positive functional group was created on the external surfaces and the charge density was changed to positive side therefore such zeolite will be appropriate for adsorption of negatively charged materials such as cyanide 25 generally hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hdtmab is applied for this purpose which is a quaternary amine with a long chain cationic surfactant 26 recently interest in the adsorption of anions and non polar molecules on surface modified zeolites has increased for example the adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbons methyltert butylether mtbe btex and other petroleum monoaromatics from contaminated aqueous solutions on granulated natural zeolite nanoparticles modified with surfactant has been studied 27 29 23 the aim of present study was the synthesis of lta zeolite nanoparticles modify of it by hdtmab and then evaluate of their ability for removal of cyanide from aqueous samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical grade chemicals were used for experimental studies nacn hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hdtmab silicon

using philips xl30 instrument netherlands equipped with energy dispersive x ray microanalysis edx was used for adsorbent surface morphology studies and elemental analysis the specific surface area of the adsorbent was determined using a nitrogen adsorption technique based on the brunauer emmet teller bet isotherm model micromeretics gemini 2372 the nature of involved functional groups in cyanide adsorption on the surface of the adsorbent was determined by fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ftir at a wavelength range of 400 4000cm 1 bruker vertex 70 germany the elemental analysis of the adsorbent samples was conducted by using an edx spectrometer attached to the sem moreover x ray diffraction xrd instrument using the philips xpert pro with cukα radiation 1 54056åwavelength generated

preparation of the adsorbent in this study an lta zeolite nanoparticle modified by hdtmab was applied for uptake of cyanide from a synthetic solution in the beginning lta zeolite was synthesized in the laboratory from a homogenized mixture solution of the following molar composition 0 8naoh 5 0hdtmab 3 4sio2 1 0al2o3 370h2o 19 6etoh 6 0iso proh the molecular structure of the lta zeolite is shown in fig 1 31 lta zeolite was crystallised in a sealed polypropylene bottle and then stirred vigorously at 98 c for 3h the lta zeolite nanoparticles were recovered from the mother liquor by centrifugation using a centrifuge sigma 301 159 germany at 12000rpm for 60min next to remove any unreacted materials the lta zeolite nanoparticles powder was dispersed in deionized water by sonication and then centrifugation this procedure was repeated until the ph of the supernatant dropped below 9 the lta zeolite nanoparticles powder was dried at 65 c over night and then calcined at 500 c for 4h in an electrical furnace the heating and cooling order was set at 1 c min to remove the hdtmab molecules 2 4 surface modification of adsorbent the surface modification of lta zeolite nanoparticles was performed using hdtmab briefly 10g of powdered raw synthesis lta zeolite was introduced to 1000ml hdtmab solution and the solution was placed on a shaker hanna hi 157 190m singapore for 24h at 60 c after 24h the modified zeolite was separated by centrifuging of solution at 12000rpm for 5min the modified adsorbent was then washed twice with 100ml of deionized water stirred at 150rpm for 15min and then centrifuged at 12000rpm for 5min the ph of the final solutions was registered and found to be7 0 0 2 next the centrifuged material of modified lta zeolite was dried at 110 c for 24h and kept in a glass container for subsequent use in the adsorption tests 2 5 experiments batch adsorption experiments were conducted in 250ml conical flasks all experiments were conducted at the room temperature expect those meant for the effects of temperature study various experimental parameters such as ph 3 11 temperature 20 60 c adsorbent mass 0 2 1g l initial cyanide concentration 25 50 and 75mg l and contact time 0 120min were investigated at first kinetic of adsorption and effect of initial cyanide concentration on the removal efficiency were performed at ph 7 adsorbent of 0 5g l was introduced into three conical flasks containing the cyanide solution at a concentration of 25 50 and 75mg l these flasks were shaken at 200 rpm at a predetermined time interval the samples were collected filtered through a filter paper 0 45mm whatman germany and then centrifuged the residual cyanide concentration was then determined and removal efficiency was calculated by the following equation 1 removal efficiency c 0 c e c 0 100 where c o and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cyanide mg l respectively in order to investigate the effect of the solution ph on the removal efficiency 250ml of cyanide solution containing 25mg l cyanide was added to nine flasks and after adding of 0 5g l adsorbent the ph adjusted at 3 11 then these flasks were shaken at 200rpm till the equilibrium was reached after equilibrium time the samples was subsequently filtered and centrifuged before the final cyanide concentration was measured after determination of the equilibrium time initial cyanide concentration and solution ph the effects of adsorbent mass and temperature was investigated finally the parameters of the kinetic thermodynamic and isotherm models were determined by resultant of contact time temperature and adsorbent mass respectively 2 6 determination of zero point charge phzpc the phzpc was determined by adding 0 01m nacl as an electrolyte and 0 1m naoh or 0 1m hcl as ph adjusting agent the 50ml of electrolyte was poured into 9 erlenmeyer flask and the solution ph was adjusted from 2 to 10 lta zeolite nanoparticles 0 5g were added to each flask and the flask were agitated for 48h next the adsorbent was separated by filtration and the final ph of the filtrate was determined by plotting the initial ph value versus the ph value after 48 h agitation one can calculated the phzpc of lta zeolite nanoparticles from the intersection of such plot 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characteristics and morphology the xrd patterns of lta zeolite nanoparticles before and after modification are illustrated in fig 2 a and b respectively it is observed that the both samples exhibited similar patterns indicating that the modification process did not have any noticeable influence on the structural framework of the zeolite furthermore as observed in these two figures the reflection peaks of the lta zeolite at 2θ 8 66 12 60 19 00 21 60 23 90 28 20 and 33 10 ascertain the successful synthesis of a high purity lta zeolite structure 20 32 the bet analysis revealed that the specific surface area of the used medium was relatively high 421m2 g nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of the sample is shown in fig 2 c which is a typical isotherm of microporous materials a steep jump and a large desorption loop were noted in the isotherm the hysteresis loop of the zeolite observed at a high relative pressure p p 0 0 9 1 0 reflecting the inter crystalline voids in the packing of the smaller crystals fig 2 d fig 2 e depicts the sem image of the modified lta zeolite before cyanide adsorption this figure shows the surface morphology of the synthesized lta zeolite it can be observed from the figure that the adsorbent particles were uniformly shaped of small particles grey parts with a size ranging from 60 to170nm in diameter moreover several heterogeneous small pores and cavities dark parts could be noted which are known to provide larger surface area for the contaminant adsorption attributing the feature of well supported adsorbent to the lta zeolite nanoparticles 21 33 our results well demonstrate firstly the interactions between cyanide molecules and lta zeolite after cyanide adsorption fig 2 f some dramatic visual changes were observed in this case the surface of lta adsorbent showed to be less scabrous more brightness and some of formerly existing pores disappeared these changes can be attributed to the adsorption between cyanide molecules onto lta zeolite outer surface and inner the pores same results were found in several studies 21 fig 2 g and h illustrate the ftir spectrum of raw and modified lta zeolite nanoparticles respectively in addition the relevant functional groups of the adsorbent were listed in table 1 the spectrum detected at wavelengths of 400 4000cm1 shows the secondary building units of zeolitic structures such as double rings and pore opening 34 35 for example the ftir spectra of the vibration of t o bending at 475 42cm 1 double ring at 576 68cm 1 and the to4 asymmetric stretch at 1035 7cm 1 are considered as evidences of a zeolitic structure formation the ftir spectrum of prepared lta zeolite was equal and in accordance with those that reported in the literature previously 24 the band noted at around 2800 3000cm 1 in the modified zeolite indicates symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of the ch2 of alkyl chain whereas the band at about 1420 1480cm 1 was specified to the vibration of the trimethyl ammonium quaternary group the elemental structure of the modified lta zeolite nanoparticles is shown in table 2 the si al ratio of the synthesized zeolite as determined by edx spectroscopy was 1 66 which is in the reported range for zeolite na lta compositions the change in si al ratio of the final product may be due to the used template as starting materials in the synthesis of zeolites for example lta zeolite synthesized using tetramethylammonium as template has a si al ratio of about 2 in contrast template free synthesis gives the value of si al 1 20 as a result of increasing si al ratio the thermal and chemical stability of the product is improved remarkably which is of a great interest for various commercial applications in industries 3 2 time concentration profile and kinetic study the results depicted in fig 3 shows that the uptake of cyanide in the early adsorption stage was high which is an interesting property of the adsorbent for practical applications 35 next the removal of solute was increased slowly with the increase in the contact time until a plateau was reached up to 60min for all cyanide concentrations in fact further contact time to over 60min did not raise cyanide uptake and the change in the removal rate remained poor then 60min was considered to be the optimized time in the further tests after equilibrium time 60min the plateau removal efficiencies were 86 4 69 and 58 6 for initial solute concentrations of 25 50 and 75mg l respectively the rapid adsorption rate the initial stage may be due to the greater concentration gradient and more available sites for adsorption for a particular adsorbent mass after adsorbent surface used the interior surface of medium participate in cyanide adsorption and due to slow pore diffusion phenomena a relatively slow process was noted 36 also the results revealed that the removal rate was decreased with an increase in the initial solute concentration this phenomenon can be reasoned that due to the saturation of binding sites onto the adsorbent surface at higher solute concentration more cyanide molecules are left unadsorbed in the solution in other words at a given mass of adsorbents there are an exclusive number of bonding sites which are saturated above a certain concentration of pollutant 34 equilibrium time data was used to identify the mechanism of adsorption such as chemical reaction diffusion control and mass transfer these data were analysed using pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion modified pseudo first order and elovich kinetic models and the related parameters of each model are presented in table 3 linear regression was used to fit the experimental data with the kinetic models the model s fitness was significant as indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 the pseudo first order equation is generally expressed as follows 37 2 d q t d t k 1 q e q t integration of eq 2 at the boundary of qt 0 at t 0 and qt qt at a given time t gives the following 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qe and qt are the amounts mg g of adsorbate at equilibrium and at a given time t min respectively k 1 is the rate constant min 1 the linear plot of lnqt qe vs t gives k 1 as the slope the general form of the pseudo second order kinetic equation is expressed as follows 38 4 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 where k 2 is the rate constant g mgmin integration of eq 4 at the boundary of qt 0 at t 0 and qt qt at t t rearranging to a linear form gives eq 5 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t the values of k 2 and qe can be determined from the slope and the intercept of the t qt vs t plot respectively the modified pseudo first order model which was proposed empirically by yang and al dury 39 and then theoretically derived by azizian and bashiri 40 is given by eq 6 6 d q t d t k m q e q t q e q t integration of eq 6 at the boundary conditions mentioned above leads to the following equation eq 7 7 ln 1 q t q e q t q e k m t the main assumption of the intra particle diffusion model is that film diffusion is negligible and intra particle diffusion is the only rate controlling step the non linear form of the intra particle diffusion model is expressed as follows 41 8 q t k i t 0 5 c where qt is the amount of adsorbate at time t and ki mg g min0 5 is the intra particle rate constant and c mg g is a parameter related to the thickness of the boundary layer by plotting qt vs t 0 5 one can obtain ki from the slope of the linear plot increasing values of ki indicate an increase in the adsorption rate for an adsorption process regarded as controlled by intra particle diffusion only the plot of qt vs t 0 5 should pass through the origin c very close or equal to 0 the non linear shape of the elovich equation is given as follows 9 d q t d t α e β q t rearrangement of eq 9 at the boundary with the same conditions as the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations gives the linear form of elovich equation as follows 10 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t where α mg g min is the initial sorption rate and the parameter β g mg corresponds to the extent of surface coverage and the activation energy for chemisorption as can be seen from table 2 the equilibrium data were exactly fitted to all kinetic models with higher correlation coefficient for the pseudo second order kinetic model for the pseudo first order model the accordance between experimentally observed uptake and that calculated from this model was poor moreover the r2 values obtained for this model was found to be below 0 990 for all cyanide concentrations for pseudo second order model the calculated uptake values agree well with the experimental values combined to the high r2 values obtained 0 990 the highest correlation coefficient obtained from pseudo second order model indicates the applicability of this model to fit the experimental kinetic data for the present system the rate constants for the pseudo second order model by the modified zeolite nanoparticles was decreased non linearly from 0 0101 to 0 0021g mg min with increase in initial cyanide concentrations from 25 to 75mg l respectively it is important to point for strict surface adsorption the relationship between the initial solute concentration and the rate of adsorption is linear and non linear relationship between solute concentration and adsorption rate may be due to the pore diffusion limits 42 to investigate whether the intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting step the data were tested by using the intraparticle diffusion model 21 if such curve passes through the origin c 0 the intraparticle diffusion will be the rate determining step in the present work the value of c was not zero indicating that intraparticle diffusion was not rate controlling step furthermore high value of ki confirmed the rapid transfer of adsorption at the first stage of contact times 3 3 influence of ph the solution ph plays a key role in the control of the surface charge and functional groups of an adsorbent the solution ph was adjusted from ph 2 10 to investigate the effect of it on cyanide uptake rate fig 4 which indicates that cyanide removal is highly ph dependent high sorption of cyanide occurs at an initial ph value of 7 further experiments performed beyond ph of 7 hampered the removal efficiency this is due to the repulsion forces between the negative charge cyanide molecules and the negative charged adsorbent surface with surplus oh ions in addition the final solution ph was found to increase with decreasing cyanide adsorption this can be attributed to the cyanide species in an alkaline or acidic environment in acid solution several parts of cyanide is in the form of hydrogen cyanide weak acid with dissolution constant of 4 8 10 10 and therefore in an alkaline solution it dissociated into its ions therefore by decreasing the solution ph the removal efficiency also decreases due to the formation of hydrogen cyanide and the final solution ph increases due to the lower dissociation constant of hydrogen cyanide 43 the role of ph in the adsorption process can be attributed to electrostatic interactions between the solute anions in the solution and the surface charge of modified lta zeolite furthermore this study revealed that the phpzc of the lta zeolite nanoparticles was found to be 8 when the solution ph was below the phzpc of 8 the cyanide anions were retained by the positively charged surface of modified lta zeolite due to the protonation of the hydroxyapatite hydroxyl groups thus favouring cyanide accumulation on the surface as the ph decreased below phzpc of 8 the surface charge of used adsorbent became more positive hence more cyanide anions were attracted to the surface increasing the adsorption capacity at ph values above the phzpc of 8 adsorption of cyanide was decreased because the surface of the adsorbent was negatively charged owing to deprotonating of the hydroxyapatite hydroxyl groups this reaction created a mutual repulsion between the cyanide anions and the oh anions our results were in accordance with those reported in literature 44 conversely some cyanide uptake was observed at ph phzpc it may not to be for electrostatic attraction but due to a chemical interaction with sufficient energy to overcome the surface cyanide repulsion forces 44 furthermore relatively high removal efficiency determined at ph near neutral leads to the favourable and environment friendly adsorption of cyanide onto lta zeolite 3 4 influence of the adsorbent mass adsorbent mass is another key factor in the adsorption process in present work the effect of adsorbent mass was studied in the range of 0 2 1g l fig 5 the removal uptake increased from 58 to 99 9 as the adsorbent dosage increased from 0 2 to 1g l ph 8 and an initial cyanide concentration of 25mg l this may be described by the fact that with an increase in the number of active sites a greater amount of cyanide can be adsorbed furthermore it was determined that with increasing adsorbent dosage from 0 2 to 1g l the cyanide adsorption capacity also increases from 20 to 31 25mg g in addition the removal rate of cyanide was 99 5 when utilizing 1g l adsorbent dose this demonstrated that lta zeolite can be employed as a potential eco friendly material for removal of cyanide from wastewater the present findings seem to be consistent with those of noroozifar et al 43 and deveci et al 44 who found that the cyanide removal efficiency increases with increasing dosage of modified natrolite zeolite iron oxyhydroxide and metal impregnated granular activated carbon 3 5 thermodynamic study the values of enthalpy δh entropy change δs free energy change δg kj mol and the thermodynamic nature of the adsorption process were calculated from the slopes and the intercepts of the linear plot of ln k d vs 1 t based on the following equation 41 11 ln k d δ h r t δ s r where k d is the distribution coefficient r is the universal gas constant 8 314jmol 1 k 1 and t is the absolute temperature k the values of the free energy change δg kj mol were calculated using the following equation 12 δ g r t ln k d the negative values of δh 434kj mol demonstrate the exothermic adsorption in nature which supports the idea that adsorption of cyanide onto used adsorbent is primarily physisorption and that the resulting adsorption complex is energetically stable 36 the positive values of δs 5 32kj molk showed that the randomness of the system increased during the sorption process the values of δg were 1119 1185 1236 1287 and 1333 for 293 303 313 323 and 333k respectively these negative values indicated that the sorption of cyanide was thermodynamically spontaneous in addition the absolute δg values tended to be more negative with respect to the increase in temperature from 293to 333k 20 60 c and this is additional proof of the exothermic adsorption of cyanide onto the present adsorbent material 42 3 6 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium data were analysed by two parameters freundlich langmuir and temkin isotherm models the langmuir model assumed a homogenous surface energy distribution on adsorbent surface it works reasonably well for describing ions that only binds through adsorption mechanisms accordingly most anions conform to the langmuir equation as the langmuir equation only predicts adsorption phenomena it only allows a finite amount of material to be retained on the surface the non linear eq 13 and linear eq 14 shapes of the langmuir model are described as follows 13 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 14 c e q e c e q m 1 q m b where q e is the equilibrium amount of adsorbate mg g c e is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l q m is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and b l mg is the langmuir constant the values of q m and b presented in table 3 were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of the linear langmuir plots of c e q e versusc e and listed in table 3 the important feature of the langmuir model can be described based on the dimensionless separation factor r l parameter as expressed by eq 15 15 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 and b are the initial cyanide concentration and langmuir constant respectively adsorption is unfavourable for r l 1 linear for r l 1 favourable for 0 r l 1 and irreversible for r l 0 the other most common isotherm model is the freundlich model which is appropriate for heterogeneous systems this model is expressed by eqs 16 and 17 16 q e k f c e 1 n 17 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q e is the amount of adsorbate mg g c e is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l and kf mg g l mg 1 n and 1 n are the freundlich constants associated to adsorption intensity and adsorption capacity respectively 8 a high value of k f is characteristic of a high affinity of the adsorbate for favourable adsorption the value of the freundlich constant n should be in the 1 10 range the values of kf and 1 n presented in table 3 were obtained from the slopes and intercepts of the linear freundlich plots of lnq e versus lnc e the temkin isotherm is also available for heterogeneous adsorption of the adsorbate onto a surface the non linear and linear forms of the temkin model are given by eqs 18 and 19 18 q e r t b 1 ln k t c e 19 q e b 1 ln k t b 1 ln c e where b 1 rt b 1 b 1 is the adsorption heat kj mol and k t is the equilibrium binding constant l g corresponding to the maximum binding energy a high value of b 1 indicates fast sorption of adsorbate at the initial stage similarly a low value of k t is related to the weak bonding of the adsorbate onto a medium by plotting q e vs ln c e one can deduce b 1 and k t from the slope and the intercept of the curve respectively the results calculated for each model and the corresponding parameters are listed in table 4 the validation of adsorption isotherm models was measured by determination of the two mathematical parameters the regression coefficient r2 and the variance deviation between experimental values of qe and models prediction of qe as shown in this table all of the used models correlated well with the experimental data r2 0 95 in the following order langmuir freundlich temkin the higher values of r2 indicated that the langmuir model was more suitable for fitting of the cyanide equilibrium data onto modified lta zeolite adsorbent with the maximum adsorption capacity found to be 24 09mg g these findings enlighten monolayer adsorption of cyanide onto homogenous surfaces sites of the used adsorbent 45 the favorability of cyanide sorption onto lta zeolite can be confirmed from the values of langmuir and freundlich constants b and n which were found to be 0 80 and 3 46 respectively for favourite adsorption process the n is the range 1 10 demonstrating that the stronger binding sites are occupied first and that the binding strength decreases with increasing degree of site occupation 37 the temkin isotherm is also suitable for heterogeneous adsorption of a solute onto a surface a high value of b 1 indicates slow sorption of adsorbate at the initial stage whereas a high value of k t is related to the strong bonding of the adsorbate onto a medium based on this assumption the adsorption heat was found to be approximately 2 86kj mol however the correlation coefficients of the temkin isotherm model appeared to be lower than those of the langmuir and freundlich models table 5 compares the maximum adsorption capacity of the present adsorbent and some recently used adsorbent for the removal of cyanide from aqueous solutions except for activated carbon qm 24 10mg g the present adsorbent material had higher sorption capacity compared to the other adsorbents given in this table these findings reveal that the modified lta zeolite nanoparticle is an efficient adsorbent for the removal of cyanide from an aqueous solution this adsorbent could be utilized in the adsorption systems to make value added product and eco friendly which could be remediate cyanide in wastewater 4 conclusion lta zeolite nanoparticles modified with hdtmab seemed to be an efficient adsorbent material for cyanide removal from a contaminated aqueous solution the characterisation investigation indicated the formation of high purity adsorbent with a size range of 60 170nm tthe bet plot analysis demonstrated that the adsorbent is a mesoporosity material with the high surface area 421m2 g the adsorption process appears to be dependent on the ph in the range of 5 11 with the optimum ph value below 7 sorption isotherm is described by the langmuir equation and the maximum sorption capacity reaches up to 24mg l in addition pseudo second order was the best fitting equation with the experimental kinetic data these findings demonstrated a chemosorption monolayer adsorption of cyanide onto homogenous active sites of the lta zeolite nanoparticles thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption process of cyanide is an exothermic reaction through the results obtained from the present study lta zeolite nanoparticles modified with hdtmab has a promising novel application in the removal of cyanide from the tertiary stage of wastewater treatment acknowledgment we acknowledge the iranian nanotechnology initiative council inic for partial financing of this study 
14601,linde type a lta zeolite nanoparticles were synthesized modified with hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and then used for removal of cyanide from synthetic solution the synthesized adsorbent was characterized by means of xrd sem ftir and bet techniques results well revealed that the cyanide adsorption rate increased with increase in solution temperature and the pseudo second order model best describe the cyanide adsorption kinetics the changes in enthalpy δh and entropy δs were 434kj mol and 5 32kj molk respectively which substantiates the spontaneous and exothermic behaviour of the cyanide uptake by modified lta zeolite nanoparticles the experimental isotherm results were best fitted onto the langmuir monolayer model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 24 09mg g this value is higher than the previously reported values for other adsorbents and thereby demonstrates that modified lta zeolite is an efficient adsorbent material for cyanide removal keywords cyanide lta zeolite nano adsorption 1 introduction the increasing water resources contamination by industrial wastewater containing toxic materials possesses a critical environmental issue 1 cyanide is a hazardous pollutant of special interest that attracts considerable attention wing to its fatal effects on human health and environment 2 cyanide is extremely toxic to human health that is used in a several industries and detected in low amounts from car exhausts chronic exposure of humans to cyanide primarily has detrimental effects on the central nervous system 3 apart from affecting the cardiovascular and respiratory systems enlarging thyroid glands and causing irritation to the eyes and skin 4 no data are available on the carcinogenic effects of cyanide in humans as a consequence of its inhalation 3 although many researchers have reported adverse effects of cyanide cyanide is in two dangerous forms namely hcn and cn in water 5 cyanide contaminated wastewater are produced from several industries for example industrial effluents from gold extraction iron and steel oil extraction and refining as well as metal plating industries contain cyanide species above the maximum contaminant level allowed 6 7 therefore these effluents must be treated before discharging them into any aquatic environment for that reason and for environmental protection goals the environmental protection agency epa set strong standards on the acceptable cyanide levels in industrial wastewater effluent which is suggested to be below 0 2mg l prior to discharge into the environment 8 in the usa according to epa standards the allowed cyanide level in drinking water and aquatic environment are 200 and 50 ppb respectively and generally the local environmental discharge limit is 0 2ppm 9 10 numerous procedures have been proposed for cyanide treatment in wastewater including electro winning 11 hydrolysis distillation 9 flotation 12 iron cyanide precipitation 13 resin 14 acidification volatilisation re neutralisation 15 reverse osmosis 16 degradation by hydrogen peroxide 17 oxidation by caro s acid 18 and biosorption 19 in the design of appropriate treatment method the concentration of waste and the cost of treatment method must be taken into account 20 adsorption is a low cost simple and widely used method for treating various toxic materials 5 nowadays nanoadsorbent defined by including nano cavity have received great notice for the removal of pollutant due to their high surface area which is followed higher adsorption capacities recently adsorption using zeolitic materials in nano size has attracted much attention in environmental applications 21 22 moreover extraordinary adsorption catalysis and ion exchange properties of zeolite have found numerous industrial and research applications in the bulk powder form 23 linde type a lta zeolite materials are crystalline compounds with an extremely ordered and open microporous frame consisting of a three dimensional network of sio4 and alo4 tetrahedral 24 lta zeolite is a well known type of zeolitic material in terms of large scale commercial production and application 5 lta zeolite has been described as sodalite cages linked via four membered rings the bounding layout of the sodalite cages leads in the formation of a large central hole known as a super cage after that the lta zeolite is formed by bonding of this central cavity with six similar cavities via an eight ring window of an opening diameter of 4 2å the synthetic lta zeolite has a si al ratio of 1 however higher ratios up to 1 7 may be observed when tetramethylammonium is used as starting materials in the synthesis of lta zeolite 5 to enhance the adsorption capacity lta zeolite nanoparticles may be subjected to a sequence of processes in order to modify its surface which can be done using a cationic surfactant by modification of zeolites with cationic surfactant a positive functional group was created on the external surfaces and the charge density was changed to positive side therefore such zeolite will be appropriate for adsorption of negatively charged materials such as cyanide 25 generally hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hdtmab is applied for this purpose which is a quaternary amine with a long chain cationic surfactant 26 recently interest in the adsorption of anions and non polar molecules on surface modified zeolites has increased for example the adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbons methyltert butylether mtbe btex and other petroleum monoaromatics from contaminated aqueous solutions on granulated natural zeolite nanoparticles modified with surfactant has been studied 27 29 23 the aim of present study was the synthesis of lta zeolite nanoparticles modify of it by hdtmab and then evaluate of their ability for removal of cyanide from aqueous samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals analytical grade chemicals were used for experimental studies nacn hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide hdtmab silicon

preparation of the adsorbent in this study an lta zeolite nanoparticle modified by hdtmab was applied for uptake of cyanide from a synthetic solution in the beginning lta zeolite was synthesized in the laboratory from a homogenized mixture solution of the following molar composition 0 8naoh 5 0hdtmab 3 4sio2 1 0al2o3 370h2o 19 6etoh 6 0iso proh the molecular structure of the lta zeolite is shown in fig 1 31 lta zeolite was crystallised in a sealed polypropylene bottle and then stirred vigorously at 98 c for 3h the lta zeolite nanoparticles were recovered from the mother liquor by centrifugation using a centrifuge sigma 301 159 germany at 12000rpm for 60min next to remove any unreacted materials the lta zeolite nanoparticles powder was dispersed in deionized water by sonication and then centrifugation this procedure was repeated until the ph of the supernatant dropped below 9 the lta zeolite nanoparticles powder was dried at 65 c over night and then calcined at 500 c for 4h in an electrical furnace the heating and cooling order was set at 1 c min to remove the hdtmab molecules 2 4 surface modification of adsorbent the surface modification of lta zeolite nanoparticles was performed using hdtmab briefly 10g of powdered raw synthesis lta zeolite was introduced to 1000ml hdtmab solution and the solution was placed on a shaker hanna hi 157 190m singapore for 24h at 60 c after 24h the modified zeolite was separated by centrifuging of solution at 12000rpm for 5min the modified adsorbent was then washed twice with 100ml of deionized water stirred at 150rpm for 15min and then centrifuged at 12000rpm for 5min the ph of the final solutions was registered and found to be7 0 0 2 next the centrifuged material of modified lta zeolite was dried at 110 c for 24h and kept in a glass container for subsequent use in the adsorption tests 2 5 experiments batch adsorption experiments were conducted in 250ml conical flasks all experiments were conducted at the room temperature expect those meant for the effects of temperature study various experimental parameters such as ph 3 11 temperature 20 60 c adsorbent mass 0 2 1g l initial cyanide concentration 25 50 and 75mg l and contact time 0 120min were investigated at first kinetic of adsorption and effect of initial cyanide concentration on the removal efficiency were performed at ph 7 adsorbent of 0 5g l was introduced into three conical flasks containing the cyanide solution at a concentration of 25 50 and 75mg l these flasks were shaken at 200 rpm at a predetermined time interval the samples were collected filtered through a filter paper 0 45mm whatman germany and then centrifuged the residual cyanide concentration was then determined and removal efficiency was calculated by the following equation 1 removal efficiency c 0 c e c 0 100 where c o and ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cyanide mg l respectively in order to investigate the effect of the solution ph on the removal efficiency 250ml of cyanide solution containing 25mg l cyanide was added to nine flasks and after adding of 0 5g l adsorbent the ph adjusted at 3 11 then these flasks were shaken at 200rpm till the equilibrium was reached after equilibrium time the samples was subsequently filtered and centrifuged before the final cyanide concentration was measured after determination of the equilibrium time initial cyanide concentration and solution ph the effects of adsorbent mass and temperature was investigated finally the parameters of the kinetic thermodynamic and isotherm models were determined by resultant of contact time temperature and adsorbent mass respectively 2 6 determination of zero point charge phzpc the phzpc was determined by adding 0 01m nacl as an electrolyte and 0 1m naoh or 0 1m hcl as ph adjusting agent the 50ml of electrolyte was poured into 9 erlenmeyer flask and the solution ph was adjusted from 2 to 10 lta zeolite nanoparticles 0 5g were added to each flask and the flask were agitated for 48h next the adsorbent was separated by filtration and the final ph of the filtrate was determined by plotting the initial ph value versus the ph value after 48 h agitation one can calculated the phzpc of lta zeolite nanoparticles from the intersection of such plot 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characteristics and morphology the xrd patterns of lta zeolite nanoparticles before and after modification are illustrated in fig 2 a and b respectively it is observed that the both samples exhibited similar patterns indicating that the modification process did not have any noticeable influence on the structural framework of the zeolite furthermore as observed in these two figures the reflection peaks of the lta zeolite at 2θ 8 66 12 60 19 00 21 60 23 90 28 20 and 33 10 ascertain the successful synthesis of a high purity lta zeolite structure 20 32 the bet analysis revealed that the specific surface area of the used medium was relatively high 421m2 g nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of the sample is shown in fig 2 c which is a typical isotherm of microporous materials a steep jump and a large desorption loop were noted in the isotherm the hysteresis loop of the zeolite observed at a high relative pressure p p 0 0 9 1 0 reflecting the inter crystalline voids in the packing of the smaller crystals fig 2 d fig 2 e depicts the sem image of the modified lta zeolite before cyanide adsorption this figure shows the surface morphology of the synthesized lta zeolite it can be observed from the figure that the adsorbent particles were uniformly shaped of small particles grey parts with a size ranging from 60 to170nm in diameter moreover several heterogeneous small pores and cavities dark parts could be noted which are known to provide larger surface area for the contaminant adsorption attributing the feature of well supported adsorbent to the lta zeolite nanoparticles 21 33 our results well demonstrate firstly the interactions between cyanide molecules and lta zeolite after cyanide adsorption fig 2 f some dramatic visual changes were observed in this case the surface of lta adsorbent showed to be less scabrous more brightness and some of formerly existing pores disappeared these changes can be attributed to the adsorption between cyanide molecules onto lta zeolite outer surface and inner the pores same results were found in several studies 21 fig 2 g and h illustrate the ftir spectrum of raw and modified lta zeolite nanoparticles respectively in addition the relevant functional groups of the adsorbent were listed in table 1 the spectrum detected at wavelengths of 400 4000cm1 shows the secondary building units of zeolitic structures such as double rings and pore opening 34 35 for example the ftir spectra of the vibration of t o bending at 475 42cm 1 double ring at 576 68cm 1 and the to4 asymmetric stretch at 1035 7cm 1 are considered as evidences of a zeolitic structure formation the ftir spectrum of prepared lta zeolite was equal and in accordance with those that reported in the literature previously 24 the band noted at around 2800 3000cm 1 in the modified zeolite indicates symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of the ch2 of alkyl chain whereas the band at about 1420 1480cm 1 was specified to the vibration of the trimethyl ammonium quaternary group the elemental structure of the modified lta zeolite nanoparticles is shown in table 2 the si al ratio of the synthesized zeolite as determined by edx spectroscopy was 1 66 which is in the reported range for zeolite na lta compositions the change in si al ratio of the final product may be due to the used template as starting materials in the synthesis of zeolites for example lta zeolite synthesized using tetramethylammonium as template has a si al ratio of about 2 in contrast template free synthesis gives the value of si al 1 20 as a result of increasing si al ratio the thermal and chemical stability of the product is improved remarkably which is of a great interest for various commercial applications in industries 3 2 time concentration profile and kinetic study the results depicted in fig 3 shows that the uptake of cyanide in the early adsorption stage was high which is an interesting property of the adsorbent for practical applications 35 next the removal of solute was increased slowly with the increase in the contact time until a plateau was reached up to 60min for all cyanide concentrations in fact further contact time to over 60min did not raise cyanide uptake and the change in the removal rate remained poor then 60min was considered to be the optimized time in the further tests after equilibrium time 60min the plateau removal efficiencies were 86 4 69 and 58 6 for initial solute concentrations of 25 50 and 75mg l respectively the rapid adsorption rate the initial stage may be due to the greater concentration gradient and more available sites for adsorption for a particular adsorbent mass after adsorbent surface used the interior surface of medium participate in cyanide adsorption and due to slow pore diffusion phenomena a relatively slow process was noted 36 also the results revealed that the removal rate was decreased with an increase in the initial solute concentration this phenomenon can be reasoned that due to the saturation of binding sites onto the adsorbent surface at higher solute concentration more cyanide molecules are left unadsorbed in the solution in other words at a given mass of adsorbents there are an exclusive number of bonding sites which are saturated above a certain concentration of pollutant 34 equilibrium time data was used to identify the mechanism of adsorption such as chemical reaction diffusion control and mass transfer these data were analysed using pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion modified pseudo first order and elovich kinetic models and the related parameters of each model are presented in table 3 linear regression was used to fit the experimental data with the kinetic models the model s fitness was significant as indicated by the coefficient of determination r2 the pseudo first order equation is generally expressed as follows 37 2 d q t d t k 1 q e q t integration of eq 2 at the boundary of qt 0 at t 0 and qt qt at a given time t gives the following 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where qe and qt are the amounts mg g of adsorbate at equilibrium and at a given time t min respectively k 1 is the rate constant min 1 the linear plot of lnqt qe vs t gives k 1 as the slope the general form of the pseudo second order kinetic equation is expressed as follows 38 4 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 where k 2 is the rate constant g mgmin integration of eq 4 at the boundary of qt 0 at t 0 and qt qt at t t rearranging to a linear form gives eq 5 5 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t the values of k 2 and qe can be determined from the slope and the intercept of the t qt vs t plot respectively the modified pseudo first order model which was proposed empirically by yang and al dury 39 and then theoretically derived by azizian and bashiri 40 is given by eq 6 6 d q t d t k m q e q t q e q t integration of eq 6 at the boundary conditions mentioned above leads to the following equation eq 7 7 ln 1 q t q e q t q e k m t the main assumption of the intra particle diffusion model is that film diffusion is negligible and intra particle diffusion is the only rate controlling step the non linear form of the intra particle diffusion model is expressed as follows 41 8 q t k i t 0 5 c where qt is the amount of adsorbate at time t and ki mg g min0 5 is the intra particle rate constant and c mg g is a parameter related to the thickness of the boundary layer by plotting qt vs t 0 5 one can obtain ki from the slope of the linear plot increasing values of ki indicate an increase in the adsorption rate for an adsorption process regarded as controlled by intra particle diffusion only the plot of qt vs t 0 5 should pass through the origin c very close or equal to 0 the non linear shape of the elovich equation is given as follows 9 d q t d t α e β q t rearrangement of eq 9 at the boundary with the same conditions as the pseudo first order and pseudo second order equations gives the linear form of elovich equation as follows 10 q t 1 β ln α β 1 β ln t where α mg g min is the initial sorption rate and the parameter β g mg corresponds to the extent of surface coverage and the activation energy for chemisorption as can be seen from table 2 the equilibrium data were exactly fitted to all kinetic models with higher correlation coefficient for the pseudo second order kinetic model for the pseudo first order model the accordance between experimentally observed uptake and that calculated from this model was poor moreover the r2 values obtained for this model was found to be below 0 990 for all cyanide concentrations for pseudo second order model the calculated uptake values agree well with the experimental values combined to the high r2 values obtained 0 990 the highest correlation coefficient obtained from pseudo second order model indicates the applicability of this model to fit the experimental kinetic data for the present system the rate constants for the pseudo second order model by the modified zeolite nanoparticles was decreased non linearly from 0 0101 to 0 0021g mg min with increase in initial cyanide concentrations from 25 to 75mg l respectively it is important to point for strict surface adsorption the relationship between the initial solute concentration and the rate of adsorption is linear and non linear relationship between solute concentration and adsorption rate may be due to the pore diffusion limits 42 to investigate whether the intraparticle diffusion is the rate limiting step the data were tested by using the intraparticle diffusion model 21 if such curve passes through the origin c 0 the intraparticle diffusion will be the rate determining step in the present work the value of c was not zero indicating that intraparticle diffusion was not rate controlling step furthermore high value of ki confirmed the rapid transfer of adsorption at the first stage of contact times 3 3 influence of ph the solution ph plays a key role in the control of the surface charge and functional groups of an adsorbent the solution ph was adjusted from ph 2 10 to investigate the effect of it on cyanide uptake rate fig 4 which indicates that cyanide removal is highly ph dependent high sorption of cyanide occurs at an initial ph value of 7 further experiments performed beyond ph of 7 hampered the removal efficiency this is due to the repulsion forces between the negative charge cyanide molecules and the negative charged adsorbent surface with surplus oh ions in addition the final solution ph was found to increase with decreasing cyanide adsorption this can be attributed to the cyanide species in an alkaline or acidic environment in acid solution several parts of cyanide is in the form of hydrogen cyanide weak acid with dissolution constant of 4 8 10 10 and therefore in an alkaline solution it dissociated into its ions therefore by decreasing the solution ph the removal efficiency also decreases due to the formation of hydrogen cyanide and the final solution ph increases due to the lower dissociation constant of hydrogen cyanide 43 the role of ph in the adsorption process can be attributed to electrostatic interactions between the solute anions in the solution and the surface charge of modified lta zeolite furthermore this study revealed that the phpzc of the lta zeolite nanoparticles was found to be 8 when the solution ph was below the phzpc of 8 the cyanide anions were retained by the positively charged surface of modified lta zeolite due to the protonation of the hydroxyapatite hydroxyl groups thus favouring cyanide accumulation on the surface as the ph decreased below phzpc of 8 the surface charge of used adsorbent became more positive hence more cyanide anions were attracted to the surface increasing the adsorption capacity at ph values above the phzpc of 8 adsorption of cyanide was decreased because the surface of the adsorbent was negatively charged owing to deprotonating of the hydroxyapatite hydroxyl groups this reaction created a mutual repulsion between the cyanide anions and the oh anions our results were in accordance with those reported in literature 44 conversely some cyanide uptake was observed at ph phzpc it may not to be for electrostatic attraction but due to a chemical interaction with sufficient energy to overcome the surface cyanide repulsion forces 44 furthermore relatively high removal efficiency determined at ph near neutral leads to the favourable and environment friendly adsorption of cyanide onto lta zeolite 3 4 influence of the adsorbent mass adsorbent mass is another key factor in the adsorption process in present work the effect of adsorbent mass was studied in the range of 0 2 1g l fig 5 the removal uptake increased from 58 to 99 9 as the adsorbent dosage increased from 0 2 to 1g l ph 8 and an initial cyanide concentration of 25mg l this may be described by the fact that with an increase in the number of active sites a greater amount of cyanide can be adsorbed furthermore it was determined that with increasing adsorbent dosage from 0 2 to 1g l the cyanide adsorption capacity also increases from 20 to 31 25mg g in addition the removal rate of cyanide was 99 5 when utilizing 1g l adsorbent dose this demonstrated that lta zeolite can be employed as a potential eco friendly material for removal of cyanide from wastewater the present findings seem to be consistent with those of noroozifar et al 43 and deveci et al 44 who found that the cyanide removal efficiency increases with increasing dosage of modified natrolite zeolite iron oxyhydroxide and metal impregnated granular activated carbon 3 5 thermodynamic study the values of enthalpy δh entropy change δs free energy change δg kj mol and the thermodynamic nature of the adsorption process were calculated from the slopes and the intercepts of the linear plot of ln k d vs 1 t based on the following equation 41 11 ln k d δ h r t δ s r where k d is the distribution coefficient r is the universal gas constant 8 314jmol 1 k 1 and t is the absolute temperature k the values of the free energy change δg kj mol were calculated using the following equation 12 δ g r t ln k d the negative values of δh 434kj mol demonstrate the exothermic adsorption in nature which supports the idea that adsorption of cyanide onto used adsorbent is primarily physisorption and that the resulting adsorption complex is energetically stable 36 the positive values of δs 5 32kj molk showed that the randomness of the system increased during the sorption process the values of δg were 1119 1185 1236 1287 and 1333 for 293 303 313 323 and 333k respectively these negative values indicated that the sorption of cyanide was thermodynamically spontaneous in addition the absolute δg values tended to be more negative with respect to the increase in temperature from 293to 333k 20 60 c and this is additional proof of the exothermic adsorption of cyanide onto the present adsorbent material 42 3 6 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium data were analysed by two parameters freundlich langmuir and temkin isotherm models the langmuir model assumed a homogenous surface energy distribution on adsorbent surface it works reasonably well for describing ions that only binds through adsorption mechanisms accordingly most anions conform to the langmuir equation as the langmuir equation only predicts adsorption phenomena it only allows a finite amount of material to be retained on the surface the non linear eq 13 and linear eq 14 shapes of the langmuir model are described as follows 13 q e q m b c e 1 b c e 14 c e q e c e q m 1 q m b where q e is the equilibrium amount of adsorbate mg g c e is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l q m is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and b l mg is the langmuir constant the values of q m and b presented in table 3 were calculated from the slopes and intercepts of the linear langmuir plots of c e q e versusc e and listed in table 3 the important feature of the langmuir model can be described based on the dimensionless separation factor r l parameter as expressed by eq 15 15 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 and b are the initial cyanide concentration and langmuir constant respectively adsorption is unfavourable for r l 1 linear for r l 1 favourable for 0 r l 1 and irreversible for r l 0 the other most common isotherm model is the freundlich model which is appropriate for heterogeneous systems this model is expressed by eqs 16 and 17 16 q e k f c e 1 n 17 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where q e is the amount of adsorbate mg g c e is the equilibrium concentration of adsorbate mg l and kf mg g l mg 1 n and 1 n are the freundlich constants associated to adsorption intensity and adsorption capacity respectively 8 a high value of k f is characteristic of a high affinity of the adsorbate for favourable adsorption the value of the freundlich constant n should be in the 1 10 range the values of kf and 1 n presented in table 3 were obtained from the slopes and intercepts of the linear freundlich plots of lnq e versus lnc e the temkin isotherm is also available for heterogeneous adsorption of the adsorbate onto a surface the non linear and linear forms of the temkin model are given by eqs 18 and 19 18 q e r t b 1 ln k t c e 19 q e b 1 ln k t b 1 ln c e where b 1 rt b 1 b 1 is the adsorption heat kj mol and k t is the equilibrium binding constant l g corresponding to the maximum binding energy a high value of b 1 indicates fast sorption of adsorbate at the initial stage similarly a low value of k t is related to the weak bonding of the adsorbate onto a medium by plotting q e vs ln c e one can deduce b 1 and k t from the slope and the intercept of the curve respectively the results calculated for each model and the corresponding parameters are listed in table 4 the validation of adsorption isotherm models was measured by determination of the two mathematical parameters the regression coefficient r2 and the variance deviation between experimental values of qe and models prediction of qe as shown in this table all of the used models correlated well with the experimental data r2 0 95 in the following order langmuir freundlich temkin the higher values of r2 indicated that the langmuir model was more suitable for fitting of the cyanide equilibrium data onto modified lta zeolite adsorbent with the maximum adsorption capacity found to be 24 09mg g these findings enlighten monolayer adsorption of cyanide onto homogenous surfaces sites of the used adsorbent 45 the favorability of cyanide sorption onto lta zeolite can be confirmed from the values of langmuir and freundlich constants b and n which were found to be 0 80 and 3 46 respectively for favourite adsorption process the n is the range 1 10 demonstrating that the stronger binding sites are occupied first and that the binding strength decreases with increasing degree of site occupation 37 the temkin isotherm is also suitable for heterogeneous adsorption of a solute onto a surface a high value of b 1 indicates slow sorption of adsorbate at the initial stage whereas a high value of k t is related to the strong bonding of the adsorbate onto a medium based on this assumption the adsorption heat was found to be approximately 2 86kj mol however the correlation coefficients of the temkin isotherm model appeared to be lower than those of the langmuir and freundlich models table 5 compares the maximum adsorption capacity of the present adsorbent and some recently used adsorbent for the removal of cyanide from aqueous solutions except for activated carbon qm 24 10mg g the present adsorbent material had higher sorption capacity compared to the other adsorbents given in this table these findings reveal that the modified lta zeolite nanoparticle is an efficient adsorbent for the removal of cyanide from an aqueous solution this adsorbent could be utilized in the adsorption systems to make value added product and eco friendly which could be remediate cyanide in wastewater 4 conclusion lta zeolite nanoparticles modified with hdtmab seemed to be an efficient adsorbent material for cyanide removal from a contaminated aqueous solution the characterisation investigation indicated the formation of high purity adsorbent with a size range of 60 170nm tthe bet plot analysis demonstrated that the adsorbent is a mesoporosity material with the high surface area 421m2 g the adsorption process appears to be dependent on the ph in the range of 5 11 with the optimum ph value below 7 sorption isotherm is described by the langmuir equation and the maximum sorption capacity reaches up to 24mg l in addition pseudo second order was the best fitting equation with the experimental kinetic data these findings demonstrated a chemosorption monolayer adsorption of cyanide onto homogenous active sites of the lta zeolite nanoparticles thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption process of cyanide is an exothermic reaction through the results obtained from the present study lta zeolite nanoparticles modified with hdtmab has a promising novel application in the removal of cyanide from the tertiary stage of wastewater treatment acknowledgment we acknowledge the iranian nanotechnology initiative council inic

14602,the combinations of treatment processes are one of the hot topics in environmental engineering especially the highly polluted wastewater can be treated effectively using combined processes the objective of the present study was to investigate the treatment performance of brewery wastewater using electrocoagulation ec ultrasonication us and sono electrocoagulation sec processes a cross flow membrane system was integrated to succeed continuous treatment the effect of electrode combination fe and al current density 50 100a m2 ph 5 0 9 0 and operating time 0 60min on the treatment of wastewater were investigated to obtain maximum treatment efficiency the maximum removal efficiencies of color and chemical oxygen demand cod were obtained as 99 2 and 60 5 respectively at the electrode combination of al al current density of 100a m2 ph 7 0 and reaction time of 60min in order to improve treatment quality a cross flow membrane process was integrated to the sono electrocoagulation process nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes were tested the combined sono assisted electrocoagulation and membrane system supplied 100 color and 90 8 cod removal efficiency when supported with ro membrane the results indicated that the proposed integrated process supplied higher pollutant removal compared to the alone electrocoagulation and sonication process operating cost of the combined process was calculated as 1 83 m3 moreover the genotoxic effect of brewery wastewater was also assessed by comet assay before and after treatment this process can be used to treat a different kind of wastewater as an efficient technique keywords electrocoagulation ultrasonication sono electrocoagulation membrane process brewery wastewater genotoxicity 1 introduction wastewater contains various kinds of pollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides dyes and organic pollutants most of these substances may cause ecological risk to aquatic environment this ecological risk is potentially genotoxicity toxicity and extinction 1 therefore these substances must be removed from wastewater before discharge or reuse ecological risk of these pollutants does not only depend on their concentrations but also their metabolites and degradation products effluents from wastewater treatment present lower toxicity than the corresponding influent thus the genotoxicity of water pollutants should be an important matter of study in the field of wastewater treatment 2 so scientists should increase these studies that contain detecting genotoxic risk of pollutants in aquatic environment industrial wastewater characteristics can be variable and wastewater must be treated before being discharged to any receiving environment 3 the brewery industry use large quantities of water and produce huge amounts of wastewater 4 the typical brewery industry produces 3 10l wastewater per liter of beer 5 it mostly contains sugars soluble starch ethanol volatile fatty acids and suspended solids 6 therefore to make dischargeable of brewery wastewaters has become an important issue to protect environment 7 so far conventional treatment methods such as anaerobic packed bed reactor 8 anaerobic membrane bioreactor 9 coagulation flocculation 10 microalgae 11 microbial fuel cells 12 aerobic granulation 13 and electrocoagulation 14 have been applied for brewery wastewater treatment electrocoagulation ec is one of the important technology that combines the advantages of conventional coagulation flotation and adsorption in water and wastewater treatment 15 process depends on dissolution of the anode electrode oxidation reactions take place on anode while reduction reactions occur on cathode 16 iron and aluminum metals are the most used electrode materials because they are cheap effective and easy to find 17 electrocoagulation offers many advantages over traditional treatment processes such as easy operation simple equipment low capital operating costs and relatively low amount of sludge generation 18 ultrasonication us is transmitted to the material by waves that compress and stretch its molecules when the negative pressure is large enough to disrupt the distance between the molecules of the liquid the cavitation bubbles are created 19 the collapse of these bubbles may generate very high temperatures and pressures and these conditions will cause the breakdown of the water molecules inside the cavitation bubbles these conditions will cause the breakdown of the water molecules inside the cavitation bubbles therefore the sonolytical cleavage of water molecules produces reactive ohradicals that are non selective oxidants for organic pollutants in wastewater 20 21 the sono electrochemical sec process consists of ultrasound us and electrochemical ec techniques this process enhances radicals production from ultrasound therefore higher reaction rate and pollutant degradation can be achieved 22 moreover ultrasound irritation affects particle size solubilization formation of refractory compounds and organic material structure 23 to set up continuous treatment process a cross flow membrane system can be integrated with different types of processes it is well known that membrane technology has been proved to be an efficient way to purify wastewater for recycle or reuse 24 29 the quality of organism s life is dependent on the environment when the large amounts of pollutants are released into the environment they may lead to some adverse effects on organisms moreover the adverse effects may be genotoxic which damages dna molecule due to presence of genotoxins in the environment it is important to evaluate the genotoxic effects on organisms the aquatic environment has ecological risk because of genotoxic agents such as chemicals pesticides nanoparticles factory wastes 30 31 several tests are used to assess genotoxicity in aquatic environment micronucleus and comet assay have been commonly used for the evaluation of dna damage comet assay shows dna single and double strand breaks 32 33 in recent years integrated processes have been intensively investigated to increase the efficiency of wastewater treatment 34 37 the main novelty of this work is to enhance a synergistic effect with combined sono electrocoagulation sec process integrated to cross flow membrane cfm process for further removal of color and cod the effects of several operating parameters such as electrode combination fe and al current density 50 100a m2 ph 5 0 9 0 and operating time 0 60min were tested the effect of membrane type nf and ro was also investigated moreover the genotoxic effect of brewery wastewater was assessed by comet assay before and after brewery wastewater treatment tejedor sanz et al proposed the integration of two electrochemical techniques as an electrocoagulation ec and a microbial electrochemical fluidized bed reactor me fbr to treat brewery effluents it was reported that the soluble organic matter was oxidized 88 of the cod using a fluidized anode at 25a m current density when ec process was integrated with me fbr 38 bani melhem and edward smith investigated the performance of an integrated process consisting of an electro coagulation ec unit and a submerged membrane bioreactor smbr to treat grey water it was shown that integrating ec process with smbr ec smbr improved the overall performance of the membrane filtration process and up to 13 reduction in membrane fouling was achieved by ec smbr process 39 2 materials and methods 2 1 brewery wastewater characterization the

reverse osmosis sw30 membranes were used for further color and cod removal from brewery wastewater nf270 and sw30 membranes were provided from dow filmtec according to the manufacturers the nf270 and sw30 membranes have molecular weight cutoffs of approximately 200 400 and 100da respectively previous studies have provided information regarding the characterization on these membranes 40 41 the membranes were wetted in deionized water overnight and compacted by deionized water for 3h at room temperature 2 3 continuous reactor setup the experimental set up scheme for the combined sec process

calibrated against platinum cobalt pt co method the unit of color being that produced by 1mg platinum l in the form of the chloroplatinate ion 42 2 4 3 operating cost of the combined process operating cost is an important parameter for industrial wastewater treatment high charge loading can be option for desirable effluent water quality although charge loading effects energy consumption power

supplied from human blood lymphocytes that were centrifuge with histopaque 1077 this culture media was set up by adding 0 5ml lymphocyte suspension in 4 5ml of rpmi fetal calf serum penicillin streptomycin l glutamine phytohemagglutinin comet assay was used to evaluate genotoxicity cells were incubated at 37 c for 72h with brewery wastewater before and after treatment sterile water was used as negative control cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide as positive control for 3h after exposed comet assay was performed according to tice et al 33 all procedures were carried out in dark to prevent dna damage these slides were stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed with a confocal microscope according to the length of the tail the dna damage in cells was classified by assigning a score of from 0 to iv type 0 corresponds to intact cells type i corresponds to cells with low level damage type ii is medium level damage type iii is high level damage and type iv is cells with complete damage 43 a genetic damage index gdi and the extent of dna damage were estimated for each subject 44 45 3 results and discussion brewery wastewater treatment experiments were systematically performed to compare the us and ec processes in a batch and continuous mode a cross flow membrane system was integrated to sec processes to obtain continuous treatment system the obtained results are discussed below in the relevant sections 3 1 comparison of process efficiency in this study the process efficiency of the us ec and sec were tested and compared for the removal percentage of color and cod with a current density 75a m2 ph 7 0 electrode combination al al inter electrode distance 2cm reaction time 60min and ultrasonic frequency 37khz the color and cod removals were about 7 7 96 7 98 2 fig 2 a and 2 7 46 5 53 7 fig 2b for the us ec and sec processes respectively it can be concluded from the results that the individual us process did not supply reasonable removal of color and cod the individual ec process supplied high color removal but moderate cod removal the main reason of efficiency increasing for sec process may be due to regeneration of new electrode surface by dynamic cavitation and or micro streaming effect during the sonication process 28 the other reason was probably enhancing bridge between coagulants and pollutants by increasing the mixing efficiency to support collisions frequency 28 29 as a result cod removal efficiency was improved by sec combined process compared with individual us and ec process 3 2 optimization of operating parameters for the sec process at batch mode 3 2 1 effect of electrode combination the chemical reactions observed in the ec process for aluminum and iron electrodes are as follow 46 47 for aluminum electrodes a l s a l

al electrode arrangements were studied and the results are presented in fig 3 the anode cathode materials had an evident impact on the color and cod removal the color and cod removals were about 92 4 93 7 96 7 98 2 fig 3a and 42 0 46 1 50 8 53 7 fig 3b by the anode cathode electrode arrangements of fe al al fe fe fe and al al respectively the sacrificial al al electrode combination supplied the highest pollutant removal for this reason all the sec experiments were conducted using the al al electrode 3 2 2 effect of ph it is well known that the ph has a remarkable influence on the performance of ec and sec process the effect of ph on the removal efficiencies of color and cod was investigated with the ph values in the range of 5 0 9 0 using aluminum electrodes constant current density and electrode distance were 75a m2 and 2cm respectively the results of color and cod removal efficiencies as a function of ph is demonstrated in fig 4 it can be noticed that ph of the wastewater affected removal efficiencies the color and cod removal efficiencies increased from 83 1 to 98 2 fig 4a and from 29 1 to 53 7 fig 4b respectively when ph increased from 5 0 to 7 0 the highest color and cod removal efficiencies were obtained in neutral media ph 7 0 with al electrodes however the color and cod removal efficiencies decreased from 98 2 to 95 4 and from 53 7 to 45 3 respectively when ph increased from 7 0 to 9 0 it could be seen that coagulation decreased at lower and higher ph values aluminum ions produced by ec process can form monomeric and polymeric aluminum hydroxide complex depending on ph scale 48 the monomeric and polymeric aluminum complexes such as al oh 3 al oh 2 al2 oh 2 4 al6 oh 15 3 al7 oh 17 4 al8 oh 20 4 and al13 oh 34 5 are effective coagulants between ph 5 0 and 8 5 49 at higher ph values both cathode and anode may be chemically attacked by oh ions and the solubility of al oh 3 will increase to form al oh 4 which is ineffective in wastewater treatment 26 50 however the previous studies showed that the treatment efficiency was higher for aluminum electrode when ph was below 8 0 51 52 3 2 3 effect of current density current density is another important parameter which affects process rate coagulant dosage bubble properties of flocks in the ec and sec process 53 the color and cod removal efficiencies were increased in the range of 96 7 99 2 fig 5 a and 37 2 60 5 fig 5b at current density of 50 100a m2 fig 5 the current density was selected as 100a m2 it was reported that the removal efficiency of organic pollutant increased as the current density increased 54 according to faraday s law the amount of dissolved electrode increases with the increasing current density in the ec process this provides increasing of aluminum solubility rate and more al oh 3 reacts with further pollutant amount in addition us process might induce the formation of hydroxyl radicals which increased color and cod removal 55 56 3 3 continuous mode treatment studies the continuous treatment studies were carried out after determining of the optimum conditions in batch studies optimum conditions were determined as current density of 100a m2 initial ph of 7 0 electrode distance of 2cm ultrasound frequency of 37khz and reaction time of 60min the average removal efficiency for color and cod at these conditions were found as 99 2 and 60 5 for al al electrode in batch reactor respectively the sec batch process was integrated to cfm process to obtain continuous treatment nf and ro membranes were used in the membrane system the color and cod were analyzed by taking samples at 30min intervals during the continuous treatment studies brewery wastewater was fed to sec reactor with a flow rate of 800ml h the permeate flux was calculated at 5min internals 3 3 1 change of color and cod during continuous studies the change of color and cod removal efficiencies in continuous operation is shown in fig 6 membrane system was operated 24h and color and cod were measured in membrane permeate it was determined that total color removal efficiency by membranes was 99 7 for nf270 membrane and 100 for sw30 membrane in continuous mode fig 6a it should be remembered that the color removal efficiency was 99 2 in batch mode of sec process the cod concentration of raw wastewater was 6840mg l the cod concentration of membrane permeate was measured as 2560mg l and 630mg l for nf270 and sw30 membranes at the end of the operating time respectively accordingly it was determined that total cod removal efficiency by membranes was 62 6 for nf270 membrane and 90 8 for sw30 membrane in continuous mode fig 6b it should be remembered that the cod removal efficiency was 60 5 in batch mode of sec process it can be seen that removal efficiency by nanofiltration appeared to be close to sec process the results showed that the size of dissolved organic molecules was smaller than nf270 membrane pore size 200 400da however sw30 membrane showed better performance than nf270 in terms of cod removal efficiency it can be said that the size of most dissolved organic molecules in brewery wastewater was in the range of 100 400da for this study moreover flux analyses were performed to determine the relationship between untreated organic molecules during the sec process and membrane fouling 3 3 2 change of flux during continuous studies the wastewater pretreated with sec process was filtered using nf270 and sw30 membranes and permeate flux was calculated initial drop occurred in the permeate flux within first 60min with nf270 fig 7 the initial flux was 115l m2 h and the flux reached a pseudo steady state condition after 60min steady state permeate flux value was 22l m2 h however the initial flux was 33l m2 h when sw30 membrane was combined to the system the flux reached a pseudo steady state condition within 30min and steady state permeate flux was 13l m2 h the membranes were chemically cleaned with naoh 0 1n every 6h the flux results showed that the nf270 membrane lost its flux seriously and organic or inorganic fouling blocked more rapidly than the bw30 membrane dissolved aluminum ions or aluminum hydroxide incoming from the sec process might have caused the inorganic fouling or scaling 3 4 genotoxicity of brewery wastewater in fact many components i e sugars soluble starch ethanol volatile fatty acids and suspended solids in aquatic environment may be toxic or genotoxic on livings depending of the concentration and nature of the components ethanol is a major ingredient of alcoholic drinks and ability of ethanol to damage dna was exhibited in different studies and tissues 57 additionally fatty acids can alter leukocytes neutrophils eosinophils basophils lymphocytes and monocytes function and higher concentrations of certain acids like volatile fatty acids can cause cell death via apoptosis or necrosis 58 moreover it is possible that main component or degradation products provoke genetic alterations concerning fertilization the dna of the cells may be damaged due to genotoxic stress the damaged dna migrates at a different rate than undamaged dna in the electric field gel electrophoresis if the cells have the dna strand break the strand breaks migrate away from the undamaged dna containing nucleoid body the dna strand breaks lead to tail formation the percentage of dna in the tail shows magnitude of damaged consequently the dna strand breaks caused by an agent can be evaluated and compared with negative control known as non genotoxic and positive control known as genotoxic for this reason genotoxic effect of the brewery wastewater was evaluated before and after treatment process our results showed that brewery wastewater did not exhibit genotoxic effect after treatment if the livings in aquatic environment expose to pollutants for long time they may fall with different hazards such as extinction and genetic alterations for fertilization cell incubated with treated brewery wastewater did not show an increase in the dna damage compared to other exposed cells table 2 except for positive control the results obtained from all tested concentrations are similar to the results of the negative control fig 8 consequently our proposed treatment system effectively reduces the water genotoxicity from the brewery wastewater 3 5 operating cost of the combined process for the optimum operating conditions consumption of electrode and energy are given in table 3 energy consumption values are estimated by considering the conditions in table 4 the energy costs for the ec and sec process were 0 945 and 0 983 m3 respectively however the energy costs for the sec integrated with cfm process was 1 137 m3 the total costs for the ec sec and sec cfm combined process were as 0 994 1 032 and 1 830 m3 respectively it can be clearly seen that high recovery efficiency is achieved even after 20min fig 6 it is known that the reaction time will reduce the operating cost however extension of sec period promoted further cod removal for this reason the relationship between soluble organic matter and membrane fouling needs to be investigated more deeply and the optimum retention time should be determined to save energy consumption in real application 4 conclusion the present study proposes a continuous treatment process including combined process to treat brewery wastewater the following results were obtained from this study the sec process supplied further color and cod removal from brewery wastewater as compared to the individual us and ec processes the combined sec process ensured 99 2 color and 60 5 cod removal efficiency at ph 7 0 current density of 100a m2 electrode combination of al al and reaction time of 60min a cfm system was integrated to sec process for continuous treatment system the results showed that ro membrane could be operated effectively for advanced treatment and 100 color and 90 8 cod removal efficiencies were achieved by sw30 membrane genotoxicity results showed that brewery wastewater did not exhibit genotoxic effect after treatment the proposed combined process can also be used for the treatment of other wastewater containing cod and color acknowledgment this research was supported by department of scientific research projects of mersin university project number 2015 ap4 1368 
14602,the combinations of treatment processes are one of the hot topics in environmental engineering especially the highly polluted wastewater can be treated effectively using combined processes the objective of the present study was to investigate the treatment performance of brewery wastewater using electrocoagulation ec ultrasonication us and sono electrocoagulation sec processes a cross flow membrane system was integrated to succeed continuous treatment the effect of electrode combination fe and al current density 50 100a m2 ph 5 0 9 0 and operating time 0 60min on the treatment of wastewater were investigated to obtain maximum treatment efficiency the maximum removal efficiencies of color and chemical oxygen demand cod were obtained as 99 2 and 60 5 respectively at the electrode combination of al al current density of 100a m2 ph 7 0 and reaction time of 60min in order to improve treatment quality a cross flow membrane process was integrated to the sono electrocoagulation process nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes were tested the combined sono assisted electrocoagulation and membrane system supplied 100 color and 90 8 cod removal efficiency when supported with ro membrane the results indicated that the proposed integrated process supplied higher pollutant removal compared to the alone electrocoagulation and sonication process operating cost of the combined process was calculated as 1 83 m3 moreover the genotoxic effect of brewery wastewater was also assessed by comet assay before and after treatment this process can be used to treat a different kind of wastewater as an efficient technique keywords electrocoagulation ultrasonication sono electrocoagulation membrane process brewery wastewater genotoxicity 1 introduction wastewater contains various kinds of pollutants such as pharmaceuticals pesticides dyes and organic pollutants most of these substances may cause ecological risk to aquatic environment this ecological risk is potentially genotoxicity toxicity and extinction 1 therefore these substances must be removed from wastewater before discharge or reuse ecological risk of these pollutants does not only depend on their concentrations but also their metabolites and degradation products effluents from wastewater treatment present lower toxicity than the corresponding influent thus the genotoxicity of water pollutants should be an important matter of study in the field of wastewater treatment 2 so scientists should increase these studies that contain detecting genotoxic risk of pollutants in aquatic environment industrial wastewater characteristics can be variable and wastewater must be treated before being discharged to any receiving environment 3 the brewery industry use large quantities of water and produce huge amounts of wastewater 4 the typical brewery industry produces 3 10l wastewater per liter of beer 5 it mostly contains sugars soluble starch ethanol volatile fatty acids and suspended solids 6 therefore to make dischargeable of brewery wastewaters has become an important issue to protect environment 7 so far conventional treatment methods such as anaerobic packed bed reactor 8 anaerobic membrane bioreactor 9 coagulation flocculation 10 microalgae 11 microbial fuel cells 12 aerobic granulation 13 and electrocoagulation 14 have been applied for brewery wastewater treatment electrocoagulation ec is one of the important technology that combines the advantages of conventional coagulation flotation and adsorption in water and wastewater treatment 15 process depends on dissolution of the anode electrode oxidation reactions take place on anode while reduction reactions occur on cathode 16 iron and aluminum metals are the most used electrode materials because they are cheap effective and easy to find 17 electrocoagulation offers many advantages over traditional treatment processes such as easy operation simple equipment low capital operating costs and relatively low amount of sludge generation 18 ultrasonication us is transmitted to the material by waves that compress and stretch its molecules when the negative pressure is large enough to disrupt the distance between the molecules of the liquid the cavitation bubbles are created 19 the collapse of these bubbles may generate very high temperatures and pressures and these conditions will cause the breakdown of the water molecules inside the cavitation bubbles these conditions will cause the breakdown of the water molecules inside the cavitation bubbles therefore the sonolytical cleavage of water molecules produces reactive ohradicals that are non selective oxidants for organic pollutants in wastewater 20 21 the sono electrochemical sec process consists of ultrasound us and electrochemical ec techniques this process enhances radicals production from ultrasound therefore higher reaction rate and pollutant degradation can be achieved 22 moreover ultrasound irritation affects particle size solubilization formation of refractory compounds and organic material structure 23 to set up continuous treatment process a cross flow membrane system can be integrated with different types of processes it is well known that membrane technology has been proved to be an efficient way to purify wastewater for recycle or reuse 24 29 the quality of organism s life is dependent on the environment when the large amounts of pollutants are released into the environment they may lead to some adverse effects on organisms moreover the adverse effects may be genotoxic which damages dna molecule due to presence of genotoxins in the environment it is important to evaluate the genotoxic effects on organisms the aquatic environment has ecological risk because of genotoxic agents such as chemicals pesticides nanoparticles factory wastes 30 31 several tests are used to assess genotoxicity in aquatic environment micronucleus and comet assay have been commonly used for the evaluation of dna damage comet assay shows dna single and double strand breaks 32 33 in recent years integrated processes have been intensively investigated to increase the efficiency of wastewater treatment 34 37 the main novelty of this work is to enhance a synergistic effect with combined sono electrocoagulation sec process integrated to cross flow membrane cfm process for further removal of color and cod the effects of several operating parameters such as electrode combination fe and al current density 50 100a m2 ph 5 0 9 0 and operating time 0 60min were tested the effect of membrane type nf and ro was also investigated moreover the genotoxic effect of brewery wastewater was assessed by comet assay before and after brewery wastewater treatment tejedor sanz et al proposed the integration of two electrochemical techniques as an electrocoagulation ec and a microbial electrochemical fluidized bed reactor me fbr to treat brewery effluents it was reported that the soluble organic matter was oxidized 88 of the cod using a fluidized anode at 25a m current density when ec process was integrated with me fbr 38 bani melhem and edward smith investigated the performance of an integrated process consisting of an electro coagulation ec unit and a submerged membrane bioreactor smbr to treat grey water it was shown that integrating ec process with smbr ec smbr improved the overall performance of the membrane filtration process and up to 13 reduction in membrane fouling was achieved by ec smbr process 39 2 materials and methods 2 1 brewery wastewater characterization the brewery wastewater was supplied from anadolu efes beer factory located in adana turkey the specific characteristics of the brewery industry are shown in table 1 h2so4 0 1n and naoh 0 1n were used to adjust the ph value all chemicals were purchased from merck and sigma aldrich company the solutions were prepared with deionized water millipore direct q3uv 2 2 membranes nanofiltration nf270 and reverse osmosis sw30 membranes were used for further color and cod removal from brewery wastewater nf270 and sw30 membranes were provided from dow filmtec according to the manufacturers the nf270 and sw30 membranes have molecular weight cutoffs of approximately 200 400 and 100da respectively previous studies have provided information regarding the characterization on these membranes 40 41 the

density increased 54 according to faraday s law the amount of dissolved electrode increases with the increasing current density in the ec process this provides increasing of aluminum solubility rate and more al oh 3 reacts with further pollutant amount in addition us process might induce the formation of hydroxyl radicals which increased color and cod removal 55 56 3 3 continuous mode treatment studies the continuous treatment studies were carried out after determining of the optimum conditions in batch studies optimum conditions were determined as current density of 100a m2 initial ph of 7 0 electrode distance of 2cm ultrasound frequency of 37khz and reaction time of 60min the average removal efficiency for color and cod at these conditions were found as 99 2 and 60 5 for al al electrode in batch reactor respectively the sec batch process was integrated to cfm process to obtain continuous treatment nf and ro membranes were used in the membrane system the color and cod were analyzed by taking samples at 30min intervals during the continuous treatment studies brewery wastewater was fed to sec reactor with a flow rate of 800ml h the permeate flux was calculated at 5min internals 3 3 1 change of color and cod during continuous studies the change of color and cod removal efficiencies in continuous operation is shown in fig 6 membrane system was operated 24h and color and cod were measured in membrane permeate it was determined that total color removal efficiency by membranes was 99 7 for nf270 membrane and 100 for sw30 membrane in continuous mode fig 6a it should be remembered that the color removal efficiency was 99 2 in batch mode of sec process the cod concentration of raw wastewater was 6840mg l the cod concentration of membrane permeate was measured as 2560mg l and 630mg l for nf270 and sw30 membranes at the end of the operating time respectively accordingly it was determined that total cod removal efficiency by membranes was 62 6 for nf270 membrane and 90 8 for sw30 membrane in continuous mode fig 6b it should be remembered that the cod removal efficiency was 60 5 in batch mode of sec process it can be seen that removal efficiency by nanofiltration appeared to be close to sec process the results showed that the size of dissolved organic molecules was smaller than nf270 membrane pore size 200 400da however sw30 membrane showed better performance than nf270 in terms of cod removal efficiency it can be said that the size of most dissolved organic molecules in brewery wastewater was in the range of 100 400da for this study moreover flux analyses were performed to determine the relationship between untreated organic molecules during the sec process and membrane fouling 3 3 2 change of flux during continuous studies the wastewater pretreated with sec process was filtered using nf270 and sw30 membranes and permeate flux was calculated initial drop occurred in the permeate flux within first 60min with nf270 fig 7 the initial flux was 115l m2 h and the flux reached a pseudo steady state condition after 60min steady state permeate flux value was 22l m2 h however the initial flux was 33l m2 h when sw30 membrane was combined to the system the flux reached a pseudo steady state condition within 30min and steady state permeate flux was 13l m2 h the membranes were chemically cleaned with naoh 0 1n every 6h the flux results showed that the nf270 membrane lost its flux seriously and organic or inorganic fouling blocked more rapidly than the bw30 membrane dissolved aluminum ions or aluminum hydroxide incoming from the sec process might have caused the inorganic fouling or scaling 3 4 genotoxicity of brewery wastewater in fact many components i e sugars soluble starch ethanol volatile fatty acids and suspended solids in aquatic environment may be toxic or genotoxic on livings depending of the concentration and nature of the components ethanol is a major ingredient of alcoholic drinks and ability of ethanol to damage dna was exhibited in different studies and tissues 57 additionally fatty acids can alter leukocytes neutrophils eosinophils basophils lymphocytes and monocytes function and higher concentrations of certain acids like volatile fatty acids can cause cell death via apoptosis or necrosis 58 moreover it is possible that main component or degradation products provoke genetic alterations concerning fertilization the dna of the cells may be damaged due to genotoxic stress the damaged dna migrates at a different rate than undamaged dna in the electric field gel electrophoresis if the cells have the dna strand break the strand breaks migrate away from the undamaged dna containing nucleoid body the dna strand breaks lead to tail formation the percentage of dna in the tail shows magnitude of damaged consequently the dna strand breaks caused by an agent can be evaluated and compared with negative control known as non genotoxic and positive control known as genotoxic for this reason genotoxic effect of the brewery wastewater was evaluated before and after treatment process our results showed that brewery wastewater did not exhibit genotoxic effect after treatment if the livings in aquatic environment expose to pollutants for long time they may fall with different hazards such as extinction and genetic alterations for fertilization cell incubated with treated brewery wastewater did not show an increase in the dna damage compared to other exposed cells table 2 except for positive control the results obtained from all tested concentrations are similar to the results of the negative control fig 8 consequently our proposed treatment system effectively reduces the water genotoxicity from the brewery wastewater 3 5 operating cost of the combined process for the optimum operating conditions consumption of electrode and energy are given in table 3 energy consumption values are estimated by considering the conditions in table 4 the energy costs for the ec and sec process were 0 945 and 0 983 m3 respectively however the energy costs for the sec integrated with cfm process was 1 137 m3 the total costs for the ec sec and sec cfm combined process were as 0 994 1 032 and 1 830 m3 respectively it can be clearly seen that high recovery efficiency is achieved even after 20min fig 6 it is known that the reaction time will reduce the operating cost however extension of sec period promoted further cod removal for this reason the relationship between soluble organic matter and membrane fouling needs to be investigated more deeply and the optimum retention time should be determined to save energy consumption in real application 4 conclusion the present study proposes a continuous treatment process including combined process to treat brewery wastewater the following results were obtained from this study the sec process supplied further color and cod removal from brewery wastewater as compared to the individual us and ec processes the combined sec process ensured 99 2 color and 60 5 cod removal efficiency at ph 7 0 current density of 100a m2 electrode combination of al al and reaction time of 60min a cfm system was integrated to sec process for continuous treatment system the results showed that ro membrane could be operated effectively for advanced treatment and 100 color and 90 8 cod removal efficiencies were achieved by sw30 membrane genotoxicity results showed that brewery wastewater did not exhibit genotoxic effect after treatment the proposed combined process can also be used for the treatment of other wastewater containing cod and color acknowledgment this research was supported by department of scientific research projects of mersin university project number 2015 ap4 1368 
14603,this work presents the preparation of membranes using polycaprolactone pcl a biodegradable polymer incorporating unmodified and modified nanoclay using phase inversion technique the membranes prepared with the incorporation of 0 1g to 0 4g of unmodified nanoclay and 0 05 g to 0 15g of modified nanoclay were studied with respect to porosity hydrophilicity chemistry mechanical and thermal properties and morphological characteristics the results showed that the membrane incorporated with unmodified nanoclay has enhanced strength and porosity compared to the membrane with modified nanoclay and neat pcl an increase in water permeability is shown by the incorporation of unmodified nanoclay and contact angle measurement results revealed an increased hydrophilicity with a decrease in membrane roughness which was confirmed using afm analysis the surface morphology was examined using sem analysis and the results revealed that on adding unmodified nanoclay the average pore size decreased from 6 2μm to 4 5μm and for membranes with modified nanoclay the average pore size was found to be 1μm the prepared membranes were tested for the rejection of congo red and the performance were analysed keywords pcl membrane separation nanoclay hydrophilicity phase inversion 1 introduction membrane science has gained wide acceptance especially for waste water treatment 1 mainly because of its advantages such as low cost energy saving no phase change environmental friendly and high removal efficiency 2 a lot of research works are going on synthetic membranes mainly on polymeric membranes using polysulphone polyethersulphone pvdf etc because of their inherent properties and wide variety of structures even though inorganic materials like ceramics are also often used their large scale applications are limited due to high operation and inherent mechanical fragility 3 today researchers are looking into biodegradable polymers or biopolymers as these polymers causes no harm to the environment with all the properties and durability which are very much enough to compete with the other polymeric materials poly ε caprolactone pcl is a biodegradable polymer having relatively high biodegradability and biocompatibility 4 since pcl dissolves in wide range of organic solvents it can be easily processed using different fabrication techniques due to its low mechanical strength and slow resorption degradation rates 5 different nanofillers are added to enhance its properties sanaz et al 6 has used calcium carbonate nanoparticles to enhance the mechanical and thermal properties of polycaprolactone chitosan blend they had successfully prepared homogenous pcl chitosan nanocomposite with a tensile strength increased to 20 18 0 96mpa and the thermal degradation temperature increases up to 64 c at 1wt of nano sized caco3 content in this study pcl is incorporated with different weight of nanoclay and its mechanical and thermal properties are analyzed the incorporation of nanoclays commonly montmorillonites into polymers significantly increases the mechanical and thermal resistance since such nanofillers display a large surface for interactions with the polymer matrix 7 they also possess dimensional stability in two dimensions rather than one 8 many research results confirms the enhancement in these properties with the incorporation of clay on to pcl as well as pcl based blends and these were mostly utilized for biomedical applications 9 10 and also for packaging applications 11 because of its expanding properties clays are inherently hydrophilic in nature it absorbs water molecules within the clay layers 12 and thereby it enhances the hydrophilicity of the polymer this property of clay makes it to use as nanofiller in the polymeric composite membranes for waste water treatment applications apart from these characteristics nanoclays are easily available with a variety of surface and structural properties and of low cost biopolymers incorporated with nanofillers forms nano biocomposites with improved biodegradability and eco toxicity 13 the objective of this study is to fabricate pcl membranes loaded with unmodified and modified montmorillonite using phase inversion technique as the organic modification of montmorillonites increases the compatibility of clay to polymeric systems the effect of modified and unmodified clay on the mechanical and morphological properties of pcl was investigated as well as the water permeability through the membranes was studied the porosity and hydrophilicity enhancements were also examined finally the membranes were analysed for congo red dye rejection from synthetic water in a cross flow filtration unit pcl undergoes hydrolytic degradation within a period of 2 3 years 14 since the average life span of the membranes used in the water treatment applications is 2 3 years they can be replaced with biodegradable pcl membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials poly ε caprolactone purchased from sigma aldrich with a molecular weight of mw 70 000 in pellet form were used as the main membrane forming material n n dimethyl formamide dmf mw 73 09g mol supplied by otto chemie pvt ltd were used as solvent unmodified nanoclay and surface modified nanoclay containing 25 30wt methyl dihydroxy ethyl hydrogenated tallow ammonium was purchased from aldrich chemistry to use as an additive congo red practical grade was purchased from hi media laboratories pvt ltd for the preparation of feed solution other chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade and used as received 2 2 preparation of pcl clay composite membranes initially known weight of nanoclay was dispersed in 10ml of dmf solvent by sonicating it for 15min to produce a homogenous solution then the required quantity of pcl was added to the solution under constant stirring at 250rpm at a temperature of 60 c after removing all the bubbles the homogenous solution was casted on a glass plate using a doctor s blade after leaving it for around 30s the glass plate was immersed into di water bath the polymeric film gets solidified in the bath via phase inversion technique and it was allowed to remain for 24h the membrane formed is dried under ambient conditions until use the compositions of the prepared membranes are given in table 1 and table 2 in the case of incorporating modified nanoclay complete dispersion of the clay in the solvent was not achieved beyond 1 5g 2 3 membrane characterisations 2 3 1 hydrophilicity the hydrophilicity of the prepared membranes was measured by an automated contact angle goniometer equipped by a software controlled dosing system with di water as the liquid di water droplet was placed on the dry membrane surface using a motor driven micro syringe it is very difficult to measure the static contact angle of a porous polymer membrane as the liquid drop rapidly disappears into the pores upon placement on the surface 15 hence the contact angle is measured immediately 10s after the placement of the liquid drop around 3 points were arbitrarily selected on the membrane surface to yield an average value 2 3 2 mechanical strength mechanical strength is one of the important specifications of membranes for pressure driven uf separation processes to guarantee their long duration stable performance 16 tensile strength of the prepared membranes was determined by using a shimadzu ag x plus 10kn universal testing machine according to the astm d 882 standard by applying a crosshead speed of 10mm min all the samples were cut into rectangular pieces with dimensions of 14 2 3cm2 leaving a 10cm gauge length for mechanical loading and vertically mounted in between two mechanical gripping units of the tester the sample thicknesses were measured with an electronic micrometer having a precision of 1μm 3 samples of each membrane was measured to obtain an average value 2 3 3 membrane porosity membrane porosity was calculated based on the volume and the surface area to calculate the volumetric porosity a membrane of 2 2cm2 was cut and immersed into di water for 24h and the weight of the wet membrane and its thickness was measured then the membrane was dried in a vacuum oven at 40 c for 24h and then the dried weight of the membrane was measured the volumetric porosity ε of the membrane was then calculated using the following eq 1 1 ε ww wd d w s l 100 where ww and wd are the weight of the wet and dry membrane g respectively s is the membrane area cm2 l is the wet membrane thickness cm and dw is the water density at room temperature g cm3 together with pore size distribution surface porosity is regarded as a very important parameter 17 surface porosity is calculated using image j software by arbitrarily choosing points on the sem image of the membrane surface percentage surface porosity is calculated using eq 2 2 s u r f a c e p o r o s i t y p o r e a r e a t o t a l a r e a 100 2 3 4 thermo gravimetric analysis thermo gravimetric analysis was carried out for the prepared membranes to determine the weight degradation of neat and composite films tga was performed on a hitachi sta 7200 in which samples of about 10mg were heated in air from 25 c to 500 c at a heating rate of 40 c min 2 3 5 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in order to identify the presence of functional groups of the synthesised membrane ftir spectrum analysis were carried out for neat and composite films using 630 1b diamond atr module using kbr pellets in the range of 4000 400cm 1 2 3 6 morphological characterisations in order to study the dispersion of nanoclay in the pcl matrix the surface morphology of the membranes were characterised by scanning electron microscopy sem model jeol jsm 6360 from the sem results the pore sizes of the membranes were measured using image j software transmission electron microscopy tem measurement was performed with a high resolution jeol jsm 2100 instrument and the stained specimen section was placed in a 200mesh copper grid for observing the dispersion of nanoclay in pcl matrix atomic force microscopy afm results were used to determine the surface roughness parameters of the membranes as roughness has got a direct impact on the anti fouling property hydrophilic membranes with smooth membrane surfaces are less prone to colloidal fouling compared to the relatively more hydrophobic and rougher membranes to perform the analysis equipment aper a 100 spm was used 2 3 7 membrane permeability permeability of the prepared membranes was determined using a lab scale filtration unit with an effective membrane area of 42cm2 the schematic diagram of cross flow filtration unit used for the filtration studies is shown in fig 1 the samples were pressurised at 8 bars to minimise compaction effects subsequently the pure water flux of the membranes was then measured at pressures ranging from 1bar to 5 bars using eq 3 3 j w q a δ t where jw is the pure water flux l m2 h q is the volume of permeate collected l a is the membrane effective surface area m2 and t is the sampling time interval h the pore diameter was found to be 26nm for m0 membrane 54 17nm for mm1 membrane and 71 19nm for mm2 membrane 2 3 8 dye rejection studies rejection of congo red dye is examined using the characterised membranes and the percentage rejection is calculated using eq 5 4 r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c f 100 where c p is concentration of dye in the permeate ppm and c f is the concentration of dye in the feed ppm analysed using uv visible spectroscopy 3 results and discussions 3 1 membrane hydrophilicity table 3 shows the contact angle of the prepared membranes it can be observed that the mu1 membrane is more hydrophilic compared to other prepared mu membranes in the case of modified nanoclay incorporated membranes there is a considerable increase in the hydrophilicity because of the presence of polar groups in the modified nanoclay 18 moreover surface hydrophilicity affects the flux and antifouling ability of membrane 19 3 2 mechanical strength fig 2 shows the tensile stress of the prepared membranes plotted with a 3 error compared to m0 membrane having tensile strength 1 687mpa the tensile strength of mu1 membrane has been increased to 2 915mpa but on further loading of nanoclay particles the tensile strength gradually decreased at lower amounts of clay particles they get uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix causing an improved stress transfer between the matrix and the filler but on further loading excess clay tends to form aggregates which cause decrease in homogeneity which decrease the tensile strength 9 also the enhancement in the mechanical property is due to the suppression of macrovoids by the nanofillers which was evident from the sem results 20 for the membranes incorporated with modified nanoclay there is no considerable increase in the tensile strength values which may be due to the poor interfacial interaction between the modified clay and the polymer matrix 3 3 membrane porosity the porosities of m0 mu1 and mm2 membranes were calculated and presented in table 4 the volumetric porosity of mu1 membrane was found to be 59 37 while the porosity for the neat membrane is 40 this observation is supported by the sem results shown in fig 5 and fig 6 but in the case of mm2 membranes the volumetric porosity has been reduced which may be due to the presence of a thin skin layer with fine pores on the surface of the membranes the average surface porosity values of m0 mu1 and mm2 membrane were 15 80 19 54 and 2 45 surface porosity has a direct effect on flux decline low surface porosity increases the effect of adsorption and fouling due to solute accumulation near the pores 17 roughness parameters obtained from the afm images support the reported surface porosity values 3 4 thermo gravimetric analysis fig 3 represents the tg curve of m0 mu1 and mm1 membranes pcl showed a one step degradation with an initial decomposition temperature of 362 c and complete decomposition occurs around at 469 c as reported in previous studies 21 22 there is a slight enhancement in the degradation temperature on incorporating unmodified nanoclay particles on to the polymer matrix in the case of modified nanoclay even though the material is almost completely degraded the temperature of thermal degradation was found to be reduced slightly may be due to the structural decomposition of the nanocomposite 3 5 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the ftir spectra obtained for m0 mu1 and mm2 membranes are shown in fig 4 the exceptional peaks found in all the three spectra are the characteristic infra red bands of pcl the peaks at 2949cm 1 and 2865cm 1 represents the asymmetric ch2 stretching and symmetric ch2 stretching 1727cm 1 shows carbonyl stretching 23 1293cm 1 is due to co and cc stretching in the crystalline phase 1240cm 1 represents asymmetric coc stretching 1170cm 1 symmetric coc stretching 1157cm 1 shows co and cc stretching in the amorphous phase 24 compared to neat pcl membrane the peaks at 1727 and 1170cm 1 are intensified with the addition of unmodified nanoclay particles but in the case of ir spectra of mm2 membrane this intensification is not observed and moreover peaks at 2865 and 2949cm 1 are not very distinct 3 6 morphological characterisations 3 6 1 sem analysis fig 5 shows the sem image of neat pcl membrane with an average pore size of 6 2μm measured at random points using image j software with the addition of unmodified nanoclay the pore sizes were considerably reduced to an average value of 4 5μm fig 6 a but more clear pores can be observed which might be the reason for an increased water flux obtained from the experimental results the surface of the membranes with modified nanoclay particles seems to be very dense from fig 6 b the composite membranes with modified nanoclay showed large number of small pores with an average pore diameter of 1μm and uniform pore distribution covered with thin skin layer compared with the membrane incorporated with unmodified nanoclay the presence of clay particle in the polymer solution reduces the interfacial tension and increases the exchange rate of solvent and non solvent during the phase inversion process 25 this results in the change in pore size of the membrane 3 6 2 tem analysis tem images clearly confirm the presence of nanoclay in the pcl polymer matrix compared to the tem image of m0 membrane in fig 7 mu1 shows some dark spots which can be assumed to be unmodified nanoclay particles fig 8 a the polymer is unable to intercalate within the unmodified clay layers and the clay is dispersed as aggregates or particles with layers stacked together within the polymer matrix in the case of membranes with modified nanoclay shown in fig 8 b an exfoliated or delaminated structure of nanoclay is dispersed within the polymer matrix 26 3 6 3 atomic force microscopy fig 9 a and fig 9 b show the afm images of m0 and mu1membrane and fig 10 shows for mm2 membranes the dark regions represents valleys or membrane pores and brightest regions represents highest points or nodules of the membrane surface 19 27 the roughness parameter value obtained for m0 membrane was 60 63nm and for mu1 and mm2 membranes were 22 21nm and 26 72nm this shows that on addition of nanoclay the membrane has become smoother smooth surface are less prone to fouling as the foulants gets accumulated on the valleys on the membrane surface 28 and hence smooth surface of the modified membrane has got more water permeability 29 which was confirmed by the water flux studies 3 7 membrane permeability pure water flux of the prepared membranes was experimentally determined using a cross flow filtration unit at a pressure ranging from 1 to 5 bars the steady state flux values are plotted against the corresponding operating pressures in fig 11 and fig 12 the permeability values of the membranes are obtained from the slope of the plot between pure water flux and transmembrane pressure and are tabulated in table 4 the water permeability was considerably increased on incorporation of unmodified and modified nanoclay the improvement in membrane permeability is due to the combined effects of decreased contact angle and increased porosity but the permeability of mm2 membrane was found to be low compared to mu1 membranes which may be due to the formation of a thin skin layer with fine pores resulting in a decreased porosity the pore diameter of the membranes were calculated by hagen poiseuille equation eq 5 using the experimental flux values 5 δ p 32 μ l v ε d 2 where δp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the viscosity of water pa s l is the membrane thickness m v is the velocity m s ε is the membrane porosity and d is the pore diameter m there is a discrepancy in the pore diameter values calculated from eq 4 and the values obtained from the sem results this may be explained with the disproportionate increase of porosity and flux of the m0 mu1 and mm2 membranes m0 membrane has large size uniform pores with less porosity which gave a lower flux value this resulted in a lower calculated pore diameter for mu1 membranes there is a uniform pore distribution with small size pore and higher porosity this caused a substantial increase in water flux and hence a higher pore diameter in the case of mm2 membranes there is a non uniform distribution of pores with a large number of extremely smaller pores and lower porosity causing an intermediate flux value and higher pore diameter 3 8 dye rejection studies the optimised membranes m0 mu1 and mm2 were used to evaluate the rejection of congo red from synthetic waste water at an operating pressure of 2bar and the percentage removal is shown in fig 13 it was observed that the rejection has been increased with the addition of nanoclay with a higher rejection for mm2 membrane compared to mu1 membrane the presence of modified clay in mm2 membrane may induce an electrostatic repulsion against the cationic dye congo red which resulted in an increase in rejection 4 conclusion pcl based membranes were successfully synthesized using phase inversion technique with the incorporation of unmodified and modified nanoclay separately porosity and hydrophilicity measurements of the synthesized membranes showed that the membrane incorporated with unmodified nanoclay has enhanced properties from the mechanical strength studies the tensile strength of the membrane with unmodified nanoclay was found to be considerably higher than neat pcl membrane as well as the membrane with modified nanoclay particles tga results showed a slight enhancement in the thermal degradation of the membrane incorporated with unmodified nanoclay also by analyzing the ftir results the peaks at 1727 and 1170cm 1 were intensified with the addition of unmodified nanoclay particles sem results showed a decrease in the pore size of the membranes with more clear pores in mu1 membranes and mm2 membrane showed a uniform pore size distribution but with a thin skin layer on the membrane surface the permeability studies showed an increase in the water flux for the membrane with unmodified nanoclay compared to modified nanoclay incorporated membranes tem results exhibited a well dispersion of modified clay in the pcl matrix from the afm results the roughness parameter was calculated and it was found that the membrane roughness has been reduced by the addition of unmodified and modified nanoclay which showed an improved anti fouling property the incorporation of unmodified nanoclay smoothen the membrane surface with higher water flux and porosity but modified nanoclay incorporated membranes exhibited more rejection with a lower flux and porosity values hence these membranes can be further modified for water treatment applications

arbitrarily choosing points on the sem image of the membrane surface percentage surface porosity is calculated using eq 2 2 s u r f a c e p o r o s i t y p o r e a r e a t o t a l a r e a 100 2 3 4 thermo gravimetric analysis thermo gravimetric analysis was carried out for the prepared membranes to determine the weight degradation of neat and composite films tga was performed on a hitachi sta 7200 in which samples of about 10mg were heated in air from 25 c to 500 c at a heating rate of 40 c min 2 3 5 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in order to identify the presence of functional groups of the synthesised membrane ftir spectrum analysis were carried out for neat and composite films using 630 1b diamond atr module using kbr pellets in the range of 4000 400cm 1 2 3 6 morphological characterisations in order to study the dispersion of nanoclay in the pcl matrix the surface morphology of the membranes were characterised by scanning electron microscopy sem model jeol jsm 6360 from the sem results the pore sizes of the membranes were measured using image j software transmission electron microscopy tem measurement was performed with a high resolution jeol jsm 2100 instrument and the stained specimen section was placed in a 200mesh copper grid for observing the dispersion of nanoclay in pcl matrix atomic force microscopy afm results were used to determine the surface roughness parameters of the membranes as roughness has got a direct impact on the anti fouling property hydrophilic membranes with smooth membrane surfaces are less prone to colloidal fouling compared to the relatively more hydrophobic and rougher membranes to perform the analysis equipment aper a 100 spm was used 2 3 7 membrane permeability permeability of the prepared membranes was determined using a lab scale filtration unit with an effective membrane area of 42cm2 the schematic diagram of cross flow filtration unit used for the filtration studies is shown in fig 1 the samples were pressurised at 8 bars to minimise compaction effects subsequently the pure water flux of the membranes was then measured at pressures ranging from 1bar to 5 bars using eq 3 3 j w q a δ t where jw is the pure water flux l m2 h q is the volume of permeate collected l a is the membrane effective surface area m2 and t is the sampling time interval h the pore diameter was found to be 26nm for m0 membrane 54 17nm for mm1 membrane and 71 19nm for mm2 membrane 2 3 8 dye rejection studies rejection of congo red dye is examined using the characterised membranes and the percentage rejection is calculated using eq 5 4 r e j e c t i o n 1 c p c f 100 where c p is concentration of dye in the permeate ppm and c f is the concentration of dye in the feed ppm analysed using uv visible spectroscopy 3 results and discussions 3 1 membrane hydrophilicity table 3 shows the contact angle of the prepared membranes it can be observed that the mu1 membrane is more hydrophilic compared to other prepared mu membranes in the case of modified nanoclay incorporated membranes there is a considerable increase in the hydrophilicity because of the presence of polar groups in the modified nanoclay 18 moreover surface hydrophilicity affects the flux and antifouling ability of membrane 19 3 2 mechanical strength fig 2 shows the tensile stress of the prepared membranes plotted with a 3 error compared to m0 membrane having tensile strength 1 687mpa the tensile strength of mu1 membrane has been increased to 2 915mpa but on further loading of nanoclay particles the tensile strength gradually decreased at lower amounts of clay particles they get uniformly dispersed within the polymer matrix causing an improved stress transfer between the matrix and the filler but on further loading excess clay tends to form aggregates which cause decrease in homogeneity which decrease the tensile strength 9 also the enhancement in the mechanical property is due to the suppression of macrovoids by the nanofillers which was evident from the sem results 20 for the membranes incorporated with modified nanoclay there is no considerable increase in the tensile strength values which may be due to the poor interfacial interaction between the modified clay and the polymer matrix 3 3 membrane porosity the porosities of m0 mu1 and mm2 membranes were calculated and presented in table 4 the volumetric porosity of mu1 membrane was found to be 59 37 while the porosity for the neat membrane is 40 this observation is supported by the sem results shown in fig 5 and fig 6 but in the case of mm2 membranes the volumetric porosity has been reduced which may be due to the presence of a thin skin layer with fine pores on the surface of the membranes the average surface porosity values of m0 mu1 and mm2 membrane were 15 80 19 54 and 2 45 surface porosity has a direct effect on flux decline low surface porosity increases the effect of adsorption and fouling due to solute accumulation near the pores 17 roughness parameters obtained from the afm images support the reported surface porosity values 3 4 thermo gravimetric analysis fig 3 represents the tg curve of m0 mu1 and mm1 membranes pcl showed a one step degradation with an initial decomposition temperature of 362 c and complete decomposition occurs around at 469 c as reported in previous studies 21 22 there is a slight enhancement in the degradation temperature on incorporating unmodified nanoclay particles on to the polymer matrix in the case of modified nanoclay even though the material is almost completely degraded the temperature of thermal degradation was found to be reduced slightly may be due to the structural decomposition of the nanocomposite 3 5 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the ftir spectra obtained for m0 mu1 and mm2 membranes are shown in fig 4 the exceptional peaks found in all the three spectra are the characteristic infra red bands of pcl the peaks at 2949cm 1 and 2865cm 1 represents the asymmetric ch2 stretching and symmetric ch2 stretching 1727cm 1 shows carbonyl stretching 23 1293cm 1 is due to co and cc stretching in the crystalline phase 1240cm 1 represents asymmetric coc stretching 1170cm 1 symmetric coc stretching 1157cm 1 shows co and cc stretching in the amorphous phase 24 compared to neat pcl membrane the peaks at 1727 and 1170cm 1 are intensified with the addition of unmodified nanoclay particles but in the case of ir spectra of mm2 membrane this intensification is not observed and moreover peaks at 2865 and 2949cm 1 are not very distinct 3 6 morphological characterisations 3 6 1 sem analysis fig 5 shows the sem image of neat pcl membrane with an average pore size of 6 2μm measured at random points using image j software with the addition of unmodified nanoclay the pore sizes were considerably reduced to an average value of 4 5μm fig 6 a but more clear pores can be observed which might be the reason for an increased water flux obtained from the experimental results the surface of the membranes with modified nanoclay particles seems to be very dense from fig 6 b the composite membranes with modified nanoclay showed large number of small pores with an average pore diameter of 1μm and uniform pore distribution covered with thin skin layer compared with the membrane incorporated with unmodified nanoclay the presence of clay particle in the polymer solution reduces the interfacial tension and increases the exchange rate of solvent and non solvent during the phase inversion process 25 this results in the change in pore size of the membrane 3 6 2 tem analysis tem images clearly confirm the presence of nanoclay in the pcl polymer matrix compared to the tem image of m0 membrane in fig 7 mu1 shows some dark spots which can be assumed to be unmodified nanoclay particles fig 8 a the polymer is unable to intercalate within the unmodified clay layers and the clay is dispersed as aggregates or particles with layers stacked together within the polymer matrix in the case of membranes with modified nanoclay shown in fig 8 b an exfoliated or delaminated structure of nanoclay is dispersed within the polymer matrix 26 3 6 3 atomic force microscopy fig 9 a and fig 9 b show the afm images of m0 and mu1membrane and fig 10 shows for mm2 membranes the dark regions represents valleys or membrane pores and brightest regions represents highest points or nodules of the membrane surface 19 27 the roughness parameter value obtained for m0 membrane was 60 63nm and for mu1 and mm2 membranes were 22 21nm and 26 72nm this shows that on addition of nanoclay the membrane has become smoother smooth surface are less prone to fouling as the foulants gets accumulated on the valleys on the membrane surface 28 and hence smooth surface of the modified membrane has got more water permeability 29 which was confirmed by the water flux studies 3 7 membrane permeability pure water flux of the prepared membranes was experimentally determined using a cross flow filtration unit at a pressure ranging from 1 to 5 bars the steady state flux values are plotted against the corresponding operating pressures in fig 11 and fig 12 the permeability values of the membranes are obtained from the slope of the plot between pure water flux and transmembrane pressure and are tabulated in table 4 the water permeability was considerably increased on incorporation of unmodified and modified nanoclay the improvement in membrane permeability is due to the combined effects of decreased contact angle and increased porosity but the permeability of mm2 membrane was found to be low compared to mu1 membranes which may be due to the formation of a thin skin layer with fine pores resulting in a decreased porosity the pore diameter of the membranes were calculated by hagen poiseuille equation eq 5 using the experimental flux values 5 δ p 32 μ l v ε d 2 where δp is the transmembrane pressure pa μ is the viscosity of water pa s l is the membrane thickness m v is the velocity m s ε is the membrane porosity and d is the pore diameter m there is a discrepancy in the pore diameter values calculated from eq 4 and the values obtained from the sem results this may be explained with the disproportionate increase of porosity and flux of the m0 mu1 and mm2 membranes m0 membrane has large size uniform pores with less porosity which gave a lower flux value this resulted in a lower calculated pore diameter for mu1 membranes there is a uniform pore distribution with small size pore and higher porosity this caused a substantial increase in water flux and hence a higher pore diameter in the case of mm2 membranes there is a non uniform distribution of pores with a large number of extremely smaller pores and lower porosity causing an intermediate flux value and higher pore diameter 3 8 dye rejection studies the optimised membranes m0 mu1 and mm2 were used to evaluate the rejection of congo red from synthetic waste water at an operating pressure of 2bar and the percentage removal is shown in fig 13 it was observed that the rejection has been increased with the addition of nanoclay with a higher rejection for mm2 membrane compared to mu1 membrane the presence of modified clay in mm2 membrane may induce an electrostatic repulsion against the cationic dye congo red which resulted in an increase in rejection 4 conclusion pcl based membranes were successfully synthesized using phase inversion technique with the incorporation of unmodified and modified nanoclay separately porosity and hydrophilicity measurements of the synthesized membranes showed that the membrane incorporated with unmodified nanoclay has enhanced properties from the mechanical strength studies the tensile strength of the membrane with unmodified nanoclay was found to be considerably higher than neat pcl membrane as well as the membrane with modified nanoclay particles tga results showed a slight enhancement in the thermal degradation of the membrane incorporated with unmodified nanoclay also by analyzing the ftir results the peaks at 1727 and 1170cm 1 were intensified with the addition of unmodified nanoclay particles sem results showed a decrease in the pore size of the membranes with more clear pores in mu1 membranes and mm2 membrane showed a uniform pore size distribution but with a thin skin layer on the membrane surface the permeability studies showed an increase in the water flux for the membrane with unmodified nanoclay compared to modified nanoclay incorporated membranes tem results exhibited a well dispersion of modified clay in the pcl matrix from the afm results the roughness parameter was calculated and it was found that the membrane roughness has been reduced by the addition of unmodified and modified nanoclay which showed an improved anti fouling property the incorporation of unmodified nanoclay smoothen the membrane surface with higher water flux and porosity but modified nanoclay incorporated membranes exhibited more rejection with a lower flux and porosity values hence these membranes can be further modified for water treatment applications

department of civil and environmental engineering university of delaware newark de 19716 united states graphical abstract nano hematite bagasse composite n hbc was synthesized characterized and tested for the removal of pb ii from dilute aqueous solutions the particle size of ferric oxide was in the range of 100 300nm the composite surface both internal and external was occupied by abundant oxygen containing functional groups the optimum pb ii adsorption density occurred in the ph range from 4 0 to 5 5 adsorption reached equilibrium rapidly in 480 600 720min at initial pb ii concentration of 20 30 and 40mg l respectively at 25 c and ph 5 0 the maximum pb ii adsorption capacity calculated from the langmuir adsorption isotherm was 16 57mg g at 25 c furthermore surface complexation model was also applied to describe the adsorption reaction between aqueous pb ii and n hbc the gibbs free energy of adsorption δgads 0 was 39 49kj mol 9 44kcal mol at 25 c which indicated spontaneous pb ii ion adsorption on n hbc results of xps studies demonstrated the presence of surface oxygen containing functional groups which were involved in the adsorption of pb ii and that hematite played a key role in pb ii uptake keywords nano hematite bagasse composite n hbc lead ii surface complex formation adsorption impregnation 1 introduction lead ii is known toxic chemical species in water high lead ii concentration in drinking water is known to have adverse human health effects such as anemia kidney failure mental retardation and physiological defects 1 lead ii in the aquatic environment may originate from mainly from anthropogenic activities many methods such as coagulation chemical precipitation solvent extraction membrane separation reverse osmosis ion exchange and adsorption have been used to remove heavy metals including lead ii from water and wastewater 2 4 among all of these methods adsorption is a simple effective and inexpensive process for pb ii removal from dilute aqueous solutions 5 activated carbon due to its large specific surface area micro porous structure and stable chemical properties has been widely used for environmental remediation practices including water purificaiton wood and coal are generally the major raw materials for activated carbon manufacturing however the availability of these raw materials has prompted several studies to use waste agricultural by products for the removal of metals from water and wastewater 6 8 activated carbon has been reported effective in removing pb ii from wastewater 9 11 huang et al 12 19 58 were among the early researchers to study the adsorption of heavy metals from water by commercial activated carbon imamoglu and tekir 20 studied the removal of cu ii and pb ii from water using activated carbon prepared from hazelnut husks song et al 21 reported effective removal of pb ii using a surface modified coconut based activated carbon while results of the above studies generally showed effective removal of lead from wastewater at high concentrations pb ii removal at dilute concentration was rather inefficient therefore absorbents with strong adsorption capability over an extended concentration range for metal removal from water are needed iron oxide with phzpc in the neutral ph range and capable of removing a wide group of cations and anions has received considerable attention 22 24 raven et al reported high adsorption capacity toward pb ii cu ii zn ii ni ii and cr vi by iron based adsorbents 25 26 however iron based adsorbents had relatively small specific surface area slow mass transfer and low recycle reuse potential 27 therefore there are interests in activated carbon iron oxide composites bagasse is a solid residue from the sugar cane refinery industry and can be a sustainable resource of material for the preparation of activated carbon 28 in this study we prepare a nano hemite bagasse composite n hbc and study the pb ii adsorption characteristics of this material factors such as contact time ph pb ii concentration and bagasse content on the metal adsorption capacity of n hbc were studied first in batch experiments pb ii adsorptipon characteristics on hydrous n hbc described in terms of langmuir adsorption isotherm and surface complex formation model 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals reagents used in the study were of analytical

solution to the boiling solution while slowly stirring to obtain a red brown colloid solution mixed fifty gram dried bagasse with the colloid solution after mixing for 24h the ph value of the mixture was adjusted to 7 4 with 10 v v ammonia solution using an automatic potentiometric titrator metrohm 848 titrino plus to produce bagasse ferric hydroxide composite the solid was filtered and dried in an oven at 105 110 c for 24h followed by drying in a muffle furnace to collect nano fe oh 3 bagsse solid which was then carbonized activated at 550 c for 4h to obtain n hbc 29 for the purpose of comparison carbonized bamboo biochar without nnao hematite was prepared briefly the dried bamboo biochar average particle size 5mm was heated at 550 c for 4h in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 4 c per min then allowed to cool to room temperature 2 3 batch adsorption experiments batch pb ii removal experiments were conducted first a desired amount of n hbc powder was weighted and put in a series of plastic centrifuge tubes 100ml and added 50ml solution of different pb ii concentrations i e 20 50mg l after adjusting the ph with naoh 0 1m or hno3 0 1m to pre selected value the centrifuge tubes were sealed with capsules and placed on a temperature shaker i e 25 35 or 45 c and shaken at a speed of 200 strokes per min to attain adsorption equilibrium after centrifugation at 4000rpm for 5min the supernatant was filtered through 0 45 μm micro pore membrane and added 0 2 v v hno3 to stabilize the sample in 100ml volumetric flask before analyzing for the residual pb ii samples were stored in acid washed high density polyethylene containers until analysis of residual pb ii all samples were analyzed within three days of collection the adsorption capacity of n hbc at time t was calculated according to the mass balance relationship of pb ii ions expressed as 1 q v x c o c t where c0 and ct are pb ii concentration inmg l at initial and time t respectively v is the volume of the solution l and x is the mass of the n hbc used g the percent pb ii removal r was determined by the following equation 2 r 100 c o c t c o 2 4 experimental conditions the effect of various operating parameters namely contact time 30 1200min solution ph 2 0 9 0 adsorbent dosage 0 67 2 67g l initial pb ii concentration 20 50mg l and temperature 298 318k on pb ii adsorption were studied first the adsorption isotherm adsorption rate and thermodynamic parameters at ph 5 0 were obtained and analyzed as well 2 5 surface characterization of n hbc specific surface area was determined according to the brunauer emmet teller bet equation by nitrogen gas adsorption using a quantachrome nova station apparatus surface charge was determined by alkalimetric titration of 0 2g l solid suspension with naoh 10 3 m and hcl 10 3 m in nacl 10 2 m as supporting electrolyte the ph value was recorded using a ph meter model pb 10 sartorius co germany additionally the zeta potential of the adsorbent was measured as a function of ph in nacl 10 2 m electrolyte using nanoparticle zeta potential analyzer model zs90 malvern co england the structural feature of the n hbc was observed using

concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrometer perkin elmer aanalyst 700 3 results and discussions 3 1 surface characteristics of n hbc fig 1 a shows the sem images of n hbc the size and shape of nano hematite particles on n hbc could be seen from the sem images the size and shape of nano hematite particles on n hbc could be seen from the sem images the size of nano hematite particles was in the range of 50 and 100nm fig 1b shows xrd spectra of n hbc all major peaks could be clearly seen and identified as standard hematite α fe2o3 00 033 0664 confirming the formation of hematite α fe2o3 during preparation fig 1c shows the ftir spectra of n hbc the absorption peaks were at 3426 2924 2852 1630 1400 1170 1120 and 610cm 1 respectively the co functional groups were at 1630cm 1 and oh functional groups appeared at 3426cm 1 the peak at 2852cm 1 was attributed to ch stretching vibration the peak at 1400cm 1 was associated with oh bending deformation in carbocyclic acids and phenolic groups the adsorption band at 1170cm 1 was asymmetric stretching of the coc bridge the peak at 1120cm 1 was attributed to some overtones the oxygen containing functional groups were present abundantly on the external and internal surfaces of n hbc as adsorption sites and contributed to the adsorption capacity of n hbc the ftir spectra of n hbc were different from that of oxidized activated carbon reported by ding et al 30 ding et al 30 reported that the peaks at 2338cm 1 due to cc stretching and 1722 and 1595cm 1 due to co stretching were reduced and the peaks at 1061cm 1 due to co stretching disappeared upon heating at 550 c they also suggested that heating at elevating temperature decreased the surface functional groups the peak at 610cm 1 was attributed to the feo groups proving the presence of fe2o3 31 32 the specific surface area was 66 9m2 g determined by the bet n2 adsorption method ding et al 30 prepared bagasse biochars at different temperature and reported specific surface area mean geometric particle size 0 7mm of 0 56 0 78 1 98 and 14 1m2 g at heating temperature of 250 400 500 and 600 c respectively in the absence of data for the specific surface area of carbonized biochar based on the results reported by ding et al 30 a specific surface area of 7m2 g was estimated for the carbonized biochar the large specific surface area of n hbc can be attributed in part to the nano size hematite particles on the biochar the average pore diameter and the total pore volume were 12 25nm and 0 0201cm3 g respectively calculated by the bjh method fig s1 shows the zeta potential as a function of ph from fig s1 the phzpc of n hbc was 4 93 3 2 major factors affecting pb ii adsoriton the ph of the solution plays an important part on ion adsorption because solution ph governs the distribution of both the adsorbent surface metal binding sites and the metal ions in water 33 fig 2 a shows the adsorption of pb ii on n hbc as a function of ph results clearly indicated the importance of solution ph on pb ii adsorption 34 when the ph value was increased from 1 0 to 5 0 the adsorption capacity was increased from 1 90 to 14 74mg g the optimum ph for pb ii adsorption was found in the range from 4 0 to 5 5 obviously the nature of the surface charge could play a role in pb ii adsorption 35 at ph phzpc the adsorbent surface is negatively charged which strong electrostatic attraction between the surface groups and pb ii species might occur 35 n hbc had a phzpc of 4 93 fig s1 indicating a positive surface charge below ph 4 93 on the contrary the surface of n hbc was negatively charged at ph phzpc it is noted that at ph phzpc the predominant pb ii species was pb2 other species such as pb oh pb oh 2 and pb oh 3 were present at ph phzpc fig s6 strong intersection between the negatively charged n hbc surface and cationic pb2 species was expected although specific chemical adsorption could not be ruled out as important contributing forces for metal ion adsorption 18 fig 2b shows the effect of contact time on pb ii adsorption the residual pb ii concentration decreased rapidly at the onset of adsorption experiment which was typical of ion adsorption from dilute aqueous solutions and indicative of favor interactions between n fobc and pb ii results in fig 2b also show that the amount of pb ii adsorption reached a plateau at 480 600 and 720min at the initial pb ii concentration of 20 30 and 40mg l respectively under experimental condition of 25 c and ph 5 0 it was observed further that pb ii was adsorbed within the first 60min at an average adsorption rate of 0 114mg g min when the initial pb ii concentration was 20mg l temperature at 25 c and ph 5 0 a similar trend for initial pb ii concentration of 30 and 40mg l was also observed there were reports that adsorption reaction occurred rapidly during the initial stage which was followed by a slow reaction till equilibrium 36 the presence of a large number of vacant sites at the initial stage may be the cause of raid initial uptake of adsorbate species 37 3 3 adsorption isotherm fig 3 shows the pb ii adsorption isotherm for carbonized and n hbc at different temperature i e 25 35 and 45 c the adsorption density increased with increase in temperature at specific initial pb ii concentration the pb ii absorption density increased from 9 69 to 15 18 9 78 to15 69 and 9 83 16 28mg g when the equilibrium pb ii concentration was increased from 0 20 to 20mg l at 25 c 35 c and 45 c respectively it is interesting to note that n hbc exhibited a pb ii adsorption density three times that of carbonized bagasse the pb ii adsorption density can be described well by the langmuir adsorption isotherm 3 q q m k l c e 1 k l c e where q qm kl and ce are adsorption density monolayer layer adsorption density langmuir constant and equilibrium concentration respectively results showed that the degree of data fitness by the langmuir adsorption isotherm was good with correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9988 0 9998 and 0 9998 at 25 35 and 45 c respectively the adsorption dsnsity increased from 16 57 at 25 c to 17 24mg g at 45 c results indicated that pb ii adsorption on n hbc was endothermic n hbc exhibited a pb ii adsorption capacity of 16 6mg g which was less than 40 1mg g of an acid oxidized commercial acticated carbon 30 slightly less than 17 82mg g of bamboo charcoal 38 and slightly greater than 15 96mg g of activated carbon prepared from van apple pulp 19 however the pb ii adsorption density of n hbc was much greater than 7 04mg g of carbonized bagasse at 25 c the kl values were 6 10 107 2 07 108 and 2 38 108 m 1 at 25 c 35 c and 45 c respectively the change of gibbs free energy of adsorption δg can be calculated from the nernst equation δg rt ln kl where r is the gas constant 8 314j molk and t is the absolute temperature k the gibbs free energy value table 1 indicated the spontaneous nature of adsorption 3 4 surface acidity of n hbc the surface acidity of hydrous solids is an important property contributing to interfacial interactions with ions upon hydration the solid surface develops surface hydroxyl groups that behave amphoterically 39 41 20 4a s o h 2 s o h h k a 2 int 4b s o h s o h k a 2 int where soh2 soh and so represent protonated neutral and depronated surface hydroxyl groups respectively the various surface hydroxyl groups formed may not be structurally and fully chemically homogeneous 39 42 but for the sake of simplicity a single hydroxyl group in the chemical reaction was considered the deprotonated surface group so behaves as a bronsted base whereas the protonated soh2 group is a bronsted acid at constant ionic strength the surface activity or surface concentration of the surface species are assumed to be equal the surface acidity of any hydrous solid canbe expressed in terms of acidity strength i e intrinsic surface acidity constants p k a 1 int and p k a 2 int and total surface site nt μc cm2 which is the sum of the three surface hydroxyl groups i e 5 n t s o h 2 s o h s o based on alkalimetric titration and zeta potential measurement it is possible to calculate the surface acidity of a hydrous solid such as n hbc supporting information s4 as shown in the supporting information the acidity constants p k a 1 int and p k a 2 int were 3 29 and 6 57 respectively and the acidity capacity nt was 10 56μc cm2 at ionic strength of nacl 10 2 m based on the intrinsic acidity constants it is possible to calculate the speciation of the n hbc surface acidity supporting information s4 the surface and pb ii speciation canbe used to calculate the surface complex between pb ii and hydrous n hbc 3 5 surface complex formation scfm at low metal concentration metal adsorption onto hydrous solids such as metal oxides is mainly a surface coordination process that can be modeled thermodynamically as a complexation reaction between surface sites and adsorbates 43 the surface complex formation model scfm has been successfully used to describe the adsorption reactions at oxide water interfaces 17 44 47 with excellent predictability for the sake of simplicity a scfm originally proposed by huang and stumm 39 was employed to describe the adsorption of pb ii on n hbc huang and coworkers have used this model to describe the adsorption of metal ions onto many adsorbates including γ al2o3 39 metal sulfides 40 48 activated carbon 17 18 concrete materials 49 sludge particulates 50 and algal biomass 51 based on the above data the following complex formation was proposed for the adsorption of pb ii onto

yielded logks from the intercept fig 4b value of 2 32 which was very close to the logks value determined in fig 4a above note that ks is ph dependent the stability constants ks for pb ii n hbc complex was calculated from eq 6c i e ks and k a 2 i n t the stability constant logks was 8 89 at 25 c it must be noted that ks is the same as the langmuir adsorption constant kl results showed that ks was in the same order of magnitude as kl table 1 weng 52 reported the formation of surface complexes sopb and sopb oh sandy loam soil surface with stability constants logks of 4 2 4 7 and 7 1 7 3 respectively similar results were reported for the formation of surface complexes socu and socuoh between cu ii and powdered pineapple leaves 59 and cu ii and black tea leave 60 the stability constant between pb2 and n hbc was in the same order of magnitude as those reported by weng 52 nonetheless in the present work there was no formation of sopb oh surface complex the gibbs free energy of adsorption δgads 0 can be determined by the nernst equation 8 δgads 0 2 303 rt pks where r is the gas constant 8 314j k mol or 1 986cal k mol and t is the absolute temperature k at pks 8 89 the gibbs free energy of adsorption was δg ads 50 7kj mol or 12 1kcal mol which was of the same order of magnitude as that calculated from the of the same order of magnitude as that calculated from the langmuir adsorption constant kl at 25 c weng and huang reported δgads 0 value of 7 1kcal mol for the adsorption of zn ii onto fly ash 53 weng et al reported δgads 0 value of 5 7 to 7 3kcal mol for the adsorption of cu ii onto spent activated clay 54 the negative δgads 0 value indicated the spontaneuity of pb ii ion adsorption onto n hbc 3 6 chemical nature of pb ii interaction with n hbc fig 5 shows the results of energy dispersive spectrometric eds analysis the atomic percentage of c o and fe of n hbc was 33 22 65 67 and 1 12 or mass percentage of 25 22 68 47 and 4 07 respectively after pb ii adsorption the atomic percentage of c o and fe was 31 02 65 44 and 3 40 and the mass percentage were 23 08 64 85 and 11 76 respectively the mass percentage of pb ii was 0 7 which was the same as that based on the maximum adsorption capacity calculated by the langmuir adsorption isotherm this pattern showed the presence of pb ii peak confirming the pb ii adsorption on n hbc surface the major characteristic major peaks 2θ of n hbc before pb ii adsorption were at 33 37 35 63 57 16 43 15 and 62 95 which were shifted to 33 29 35 60 43 28 57 32 and 63 03 respectively after pb ii adsorption the major peaks of carbonized bagasse were at 43 59 and 50 83 before pb ii adsorption the peak at 50 83 disappeared after pb ii adsorption pb ii indicating the presence of oxygen containing functional groups that were responsible for pb ii adsorption fig 6 fig 7 shows the deconvoluted xps spectra of o 1s c 1s and fe 2p orbitals the c1s signal at 284 8ev was assigned to hydrocarbon contamination this peak was taken as reference no shift of xps spectra of c1s cc cc and co suggested that carbon species was not involved in adsorption process the main o1s peak was shifted from 531 8ev to 532 1ev after pb ii adsorption results showed the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of hbcin the form of carboxyl oxygen oco 533 4ev and carbonyl oxygen oc 530 6ev pb ii adsorption was accompanied by a change in oxygen bonding providing evidence that oxygen containing functional groups took part in pb ii adsorption the bonding energy of fe 2p was increased from 710 8 to 710 9ev after pb ii adsorption these values were typical for fe iii in fe2o3 the bonding energy change reflected electron transfer in the valence band in fact the actual charge transfers due to chemical reactions occurred therefore by tracking the change in core level peak position of the substrate with and without formation of surface complexes it is possible to deduce the direction of electron transfer during adsorption and to assess the relative acidity and basicity of substrate and adsorbate 55 the o1s binding energy and intensity shift was dependent on the content of different oxygen atoms in particular on the surface of n hbc a simple formula connecting o1s chemical shift and charge has been constructed with frontier molecular orbital theory as the theoretical framework 56 9 q o 4 372 385 023 8 976 545 509 o 1 s b e 1 2 4 488 where q0 is the actual oxygen charge in sorbent and o1s be is the o1s binding energy determined from xps moulder et al 57 reported that the q0 value of metal oxides was between 533 6 and 528 3ev the o1s binding energy and the actual charge of oxygen of surface oxygen groups should also be compatible with the migration of iron binding energy iron charge can be calculated from iron atom core level xps analysis and as following 56 10 q f e 0 3233 b e f e 2 p 228 51 where qfe is the actual charge of iron befe2p is the binding energy obtained by xps analysis according to eq 9 the charge of oxygen of n hbc surface before and after pb ii adsorption were 0 80 and 0 81 esu respectively it indicated that before and after pb ii adsorption the actual charge of oxygen of surface species was insignificantly changed which indicated that pb ii adsorption on n hbc did not involve noticeable electron transfer between n hbc surface and pb ii according to eq 10 the charge of surface iron species before and after pb ii adsorption were 1 29 and 1 32 esu respectively it indicated that charge of surface iron species was slightly changed after pb ii adsorption which was correspondent to the actual charge of o 1s after pb ii adsorption the iron charge became more positively charged suggesting that the surface iron atoms acted as lewis base in the adsorption of pb2 which was a lewis acid the results agreed with the above context that pb ii adsorption on n hbc formed surface complex so pb fig 8 shows the xps spectra of pb 4f pb4f5 2 and 4f7 2 orbitals the peak pb 2f shifted from the reference binding energy of 137 6 142 4ev 57 the pb4f5 2 peak at 138 9ev and the pb 4f7 2 peak at 143 8ev were clearly seen the shift of pb 4f orbital spectra at the binding energy be of 137 5ev after pb ii absorption demonstrated clearly that the surface oxygen containing functional groups were involved in the adsorption reaction and that hematite played a significant role on pb ii adsorption 3 7 engineering implications results clearly show the merits of the n hbc as an adsorbent for the removal of trace metals such as pb ii from water from the engineering process applications point of view this adsorbent has three major attributes first the nan hematite particles contribute great specific surface area to the n bc which provides major surface sites necessary for metal ion adsorption second the bagasse support enables the design of the metal removal processes in the mode of fixed bed operation which can greatly reduce the post metal treatment costs of particle separation finally the ph dependent nature of metal adsorption enables easy regeneration of the saturated adsorbent it is extremely feasible to regenerate the n hbc when it reaches maximum metal adsorption capacity for example at ph 2 and 9 the pb ii adsorption capacity of n hbc is small which makes it easy to desorb pb ii from the surface the pb ii concentration in the acid or base regenerating solutions is high which makes it easy to recover pb ii and water 4 conclusion the particle size of n fe2o3 was between 100 and 300nm major oxygen containing functional groups were present abundantly on the external and internal surfaces of n hbc the surface acidity constants of n fobc were p k a 1 int 3 29 and p k a 2 int 6 57 at 10 2 m of nacl solution and 25 c the ph played a major role on pb ii adsorption onto hydrous n hbc surface the optimum ph for pb ii adsorption was in the range of 4 0 5 5 with maximum pb ii removal at ph 5 0 pb ii adsorption was fast with equilibrium time of 480 600 720min at 25 c and ph 5 0 when the initial pb ii concentration was 20 30 and 40mg l respectively the maximum adsorption capacity calculated from the langmuir isotherm was 16 57mg g at 25 c surface complexation model was able to satisfactorily describe the adsorption reaction between aqueous pb2 and n hbc surfaces the gibbs free adsorption of adsorption was in the range of 39 73 and 50 72kj mol which indicated favorable pb2 adsorption onto n hbc the shift of pb 4f orbital spectra at the binding energy be of 137 5ev after pb ii absorption demonstrated clearly that the surface oxygen containing functional groups were involved in the adsorption reaction and that hematite played a significant role on pb ii adsorption under the context of surface complex formation supported by xs analysis it was clear that the surface of n hbc behaved as lewis base and pb ii specifically pb2 was lewis acid in the adsorption of pb ii onto the n hbc acknowledgments this paper has

department of civil and environmental engineering university of delaware newark de 19716 united states graphical abstract nano hematite bagasse composite n hbc was synthesized characterized and tested for the removal of pb ii from dilute aqueous solutions the particle size of ferric oxide was in the range of 100 300nm the composite surface both internal and external was occupied by abundant oxygen containing functional groups the optimum pb ii adsorption density occurred in the ph range from 4 0 to 5 5 adsorption reached equilibrium rapidly in 480 600 720min at initial pb ii concentration of 20 30 and 40mg l respectively at 25 c and ph 5 0 the maximum pb ii adsorption capacity calculated from the langmuir adsorption isotherm was 16 57mg g at 25 c furthermore surface complexation model was also applied to describe the adsorption reaction between aqueous pb ii and n hbc the gibbs free energy of adsorption δgads 0 was 39 49kj mol 9 44kcal mol at 25 c which indicated spontaneous pb ii ion adsorption on n hbc results of xps studies demonstrated the presence of surface oxygen containing functional groups which were involved in the adsorption of pb ii and that hematite played a key role in pb ii uptake keywords nano hematite bagasse composite n hbc lead ii surface complex formation adsorption impregnation 1 introduction lead ii is known toxic chemical species in water high lead ii concentration in drinking water is known to have adverse human health effects such as anemia kidney failure mental retardation and physiological defects 1 lead ii in the aquatic environment may originate from mainly from anthropogenic activities many methods such as coagulation chemical precipitation solvent extraction membrane separation reverse osmosis ion exchange and adsorption have been used to remove heavy metals including lead ii from water and wastewater 2 4 among all of these methods adsorption is a simple effective and inexpensive process for pb ii removal from dilute aqueous solutions 5 activated carbon due to its large specific surface area micro porous structure and stable chemical properties has been widely used for environmental remediation practices including water purificaiton wood and coal are generally the major raw materials for activated carbon manufacturing however the availability of these raw materials has prompted several studies to use waste agricultural by products for the removal of metals from water and wastewater 6 8 activated carbon has been reported effective in removing pb ii from wastewater 9 11 huang et al 12 19 58 were among the early researchers to study the adsorption of heavy metals from water by commercial activated carbon imamoglu and tekir 20 studied the removal of cu ii and pb ii from water using activated carbon prepared from hazelnut husks song et al 21 reported effective removal of pb ii using a surface modified coconut based activated carbon while results of the above studies generally showed effective removal of lead from wastewater at high concentrations pb ii removal at dilute concentration was rather inefficient therefore absorbents with strong adsorption capability over an extended concentration range for metal removal from water are needed iron oxide with phzpc in the neutral ph range and capable of removing a wide group of cations and anions has received considerable attention 22 24 raven et al reported high adsorption capacity toward pb ii cu ii zn ii ni ii and cr vi by iron based adsorbents 25 26 however iron based adsorbents had relatively small specific surface area slow mass transfer and low recycle reuse potential 27 therefore there are interests in activated carbon iron oxide composites bagasse is a solid residue from the sugar cane refinery industry and can be a sustainable resource of material for the preparation of activated carbon 28 in this study we prepare a nano hemite bagasse composite n hbc and study the pb ii adsorption characteristics of this material factors such as contact time ph pb ii concentration and bagasse content on the metal adsorption capacity of n hbc were studied first in batch experiments pb ii adsorptipon characteristics on hydrous n hbc described in terms of langmuir adsorption isotherm and surface complex formation model 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals reagents used in the study were of analytical grade and used without further purification except lead standard solution ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o ammina nh3 h2o sodium hydroxide naoh nitric acid hno3 lead nitrate pb no3 2 sodium chloride nacl and cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctmab were purchased from country medicine group in shanghai china bagasse was obtained from a sugar industry site in guangxi china 2 2 preparation of n hbc first bagasse was dried in an oven at 80 c for 24h then ground into small size and sieved to an average particle size of 5mm one mol l of fecl3 0 05mol l of ctmab and 10 v v of ammonia solution all of analytical grade were prepared with ultrapure water add ctmab 100ml at 0 05mol l and ultrapure water 800ml into a 2 l beaker and heated to boiling then added 100ml of 1mol l fecl3 solution to the boiling solution while slowly stirring to obtain a red brown colloid solution mixed fifty gram dried bagasse with the colloid solution after mixing for 24h the ph value of the mixture was adjusted to 7 4 with 10 v v ammonia solution using an automatic potentiometric titrator metrohm 848 titrino plus to produce bagasse ferric hydroxide composite the solid was filtered and dried in an oven at 105 110 c for 24h followed by drying in a muffle furnace to collect nano fe oh 3 bagsse solid which was then carbonized activated at 550 c for 4h to obtain n hbc 29 for the purpose of comparison carbonized bamboo biochar without nnao hematite was prepared briefly the dried bamboo biochar average particle size 5mm was heated at 550 c for 4h in a muffle furnace at a heating rate of 4 c per min then allowed to cool to room temperature 2 3 batch adsorption experiments batch pb ii removal experiments were conducted first a desired amount of n hbc powder was weighted and put in a series of plastic centrifuge tubes 100ml and added 50ml solution of different pb ii concentrations i e 20 50mg l after adjusting the ph with naoh 0 1m or hno3 0 1m to pre selected value the centrifuge tubes were sealed with capsules and placed on a temperature shaker i e 25 35 or 45 c and shaken at a speed of 200 strokes per min to attain adsorption equilibrium after centrifugation at 4000rpm for 5min the supernatant was filtered through 0 45 μm micro pore membrane and added 0 2 v v hno3 to stabilize the sample in 100ml volumetric flask before analyzing for the residual pb ii samples were stored in acid washed high density polyethylene containers until analysis of residual pb ii all samples were analyzed within three days of collection the adsorption capacity of n hbc at time t was calculated according to the mass balance relationship of pb ii ions expressed as 1 q v x c o c t where c0 and ct are pb ii concentration inmg l at initial and time t respectively v is the volume of the solution l and x is the mass of the n hbc used g the percent pb ii removal r was determined by the following equation 2 r 100 c o c t c o 2 4 experimental conditions the effect of various operating parameters namely contact time 30 1200min solution ph 2 0 9 0 adsorbent dosage 0 67 2 67g l initial pb ii concentration 20 50mg l and temperature 298 318k on pb ii adsorption were studied first the adsorption isotherm adsorption rate and thermodynamic parameters at ph 5 0 were obtained and analyzed as well 2 5 surface characterization of n hbc specific surface area was determined according to the brunauer emmet teller bet equation by nitrogen gas adsorption using a quantachrome nova station apparatus surface charge was determined by alkalimetric titration of 0 2g l solid suspension with naoh 10 3 m and hcl 10 3 m in nacl 10 2 m as supporting electrolyte the ph value was recorded using a ph meter model pb 10 sartorius co germany additionally the zeta potential of the adsorbent was measured as a function of ph in nacl 10 2 m electrolyte using nanoparticle zeta potential analyzer model zs90 malvern co england the structural feature of the n hbc was observed using

concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectrometer perkin elmer aanalyst 700 3 results and discussions 3 1 surface characteristics of n hbc fig 1 a shows the sem images of n hbc the size and shape of nano hematite particles on n hbc could be seen from the sem images the size and shape of nano hematite particles on n hbc could be seen from the sem images the size of nano hematite particles was in the range of 50 and 100nm fig 1b shows xrd spectra of n hbc all major peaks could be clearly seen and identified as standard hematite α fe2o3 00 033 0664 confirming the formation of hematite α fe2o3 during preparation fig 1c shows the ftir spectra of n hbc the absorption peaks were at 3426 2924 2852 1630 1400 1170 1120 and 610cm 1 respectively the co functional groups were at 1630cm 1 and oh functional groups appeared at 3426cm 1 the peak at 2852cm 1 was attributed to ch stretching vibration the peak at 1400cm 1 was associated with oh bending deformation in carbocyclic acids and phenolic groups the adsorption band at 1170cm 1 was asymmetric stretching of the coc bridge the peak at 1120cm 1 was attributed to some overtones the oxygen containing functional groups were present abundantly on the external and internal surfaces of n hbc as adsorption sites and contributed to the adsorption capacity of n hbc the ftir spectra of n hbc were different from that of oxidized activated carbon reported by ding et al 30 ding et al 30 reported that the peaks at 2338cm 1 due to cc stretching and 1722 and 1595cm 1 due to co stretching were reduced and the peaks at 1061cm 1 due to co stretching disappeared upon heating at 550 c they also suggested that heating at elevating temperature decreased the surface functional groups the peak at 610cm 1 was attributed to the feo groups proving the presence of fe2o3 31 32 the specific surface area was 66 9m2 g determined by the bet n2 adsorption method ding et al 30 prepared bagasse biochars at different temperature and reported specific surface area mean geometric particle size 0 7mm of 0 56 0 78 1 98 and 14 1m2 g at heating temperature of 250 400 500 and 600 c respectively in the absence of data for the specific surface area of carbonized biochar based on the results reported by ding et al 30 a specific surface area of 7m2 g was estimated for the carbonized biochar the large specific surface area of n hbc can be attributed in part to the nano size hematite particles on the biochar the average pore diameter and the total pore volume were 12 25nm and 0 0201cm3 g respectively calculated by the bjh method fig s1 shows the zeta potential as a function of ph from fig s1 the phzpc of n hbc was 4 93 3 2 major factors affecting pb ii adsoriton the ph of the solution plays an important part on ion adsorption because solution ph governs the distribution of both the adsorbent surface metal binding sites and the metal ions in water 33 fig 2 a shows the adsorption of pb ii on n hbc as a function of ph results clearly indicated the importance of solution ph on pb ii adsorption 34 when the ph value was increased from 1 0 to 5 0 the adsorption capacity was increased from 1 90 to 14 74mg g the optimum ph for pb ii adsorption was found in the range from 4 0 to 5 5 obviously the nature of the surface charge could play a role in pb ii adsorption 35 at ph phzpc the adsorbent surface is negatively charged which strong electrostatic attraction between the surface groups and pb ii species might occur 35 n hbc had a phzpc of 4 93 fig s1 indicating a positive surface charge below ph 4 93 on the contrary the surface of n hbc was negatively charged at ph phzpc it is noted that at ph phzpc the predominant pb ii species was pb2 other species such as pb oh pb oh 2 and pb oh 3 were present at ph phzpc fig s6 strong intersection between the negatively charged n hbc surface and cationic pb2 species was expected although specific chemical adsorption could not be ruled out as important contributing forces for metal ion adsorption 18 fig 2b shows the effect of contact time on pb ii adsorption the residual pb ii concentration decreased rapidly at the onset of adsorption experiment which was typical of ion adsorption from dilute aqueous solutions and indicative of favor interactions between n fobc and pb ii results in fig 2b also show that the amount of pb ii adsorption reached a plateau at 480 600 and 720min at the initial pb ii concentration of 20 30 and 40mg l respectively under experimental condition of 25 c and ph 5 0 it was observed further that pb ii was adsorbed within the first 60min at an average adsorption rate of 0 114mg g min when the initial pb ii concentration was 20mg l temperature at 25 c and ph 5 0 a similar trend for initial pb ii concentration of 30 and 40mg l was also observed there were reports that adsorption reaction occurred rapidly during the initial stage which was followed by a slow reaction till equilibrium 36 the presence of a large number of vacant sites at the initial stage may be the cause of raid initial uptake of adsorbate species 37 3 3 adsorption isotherm fig 3 shows the pb ii adsorption isotherm for carbonized and n hbc at different temperature i e 25 35 and 45 c the adsorption density increased with increase in temperature at specific initial pb ii concentration the pb ii absorption density increased from 9 69 to 15 18 9 78 to15 69 and 9 83 16 28mg g when the equilibrium pb ii concentration was increased from 0 20 to 20mg l at 25 c 35 c and 45 c respectively it is interesting to note that n hbc exhibited a pb ii adsorption density three times that of carbonized bagasse the pb ii adsorption density can be described well by the langmuir adsorption isotherm 3 q q m k l c e 1 k l c e where q qm kl and ce are adsorption density monolayer layer adsorption density langmuir constant and equilibrium concentration respectively results showed that the degree of data fitness by the langmuir adsorption isotherm was good with correlation coefficient r2 of 0 9988 0 9998 and 0 9998 at 25 35 and 45 c respectively the adsorption dsnsity increased from 16 57 at 25 c to 17 24mg g at 45 c results indicated that pb ii adsorption on n hbc was endothermic n hbc exhibited a pb ii adsorption capacity of 16 6mg g which was less than 40 1mg g of an acid oxidized commercial acticated carbon 30 slightly less than 17 82mg g of bamboo charcoal 38 and slightly greater than 15 96mg g of activated carbon prepared from van apple pulp 19 however the pb ii adsorption density of n hbc was much greater than 7 04mg g of carbonized bagasse at 25 c the kl values were 6 10 107 2 07 108 and 2 38 108 m 1 at 25 c 35 c and 45 c respectively the change of gibbs free energy of adsorption δg can be calculated from the nernst equation δg rt ln kl where r is the gas constant 8 314j molk and t is the absolute temperature k the gibbs free energy value table 1 indicated the spontaneous nature of adsorption 3 4 surface acidity of n hbc the surface acidity of hydrous solids is an important property contributing to interfacial interactions with ions upon hydration the solid surface develops surface hydroxyl groups that behave amphoterically 39 41 20 4a s o h 2 s o h h k a 2 int 4b s o h s o h k a 2 int where soh2 soh and so represent protonated neutral and depronated surface hydroxyl groups respectively the various surface hydroxyl groups formed may not be structurally and fully chemically homogeneous 39 42 but for the sake of simplicity a single hydroxyl group in the chemical reaction was considered the deprotonated surface group so behaves as a bronsted base whereas the protonated soh2 group is a bronsted acid at constant ionic strength the surface activity or surface concentration of the surface species are assumed to be equal the surface acidity of any hydrous solid canbe expressed in terms of acidity strength i e intrinsic surface acidity constants p k a 1 int and p k a 2 int and total surface site nt μc cm2 which is the sum of the three surface hydroxyl groups i e 5 n t s o h 2 s o h s o based on alkalimetric titration and zeta potential measurement it is possible to calculate the surface acidity of a hydrous solid such as n hbc supporting information s4 as shown in the supporting information the acidity constants p k a 1 int and p k a 2 int were 3 29 and 6 57 respectively and the acidity capacity nt was 10 56μc cm2 at ionic strength of nacl 10 2 m based on the intrinsic acidity constants it is possible to calculate the speciation of the n hbc surface acidity supporting information s4 the surface and pb ii speciation canbe used to calculate the surface complex between pb ii and hydrous n hbc 3 5 surface complex formation scfm at low metal concentration metal adsorption onto hydrous solids such as metal oxides is mainly a surface coordination process that can be modeled thermodynamically as a complexation reaction between surface sites and adsorbates 43 the surface complex formation model scfm has been successfully used to describe the adsorption reactions at oxide water interfaces 17 44 47 with excellent predictability for the sake of simplicity a scfm originally proposed by huang and stumm 39 was employed to describe the adsorption of pb ii on n hbc huang and coworkers have used this model to describe the adsorption of metal ions onto many adsorbates including γ al2o3 39 metal sulfides 40 48 activated carbon 17 18 concrete materials 49 sludge particulates 50 and algal biomass 51 based on the above data the following complex formation was proposed for the adsorption of pb ii onto hydrous n hbc 6a s o p b 2 s o p b k s s o p b s o p b 2 or 6b s o h p b 2 s o p b h k s s o p b h s o h p b 2 note that the stability constant ks is related to k s by the following relationship 6c k

yielded logks from the intercept fig 4b value of 2 32 which was very close to the logks value determined in fig 4a above note that ks is ph dependent the stability constants ks for pb ii n hbc complex was calculated from eq 6c i e ks and k a 2 i n t the stability constant logks was 8 89 at 25 c it must be noted that ks is the same as the langmuir adsorption constant kl results showed that ks was in the same order of magnitude as kl table 1 weng 52 reported the formation of surface complexes sopb and sopb oh sandy loam soil surface with stability constants logks of 4 2 4 7 and 7 1 7 3 respectively similar results were reported for the formation of surface complexes socu and socuoh between cu ii and powdered pineapple leaves 59 and cu ii and black tea leave 60 the stability constant between pb2 and n hbc was in the same order of magnitude as those reported by weng 52 nonetheless in the present work there was no formation of sopb oh surface complex the gibbs free energy of adsorption δgads 0 can be determined by the nernst equation 8 δgads 0 2 303 rt pks where r is the gas constant 8 314j k mol or 1 986cal k mol and t is the absolute temperature k at pks 8 89 the gibbs free energy of adsorption was δg ads 50 7kj mol or 12 1kcal mol which was of the same order of magnitude as that calculated from the of the same order of magnitude as that calculated from the langmuir adsorption constant kl at 25 c weng and huang reported δgads 0 value of 7 1kcal mol for the adsorption of zn ii onto fly ash 53 weng et al reported δgads 0 value of 5 7 to 7 3kcal mol for the adsorption of cu ii onto spent activated clay 54 the negative δgads 0 value indicated the spontaneuity of pb ii ion adsorption onto n hbc 3 6 chemical nature of pb ii interaction with n hbc fig 5 shows the results of energy dispersive spectrometric eds analysis the atomic percentage of c o and fe of n hbc was 33 22 65 67 and 1 12 or mass percentage of 25 22 68 47 and 4 07 respectively after pb ii adsorption the atomic percentage of c o and fe was 31 02 65 44 and 3 40 and the mass percentage were 23 08 64 85 and 11 76 respectively the mass percentage of pb ii was 0 7 which was the same as that based on the maximum adsorption capacity calculated by the langmuir adsorption isotherm this pattern showed the presence of pb ii peak confirming the pb ii adsorption on n hbc surface the major characteristic major peaks 2θ of n hbc before pb ii adsorption were at 33 37 35 63 57 16 43 15 and 62 95 which were shifted to 33 29 35 60 43 28 57 32 and 63 03 respectively after pb ii adsorption the major peaks of carbonized bagasse were at 43 59 and 50 83 before pb ii adsorption the peak at 50 83 disappeared after pb ii adsorption pb ii indicating the presence of oxygen containing functional groups that were responsible for pb ii adsorption fig 6 fig 7 shows the deconvoluted xps spectra of o 1s c 1s and fe 2p orbitals the c1s signal at 284 8ev was assigned to hydrocarbon contamination this peak was taken as reference no shift of xps spectra of c1s cc cc and co suggested that carbon species was not involved in adsorption process the main o1s peak was shifted from 531 8ev to 532 1ev after pb ii adsorption results showed the presence of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of hbcin the form of carboxyl oxygen oco 533 4ev and carbonyl oxygen oc 530 6ev pb ii adsorption was accompanied by a change in oxygen bonding providing evidence that oxygen containing functional groups took part in pb ii adsorption the bonding energy of fe 2p was increased from 710 8 to 710 9ev after pb ii adsorption these values were typical for fe iii in fe2o3 the bonding energy change reflected electron transfer in the valence band in fact the actual charge transfers due to chemical reactions occurred therefore by tracking the change in core level peak position of the substrate with and without formation of surface complexes it is possible to deduce the direction of electron transfer during adsorption and to assess the relative acidity and basicity of substrate and adsorbate 55 the o1s binding energy and intensity shift was dependent on the content of different oxygen atoms in particular on the surface of n hbc a simple formula connecting o1s chemical shift and charge has been constructed with frontier molecular orbital theory as the theoretical framework 56 9 q o 4 372 385 023 8 976 545 509 o 1 s b e 1 2 4 488 where q0 is the actual oxygen charge in sorbent and o1s be is the o1s binding energy determined from xps moulder et al 57 reported that the q0 value of metal oxides was between 533 6 and 528 3ev the o1s binding energy and the actual charge of oxygen of surface oxygen groups should also be compatible with the migration of iron binding energy iron charge can be calculated from iron atom core level xps analysis and as following 56 10 q f e 0 3233 b e f e 2 p 228 51 where qfe is the actual charge of iron befe2p is the binding energy obtained by xps analysis according to eq 9 the charge of oxygen of n hbc surface before and after pb ii adsorption were 0 80 and 0 81 esu respectively it indicated that before and after pb ii adsorption the actual charge of oxygen of surface species was insignificantly changed which indicated that pb ii adsorption on n hbc did not involve noticeable electron transfer between n hbc surface and pb ii according to eq 10 the charge of surface iron species before and after pb ii adsorption were 1 29 and 1 32 esu respectively it indicated that charge of surface iron species was slightly changed after pb ii adsorption which was correspondent to the actual charge of o 1s after pb ii adsorption the iron charge became more positively charged suggesting that the surface iron atoms acted as lewis base in the adsorption of pb2 which was a lewis acid the results agreed with the above context that pb ii adsorption on n hbc formed surface complex so pb fig 8 shows the xps spectra of pb 4f pb4f5 2 and 4f7 2 orbitals the peak pb 2f shifted from the reference binding energy of 137 6 142 4ev 57 the pb4f5 2 peak at 138 9ev and the pb 4f7 2 peak at 143 8ev were clearly seen the shift of pb 4f orbital spectra at the binding energy be of 137 5ev after pb ii absorption demonstrated clearly that the surface oxygen containing functional groups were involved in the adsorption reaction and that hematite played a significant role on pb ii adsorption 3 7 engineering implications results clearly show the merits of the n hbc as an adsorbent for the removal of trace metals such as pb ii from water from the engineering process applications point of view this adsorbent has three major attributes first the nan hematite particles contribute great specific surface area to the n bc which provides major surface sites necessary for metal ion adsorption second the bagasse support enables the design of the metal removal processes in the mode of fixed bed operation which can greatly reduce the post metal treatment costs of particle separation finally the ph dependent nature of metal adsorption enables easy regeneration of the saturated adsorbent it is extremely feasible to regenerate the n hbc when it reaches maximum metal adsorption capacity for example at ph 2 and 9 the pb ii adsorption capacity of n hbc is small which makes it easy to desorb pb ii from the surface the pb ii concentration in the acid or base regenerating solutions is high which makes it easy to recover pb ii and water 4 conclusion the particle size of n fe2o3 was between 100 and 300nm major oxygen containing functional groups were present abundantly on the external and internal surfaces of n hbc the surface acidity constants of n fobc were p k a 1 int 3 29 and p k a 2 int 6 57 at 10 2 m of nacl solution and 25 c the ph played a major role on pb ii adsorption onto hydrous n hbc surface the optimum ph for pb ii adsorption was in the range of 4 0 5 5 with maximum pb ii removal at ph 5 0 pb ii adsorption was fast with equilibrium time of 480 600 720min at 25 c and ph 5 0 when the initial pb ii concentration was 20 30 and 40mg l respectively the maximum adsorption capacity calculated from the langmuir isotherm was 16 57mg g at 25 c surface complexation model was able to satisfactorily describe the adsorption reaction between aqueous pb2 and n hbc surfaces the gibbs free adsorption of adsorption was in the range of 39 73 and 50 72kj mol which indicated favorable pb2 adsorption onto n hbc the shift of pb 4f orbital spectra at the binding energy be of 137 5ev after pb ii absorption demonstrated clearly that the surface oxygen containing functional groups were involved in the adsorption reaction and that hematite played a significant role on pb ii adsorption under the context of surface complex formation supported by xs analysis it was clear that the surface of n hbc behaved as lewis base and pb ii specifically pb2 was lewis acid in the adsorption of pb ii onto the n hbc acknowledgments this paper has
