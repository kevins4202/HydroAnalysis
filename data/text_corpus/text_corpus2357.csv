11785,during the past two decades several studies on arsenic as occurrence in the environment particularly in surface and groundwater systems have reported high levels of as in many african countries arsenic concentrations up to 10 000 μg l have been reported in surface water systems caused by anthropogenic activities such as mining industrial effluents and municipal solid waste disposals similarly concentrations up to 1760 μg l have been reported in many groundwater systems which account for approximately 60 of drinking water demand in rural africa naturally as is mobilized in groundwater systems through weathering processes and dissolution of as bearing minerals such as sulfides pyrite arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite iron oxides other mineralized granitic and gneissic rocks and climate change factors triggering as release in groundwater recently public health studies in some african countries such as tanzania and ethiopia have reported high levels of as in human tissues such as toenails as well as in urine among pregnant women exposed to as contaminated groundwater respectively in urine concentrations up to 150 μg l were reported among pregnant women depending on as contaminated drinking water within geita gold mining areas in the north western part of tanzania however the studies on as occurrence and mobilization in african water systems as well as related health effects are limited due to the lack of awareness the current study aims to gather information on the occurrence of as in different environmental compartments its spatial variability public health problems and the potential remediation options of as in water sources the study also aims at creating awareness of as contamination in africa and its removal using locally available materials graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic africa sources spatial variability local adsorbents removal 1 introduction arsenic as is a metalloid group va classified as a toxic element that threatens human health it occurs ubiquitously in the environment particularly in the soil water and air and is mobilized by various geogenic and anthropogenic processes bhattacharya et al 1997 bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b 2007 2012 2017 bhattacharya et al 2004 bundschuh and maity 2015 bundschuh et al 2013 kar et al 2010 liu et al 2011 2013 maity et al 2011a 2011b 2017 2021a b mohan and pittman 2007

durowoju et al 2020 mudzielwana et al 2020 bretzler et al 2017 2019 mladenov et al 2014 von brömssen et al 2007 merola et al 2014 selinus 2006 naturally as exists as an inorganic as iii or as v species as well as organic as e g monomethylarsonic acid dimethylarsinic acid trimethylarsine oxide arsenobetaine and arsenicholine among which inorganic species are more toxic than organic compounds fitz and wenzel 2002 bhattacharya et al 2002a bhattacharyya et al 2003 nriagu et al 2007 herath et al 2016 kumarathilaka et al 2018 hussain et al 2021 in terms of mobility the as iii is highly mobile 25 65 times in the natural environment as compared to as v predominantly due to its electroneutrality ferguson and gavis 1972 hughes 2002 rukh et al 2017 sadiq 1997 generally the release of as into the environment is caused by oxidation of as bearing sulfide minerals weathering of as bearing rocks as desorption from surfaces of mineral iron or manganese oxides reductive dissolution of iron oxides and due to evaporative concentration in arid and semi arid regions ahoulé et al 2015 bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b bhattacharya et al 2004 2007 bissen et al 2003 herath et al 2016 kent and fox 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 anthropogenic processes such as mining agricultural pesticide application industrial discharge and land filling of sewage sludge are also the potential sources of as mandal and suzuki 2002 rukh et al 2017 furthermore the coal burning activities can significantly contribute to as mobilization in the environment finkelman 2004 despite a few documented studies on as occurrence in africa ahoulé et al 2015 indicated both anthropogenic and geogenic activities as the sources of high as levels in the aquatic environment most of the studies focused on anthropogenic sources particularly mining activities industrial effluents and agricultural practices in some countries recently high levels of as have been reported in northern egyptian delta lake near agricultural sites and have been associated with pesticides containing as and industrial wastewater flows el badry and khalifa 2017 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 reported the occurrence of as related to the oxidation of sulfide minerals agricultural and industrial application of as in south africa likewise the occurrence of as was associated with the presence of gold deposits gbogbo et al 2017 and industrial activities asante et al 2012 the as occurrence in the semi arid regions of west africa is due to the geogenic oxidation of sulfide minerals in auriferous zones of volcano sedimentary schists and volcanic rocks of birimian formation bretzler et al 2019 in the eastern part of the main rift valley of ethiopia high levels of as have been associated with weathering of fluvio volcano lacustrine rocks hydrothermal water associated with high ph geochemical environment rango et al 2010 2013 in kenya and tanzania the elevated concentrations of as have been associated with oxidation of arsenopyrite in mine wastes and tailings kassenga and mato 2008 nyanza et al 2014 ogola et al 2002 yang et al 2017 the concentrations of as were found close to the who drinking water guideline except some hotspots both in shallow groundwater and surface water sources in areas in close proximity of the gold mining activities in northern tanzania the concentration of as ranged between 1 and 300 μg l and nearly 53 of all analyzed samples exceeded the who guideline value of 10 μg l lucca et al 2018 from the perspectives of drinking water safety the world health organization who recommended 10 μg l as a maximum allowable concentration mac guideline value in water sources used for drinking purpose cotruvo 2017 consumption of drinking water with as levels above the guideline value poses a significant risk to human health kapaj et al 2006 ahmad and bhattacharya 2018 maity et al 2012 the long term exposure of as can lead to skin lesions internal organ cancer bladder lung kidney liver and premature birth gbaruko et al 2008 jain and ali 2000 kapaj et al 2006 kar et al 2011 maity et al 2012 samal et al 2021 smith et al 1992 von ehrenstein et al 2006 thus as removal from water is one of the mitigation strategies in the current global research maity et al 2019a b 2021a b arsenic removal is well documented worldwide through the application of precipitation adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis nanofiltration oxidation and bioremediation ahmad et al 2018 ahmad et al 2017 bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b jana et al 2000 maity et al 2019a 2019b maity et al 2021a b adsorption is the most preferred method because it is simple affordable and eco friendly ahmad et al 2020a b maity et al 2019a 2019b maity et al 2021a b roy et al 2013 however adsorption is highly affected by ph contact time concentration the surface area of the adsorbent and redox potential many adsorbents have been applied to remove as at both laboratory and field scale maity et al maity et al 2019a 2019b maity et al 2021a b the selection of adsorbent depends not only on its availability but also on its adsorptive capacity regeneration and cost iron fe and aluminum al based adsorbents are preferable to remove as at lower ph in which fe has a high affinity towards as where the calcium ca based materials precipitate arsenic at higher ph ahmad et al 2020c herath et al 2016 maity et al 2019a 2019b maity et al 2021a b thus locally available adsorbent materials in africa such as soils sands magnesite bauxite iron ore gypsum wood char bone char and activated carbon from agricultural wastes have inculcated an interest among researchers to opt their application in water treatment in tanzania the local adsorbent materials such as magnesite bauxite and gypsum have been successfully tested for fluoride removal mndolwa and mtalo 2021 thole et al 2013 thereby creating a curiosity to investigate their efficiency to remove as from water taking into consideration that inorganic as affects the human health through consumption of contaminated water and food the african society needs awareness on the occurrence of as in different regions and the potential pathways of exposure for developing better control measures thus the current review addresses the potential as sources in the specific african region spatial variability as well as affordable removal techniques the essence of this review paper is to create awareness and insights to researchers on investigating the link between as contamination in drinking water sources and cancer cases especially in the mining areas as well as the impact of climatic change on the release of as from different sources and its mobilization in different environmental compartment in africa in addition the review paper aims at exploring the state of the art remediation technologies to ensure the drinking water security that are sustainable and affordable for as removal from water 2 methodology the current study is based on a compilation of information gathered from diverse sources through a scan of the published literature in different search engines such as google scholar and sciencedirect different search words were applied during the literature search such as arsenic in africa arsenic in the environment africa contaminated water from arsenic natural sources of arsenic anthropogenic sources of arsenic water contaminated by arsenic in africa climate factors controlling the release arsenic into the water arsenic health problem in africa arsenic remediation removal from water in africa sustainable arsenic remediation local material for arsenic removal and arsenic disposal methods most literature were within the year 2000 2022 but few research works emerging out of the literature search were prior to 2000 between 1989 and 1999 were potentially significant to bring scientific insight on building the scientific understanding relevant for understanding the occurrences of as for the concerns and raising awareness in africa the concentration range of as and mean values in different environmental matrices from various african countries are presented in table 1 the collected information was processed in arcgis software version 10 6 1 to create the continental wide map presented in fig 1 these data were also used for calculating as percentage levels in different water sources in africa compared to who guideline value of 10 μg l 3 arsenic sources and its spatial variability in africa most of the african countries are well endowed with natural precious minerals coal gold diamond silver cobalt copper iron ores bauxite zinc and many minerals making african continent the largest mineral producer at a global scale mining activities both small medium and large scale are in full swing in many countries in africa causing several disturbances in the local geological settings which trigger the release of toxic elements in drinking water sources among the surveyed studies the elevated concentrations of as between 0 02 and 1760 μg l and up to 10 000 μg l have been reported both in groundwater and surface systems respectively and are associated with natural weathering processes and anthropogenic activities fig 1 ahoulé et al 2015 other factors causing the prevalence of as in elevated concentrations within the aquatic environment include climate change effects accelerating the landscape dynamics mainly in the homologous tectonic settings of andean and himalaya basin aquifers in latin america and south asia respectively and thus the recharge or discharge of groundwater due to droughts and flooding triggers as release in the environment coomar et al 2019 high levels of as have been reported in numerous environmental matrices including soils sediments mine tailings plants urine and fish in some parts of african regions as summarized in fig 1 and table 1 elevated concentrations of as in soils ranging between 0 001 and 20 298 μg g were reported in parts of kenya tanzania south africa and ghana miller et al 2018 nyanza et al 2014 okonkwo 2007 ramudzuli and horn 2014 kortei et al 2020 mensah et al 2020 in the nile delta region of egypt the as concentration in sediment has been reported ranging between 10 and 44 μg g el badry and khalifa 2017 in the mine tailings area in kenya the as concentrations were reported between 0 06 and 76 μg g ogola et al 2002 the recent studies have indicated high levels of as in plants and fish which threatens the life of consumers nyanza et al 2014 recorded concentrations between 0 60 and 1 120 μg g in leaves and roots of cassava plant in rwamagasa village within areas close to small scale and artisanal mining sites similarly outtara et al 2020 in their study have recorded as concentrations between 0 0413 and 0 427 μg g in fish from ivory coast water bodies further studies on as occurrence have reported high levels in human urine particularly among the population living close to small scale and artisanal areas and mining processing sites for example nyanza et al 2019 have reported as concentrations as high as 150 μg l in the urine of pregnant women living within geita gold mining areas in the lake victoria basin in the north western part of tanzania thus the as concentrations in many parts of the african region exceed the who limit of 10 μg l and demonstrates the high spatial variability at a local scale arsenic problem is not only serious in water systems but also in soils sediments vegetables and fish complicating exposure routes to the human body table 1 most researchers on as contamination in the environment had different styles of reporting their results which limited the detailed analysis of the spatial variability in as concentrations for the sake of understanding the arsenic problem at the continental level the minimum and maximum values in each sample type were compared with the who maximum recommended guideline value of 10 μg l for drinking water around 30 of the minimum values exceeded 10 μg l in which one value was recorded in eastern africa tanzania the rest were recorded in the western africa at ghana 50 morocco 25 and togo 12 5 for the maximum values around 74 were above 10 μg l and were spatially distributed in northern 4 3 southern 13 eastern 26 and western 57 parts of africa in the northern part of africa this value was reported in egypt while the rest were reported in zimbabwe 33 3 south africa 33 3 and botswana 33 5 in southern africa similarly the maximum values exceeding 10 μg l were reported in kenya 16 7 ethiopia 33 3 and tanzania 50 in eastern africa in western africa these values were reported in cote d ivoire 7 7 togo 7 7 morocco 15 5 and ghana 69 2 for groundwater samples around 24 of samples consisted of the minimum as concentration exceeding 10 μg l and were spatially distributed in the eastern 14 3 western 28 6 and southern 57 1 parts of africa in the eastern africa as exceeding 10 μg l was reported in ethiopia while others were reported in nigeria and ghana within the western africa more than 10 μg l of as was reported in botswana 25 where 75 of the sample was observed in south africa for the maximum value around 86 of the samples were reported to have as concentration above 10 μg l and were spatially distributed in the eastern 16 7 southern 23 3 and western 60 parts of the africa in the eastern part they were reported in parts of tanzania 20 and ethiopia 80 while then reported in botswana 28 6 and south africa 71 4 in the southern part of africa likewise these values were reported in parts of nigeria and mali 5 6 each burkina faso 22 2 and ghana 66 7 in the western part of africa for the rest of the sample types in table 1 a similar percentage summary as above for urine soils sediments and vegetations was not possible since there are no guidelines now based on the references we consulted therefore based on this collection of information about total as levels in different environmental compartment samples there is an urgent need to further studies on as occurrence in these compartments as they present another route of exposure to humans in africa countries for detailed description of as occurrences in various environmental compartments we divide the african region into five parts including the eastern southern central western and northern sub regions 3 1 arsenic occurrences in the eastern africa in eastern africa as was reported in surface water systems in ethiopia kenya and tanzania respectively fig 1 the minimum concentration of 0 21 μg l dsikowitzky et al 2013 and maximum concentration of 566 μg l rango et al 2013 were reported within parts of the east african rift valley earv in kenya the reported minimum concentration of as was 0 147 μg l outa et al 2020 and the maximum of 22 7 μg l yang et al 2017 in the lake water in parts of the earv similarly the minimum and maximum values of 0 13 and 324 μg l were recorded in geita and mara districts taylor et al 2005 and serengeti districts bowell et al 1995 in gold mining areas around the earv occurrence of as in groundwater systems has been reported in ethiopia and tanzania respectively the minimum 0 6 μg l and maximum 566 μg l value in ethiopian groundwater sources was recorded by rango et al 2013 in the kenyan section of the earv in tanzania the minimum and maximum values of 0 13 and 2 4 μg l respectively were reported by taylor et al 2005 in areas of the geita district traces of as have been reported in mining tailings soils plants and urine in parts of kenya and tanzania the range of 0 06 76 μg g was reported by ogola et al 2002 in mine tailings around the mining areas of kenya in soils as concentrations ranging between 0 183 and 20 298 μg g was detected in the community drinking water sources adjacent to the gold mining areas in geita district north west tanzania nyanza et al 2014 the high levels of as in soil is another health risk particularly to pregnant women in rural areas miller et al 2018 despite the levels of as in toenails for young and adult people differed significantly they correlated positively with as levels in community boreholes used as sources for drinking water r 0 72 r2 0 52 p 0 001 merola et al 2014 likewise the as concentrations between 0 60 and 1 120 μg g were found in cassava plants in rwamagasa village where artisanal and small scale mining are daily activities to support rural livelihood in a longitudinal study on mining and health prospective within gold mining areas nyanza et al 2019 urine samples exhibited as ranging between 0 01 and 150 μg l among pregnant women within and outside the mining areas of the geita district in north west tanzania 3 1 1 arsenic traces by specific country in the eastern africa geogenic processes along the great eastern rift valley earv have a contribution to the as occurrence and distribution in this region however there were several heavy metal studies in which as was not analyzed due to the cost and unavailability of as detection instruments 3 1 1 1 ethiopia the presence of elevated as concentrations in the ethiopian environment is caused by anthropogenic and geogenic processes geogenic processes include tectonic and volcanic activities weathering of as bearing rocks presence of thermal waters and the presence of young volcanic rocks the anthropogenic sources include agricultural and industrial effluents arsenic concentrations ranging between 0 6 and 190 μg l have been reported in many parts of the main ethiopian rift aquifers characterized by the tectonic processes and volcanic activities rango et al 2013 the presence of young volcanic rocks ignimbrites pumice rhyolite trachybasalt and fissural basalts within the main ethiopian rift system is one of the sources of as in the environment reimann et al 2003 exogenic processes such as weathering of volcanic rocks and erosion action have led to fluvio lacustrine deposition thereby forming sedimentary aquifers with groundwater having high levels of as for example 54 of samples collected from the lacustrine aquifer at the ziway shal basin in the northern part of main ethiopian rift had as above who and arsenate was 80 due to oxidative environment rango et al 2013 on the other hand the presence of silicate hydrolysis of rhyolitic rocks led to the release of dissolved sodium and bicarbonate weathered products such as clay minerals and oxides the silicate hydrolysis process removes calcium or magnesium to enhance the release of sodium that causes saline groundwater with a high content of sodium bicarbonate rango et al 2013 identified two distinct hydrochemical facies in the main ethiopian rift i low tds ca mg hco3 water type that characterizes low level of fluoride and as cold springs originating primarily from the basaltic highland outside the rift and ii high tds na hco3 water type characterizes groundwater and geothermal waters emerging from the floor of the rift influences high as level another source of as in the environment is the presence of thermal waters originating from the rift system reimann et al 2003 while 35 of water sources around the main ethiopian rift valley demonstrated safe water with as concentrations below 10 μg l high concentrations up to 156 278 157 and 405 μg l were detected in thermal spring deep thermal well groundwater well and lakes respectively the primary causes of high levels of as in this area are oxidation of fluvio volcano lacustrine rocks presence of na hco3 hydro chemical facies and high ph rango et al 2010 the high ph causes desorption of as from metal hydroxides such as fe al mn in which the sediment leachates at ph 8 may release up to 220 μg l rango et al 2010 likewise in their study on the as in hot springs water reported above who limit within ethiopian part of east africa rift valley reimann et al 2003 anthropogenic sources of as are active in ethiopian environments industrial effluents and agricultural drains are the two main anthropogenic sources of elevated concentrations of as in the ethiopian environment the study conducted by gebeyehu and bayissa 2020 in the mojo area south of addis ababa where factories discharge effluents at river mojo demonstrated high levels of as in soils irrigated by water from the mojo river for instance the mean value of as in soil samples under tomato cultivation was 21 μg g while it was 30 73 μg g in cabbage growing soil arsenic levels in tomatoes were 24 50 0 50 μg g dry weight and in cabbage 5 73 0 37 μg g dry weight in addition cabbages demonstrated higher levels of as compared to tomatoes 3 1 1 2 kenya limited studies on as occurrence in the kenyan environment were retrieved and the dominating sources were gold mining activities mainly in nairobi and kisumu counties apart from as high heavy metal concentrations above who recommended guideline were reported around the gold mining areas ogola et al 2002 arsenic concentrations in mine tailings ranged between 0 06 and 76 0 μg g where the sediments had concentrations between 0 014 and 1 87 μg g the nairobi tailing sediments exhibited the as concentration of 76 μg g wherein river kuja sediments ranged between 0 08 and 0 92 μg g and migori river sediments 0 03 and 1 87 μg g however there was a challenge when detecting as concentration in river water sample due to metal hydroxides precipitation before analysis in the laboratory furthermore the kisumu tailings demonstrated the as concentrations between 1 75 μg g and 4 65 μg g 3 1 1 3 tanzania the major part of the hydrogeology of tanzania is dominated by crystalline basement complex aquifer nwankwo et al 2020 from phanerozoic upper paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic and the precambrian archean and proterozoic human activities mining small industries and agricultural activities cause contamination of as in soil surface water and groundwater taylor et al 2005 kassenga and mato 2008 almås and manoko 2012 nyanza et al 2014 the concentrations of as in the tanzanian environment are expected to increase in the future due to mining activities such as coal mining gold mining iron mining gas mining and diamond mining that reduce the quality of drinking water sources the oxidation of exposed arsenopyrite is the main source of as in the environment particularly in drinking water sources during the mining process kassenga and mato 2008 recently the sida funded project dafwat focused on water sediments and rocks linked with drinking water sources in which the reported as concentrations range ranging between 10 and 300 μg l the petrographic study of rock in geita and mara regions revealed high content of arsenopyrite pyrites and chalcopyrite fig 2 where as levels ranging between 47 and 270 μg g unpublished are likely to cause future health effects due to lack of preventive measures a recent study in and out site of the small scale gold mining areas of northwest tanzania reported elevated as concentrations in soils even outside the mining areas indication that as occurrence is a natural phenomena in such settings nyanza et al 2019 similary nyanza et al 2014 also reported that 33 3 of the water samples in rwamagasa had as levels above who guideline with the measured concentration ranging between 43 μg l and 110 μg l the as uptake by plants which are the primary source of staple food among rural communities has been reported in some parts of gold mining areas in the north west tanzania for example nyanza et al 2014 reported high levels as in cassava plants water and soil samples the cassava leaves had as ranging between 0 6 and 1 12 μg g while the cassava roots had concentration ranging between 0 25 and 0 31 μg g in soil samples as concentration ranged between 0 183 and 20 298 μg g while some of the soil samples had as concentration above the detection limit of instruments used for the laboratory analysis occurrence of as around mount meru in arusha region was lower between 0 1 and 4 9 μg l tomašek et al 2022 compared to the levels detected around lake victoria basin to improve the awareness of as contamination the local borehole well drillers in tanzania should be enhanced through training on how to choose safe aquifers sources for water sources this is possible through understanding the relationship of the color of the aquifer sediments with the water chemistry similar to the color tool which was successfully developed in bangladesh hossain et al 2014 annaduzzaman et al 2018 in terms of health effects there are no documented human health effects but the data obtained from ocean road cancer institute in dar es salaam tanzania indicated that most of the referral cases of cancer patients were from the lake victoria basin thus more studies are required to establish relationships between cancer cases and as contamination from drinking water sources and other environmental compartments mainly in the mining areas of tanzania 3 2 arsenic occurrence in southern africa the anthropogenic and geogenic sources are the major cause of the elevated as levels particularly in soils and water within the southern region despite the common causes the levels of as vary considerably among countries and within the same country they exhibit high spatial variability arsenic concentrations between 0 62 and 119 μg l were reported in the surface water systems of cape town and koekemoe spruit akinsoji et al 2013 dzoma et al 2010 in botswana the minimum 1 μg and maximum up to 188 μg l values of as were recorded by mladenov et al 2014 in the okavango delta however the minimum and maximum values of 3 2 μg l and 185 μg l respectively were recorded in the same region by mladenov et al 2014 nephalama and muzerengi 2016 reported the minimum 830 μg l and maximum 1 553 000 μg l values of as concentration in groundwater systems of limpopo province thus the diversity of as occurrence is noticed in various environmental compartments of the southern african region table 1 3 2 1 arsenic occurrence by specific country in southern africa 3 2 1 1 arsenic in south africa the release of as in the south african environment mainly depends on the sulfide minerals oxidation agricultural and industrial practice glass manufacturing semiconductors steel melting dye manufacturing wood preservatives insecticides etc abiye and bhattacharya 2019 in johannesburg the as concentrations range between 17 and 318 μg l in groundwater while in 2016 the as ranged between 830 and 1 553 000 μg l abiye and bhattacharya 2019 likewise abiye and bhattacharya 2019 reported as concentration ranging between 20 and 240 μg l and between 20 and 253 μg l in water sources characterized by reducing high ph and oxidizing low ph conditions respectively the predominant as species in the aforementioned environmental compartments is as v the as investigation done on soil samples collected from abandoned cattle dips showed high as levels between 1033 and 1369 μg g suggesting a potential risk to groundwater based drinking water sources okonkwo 2007 a similar cattle dip study in limpopo province reported as occurrence at different depths and the as concentrations ranged between 0 001 and 6 88 μg g at 10 20 and 300 m below ground surface respectively ramudzuli and horn 2014 the presence of clay in the soil profile within cattle dipping areas could be reducing the as leaching down the soil vein shapi et al 2020 recorded as concentration range between 5 and 170 3 μg g in the krugersdorp game reserve environment in gauteng south africa similarly mudzielwana et al 2020 recorded as concentrations ranging between 0 1 and 172 52 μg l with an average of 32 21 μg l in the na hco3 and ca na hco3 water type of the greater giyani municipality limpopo province nevertheless as levels below 10 μg l in northwest province south africa was reported between 0 and 8 1 μg l masindi and foteinis 2021 3 2 1 2 botswana in okavango delta mladenov et al 2014 recorded total as ranging between 87 5 and 185 μg l in wells and associated its occurrence with geogenic processes such as sulfidic mineral weathering high alkalinity evapotranspiration the high ph dissolution of orpiment presence of dissolved organic matter lead to as mobility in groundwater through complexation reactions where the hydrological biological and chemical processes control such mobilization together with the water types for example mladenov et al 2014 recorded high as levels in na k hco3 water type which differed slightly with that reported by rango et al 2013 in ethiopian rift valley the high as about 900 μg l was detected in organic samples collected from the sandy bottom of the boro river channel while termite mound collected from concentration zone 101 m from water edge in the north of sampled transect had as concentration of 138 μg l mladenov et al 2014 in addition sracek et al 2021 recorded as concentrations ranging 10 and 49 μg l in the weathered manganese rich mining tailings of kanye area southeast of botswana 3 3 arsenic occurrences in the western africa this study retrieved few study reports from different sources most of them focused on as occurrence in surface water systems groundwater systems soil urine and fish the studies were conducted in six countries of this process region including ghana ivory coast burkina faso mali togo and nigeria fig 1 in ghana as concentrations ranging between 0 003 and 28 950 μg l were recorded in surface water mainly from ankobra river rossiter et al 2010 akabzaa et al 2009 although no direct study on as occurrence in surface water systems in cote d ivoire the high levels up to 427 μg kg was recorded in fish outtara et al 2020 suggesting the availability of elevated as concentrations in surface water systems and sediments in burkina faso ouédraogo and amyot 2013 recorded the minimum value of 0 039 μg l in yatenga province likewise smedley et al 2007 recorded the minimum and maximum values of 0 5 μg l and 1630 μg l in yatenga and zendoma provinces furthermore the high spatial variability in as concentrations have been reported in soils and urine in some countries within the western africa kortei et al 2020 reported the minimum value of 0 00163 μg g in soil within the volta region whereas mensah et al 2020 reported the maximum value of 8401 μg g in the topsoils within the mining areas on the other hand asante et al 2012 reported as concentration of 17 μg l in urine among e waste workers in ghana despite unclear sources of as in water system bokar et al 2020 recorded high as levels between 16 and 139 μg l in water samples from sanson village in mali 3 3 1 potential occurrence by specific country in western africa 3 3 1 1 ghana the ankobra river basin is famous for production of gold for about 81 in ghana arsenic recorded in water samples from the three rivers ranged between 600 and 2200 μg l gbogbo et al 2017 the ankobra river sediments could be the main source of high levels of as in different environmental compartments for example gbogbo et al 2017 recorded as concentrations ranging between 0 2 and 2 8 μg g in aquatic fauna species such as fish and shellfish likewise asante et al 2012 recorded high as concentration in urine samples among the e waste workers in accra ghana consuming fish and other seafood characterized by arsenobetaine and dimethylarsinic acid together with drinking water with as concentration of 17 μg l hydrogeochemical studies done in takwa mining area of ghana recorded as concentration of 69 4 μg l in eyinaise site bhattacharya et al 2012 affum et al 2015 reported high levels of as ranging between 44 and 136 μg l in groundwater based drinking water sources in the western region of ghana characterized by high sulfate ions ranging between 34 900 and 172000 μg l in this region the cancer slope factor of as reported was 1 5 μg l day probably originating from the clay eaten soil by pregnant women where the recorded as mean value was 0 00163 0 00003 μg g kortei et al 2020 mensah et al 2020 reported also high as in abandoned and active mine spoils of ghana the as concentration in mining topsoils ranged between 1807 and 8401 μg g mensah et al 2020 in the abandoned profile samples as concentration varied with depth and ranged between 3105 and 4142 μg g at the active gold mine spoil as concentration ranged between 2034 and 3801 μg g where scorodite feasso4 and arsenopyrite feass were the two main as bearing mineral phases mainly in the mine spoil mensah et al 2020 3 3 1 2 arsenic in burkina faso and cote d ivoire ouédraogo and amyot 2013 reported low as concentration ranging between 0 039 and 0 42 μg g the author suggests that this aquatic ecosystem was not contaminated since dissolved as mean in water was 512 152 μg l while total as in fish ranged from 0 04 to 0 42 μg g ouédraogo and amyot 2013 in 2018 as concentration that was found ranges between 1 39 and 13 9 μg l and the concentrations were higher during flood season were reported from three rivers in west africa bandama river comoe river and bia river ouattara et al 2018 the as concentration in comoe and bia river threaten the health of about 3 million people in southern cote d ivoire ouattara et al 2018 the study was done in cote d ivoire rivers bandama comoe bia on fish species reveals as concentration ranges 0 0209 0 427 μg g in muscles of chrysithys nigrodigitatus and range of 0 00413 0 357 μg g sarothrodon melanotheron while the concentration was higher in bandama river even though the bioaccumulation factor is less ensures no health risk will occur due to consumption of fish in this area outtara et al 2020 the highest concentration of 333 μg l as was reported from poura west africa in 2018 bretzler et al 2019 the source of as is due to oxidation of sulfide minerals in auriferous zones volcano sedimentary schists and volcanic rocks of birimian formation the groundwater of this area was classified as oxic due to high eh 380 500 mv bretzler et al 2019 arsenic are contaminating rice and sediments in cote d ivore ranging 0 1 5 8 μg g at boniko and 0 3 2 15 μg g at agbaou sourced from gold mining leaches and agricultural activities kinimo et al 2021 3 3 1 3 mali arsenic was reported to be found in water sediments and plants the highest as in water at sanso village ranges 16 139 μg l and plants had concentration ranges 0 1 45 9 μg g dry weight where the highest concentration in sediments at the background downstream and within mining were 44 μg g 200 μg g 1928 μg g respectively bokar et al 2020 3 3 1 4 nigeria the as study from the limestone belt of ogun state reported as mean value from all sampled aquifers to be above who of 10 μg l gbadebo 2005 the as status of aiba reservoir iwo nigeria was stated to be lower in water and sediments but higher in fish liver and kidney with mean value 15 4 14 μg l and 12 2 73 μg l respectively atobatele and olutona 2015 heavy metals at woji southern nigeria were revealed in water sediments and fish mugil cephalus but as was not detected due to the inconvenience of the instrument used aas with detection limit 0 1 μg l ihunwo et al 2020 3 4 arsenic occurrence in northern and central africa there was very limited information on as in the environment retrieved in countries within the central part of africa recently although few studies were retrieved for countries in the northern part as concentrations demonstrated a large scale of variation with minimum and maximum value of 38 9 μg l and 199 6 μg l respectively as recorded by el hachimi et al 2007 in surface water sources of upper moulouya in morocco table 1 furthermore low and high levels of as have been reported in surface water systems in egypt the as range of 1 2 μg l and 13 2 μg l was recorded by abdel moati 1990 within the nile delta similarly high levels of as between 10 and 44 μg g have been reported in sediments in egypt el badry and khalifa 2017 3 4 1 potential sources of as in the northern africa the study was done in northern egyptian delta lake burullus lagoon which shows ranges 10 44 μg g as contamination in river sediment above who of 10 μg l el badry and khalifa 2017 the source of metal contamination is reported high near the agricultural areas due to pesticides that contain as while industrial drains towards the southern area of the lagoon and also contributes as pollution to the surrounding environment the study on the hydro chemical characteristic in the southern part of upper egypt along the nile between qena and luxor revealed a high concentration of heavy metals except as thus contamination is caused by high sodium and bicarbonate whereby sodium ranges 52 540 481 000 μg l and hco3 ranges 90 000 933 300 μg l abdalla and khalil 2018 snousy and morsi 2020 3 5 different climatic factors affecting as release in the groundwater the possible impact of climatic change on as release in groundwater systems is not yet studied in africa however there is limited literature on climate change predicting future impacts on the african water system water quality supply and food security due to the rise of temperature and decrease of rainfall banks et al 2021 bonsor et al 2011 cuthbert et al 2019 faye 2019 gizaw and gan 2017 hendrix and glaser 2007 lapworth et al 2013 macallister et al 2020 macdonald et al 2009 serdeczny et al 2017 urama and ozor 2010 wright and norval 2020 the motivation here was to incorporate climate change effects on groundwater contamination as reported from other countries such as asia and south america coomar et al 2019 to contribute future knowledge on climatic effects in african although not quantified at the regional level in many parts of the african continent the quantity of surface water sources has been declining due to climate change impacts especially in arid and semi arid environments cobbing and hiller 2019 in such environments groundwater accounts for approximately 80 of water demand for domestic industrial and agricultural activities cobbing and hiller 2019 the release of as in groundwater systems has been depend on climatic factors e g droughts flooding land use pattern depth of an aquifer etc coomar et al 2019 reported climatic effects on surface and subsurface water e g rainfall effect on recharge fall and rise of water table oxidation and reduction in aquifer system and land use pattern e g irrigation induced recharge and sanitation which cause to as release into the groundwater high increase in temperature on the surface of the earth due to global warming induces droughts which cause accumulation of chemicals such as chlorine fluoride as in the soil or aquifers for long period and during rainfall these chemicals are infused into the aquifer to contaminate groundwater 3 5 1 droughts africa has been facing drought events in southern africa and sahel regions gizaw and gan 2017 urama and ozor 2010 african countries facing drought e g tanzania burundi congo ethiopia eritrea gambia prolonged drought e g namibia south africa recurring drought e g kenya mali niger zimbabwe burkina faso periodic drought e g egypt chad botswana senegal rwanda nigeria morocco lesotho gizaw and gan 2017 urama and ozor 2010 are reported to have as contamination the prolonged droughts periods will decrease recharge and lead to water table decline the decline in water table exposes the aquifer sulfide minerals to oxygen and the sulfide mineral will be oxidized to release as into groundwater bondu et al 2016 the decrease in recharge during droughts may cause a decrease in groundwater flow thereby increasing the occurrence of elevated as concentrations at high evolved geochemical groundwater due to prolonged low flow than in less evolved geochemical groundwater bondu et al 2016 the prolonged low flow signifies less dilution of contaminants and this increases residence time that led to as mobilization from reductive dissolution 3 5 2 flooding most african countries faces flooding during rainy e g congo cote d ivoire burundi angola zimbabwe some parts of tanzania south africa senegal mozambique kenya urama and ozor 2010 heavy rainfall may influence rapid recharge in the areas which were affected by prolonged droughts this phenomenon increases the flushing of contaminants that were accumulated at unsaturated zones during the drought period and deposits these contaminants in the aquifers bondu et al 2016 in addition the recharge area also increases sulfide oxidation when water diffuses into fractured aquifers to increase oxygen supply and organic matter coomar et al 2019 hence release of as into groundwater 3 5 3 land use pattern the climate of an area has a high impact on the land use patterns which depend largely on water availability during the drought period groundwater uses for human activities increase due to the unavailability of surface water sources bondu et al 2016 the groundwater abstraction leads to the decline of the water table and accelerates as mobilization in groundwater systems likewise human activities such as mining industries and irrigation consume large amounts of water abstracted from the subsurface irrigation has depleted groundwater storage in semi arid and arid areas due to intensive abstraction taylor et al 2013 in irrigation areas there is recharge from irrigated water which will degrade groundwater quality by inducing contaminants such as as in the aquifers coomar et al 2019 3 5 4 depth of an aquifer aquifer characteristics play important role in ensuring safe water for drinking purposes in the african continent groundwater is abstracted through shallow wells boreholes and natural springs the shallow wells usually target small and unconfined aquifers whereas boreholes target intermediate and deep aquifers which are relatively large in extent in a deep aquifer the atmospheric oxygen is not supplied hence no sulfide oxidation although the absence of oxygen triggers a reducing condition to release as into groundwater coomar et al 2019 in countries like tanzania shallow aquifers are not regulated and most of them are used as an alternative source of water for domestic use among urban and rural communities in terms of contamination the small shallow unconfined aquifers are exposed more to water table decline than larger deeper confined aquifers bondu et al 2016 this is likely to accelerate the mobilization of geogenic contaminants such as as due to low groundwater flow in shallow aquifers 3 6 strength and weakness of arsenic studies in africa all studies conducted in africa have contributed useful knowledge to policymakers and ministries of water in specific country to put into a plan the accountability of as contamination in the water supply systems there should be no water supply without checking the levels of hazardous geogenic chemicals such as as the borehole drillers should be controlled by the responsible ministry to reduce the effect of drilling unsafe aquifers however most of the as studies were conducted under projects funded from europe and there is no continuation of study once the project period is over there are limited laboratory facilities for as analysis in africa inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy mass spectrometry icp oes ms due to resource constraints for operation and maintenance hence many researchers escape as analysis during heavy metal studies therefore each specific country should prepare funds to enhance scientific research on as investigation at least once per year to ensure a safe water supply in africa moreover as effect in africa is predicted to increase in future years due to human activities as well as natural processes during the survey of as in africa there was not enough data from samples water soil sediments fish and vegetation to cover enough area that could attract spatial variability observations thus few studies are not enough to exploit the whole impact of as in africa the few health problems reported in ghana and burkina faso ahoulé et al 2015 ethiopia and tanzania signify that as is a silent killer as it takes a longer period for a person to develop characteristics of cancer and internal organ failure the uncovered causes of cancer from many patients living near the gold mining area are still a challenge in africa more clinical proofs are required to link as and cancer issues 4 arsenic removal arsenic removal technologies are well documented worldwide ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 ahmad et al 2018 ahmad et al 2020c ahmad et al 2020c ahmad et al 2020c alkurdi et al 2019 bundschuh et al 2011 ghosh et al 2019 litter et al 2019 maity et al 2021a b maity et al 2019a 2019b mohan and pittman 2007 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 and alternatives for safe drinking water supply have been extensively discussed bhattacharya et al 1997 the use of natural geological materials such as hematite goethite soils and sediments for as adsorption in water has been documented bundschuh et al 2010a 2010b availability of local materials in african areas such as soils sands magnesite bauxite iron ores gypsum wood char bone char and activated carbon from agricultural waste encourages the community to opt for their application against expensive technologies such as reverse osmosis and electrodialysis the water treatment methods using phytoremediation by plant species such as vallisneria natans and pteris vittata chinese brake fern are also significantly reported fu et al 2017 ma et al 2001 raj and maiti 2020 vithanage et al 2012 plants can accumulate as in fronds in the range of 3 98 6 18 mg plant and in the roots ranges 0 94 284 mg plant gonzaga et al 2007 however the efficiencies of these plants were reported to be affected by plant age phosphate concentration and re use kabir and chowdhury 2017 furthermore species of pteris vittata vetiveriaa zizanoides phragmites australis have been found effective to be planted in rice farms for reducing as uptake in rice abedi and mojiri 2020 table 2 shows common as removal technologies that are applied worldwide most of the technologies are expensive to be afforded in developing countries in africa the electrodialysis was stated to cost us 3 40 per m3 of water membrane costs us 600 per m3 of water reverse osmosis costs us 3 72 per m3 of water coagulation costs us 1 0 per m3 of water and nanofiltration cost ranges us 1 41 1 84 per m3 of water kabir and chowdhury 2017 the high costs of these technologies suggest that the resource poor countries should rely on cheap and locally available natural materials for water treatment among the technologies listed in table 2 the application of iron coated sand filters have a significant advantage on water treatment for being a cheap method 4 1 locally available adsorptive materials and techniques the local easily available as adsorption techniques are globally documented bundschuh et al 2010a 2010b maity et al 2021a b biochar mineral rocks and agricultural wastes have been used for decades for heavy metal removal from water due to high surface area porosity and active sites this section provides insight into existing knowledge of local available adsorbent materials that were used in previous worldwide studies our interest is to recommend the application of locally adsorbent materials to the lower income countries around africa however the limitations on the use of these materials in the fieldwork require more studies since most experiments were only successful at the laboratory scale the discussion below summarizes results reported from adsorption studies conducted using locally available materials worldwide thus wood char shows high adsorption capacity compared to other local materials such as magnesite gypsum bauxite and calcined hematite table 3 bone char bone charcoal contains apatite with a high surface area that could allow as adsorption but the challenge could arise due to phosphate concentration into the bone char which occupies the same active sites for as adsorption hence the recommended modification is to coat bone char with iron oxide to increase surface reactive site for as adsorption the batch experiment on bone char with ph range of 9 13 was reported by chen et al 2008 to be good for removing as v in a high percentage this was enhanced by the presence of surface hydroxyl groups and co precipitation between calcium hydrogen arsenate with hydroxylapatite on the char surface the adsorption removal followed a first order reaction and reached 99 18 equilibrium time at an initial as concentration of 500 μg l and rate constant of 0 14 min 1 the author reported arsenate removal on bone char being complex which was both surface adsorption as well as intraparticle diffusion contributes to the rate determining step chen and chai 2008 the ftir of 3570 cm 1 on the bone char has shown a broad band for oh which is associated with hydrogen bond stretch of hydroxyl apatite of the char and hence the ca oh exchanged with haso4 2 during the adsorption process the author reported that the removal of arsenate from aqueous solution was both the adsorption co precipitation and ion exchange which can be represented in equations 1 and 2 1 c a 10 p o 4 6

second order with rate constant of 2 7 10 5 4 5 10 5 1 5 10 4 and initial concentrations of 2000 10 000 50 000 μg l and the equilibrium rate was reported to be affected by the initial concentration of as v langmuir model was used to explain the adsorption in which it gave the maximum capacity of 0 335 mg g at ph 4 with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 97 the electrostatic interaction and ligand exchange were thought to be the main adsorption mechanism on the bone char while the po4 3 was the most competitive anion in the solution wood char plant woods are locally available natural materials and their char is porous with high surface area been used to adsorb unpleasant contaminants from drinking water sources mohan and pittman 2007 reviewed on plant parts wood bark that when heated in a furnace at 400 c 450 c form chars that have a porous surface with a high ability to adsorb as and other heavy metal contaminants an investigation on the sorption capacity using wood char through batch experiments showed high as iii adsorption when ph rises from 2 to 4 in which oak bark exhibited higher capacity on langmuir and freundlich isotherms the authors suggest that the char surface area could be increased through steam activation to improve sorption capacity another study wang et al 2015 investigated as removal on pinewood char and pinewood char coated with hematite the pinewood char increases sorption efficiency when combined with natural hematite to form a magnetic composite material with high active sites for as adsorption wang et al 2015 the pinewood char coated with hematite shows rapid and slower phases which were related to an outer sphere and inner sphere formations the langmuir model explained well the sorption of as with maximum sorption of 265 μg g pinewood char and 429 μg g pinewood coated with hematite the author recommended more investigation to be done on lifecycle cost analysis for as removal on hematite doped pinewood char laterite soil laterite soil is a red colored clay rich soil that consists of aluminium silicates aluminium hydrosilicates iron oxides and iron hydroxides with high iron content which gives red color soil red soil has high efficiency towards as adsorption the as removal study that was done using batch experiment maji et al 2008 reported high removal using an adsorbent dose of 20 g l at 30 min and efficiency removal rises when adsorbent dose increases the column of 2 cm diameter 55 cm length packed with laterite soil 10 cm depth at flow rate 1 49 m3 m2 h 7 75ml min revealed 98 removal at an initial concentration of 330 μg l and the adsorbent dose of 20 000 μg l at 30 min equilibrium time with a breakthrough time of 6 75 h and exhaust time of 19 h maji et al 2007 the column height on adsorption zone was reduced to 9 85 cm at the rate of 0 8 cm h movement through the bed while saturation at a breakthrough was 47 12 the fixed bed column using a logistic method gave adsorption capacity coefficient of 69 220 μg l which are useful values to design a large scale adsorption column to indicate that adsorption was not represented by langmuir and freundlich the author relates the problem with as existence in different oxidation states which could lead to mixed model adsorption and suggests the dubinin radushkevich isotherm to be used in which gave the maximum adsorption capacity of 170 μg g with energy e of 6 8 kj mol that means the adsorption occurred physically the isotherm studies such as rl obtained from rl 1 1 bc0 was 0 099 and gibbs free energy of 8 30 indicated that the sorption process was favorable and spontaneous the desorption test showed no ions were released from the soil hence it is an environmentally friendly adsorbent the used soil was regenerated by naoh solution rinsed with distilled water and became more porous after regeneration maji et al 2007 applied laterite soil on fixed bed column for as iii removal the adsorption capacity was 108 020 μg l ferralite soil bhattacharyya et al 2003 revealed that the ferralite from purulia bankura and mednipur had a high capacity to remove as to above 80 at ph 8 5 the author reported that the presence of competitive anions such as phosphate and sulfate in the solution did not affect adsorption onto ferralite oxisol soil the weathered soil like oxisol which consisted of al2o3 26 fe2o3 11 al silicates 16 and quartz 44 with a surface area of 35 7 m2 g have been reported as efficient adsorbent removal material for all as oxidation states in aqueous solutions at ph 5 5 ladeira and ciminelli 2004 the adsorption capacity of oxisol soil was 3200 μg g as v thus 4 times lesser to goethite which had 12 400 μg g and for as iii was 2600 μg g which is about 3 times lesser than 7500 μg g for goethite the desorption studies using sulfate solution have shown much as iii being released from the oxisol than as v bauxite in bauxite the aluminum ion equation 3 has shown good performance on removing as from contaminated water mohapatra et al 2008 mohapatra et al 2007 the investigation by mohapatra et al 2008 for the adsorption of as v onto the calcined bauxite surface occurred at point zero charge ph 7 54 the column study was found to improve adsorption due to increase in surface area from 24 1 to 32 2 m2 g and porosity from 21 7 to 30 5 of non calcined bauxite while the maximum adsorption capacity on the column was 1710 μg g 3 a l 3 a q h a s o 4 a q a l a s o 4 s h a q the ph of 4 7 has given high adsorption with less final as concentration 010 μg l from the initial concentration of 2000 μg l and calcined bauxite of 5 g l while it declined with 360 μg l at ph 10 langmuir model on the batch experiment was explained well with a maximum adsorption capacity of 1780 μg g and r2 of 0 99 while the freundlich model had a correlation coefficient of 0 89 the presence of silicate phosphate and temperature was reported to hinder as adsorption from 99 to 83 when silicate increases and to 84 when phosphate increases usually when temperature increases from 25 c 70 c the adsorption was reported to decrease by 6 to reveal that increase in temperature lowered the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent material the regeneration of bauxite material was done by flushing the material using 0 1 m naoh in the column at a pressure of 200 ml h another study by mohapatra et al 2007 reported on the bauxite with high alumina and low iron against that with high iron revealed low alumina content the bauxite with high alumina content had adsorption capacity of 1490 μg g was better than the other the author suggested that the adsorption was governed by inner sphere complexation because it does not depend on ionic strength the adsorption of as v occurred at ph 4 to 7 5 and was explained well by the pseudo second order reaction equation magnesite magnesite the magnesium ion equation 4 has an active effect on as uptake from water magnesite is also a locally available material that is useful for as and fluoride adsorption magnesite has shown a high capacity of 1400 μg g on removing as from mine effluent with ph 2 which raise ph to above 10 masindi and gitari 2016 the removal percentage increases with an increase in dosage as well as with contact time whereby 1 g within 15 min were reported to be enough for as removal from 20 000 μg l aqueous solutions the results fitted well on pseudo second order reaction with a rate constant of 1700 μg min in which the author suggests that the rate limiting step was chemisorption due to kinetic type observed the adsorption decreases with an increase in as concentration and 20 000 μg l was optimum concentration reported to be enough for 1 g adsorbent 4 3 m g 2 a q 2 a s o 4 3 a q m g 3 a s o 4 2 s gypsum gypsum is a locally available material in tanzania and has proved better on the removal of fluoride from water sources in arusha tanzania thole et al 2013 the study done on as reported that as can be removed up to 19 000 μg g from aqueous solution in presence of crystallized gypsum at higher ph 7 to form calcium arsenate precipitates which are less toxic zhang et al 2015 the precipitation process can be represented in equation 5 5 3 c a 3 a q 2 h a s o 4 2 a q c a 3 a s o 4 2 s 2 h a q iron ores iron ores producing iron ion equation 6 have been used for as removal due to their content of hematite and goethite which usually adsorb as efficiently even though silicate and phosphate interfere with the as adsorption zhang et al 2004 the iron ores from hamersley ranges of western australia were tested especially on the sample that had high hematite 5 g l at ph 4 5 6 5 and gave a high capacity of 400 μg g on as removal in which the data fitted well to langmuir isotherm as well as first order kinetic zhang et al 2004 in another study the porous hematite prepared from calcined goethite was used for as removal in presence of competitive anions such as phosphate the maximum capacity was increased to 5670 μg g when 0 01 m nacl was added yang et al 2015 iron based backwashing sludge fbbs was used to remove trivalent as and it showed promising results of 59 700 μg g maximum adsorption under langmuir isotherm at ph 7 wu et al 2013 but the desorption studies have shown that the as release increases due to high ph and phosphate the effect of desorption could be minimized by adding gypsum on the used adsorbent materials das et al 2015 jia

reported to give low results adsorption capacity due to repulsion force between the negatively charged zeolite surface and as but the studies done on modified zeolites coated with iron oxide has shown high removal of 44 385 μg g as v under langmuir isotherm at ph 6 4 habuda stanić et al 2008 another study on coating zeolites with iron oxide and or aluminum resulted a higher adsorption while a mixture of both fe al onto zeolites had a higher adsorption capacity of 5000 μg g than single metal oxide coating simsek et al 2013 the kinetic study using aluminium and iron oxide coated zeolites reflected a promising removal of 74 and 65 of as v respectively at 8 h while the adsorption capacity of iron coated zeolites was 2716 μg g simsek and beker 2014 the experiment explained well the

limited removal studies in africa arsenic mitigation processes can be learned from experience in bangladesh alaerts and khouri 2004 hoque et al 2006 mondal 2015 hossain et al 2014 2015 sustainable mitigation of as was reported as two options 1 using alternative water sources or targeting safe aquifers and 2 the use of low cost treatment systems von brömssen et al 2007 jakariya et al 2007 bundschuh et al 2010a 2010b hossain et al 2017 the alternative sources of water were either to use deep groundwater tube well shallow groundwater through adopting well switching dug open tube well use of surface water ponds lakes river and rainwater harvesting shankar et al 2014 furthermore the process of investigating the safe aquifer was given a higher consideration as the community managed to access safe water and help to bore hole drillers in bangladesh redox conditions for safe aquifer were determined by using sediment color tool in which groundwater from black sediments is most reduced followed by white off white and red which are less reduced and less as bundschuh et al 2010a 2010b annaduzzaman et al 2018 the black color sediment was regarded as more contaminated as it contains ca mg hco3 water type and high concentrations of hco3 doc fe2 nh4 po4 while mn and so4 2 are less hossain et al 2014 moreover the use of low cost as treatments should be sustainable cheap easy to operate and repair bhattacharya et al 1997 the sustainable treatment systems in vietnam were reported to be successful through using sand filters tobias and berg 2011 therefore sand filters are becoming popular for as removal in many communities the performance of the filter is enhanced when the surface of the sand is coated by iron oxides to increase active sites that capture as iii and as v through the adsorption process the iron coated sand was reported to remove as from 325 μg l to about 90 with a capacity of 18 3 μg g thirunavukkarasu et al 2001 another study on iron coated sand reported about 99 as removal after 24 h from initial as concentration of 1000 μg l callegari et al 2018 furthermore the use of iron subsurface as removal sars was recently reported in vietnam to remove as below 10 μg l as well as low cost water supply ranging 0 06 0 07 us per m3 cañas kurz et al 2020 remediation techniques attempted around south africa burkina faso ethiopia and tanzania were of both at laboratory scale as well as at household scale thus there were no operating large scale as remediation plants reported in africa until march 2022 arsenic remediation in south africa has shown promising results where sulfate reducing bacteria was applied on treatment of spiked real water solution for 14 days and reported removal was more than 90 and 60 of as v and as iii respectively teclu et al 2013 another study utilizes the autotrophs bacteria baccilus and exiguobacterium that were isolated from cow dip in tzaneen limpopo south africa to oxidize as iii to as v which shows high oxidation at longer incubation time as 12 h 25 72 h 41 240 h 96 igboamalu and chirwa 2018 furthermore as removal was observed from the application of south african sand mixed with zero valent iron zvi which gave 100 as removal when a large column was used trois and cibati 2015 zeolite coated with iron oxide was reported to exhibit the adsorption capacity of 3115 54 180 μg g at ph 3 from an initial concentration ranged 10 000 100 000 μg l bakatula et al 2017 moreover masindi and gitari 2016 reported on the application of magnesite for the treatment of mine effluents which yield an adsorption capacity of 1400 μg g from an initial concentration of 20 000 μg l arsenic removal from iron nails embedded with sand layers reported 60 80 from field setup in souriya village burkina faso for first six months whereas laboratory column showed 95 removal with an effluent of 10 μg l bretzler et al 2020 the mechanism the iron nail sand filters release fe2 which reacts with oxygen to form an oxidant that oxidizes arsenite to arsenate and thus arsenate can be adsorbed by fe3 that was produced at the same moment of producing fe2 the laterite soil mixed with granular ferric hydroxide was reported in bukina faso to remove as from an initial concentration of 500 μg l to obtain an adsorption capacity of 50 μg g sanou and pare 2021 another study applying a termite mound technique for as removal of 99 under ph 3 to 9 was reported in ethiopia fufa et al 2014 arsenic removal of 97 with independent of ph when ferrasols adsorbent was applied on water treatment a laboratory scale was reported in tanzania kassenga and mato 2008 most of the remediation techniques were successful on a laboratory scale but cannot be of high efficiency once tested in the field however the use of locally available materials can decrease operating costs in low income countries 4 3 disposal of arsenic waste materials reusability of as removal materials led to as waste generation which requires proper disposal facilities failure to as waste disposal led to the generation of secondary as contamination in the environment the most process used for disposal is stabilization or solidification by ca and fe ii compounds before landfilling to prevent mobility of as most suggestion for stabilized solid waste disposal relies on hazardous or municipal landfills without considering the as re leaching process into the environment however the constructed landfill under strict safety protocols can be safe for disposal of the stabilized sold wastes the liquid waste should be submitted to the destruction unity and the exhausted adsorbents are treated by portland cement to prevent leaching of as into the environment litter et al 2019 as stabilization and solidification by cement caco3 and fe2 forms insoluble precipitates of ca3 aso4 2 and scorodite feaso4 2h2o respectively scorodite being the best stabilizer its stability is increased by the addition of polyferric sulfate and aluminium silicate gel bioremediation using plants can be more feasible to eliminate disposal problems fu et al 2017 it was reported that as accumulated plants can be disposed in the ocean where marine algae convert as into useful nutrient also can be ashed and digested to reduce the amount of deposited biomass mirza et al 2014 however disposal into the ocean is not an ecofriendly method as it contaminates marine organisms more research on how to dispose or degrade as waste material is required for future development and sustainability 5 conclusion the current review covers the general as occurrence concept and spatial variability on limited as studies in africa and affordable removal techniques arsenic occurrence in african environments demonstrates high spatial variability on as concentration between countries and within the same country from one geological area to another based on documented literature as is induced in the environment through natural processes such as weathering of rocks sulfide mineral oxidation bacterial redox and the anthropogenic activities mainly mining coal burning industrial sewage run off emissions and forest fires natural processes can be considered dominant in case of tanzania where as was detected in bore hole located far from mining area climatic factors such as droughts flooding land use pattern depth of an aquifer can also contribute to as release into groundwater in natural waters as exists in two forms of species as iii and as v as is a deadly element that leads to cancers of skin and internal organs such as kidney lungs liver and urinary bladder the main route of as exposure to human are through drinking water and food sources the african studies demonstrate high levels of as in plants such as cassava roots and leaves that are used as staple food among rural communities which create another risk of as exposure to human body some pregnant women are exposed to soil consumption of as contaminated soil mainly in east african countries which can be a risk to unborn infant few as removal studies were reported in africa but its removal efficiency was high at laboratory scale the sustainable as mitigation options such as targeting safe aquifer or alternative sources and utilization of locally available adsorptive systems are proposed for usability in african countries to simplify operations minimize cost and create future research interest as disposal through bioremediation is an ecofriendly choice of disposal however more research is required to investigate its future usability and stability the gaps to be addressed in future are as contamination linked to cancer cases around gold mining areas climate effect to as release into water affordable water treatment techniques and ways better to disposal declaration of competing

11785,during the past two decades several studies on arsenic as occurrence in the environment particularly in surface and groundwater systems have reported high levels of as in many african countries arsenic concentrations up to 10 000 μg l have been reported in surface water systems caused by anthropogenic activities such as mining industrial effluents and municipal solid waste disposals similarly concentrations up to 1760 μg l have been reported in many groundwater systems which account for approximately 60 of drinking water demand in rural africa naturally as is mobilized in groundwater systems through weathering processes and dissolution of as bearing minerals such as sulfides pyrite arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite iron oxides other mineralized granitic and gneissic rocks and climate change factors triggering as release in groundwater recently public health studies in some african countries such as tanzania and ethiopia have reported high levels of as in human tissues such as toenails as well as in urine among pregnant women exposed to as contaminated groundwater respectively in urine concentrations up to 150 μg l were reported among pregnant women depending on as contaminated drinking water within geita gold mining areas in the north western part of tanzania however the studies on as occurrence and mobilization in african water systems as well as related health effects are limited due to the lack of awareness the current study aims to gather information on the occurrence of as in different environmental compartments its spatial variability public health problems and the potential remediation options of as in water sources the study also aims at creating awareness of as contamination in africa and its removal using locally available materials graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic africa sources spatial variability local adsorbents removal 1 introduction arsenic as is a metalloid group va classified as a toxic element that threatens human health it occurs ubiquitously in the environment particularly in the soil water and air and is mobilized by various geogenic and anthropogenic processes bhattacharya et al 1997 bhattacharya et

species as well as organic as e g monomethylarsonic acid dimethylarsinic acid trimethylarsine oxide arsenobetaine and arsenicholine among which inorganic species are more toxic than organic compounds fitz and wenzel 2002 bhattacharya et al 2002a bhattacharyya et al 2003 nriagu et al 2007 herath et al 2016 kumarathilaka et al 2018 hussain et al 2021 in terms of mobility the as iii is highly mobile 25 65 times in the natural environment as compared to as v predominantly due to its electroneutrality ferguson and gavis 1972 hughes 2002 rukh et al 2017 sadiq 1997 generally the release of as into the environment is caused by oxidation of as bearing sulfide minerals weathering of as bearing rocks as desorption from surfaces of mineral iron or manganese oxides reductive dissolution of iron oxides and due to evaporative concentration in arid and semi arid regions ahoulé et al 2015 bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b bhattacharya et al 2004 2007 bissen et al 2003 herath et al 2016 kent and fox 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 anthropogenic processes such as mining agricultural pesticide application industrial discharge and land filling of sewage sludge are also the potential sources of as mandal and suzuki 2002 rukh et al 2017 furthermore the coal burning activities can significantly contribute to as mobilization in the environment finkelman 2004 despite a few documented studies on as occurrence in africa ahoulé et al 2015 indicated both anthropogenic and geogenic activities as the sources of high as levels in the aquatic environment most of the studies focused on anthropogenic sources particularly mining activities industrial effluents and agricultural practices in some countries recently high levels of as have been reported in northern egyptian delta lake near agricultural sites and have been associated with pesticides containing as and industrial wastewater flows el badry and khalifa 2017 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 reported the occurrence of as related to the oxidation of sulfide minerals agricultural and industrial application of as in south africa likewise the occurrence of as was associated with the presence of gold deposits gbogbo et al 2017 and industrial activities asante et al 2012 the as occurrence in the semi arid regions of west africa is due to the geogenic oxidation of sulfide minerals in auriferous zones of volcano sedimentary schists and volcanic rocks of birimian formation bretzler et al 2019 in the eastern part of the main rift valley of ethiopia high levels of as have been associated with weathering of fluvio volcano lacustrine rocks hydrothermal water associated with high ph geochemical environment rango et al 2010 2013 in kenya and tanzania the elevated concentrations of as have been associated with oxidation of arsenopyrite in mine wastes and tailings kassenga and mato 2008 nyanza et al 2014 ogola et al 2002 yang et al 2017 the concentrations of as were found close to the who drinking water guideline except some hotspots both in shallow groundwater and surface water sources in areas in close proximity of the gold mining activities in northern tanzania the concentration of as ranged between 1 and 300 μg l and nearly 53 of all analyzed samples exceeded the who guideline value of 10 μg l lucca et al 2018 from the perspectives of drinking water safety the world health organization who recommended 10 μg l as a maximum allowable concentration mac guideline value in water sources used for drinking purpose cotruvo 2017 consumption of drinking water with as levels above the guideline value poses a significant risk to human health kapaj et al 2006 ahmad and bhattacharya 2018 maity et al 2012 the long term exposure of as can lead to skin lesions internal organ cancer bladder lung kidney liver and premature birth gbaruko et al 2008 jain and ali 2000 kapaj et al 2006 kar et al 2011 maity et al 2012 samal et al 2021 smith et al 1992 von ehrenstein et al 2006 thus as removal from water is one of the mitigation strategies in the current global research maity et al 2019a b 2021a b arsenic removal is well documented worldwide through the application of precipitation adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis nanofiltration oxidation and bioremediation ahmad et al 2018 ahmad et al 2017 bhattacharya et al 2002a 2002b jana et al 2000 maity et al 2019a 2019b maity et al 2021a b adsorption is the most preferred method because it is simple affordable and eco friendly ahmad et al 2020a b maity et al 2019a 2019b maity et al 2021a b roy et al 2013 however adsorption is highly affected by ph contact time concentration the surface area of the adsorbent and redox potential many adsorbents have been applied to remove as at both laboratory and field scale maity et al maity et al 2019a 2019b maity et al 2021a b the selection of adsorbent depends not only on its availability but also on its adsorptive capacity regeneration and cost iron fe and aluminum al based adsorbents are preferable to remove as at lower ph in which fe has a high affinity towards as where the calcium ca based materials precipitate arsenic at higher ph ahmad et al 2020c herath et al 2016 maity et al 2019a 2019b maity et al 2021a b thus locally available adsorbent materials in africa such as soils sands magnesite bauxite iron ore gypsum wood char bone char and activated carbon from agricultural wastes have inculcated an interest among researchers to opt their application in water treatment in tanzania the local adsorbent materials such as magnesite bauxite and gypsum have been successfully tested for fluoride removal mndolwa and mtalo 2021 thole et al 2013 thereby creating a curiosity to investigate their efficiency to remove as from water taking into consideration that inorganic as affects the human health through consumption of contaminated water and food the african society needs awareness on the occurrence of as in different regions and the potential pathways of exposure for developing better control measures thus the current review addresses the potential as sources in the specific african region spatial variability as well as affordable removal techniques the essence of this review paper is to create awareness and insights to researchers on investigating the link between as contamination in drinking water sources and cancer cases especially in the mining areas as well as the impact of climatic change on the release of as from different sources and its mobilization in different environmental compartment in africa in addition the review paper aims at exploring the state of the art remediation technologies to ensure the drinking water security that are sustainable and affordable for as removal from water 2 methodology the current study is based on a compilation of information gathered from diverse sources through a scan of the published literature in different search engines such as google scholar and sciencedirect different search words were applied during the literature search such as arsenic in africa arsenic in the environment africa contaminated water from arsenic natural sources of arsenic anthropogenic sources of arsenic water contaminated by arsenic in africa climate factors controlling the release arsenic into the water arsenic health problem in africa arsenic remediation removal from water in africa sustainable arsenic remediation local material for arsenic removal and arsenic disposal methods most literature were within the year 2000 2022 but few research works emerging out of the literature search were prior to 2000 between 1989 and 1999 were potentially significant to bring scientific insight on building the scientific understanding relevant for understanding the occurrences of as for the concerns and raising awareness in africa the concentration range of as and mean values in different environmental matrices from various african countries are presented in table 1 the collected information was processed in arcgis software version 10 6 1 to create the continental wide map presented in fig 1 these data were also used for calculating as percentage levels in different water sources in africa compared to who guideline value of 10 μg l 3 arsenic sources and its spatial variability in africa most of the african countries are well endowed with natural precious minerals coal gold diamond silver cobalt copper iron ores bauxite zinc and many minerals making african continent the largest mineral producer at a global scale mining activities both small medium and large scale are in full swing in many countries in africa causing several disturbances in the local geological settings which trigger the release of toxic elements in drinking water sources among the surveyed studies the elevated concentrations of as between 0 02 and 1760 μg l and up to 10 000 μg l have been reported both in groundwater and surface systems respectively and are associated with natural weathering processes and anthropogenic activities fig 1 ahoulé et al 2015 other factors causing the prevalence of as in elevated concentrations within the aquatic environment include climate change effects accelerating the landscape dynamics mainly in the homologous tectonic settings of andean and himalaya basin aquifers in latin america and south asia respectively and thus the recharge or discharge of groundwater due to droughts and flooding triggers as release in the environment coomar et al 2019 high levels of as have been reported in numerous environmental matrices including soils sediments mine tailings plants urine and fish in some parts of african regions as summarized in fig 1 and table 1 elevated concentrations of as in soils ranging between 0 001 and 20 298 μg g were reported in parts of kenya tanzania south africa and ghana miller et al 2018 nyanza et al 2014 okonkwo 2007 ramudzuli and horn 2014 kortei et al 2020 mensah et al 2020 in the nile delta region of egypt the as concentration in sediment has been reported ranging between 10 and 44 μg g el badry and khalifa 2017 in the mine tailings area in kenya the as concentrations were reported between 0 06 and 76 μg g ogola et al 2002 the recent studies have indicated high levels of as in plants and fish which threatens the life of consumers nyanza et al 2014 recorded concentrations between 0 60 and 1 120 μg g in leaves and roots of cassava plant in rwamagasa village within areas close to small scale and artisanal mining sites similarly outtara et al 2020 in their study have recorded as concentrations between 0 0413 and 0 427 μg g in fish from ivory coast water bodies further studies on as occurrence have reported high levels in human urine particularly among the population living close to small scale and artisanal areas and mining processing sites for example nyanza et al 2019 have reported as concentrations as high as 150 μg l in the urine of pregnant women living within geita gold mining areas in the lake victoria basin in the north western part of tanzania thus the as concentrations in many parts of the african region exceed the who limit of 10 μg l and demonstrates the high spatial variability at a local scale arsenic problem is not only serious in water systems but also in soils sediments vegetables and fish complicating exposure routes to the human body table 1 most researchers on as contamination in the environment had different styles of reporting their results which limited the detailed analysis of the spatial variability in as concentrations for the sake of understanding the arsenic problem at the continental level the minimum and maximum values in each sample type were compared with the who maximum recommended guideline value of 10 μg l for drinking water around 30 of the minimum values exceeded 10 μg l in which one value was recorded in eastern africa tanzania the rest were recorded in the western africa at ghana 50 morocco 25 and togo 12 5 for the maximum values around 74 were above 10 μg l and were spatially distributed in northern 4 3 southern 13 eastern 26 and western 57 parts of africa in the northern part of africa this value was reported in egypt while the rest were reported in zimbabwe 33 3 south africa 33 3 and botswana 33 5 in southern africa similarly the maximum values exceeding 10 μg l were reported in kenya 16 7 ethiopia 33 3 and tanzania 50 in eastern africa in western africa these values were reported in cote d ivoire 7 7 togo 7 7 morocco 15 5 and ghana 69 2 for groundwater samples around 24 of samples consisted of the minimum as concentration exceeding 10 μg l and were spatially distributed in the eastern 14 3 western 28 6 and southern 57 1 parts of africa in the eastern africa as exceeding 10 μg l was reported in ethiopia while others were reported in nigeria and ghana within the western africa more than 10 μg l of as was reported in botswana 25 where 75 of the sample was observed in south africa for the maximum value around 86 of the samples were reported to have as concentration above 10 μg l and were spatially distributed in the eastern 16 7 southern 23 3 and western 60 parts of the africa in the eastern part they were reported in parts of tanzania 20 and ethiopia 80 while then reported in botswana 28 6 and south africa 71 4 in the southern part of africa likewise these values were reported in parts of nigeria and mali 5 6 each burkina faso 22 2 and ghana 66 7 in the western part of africa for the rest of the sample types in table 1 a similar percentage summary as above for urine soils sediments and vegetations was not possible since there are no guidelines now based on the references we consulted therefore based on this collection of information about total as levels in different environmental compartment samples there is an urgent need to further studies on as occurrence in these compartments as they present another route of exposure to humans in africa countries for detailed description of as occurrences in various environmental compartments we divide the african region into five parts including the eastern southern central western and northern sub regions 3 1 arsenic occurrences in the eastern africa in eastern africa as was reported in surface water systems in ethiopia kenya and tanzania respectively fig 1 the minimum concentration of 0 21 μg l dsikowitzky et al 2013 and maximum concentration of 566 μg l rango et al 2013 were reported within parts of the east african rift valley earv in kenya the reported minimum concentration of as was 0 147 μg l outa et al 2020 and the maximum of 22 7 μg l yang et al 2017 in the lake water in parts of the earv similarly the minimum and maximum values of 0 13 and 324 μg l were recorded in geita and mara districts taylor et al 2005 and serengeti districts bowell et al 1995 in gold mining areas around the earv occurrence of as in groundwater systems has been reported in ethiopia and tanzania respectively the minimum 0 6 μg l and maximum 566 μg l value in ethiopian groundwater sources was recorded by rango et al 2013 in the kenyan section of the earv in tanzania the minimum and maximum values of 0 13 and 2 4 μg l respectively were reported by taylor et al 2005 in areas of the geita district traces of as have been reported in mining tailings soils plants and urine in parts of kenya and tanzania the range of 0 06 76 μg g was reported by ogola et al 2002 in mine tailings around the mining areas of kenya in soils as concentrations ranging between 0 183 and 20 298 μg g was detected in the community drinking water sources adjacent to the gold mining areas in geita district north west tanzania nyanza et al 2014 the high levels of as in soil is another health risk particularly to pregnant women in rural areas miller et al 2018 despite the levels of as in toenails for young and adult people differed significantly they correlated positively with as levels in community boreholes used as sources for drinking water r 0 72 r2 0 52 p 0 001 merola et al 2014 likewise the as concentrations between 0 60 and 1 120 μg g were found in cassava plants in rwamagasa village where artisanal and small scale mining are daily activities to support rural livelihood in a longitudinal study on mining and health prospective within gold mining areas nyanza et al 2019 urine samples exhibited as ranging between 0 01 and 150 μg l among pregnant women within and outside the mining areas of the geita district in north west tanzania 3 1 1 arsenic traces by specific country in the eastern africa geogenic processes along the great eastern rift valley earv have a contribution to the as occurrence and distribution in this region however there were several heavy metal studies in which as was not analyzed due to the cost and unavailability of as detection instruments 3 1 1 1 ethiopia the presence of elevated as concentrations in the ethiopian environment is caused by anthropogenic and geogenic processes geogenic processes include tectonic and volcanic activities weathering of as bearing rocks presence of thermal waters and the presence of young volcanic rocks the anthropogenic sources include agricultural and industrial effluents arsenic concentrations ranging between 0 6 and 190 μg l have been reported in many parts of the main ethiopian rift aquifers characterized by the tectonic processes and volcanic activities rango et al 2013 the presence of young volcanic rocks ignimbrites pumice rhyolite trachybasalt and fissural basalts within the main ethiopian rift system is one of the sources of as in the environment reimann et al 2003 exogenic processes such as weathering of volcanic rocks and erosion action have led to fluvio lacustrine deposition thereby forming sedimentary aquifers with groundwater having high levels of as for example 54 of samples collected from the lacustrine aquifer at the ziway shal basin in the northern part of main ethiopian rift had as above who and arsenate was 80 due to oxidative environment rango et al 2013 on the other hand the presence of silicate hydrolysis of rhyolitic rocks led to the release of dissolved sodium and bicarbonate weathered products such as clay minerals and oxides the silicate hydrolysis process removes calcium or magnesium to enhance the release of sodium that causes saline groundwater with a high content of sodium bicarbonate rango et al 2013 identified two distinct hydrochemical facies in the main ethiopian rift i low tds ca mg hco3 water type that characterizes low level of fluoride and as cold springs originating primarily from the basaltic highland outside the rift and ii high tds na hco3 water type characterizes groundwater and geothermal waters emerging from the floor of the rift influences high as level another source of as in the environment is the presence of thermal waters originating from the rift system reimann et al 2003 while 35 of water sources around the main ethiopian rift valley demonstrated safe water with as concentrations below 10 μg l high concentrations up to 156 278 157 and 405 μg l were detected in thermal spring deep thermal well groundwater well and lakes respectively the primary causes of high levels of as in this area are oxidation of fluvio volcano lacustrine rocks presence of na hco3 hydro chemical facies and high ph rango et al 2010 the high ph causes desorption of as from metal hydroxides such as fe al mn in which the sediment leachates at ph 8 may release up to 220 μg l rango et al 2010 likewise in their study on the as in hot springs water reported above who limit within ethiopian part of east africa rift valley reimann et al 2003 anthropogenic sources of as are active in ethiopian environments industrial effluents and agricultural drains are the two main anthropogenic sources of elevated concentrations of as in the ethiopian environment the study conducted by gebeyehu and bayissa 2020 in the mojo area south of addis ababa where factories discharge effluents at river mojo demonstrated high levels of as in soils irrigated by water from the mojo river for instance the mean value of as in soil samples under tomato cultivation was 21 μg g while it was 30 73 μg g in cabbage growing soil arsenic levels in tomatoes were 24 50 0 50 μg g dry weight and in cabbage 5 73 0 37 μg g dry weight in addition cabbages demonstrated higher levels of as compared to tomatoes 3 1 1 2 kenya limited studies on as occurrence in the kenyan environment were retrieved and the dominating sources were gold mining activities mainly in nairobi and kisumu counties apart from as high heavy metal concentrations above who recommended guideline were reported around the gold mining areas ogola et al 2002 arsenic concentrations in mine tailings ranged between 0 06 and 76 0 μg g where the sediments had concentrations between 0 014 and 1 87 μg g the nairobi tailing sediments exhibited the as concentration of 76 μg g wherein river kuja sediments ranged between 0 08 and 0 92 μg g and migori river sediments 0 03 and 1 87 μg g however there was a challenge when detecting as concentration in river water sample due to metal hydroxides precipitation before analysis in the laboratory furthermore the kisumu tailings demonstrated the as concentrations between 1 75 μg g and 4 65 μg g 3 1 1 3 tanzania the major part of the hydrogeology of tanzania is dominated by crystalline basement complex aquifer nwankwo et al 2020 from phanerozoic upper paleozoic mesozoic and cenozoic and the precambrian archean and proterozoic human activities mining small industries and agricultural activities cause contamination of as in soil surface water and groundwater taylor et al 2005 kassenga and mato 2008 almås and manoko 2012 nyanza et al 2014 the concentrations of as in the tanzanian environment are expected to increase in the future due to mining activities such as coal mining gold mining iron mining gas mining and diamond mining that reduce the quality of drinking water sources the oxidation of exposed arsenopyrite is the main source of as in the environment particularly in drinking water sources during the mining process kassenga and mato 2008 recently the sida funded project dafwat focused on water sediments and rocks linked with drinking water sources in which the reported as concentrations range ranging between 10 and 300 μg l the petrographic study of rock in geita and mara regions revealed high content of arsenopyrite pyrites and chalcopyrite fig 2 where as levels ranging between 47 and 270 μg g unpublished are likely to cause future health effects due to lack of preventive measures a recent study in and out site of the small scale gold mining areas of northwest tanzania reported elevated as concentrations in soils even outside the mining areas indication that as occurrence is a natural phenomena in such settings nyanza et al 2019 similary nyanza et al 2014 also reported that 33 3 of the water samples in rwamagasa had as levels above who guideline with the measured concentration ranging between 43 μg l and 110 μg l the as uptake by plants which are the primary source of staple food among rural communities has been reported in some parts of gold mining areas in the north west tanzania for example nyanza et al 2014 reported high levels as in cassava plants water and soil samples the cassava leaves had as ranging between 0 6 and 1 12 μg g while the cassava roots had concentration ranging between 0 25 and 0 31 μg g in soil samples as concentration ranged between 0 183 and 20 298 μg g while some of the soil samples had as concentration above the detection limit of instruments used for the laboratory analysis occurrence of as around mount meru in arusha region was lower between 0 1 and 4 9 μg l tomašek et al 2022 compared to the levels detected around lake victoria basin to improve the awareness of as contamination the local borehole well drillers in tanzania should be enhanced through training on how to choose safe aquifers sources for water sources this is possible through understanding the relationship of the color of the aquifer sediments with the water chemistry similar to the color tool which was successfully developed in bangladesh hossain et al 2014 annaduzzaman et al 2018 in terms of health effects there are no documented human health effects but the data obtained from ocean road cancer institute in dar es salaam tanzania indicated that most of the referral cases of cancer patients were from the lake victoria basin thus more studies are required to establish relationships between cancer cases and as contamination from drinking water sources and other environmental compartments mainly in the mining areas of tanzania 3 2 arsenic occurrence in southern africa the anthropogenic and geogenic sources are the major cause of the elevated as levels particularly in soils and water within the southern region despite the common causes the levels of as vary considerably among countries and within the same country they exhibit high spatial variability arsenic concentrations between 0 62 and 119 μg l were reported in the surface water systems of cape town and koekemoe spruit akinsoji et al 2013 dzoma et al 2010 in botswana the minimum 1 μg and maximum up to 188 μg l values of as were recorded by mladenov et al 2014 in the okavango delta however the minimum and maximum values of 3 2 μg l and 185 μg l respectively were recorded in the same region by mladenov et al 2014 nephalama and muzerengi 2016 reported the minimum 830 μg l and maximum 1 553 000 μg l values of as concentration in groundwater systems of limpopo province thus the diversity of as occurrence is noticed in various environmental compartments of the southern african region table 1 3 2 1 arsenic occurrence by specific country in southern africa 3 2 1 1 arsenic in south africa the release of as in the south african environment mainly depends on the sulfide minerals oxidation agricultural and industrial practice glass manufacturing semiconductors steel melting dye manufacturing wood preservatives insecticides etc abiye and bhattacharya 2019 in johannesburg the as concentrations range between 17 and 318 μg l in groundwater while in 2016 the as ranged between 830 and 1 553 000 μg l abiye and bhattacharya 2019 likewise abiye and bhattacharya 2019 reported as concentration ranging between 20 and 240 μg l and between 20 and 253 μg l in water sources characterized by reducing high ph and oxidizing low ph conditions respectively the predominant as species in the aforementioned environmental compartments is as v the as investigation done on soil samples collected from abandoned cattle dips showed high as levels between 1033 and 1369 μg g suggesting a potential risk to groundwater based drinking water sources okonkwo 2007 a similar cattle dip study in limpopo province reported as occurrence at different depths and the as concentrations ranged between 0 001 and 6 88 μg g at 10 20 and 300 m below ground surface respectively ramudzuli and horn 2014 the presence of clay in the soil profile within cattle dipping areas could be reducing the as leaching down the soil vein shapi et al 2020 recorded as concentration range between 5 and 170 3 μg g in the krugersdorp game reserve environment in gauteng south africa similarly mudzielwana et al 2020 recorded as concentrations ranging between 0 1 and 172 52 μg l with an average of 32 21 μg l in the na hco3 and ca na hco3 water type of the greater giyani municipality limpopo province nevertheless as levels below 10 μg l in northwest province south africa was reported between 0 and 8 1 μg l masindi and foteinis 2021 3 2 1 2 botswana in okavango delta mladenov et al 2014 recorded total as ranging between 87 5 and 185 μg l in wells and associated its occurrence with geogenic processes such as sulfidic mineral weathering high alkalinity evapotranspiration the high ph dissolution of orpiment presence of dissolved organic matter lead to as mobility in groundwater through complexation reactions where the hydrological biological and chemical processes control such mobilization together with the water types for example mladenov et al 2014 recorded high as levels in na k hco3 water type which differed slightly with that reported by rango et al 2013 in ethiopian rift valley the high as about 900 μg l was detected in organic samples collected from the sandy bottom of the boro river channel while termite mound collected from concentration zone 101 m from water edge in the north of sampled transect had as concentration of 138 μg l mladenov et al 2014 in addition sracek et al 2021 recorded as concentrations ranging 10 and 49 μg l in the weathered manganese rich mining tailings of kanye area southeast of botswana 3 3 arsenic occurrences in the western africa this study retrieved few study reports from different sources most of them focused on as occurrence in surface water systems groundwater systems soil urine and fish the studies were conducted in six countries of this process region including ghana ivory coast burkina faso mali togo and nigeria fig 1 in ghana as concentrations ranging between 0 003 and 28 950 μg l were recorded in surface water mainly from ankobra river rossiter et al 2010 akabzaa et al 2009 although no direct study on as occurrence in surface water systems in cote d ivoire the high levels up to 427 μg kg was recorded in fish outtara et al 2020 suggesting the availability of elevated as concentrations in surface water systems and sediments in burkina faso ouédraogo and amyot 2013 recorded the minimum value of 0 039 μg l in yatenga province likewise smedley et al 2007 recorded the minimum and maximum values of 0 5 μg l and 1630 μg l in yatenga and zendoma provinces furthermore the high spatial variability in as concentrations have been reported in soils and urine in some countries within the western africa kortei et al 2020 reported the minimum value of 0 00163 μg g in soil within the volta region whereas mensah et al 2020 reported the maximum value of 8401 μg g in the topsoils within the mining areas on the other hand asante et al 2012 reported as concentration of 17 μg l in urine among e waste workers in ghana despite unclear sources of as in water system bokar et al 2020 recorded high as levels between 16 and 139 μg l in water samples from sanson village in mali 3 3 1 potential occurrence by specific country in western africa 3 3 1 1 ghana the ankobra river basin is famous for production of gold for about 81 in ghana arsenic recorded in water samples from the three rivers ranged between 600 and 2200 μg l gbogbo et al 2017 the ankobra river sediments could be the main source of high levels of as in different environmental compartments for example gbogbo et al 2017 recorded as concentrations ranging between 0 2 and 2 8 μg g in aquatic fauna species such as fish and shellfish likewise asante et al 2012 recorded high as concentration in urine samples among the e waste workers in accra ghana consuming fish and other seafood characterized by arsenobetaine and dimethylarsinic acid together with drinking water with as concentration of 17 μg l hydrogeochemical studies done in takwa mining area of ghana recorded as concentration of 69 4 μg l in eyinaise site bhattacharya et al 2012 affum et al 2015 reported high levels of as ranging between 44 and 136 μg l in groundwater based drinking water sources in the western region of ghana characterized by high sulfate ions ranging between 34 900 and 172000 μg l in this region the cancer slope factor of as reported was 1 5 μg l day probably originating from the clay eaten soil by pregnant women where the recorded as mean value was 0 00163 0 00003 μg g kortei et al 2020 mensah et al 2020 reported also high as in abandoned and active mine spoils of ghana the as concentration in mining topsoils ranged between 1807 and 8401 μg g mensah et al 2020 in the abandoned profile samples as concentration varied with depth and ranged between 3105 and 4142 μg g at the active gold mine spoil as concentration ranged between 2034 and 3801 μg g where scorodite feasso4 and arsenopyrite feass were the two main as bearing mineral phases mainly in the mine spoil mensah et al 2020 3 3 1 2 arsenic in burkina faso and cote d ivoire ouédraogo and amyot 2013 reported low as concentration ranging between 0 039 and 0 42 μg g the author suggests that this aquatic ecosystem was not contaminated since dissolved as mean in water was 512 152 μg l while total as in fish ranged from 0 04 to 0 42 μg g ouédraogo and amyot 2013 in 2018 as concentration that was found ranges between 1 39 and 13 9 μg l and the concentrations were higher during flood season were reported from three rivers in west africa bandama river comoe river and bia river ouattara et al 2018 the as concentration in comoe and bia river threaten the health of about 3 million people in southern cote d ivoire ouattara et al 2018 the study was done in cote d ivoire rivers bandama comoe bia on fish species reveals as concentration ranges 0 0209 0 427 μg g in muscles of chrysithys nigrodigitatus and range of 0 00413 0 357 μg g sarothrodon melanotheron while the concentration was higher in bandama river even though the bioaccumulation factor is less ensures no health risk will occur due to consumption of fish in this area outtara et al 2020 the highest concentration of 333 μg l as was reported from poura west africa in 2018 bretzler et al 2019 the source of as is due to oxidation of sulfide minerals in auriferous zones volcano sedimentary schists and volcanic rocks of birimian formation the groundwater of this area was classified as oxic due to high eh 380 500 mv bretzler et al 2019 arsenic are contaminating rice and sediments in cote d ivore ranging 0 1 5 8 μg g at boniko and 0 3 2 15 μg g at agbaou sourced from gold mining leaches and agricultural activities kinimo et al 2021 3 3 1 3 mali arsenic was reported to be found in water sediments and plants the highest as in water at sanso village ranges 16 139 μg l and plants had concentration ranges 0 1 45 9 μg g dry weight where the highest concentration in sediments at the background downstream and within mining were 44 μg g 200 μg g 1928 μg g respectively bokar et al 2020 3 3 1 4 nigeria the as study from the limestone belt of ogun state reported as mean value from all sampled aquifers to be above who of 10 μg l gbadebo 2005 the as status of aiba reservoir iwo nigeria was stated to be lower in water and sediments but higher in fish liver and kidney with mean value 15 4 14 μg l and 12 2 73 μg l respectively atobatele and olutona 2015 heavy metals at woji southern nigeria were revealed in water sediments and fish mugil cephalus but as was not detected due to the inconvenience of the instrument used aas with detection limit 0 1 μg l ihunwo et al 2020 3 4 arsenic occurrence in northern and central africa there was very limited information on as in the environment retrieved in countries within the central part of africa recently although few studies were retrieved for countries in the northern part as concentrations demonstrated a large scale of variation with minimum and maximum value of 38 9 μg l and 199 6 μg l respectively as recorded by el hachimi et al 2007 in surface water sources of upper moulouya in morocco table 1 furthermore low and high levels of as have been reported in surface water systems in egypt the as range of 1 2 μg l and 13 2 μg l was recorded by abdel moati 1990 within the nile delta similarly high levels of as between 10 and 44 μg g have been reported in sediments in egypt el badry and khalifa 2017 3 4 1 potential sources of as in the northern africa the study was done in northern egyptian delta lake burullus lagoon which shows ranges 10 44 μg g as contamination in river sediment above who of 10 μg l el badry and khalifa 2017 the source of metal contamination is reported high near the agricultural areas due to pesticides that contain as while industrial drains towards the southern area of the lagoon and also contributes as pollution to the surrounding environment the study on the hydro chemical characteristic in the southern part of upper egypt along the nile between qena and luxor revealed a high concentration of heavy metals except as thus contamination is caused by high sodium and bicarbonate whereby sodium ranges 52 540 481 000 μg l and hco3 ranges 90 000 933 300 μg l abdalla and khalil 2018 snousy and morsi 2020 3 5 different climatic factors affecting as release in the groundwater the possible impact of climatic change on as release in groundwater systems is not yet studied in africa however there is limited literature on climate change predicting future impacts on the african water system water quality supply and food security due to the rise of temperature and decrease of rainfall banks et al 2021 bonsor et al 2011 cuthbert et al 2019 faye 2019 gizaw and gan 2017 hendrix and glaser 2007 lapworth et al 2013 macallister et al 2020 macdonald et al 2009 serdeczny et al 2017 urama and ozor 2010 wright and norval 2020 the motivation here was to incorporate climate change effects on groundwater contamination as reported from other countries such as asia and south america coomar et al 2019 to contribute future knowledge on climatic effects in african although not quantified at the regional level in many parts of the african continent the quantity of surface water sources has been declining due to climate change impacts especially in arid and semi arid environments cobbing and hiller 2019 in such environments groundwater accounts for approximately 80 of water demand for domestic industrial and agricultural activities cobbing and hiller 2019 the release of as in groundwater systems has been depend on climatic factors e g droughts flooding land use pattern depth of an aquifer etc coomar et al 2019 reported climatic effects on surface and subsurface water e g rainfall effect on recharge fall and rise of water table oxidation and reduction in aquifer system and land use pattern e g irrigation induced recharge and sanitation which cause to as release into the groundwater high increase in temperature on the surface of the earth due to global warming induces droughts which cause accumulation of chemicals such as chlorine fluoride as in the soil or aquifers for long period and during rainfall these chemicals are infused into the aquifer to contaminate groundwater 3 5 1 droughts africa has been facing drought events in southern africa and sahel regions gizaw and gan 2017 urama and ozor 2010 african countries facing drought e g tanzania burundi congo ethiopia eritrea gambia prolonged drought e g namibia south africa recurring drought e g kenya mali niger zimbabwe burkina faso periodic drought e g egypt chad botswana senegal rwanda nigeria morocco lesotho gizaw and gan 2017 urama and ozor 2010 are reported to have as contamination the prolonged droughts periods will decrease recharge and lead to water table decline the decline in water table exposes the aquifer sulfide minerals to oxygen and the sulfide mineral will be oxidized to release as into groundwater bondu et al 2016 the decrease in recharge during droughts may cause a decrease in groundwater flow thereby increasing the occurrence of elevated as concentrations at high evolved geochemical groundwater due to prolonged low flow than in less evolved geochemical groundwater bondu et al 2016 the prolonged low flow signifies less dilution of contaminants and this increases residence time that led to as mobilization from reductive dissolution 3 5 2 flooding most african countries faces flooding during rainy e g congo cote d ivoire burundi angola zimbabwe some parts of tanzania south africa senegal mozambique kenya urama and ozor 2010 heavy rainfall may influence rapid recharge in the areas which were affected by prolonged droughts this phenomenon increases the flushing of contaminants that were accumulated at unsaturated zones during the drought period and deposits these contaminants in the aquifers bondu et al 2016 in addition the recharge area also increases sulfide oxidation when water diffuses into fractured aquifers to increase oxygen supply and organic matter coomar et al 2019 hence release of as into groundwater 3 5 3 land use pattern the climate of an area has a high impact on the land use patterns which depend largely on water availability during the drought period groundwater uses for human activities increase due to the unavailability of surface water sources bondu et al 2016 the groundwater abstraction leads to the decline of the water table and accelerates as mobilization in groundwater systems likewise human activities such as mining industries and irrigation consume large amounts of water abstracted from the subsurface irrigation has depleted groundwater storage in semi arid and arid areas due to intensive abstraction taylor et al 2013 in irrigation areas there is recharge from irrigated water which will degrade groundwater quality by inducing contaminants such as as in the aquifers coomar et al 2019 3 5 4 depth of an aquifer aquifer characteristics play important role in ensuring safe water for drinking purposes in the african continent groundwater is abstracted through shallow wells boreholes and natural springs the shallow wells usually target small and unconfined aquifers whereas boreholes target intermediate and deep aquifers which are relatively large in extent in a deep aquifer the atmospheric oxygen is not supplied hence no sulfide oxidation although the absence of oxygen triggers a reducing condition to release as into groundwater coomar et al 2019 in countries like tanzania shallow aquifers are not regulated and most of them are used as an alternative source of water for domestic use among urban and rural communities in terms of contamination the small shallow unconfined aquifers are exposed more to water table decline than larger deeper confined aquifers bondu et al 2016 this is likely to accelerate the mobilization of geogenic contaminants such as as due to low groundwater flow in shallow aquifers 3 6 strength and weakness of arsenic studies in africa all studies conducted in africa have contributed useful knowledge to policymakers and ministries of water in specific country to put into a plan the accountability of as contamination in the water supply systems there should be no water supply without checking the levels of hazardous geogenic chemicals such as as the borehole drillers should be controlled by the responsible ministry to reduce the effect of drilling unsafe aquifers however most of the as studies were conducted under projects funded from europe and there is no continuation of study once the project period is over there are limited laboratory facilities for as analysis in africa inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy mass spectrometry icp oes ms due to resource constraints for operation and maintenance hence many researchers escape as analysis during heavy metal studies therefore each specific country should prepare funds to enhance scientific research on as investigation at least once per year to ensure a safe water supply in africa moreover as effect in africa is predicted to increase in future years due to human activities as well as natural processes during the survey of as in africa there was not enough data from samples water soil sediments fish and vegetation to cover enough area that could attract spatial variability observations thus few studies are not enough to exploit the whole impact of as in africa the few health problems reported in ghana and burkina faso ahoulé et al 2015 ethiopia and tanzania signify that as is a silent killer as it takes a longer period for a person to develop characteristics of cancer and internal organ failure the uncovered causes of cancer from many patients living near the gold mining area are still a challenge in africa more clinical proofs are required to link as and cancer issues 4 arsenic removal arsenic removal technologies are well documented worldwide ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 ahmad et al 2018 ahmad et al 2020c ahmad et al 2020c ahmad et al 2020c alkurdi et al 2019 bundschuh et al 2011 ghosh et al 2019 litter et al 2019 maity et al 2021a b maity et al 2019a 2019b mohan and pittman 2007 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 and alternatives for safe drinking water supply have been extensively discussed bhattacharya et al 1997 the use of natural geological materials such as hematite goethite soils and sediments for as adsorption in water has been documented bundschuh et al 2010a 2010b availability of local materials in african areas such as soils sands magnesite bauxite iron ores gypsum wood char bone char and activated carbon from agricultural waste encourages the community to opt for their application against expensive technologies such as reverse osmosis and electrodialysis the water treatment methods using phytoremediation by plant species such as vallisneria natans and pteris vittata chinese brake fern are also significantly reported fu et al 2017 ma et al 2001 raj and maiti 2020 vithanage et al 2012 plants can accumulate as in fronds in the range of 3 98 6 18 mg plant and in the roots ranges 0 94 284 mg plant gonzaga et al 2007 however the efficiencies of these plants were reported to be affected by plant age phosphate concentration and re use kabir and chowdhury 2017 furthermore species of pteris vittata vetiveriaa zizanoides phragmites australis have been found effective to be planted in rice farms for reducing as uptake in rice abedi and mojiri 2020 table 2 shows common as removal technologies that are applied worldwide most of the technologies are expensive to be afforded in developing countries in africa the electrodialysis was stated to cost us 3 40 per m3 of water membrane costs us 600 per m3 of water reverse osmosis costs us 3 72 per m3 of water coagulation costs us 1 0 per m3 of water and nanofiltration cost ranges us 1 41 1 84 per m3 of water kabir and chowdhury 2017 the high costs of these technologies suggest that the resource poor countries should rely on cheap and locally available natural materials for water treatment among the technologies listed in table 2 the application of iron coated sand filters have a significant advantage on water treatment for being a cheap method 4 1 locally available adsorptive materials and techniques the local easily available as adsorption techniques are globally documented bundschuh et al 2010a 2010b maity et al 2021a b biochar mineral rocks and agricultural wastes have been used for decades for heavy metal removal from water due to high surface area porosity and active sites this section provides insight into existing knowledge of local available adsorbent materials that were used in previous worldwide studies our interest is to recommend the application of locally adsorbent materials to the lower income countries around africa however the limitations on the use of these materials in the fieldwork require more studies since most experiments were only successful at the laboratory scale the discussion below summarizes results reported from adsorption studies conducted using locally available materials worldwide thus wood char shows high adsorption capacity compared to other local materials such as magnesite gypsum bauxite and calcined hematite table 3 bone char bone charcoal contains apatite with a high surface area that could allow as adsorption but the challenge could arise due to phosphate concentration into the bone char which occupies the same active sites for as adsorption hence the recommended modification is to coat bone char with iron oxide to increase surface reactive site for as adsorption the batch experiment on bone char with ph range of 9 13 was reported by chen et al 2008 to be good for removing as v in a high percentage this was enhanced by the presence of surface hydroxyl groups and co precipitation between calcium hydrogen arsenate with hydroxylapatite on the char surface the adsorption removal followed a first order reaction and reached 99 18 equilibrium time at an initial as concentration of 500 μg l and rate constant of 0 14 min 1 the author reported arsenate removal on bone char being complex which was both surface adsorption as well as intraparticle diffusion contributes to the rate determining step chen and chai 2008 the ftir of 3570 cm 1 on the bone char has shown a broad band for oh which is associated with hydrogen bond stretch of hydroxyl apatite of the char and hence the ca oh exchanged with haso4 2 during the adsorption process the author reported that the removal of arsenate from aqueous solution was both the adsorption co precipitation and ion exchange which can be represented in equations 1 and 2 1 c a 10 p o 4 6 o h 2 c a 2 h a s o 4 2 c a 10 p o 4 6 o h 2 c a h a s o 4 2 c a 10 p o 4 6 o h 2 h a s o 4 2 c a 10 p o 4 6 h a s o 4 2 o h the other study on bone char liu et al 2014 reported to follow pseudo second order with rate constant of 2 7 10 5 4 5 10 5 1 5 10 4 and initial concentrations of 2000 10 000 50 000 μg l and the equilibrium rate was reported to be affected by the initial concentration of as v langmuir model was used to explain the adsorption in which it gave the maximum capacity of 0 335 mg g at ph 4 with a correlation coefficient r2 of 0 97 the electrostatic interaction and ligand exchange were thought to be the main adsorption mechanism on the bone char while the po4 3 was the most competitive anion in the solution wood char plant woods are locally available natural materials and their char is porous with high surface area been used to adsorb unpleasant contaminants from drinking water sources mohan and pittman 2007 reviewed on plant parts wood bark that when heated in a furnace at 400 c 450 c form chars that have a porous surface with a high ability to adsorb as and other heavy metal contaminants an investigation on the sorption capacity using wood char through batch experiments showed high as iii adsorption when ph rises from 2 to 4 in which oak bark exhibited higher capacity on langmuir and freundlich isotherms the authors suggest that the char surface area could be increased through steam activation to improve sorption capacity another study wang et al 2015 investigated as removal on pinewood char and pinewood char coated with hematite the pinewood char increases sorption efficiency when combined with natural hematite to form a magnetic composite material with high active sites for as adsorption wang et al 2015 the pinewood char coated with hematite shows rapid and slower phases which were related to an outer sphere and inner sphere formations the langmuir model explained well the sorption of as with maximum sorption of 265 μg g pinewood char and 429 μg g pinewood coated with hematite the author recommended more investigation to be done on lifecycle cost analysis for as removal on hematite doped pinewood char laterite soil laterite soil is a red colored clay rich soil that consists of aluminium silicates aluminium hydrosilicates iron oxides and iron hydroxides with high iron content which gives red color soil red soil has high efficiency towards as adsorption the as removal study that was done using batch experiment maji et al 2008 reported high removal using an adsorbent dose of 20 g l at 30 min and efficiency removal rises when adsorbent dose increases the column of 2 cm diameter 55 cm length packed with laterite soil 10 cm depth at flow rate 1 49 m3 m2 h 7 75ml min revealed 98 removal at an initial concentration of 330 μg l and the adsorbent dose of 20 000 μg l at 30 min equilibrium time with a breakthrough time of 6 75 h and exhaust time of 19 h maji et al 2007 the column height on adsorption zone was reduced to 9 85 cm at the rate of 0 8 cm h movement through the bed while saturation at a breakthrough was 47 12 the fixed bed column using a logistic method gave adsorption capacity coefficient of 69 220 μg l which are useful values to design a large scale adsorption column to indicate that adsorption was not represented by langmuir and freundlich the author relates the problem with as existence in different oxidation states which could lead to mixed model adsorption and suggests the dubinin radushkevich isotherm to be used in which gave the maximum adsorption capacity of 170 μg g with energy e of 6 8 kj mol that means the adsorption occurred physically the isotherm studies such as rl obtained from rl 1 1 bc0 was 0 099 and gibbs free energy of 8 30 indicated that the sorption process was favorable and spontaneous the desorption test showed no ions were released from the soil hence it is an environmentally friendly adsorbent the used soil was regenerated by naoh solution rinsed with distilled water and became more porous after regeneration maji et al 2007 applied laterite soil on fixed bed column for as iii removal the adsorption capacity was 108 020 μg l ferralite soil bhattacharyya et al 2003 revealed that the ferralite from purulia bankura and mednipur had a high capacity to remove as to above 80 at ph 8 5 the author reported that the presence of competitive anions such as phosphate and sulfate in the solution did not affect adsorption onto ferralite oxisol soil the weathered soil like oxisol which consisted of al2o3 26 fe2o3 11 al silicates 16 and quartz 44 with a surface area of 35 7 m2 g have been reported as efficient adsorbent removal material for all as oxidation states in aqueous solutions at ph 5 5 ladeira and ciminelli 2004 the adsorption capacity of oxisol soil was 3200 μg g as v thus 4 times lesser to goethite which had 12 400 μg g and for as iii was 2600 μg g which is about 3 times lesser than 7500 μg g for goethite the desorption studies using sulfate solution have shown much as iii being released from the oxisol than as v bauxite in bauxite the aluminum ion equation 3 has shown good performance on removing as from contaminated water mohapatra et al 2008 mohapatra et al 2007 the investigation by mohapatra et al 2008 for the adsorption of as v onto the calcined bauxite surface occurred at point zero charge ph 7 54 the column study was found to improve adsorption due to increase in surface area from 24 1 to 32 2 m2 g and porosity from 21 7 to 30 5 of non calcined bauxite while the maximum adsorption capacity on the column was 1710 μg g 3 a l 3 a q h a s o 4 a q a l a s o 4 s h a q the ph of 4 7 has given high adsorption with less final as concentration 010 μg l from the initial concentration of 2000 μg l and calcined bauxite of 5 g l while it declined with 360 μg l at ph 10 langmuir model on the batch experiment was explained well with a maximum adsorption capacity of 1780 μg g and r2 of 0 99 while the freundlich model had a correlation coefficient of 0 89 the presence of silicate phosphate and temperature was reported to hinder as adsorption from 99 to 83 when silicate increases and to 84 when phosphate increases usually when temperature increases from 25 c 70 c the adsorption was reported to decrease by 6 to reveal that increase in temperature lowered the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent material the regeneration of bauxite material was done by flushing the material using 0 1 m naoh in the column at a pressure of 200 ml h another study by mohapatra et al 2007 reported on the bauxite with high alumina and low iron against that with high iron revealed low alumina content the bauxite with high alumina content had adsorption capacity of 1490 μg g was better than the other the author suggested that the adsorption was governed by inner sphere complexation because it does not depend on ionic strength the adsorption of as v occurred at ph 4 to 7 5 and was explained well by the pseudo second order reaction equation magnesite magnesite the magnesium ion equation 4 has an active effect on as uptake from water magnesite is also a locally available material that is useful for as and fluoride adsorption magnesite has shown a high capacity of 1400 μg g on removing as from mine effluent with ph 2 which raise ph to above 10 masindi and gitari 2016 the removal percentage increases with an increase in dosage as well as with contact time whereby 1 g within 15 min were reported to be enough for as removal from 20 000 μg l aqueous solutions the results fitted well on pseudo second order reaction with a rate constant of 1700 μg min in which the author suggests that the rate limiting step was chemisorption due to kinetic type observed the adsorption decreases with an increase in as concentration and 20 000 μg l was optimum concentration reported to be enough for 1 g adsorbent 4 3 m g 2 a q 2 a s o 4 3 a q m g 3 a s o 4 2 s gypsum gypsum is a locally available material in tanzania and has proved better on the removal of fluoride from water sources in arusha tanzania thole et al 2013 the study done on as reported that as can be removed up to 19 000 μg g from aqueous solution in presence of crystallized gypsum at higher ph 7 to form calcium arsenate precipitates which are less toxic zhang et al 2015 the precipitation process can be represented in equation 5 5 3 c a 3 a q 2 h a s o 4 2 a q c a 3 a s o 4 2 s 2 h a q iron ores iron ores producing iron ion equation 6 have been used for as removal due to their content of hematite and goethite which usually adsorb as efficiently even though silicate and phosphate interfere with the as adsorption zhang et al 2004 the iron ores from hamersley ranges of western australia were tested especially on the sample that had high hematite 5 g l at ph 4 5 6 5 and gave a high capacity of 400 μg g on as removal in which the data fitted well to langmuir isotherm as well as first order kinetic zhang et al 2004 in another study the porous hematite prepared from calcined goethite was used for as removal in presence of competitive anions such as phosphate the maximum capacity was increased to 5670 μg g when 0 01 m nacl was added yang et al 2015 iron based backwashing sludge fbbs was used to remove trivalent as and it showed promising results of 59 700 μg g maximum adsorption under langmuir isotherm at ph 7 wu et al 2013 but the desorption studies have shown that the as release increases due to high ph and phosphate the effect of desorption could be minimized by adding gypsum on the used adsorbent materials das et al 2015 jia

reported to give low results adsorption capacity due to repulsion force between the negatively charged zeolite surface and as but the studies done on modified zeolites coated with iron oxide has shown high removal of 44 385 μg g as v under langmuir isotherm at ph 6 4 habuda stanić et al 2008 another study on coating zeolites with iron oxide and or aluminum resulted a higher adsorption while a mixture of both fe al onto zeolites had a higher adsorption capacity of 5000 μg g than single metal oxide coating simsek et al 2013 the kinetic study using aluminium and iron oxide coated zeolites reflected a promising removal of 74 and 65 of as v respectively at 8 h while the adsorption capacity of iron coated zeolites was 2716 μg g simsek and beker 2014 the experiment explained well the pseudo second order and the iron oxide coated zeolites were better than aluminium coated zeolites 7 z f e o o h 2 s h a s o 4 2 a q z f e o a s o 4 s h 2 o l citrus fruits under sunlight the as

limited removal studies in africa arsenic mitigation processes can be learned from experience in bangladesh alaerts and khouri 2004 hoque et al 2006 mondal 2015 hossain et al 2014 2015 sustainable mitigation of as was reported as two options 1 using alternative water sources or targeting safe aquifers and 2 the use of low cost treatment systems von brömssen et al 2007 jakariya et al 2007 bundschuh et al 2010a 2010b hossain et al 2017 the alternative sources of water were either to use deep groundwater tube well shallow groundwater through adopting well switching dug open tube well use of surface water ponds lakes river and rainwater harvesting shankar et al 2014 furthermore the process of investigating the safe aquifer was given a higher consideration as the community managed to access safe water and help to bore hole drillers in bangladesh redox conditions for safe aquifer were determined by using sediment color tool in which groundwater from black sediments is most reduced followed by white off white and red which are less reduced and less as bundschuh et al 2010a 2010b annaduzzaman et al 2018 the black color sediment was regarded as more contaminated as it contains ca mg hco3 water type and high concentrations of hco3 doc fe2 nh4 po4 while mn and so4 2 are less hossain et al 2014 moreover the use of low cost as treatments should be sustainable cheap easy to operate and repair bhattacharya et al 1997 the sustainable treatment systems in vietnam were reported to be successful through using sand filters tobias and berg 2011 therefore sand filters are becoming popular for as removal in many communities the performance of the filter is enhanced when the surface of the sand is coated by iron oxides to increase active sites that capture as iii and as v through the adsorption process the iron coated sand was reported to remove as from 325 μg l to about 90 with a capacity of 18 3 μg g thirunavukkarasu et al 2001 another study on iron coated sand reported about 99 as removal after 24 h from initial as concentration of 1000 μg l callegari et al 2018 furthermore the use of iron subsurface as removal sars was recently reported in vietnam to remove as below 10 μg l as well as low cost water supply ranging 0 06 0 07 us per m3 cañas kurz et al 2020 remediation techniques attempted around south africa burkina faso ethiopia and tanzania were of both at laboratory scale as well as at household scale thus there were no operating large scale as remediation plants reported in africa until march 2022 arsenic remediation in south africa has shown promising results where sulfate reducing bacteria was applied on treatment of spiked real water solution for 14 days and reported removal was more than 90 and 60 of as v and as iii respectively teclu et al 2013 another study utilizes the autotrophs bacteria baccilus and exiguobacterium that were isolated from cow dip in tzaneen limpopo south africa to oxidize as iii to as v which shows high oxidation at longer incubation time as 12 h 25 72 h 41 240 h 96 igboamalu and chirwa 2018 furthermore as removal was observed from the application of south african sand mixed with zero valent iron zvi which gave 100 as removal when a large column was used trois and cibati 2015 zeolite coated with iron oxide was reported to exhibit the adsorption capacity of 3115 54 180 μg g at ph 3 from an initial concentration ranged 10 000 100 000 μg l bakatula et al 2017 moreover masindi and gitari 2016 reported on the application of magnesite for the treatment of mine effluents which yield an adsorption capacity of 1400 μg g from an initial concentration of 20 000 μg l arsenic removal from iron nails embedded with sand layers reported 60 80 from field setup in souriya village burkina faso for first six months whereas laboratory column showed 95 removal with an effluent of 10 μg l bretzler et al 2020 the mechanism the iron nail sand filters release fe2 which reacts with oxygen to form an oxidant that oxidizes arsenite to arsenate and thus arsenate can be adsorbed by fe3 that was produced at the same moment of producing fe2 the laterite soil mixed with granular ferric hydroxide was reported in bukina faso to remove as from an initial concentration of 500 μg l to obtain an adsorption capacity of 50 μg g sanou and pare 2021 another study applying a termite mound technique for as removal of 99 under ph 3 to 9 was reported in ethiopia fufa et al 2014 arsenic removal of 97 with independent of ph when ferrasols adsorbent was applied on water treatment a laboratory scale was reported in tanzania kassenga and mato 2008 most of the remediation techniques were successful on a laboratory scale but cannot be of high efficiency once tested in the field however the use of locally available materials can decrease operating costs in low income countries 4 3 disposal of arsenic waste materials reusability of as removal materials led to as waste generation which requires proper disposal facilities failure to as waste disposal led to the generation of secondary as contamination in the environment the most process used for disposal is stabilization or solidification by ca and fe ii compounds before landfilling to prevent mobility of as most suggestion for stabilized solid waste disposal relies on hazardous or municipal landfills without considering the as re leaching process into the environment however the constructed landfill under strict safety protocols can be safe for disposal of the stabilized sold wastes the liquid waste should be submitted to the destruction unity and the exhausted adsorbents are treated by portland cement to prevent leaching of as into the environment litter et al 2019 as stabilization and solidification by cement caco3 and fe2 forms insoluble precipitates of ca3 aso4 2 and scorodite feaso4 2h2o respectively scorodite being the best stabilizer its stability is increased by the addition of polyferric sulfate and aluminium silicate gel bioremediation using plants can be more feasible to eliminate disposal problems fu et al 2017 it was reported that as accumulated plants can be disposed in the ocean where marine algae convert as into useful nutrient also can be ashed and digested to reduce the amount of deposited biomass mirza et al 2014 however disposal into the ocean is not an ecofriendly method as it contaminates marine organisms more research on how to dispose or degrade as waste material is required for future development and sustainability 5 conclusion the current review covers the general as occurrence concept and spatial variability on limited as studies in africa and affordable removal techniques arsenic occurrence in african environments demonstrates high spatial variability on as concentration between countries and within the same country from one geological area to another based on documented literature as is induced in the environment through natural processes such as weathering of rocks sulfide mineral oxidation bacterial redox and the anthropogenic activities mainly mining coal burning industrial sewage run off emissions and forest fires natural processes can be considered dominant in case of tanzania where as was detected in bore hole located far from mining area climatic factors such as droughts flooding land use pattern depth of an aquifer can also contribute to as release into groundwater in natural waters as exists in two forms of species as iii and as v as is a deadly element that leads to cancers of skin and internal organs such as kidney lungs liver and urinary bladder the main route of as exposure to human are through drinking water and food sources the african studies demonstrate high levels of as in plants such as cassava roots and leaves that are used as staple food among rural communities which create another risk of as exposure to human body some pregnant women are exposed to soil consumption of as contaminated soil mainly in east african countries which can be a risk to unborn infant few as removal studies were reported in africa but its removal efficiency was high at laboratory scale the sustainable as mitigation options such as targeting safe aquifer or alternative sources and utilization of locally available adsorptive systems are proposed for usability in african countries to simplify operations minimize cost and create future research interest as disposal through bioremediation is an ecofriendly choice of disposal however more research is required to investigate its future usability and stability the gaps to be addressed in future are as contamination linked to cancer cases around gold mining areas climate effect to as release into water affordable water treatment techniques and ways better to disposal declaration of competing

11786,the bagmati river running through kathmandu valley is heavily polluted because of increasing and unmanaged urbanization solid waste disposal and uncontrolled domestic and industrial sewage discharge centralized wastewater management has achieved little change and further deterioration is anticipated this paper identifies the principal causes and proposes key measures for improvement using strategies such as artificial aeration artificial floating islands improved waste water treatment and drainage nets a descriptive solution model to further enhance the water quality in bagmati river is described that aims to restore the declining aquatic ecosystem and river environment the proposed descriptive solution model can be made applicable to any kind of river and or river corridor furthermore this study also suggests considering export coefficient as a dynamic variable while assessing non point pollution sources in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords river water pollution pollution control bagmati river water quality wastewater 1 introduction water pollution is a critical global issue with over 80 of wastewater around the world being released into natural water systems the situation is more acute in developing countries where over 95 of wastewater is estimated to have been released into the water bodies without treatment un 2017 such pollution poses a major threat to environmental and human health and limits the proper reuse of water resources according to world health organization who the environmental burden of disease accounts for 24 of the total burden of disease in nepal who 2009 it is evident that developing countries are more impacted than developed countries in terms of water pollution especially faecal and heavy metal pollution sikder et al 2013 thus in accordance with the united nations sustainable goals by 2030 un 2020 urgent actions in wastewater management improving water quality and restoring water related ecosystems is necessary urban rivers pose their own set of challenges the urban areas are normally in a state of transition with social political economic ecological and environmental tensions leading to visible water stresses including water scarcity decreasing water quality and climatic variability ramtel et al 2021 however previous efforts have shown that it is possible to restore the natural condition of the rivers with the implementation of appropriate technologies strategies and policies such examples include the qinhuai river in china thames river in the uk and emscher river in germany adb 2008 wang et al 2012 hardach 2015 guanuna 2015 perini and sabbion 2017 the qinhuai river in nanjing city of china once heavily degraded because of industrial and municipal discharge which included solid waste was rehabilitated around 2002 by several integrated projects which included water replenishment river dredging sewage interception and treatment storm water drainage relocation of households and polluting factories riverbank restoration establishment of ecological parks and green spaces etc adb 2008 gon 2009 similarly thames river which was highly polluted around 19th century made a remarkable recovery through river restoration strategies such as improved waste treatment facilities removal of industrial trash and the addition of oxygen to the river using bubble boat technology use of biodegradable detergent along with nearly 400 habitat enhancement projects waste4change 2019 river emscher in germany which was extremely polluted during the age of industrialization primarily as a result of coal mining was successfully recovered through construction of decentralized wastewater treatment plants wwtps pumping stations interceptor drains along the rivers ecological restoration and naturalization of riverbanks and floodplains and the separation of storm water and wastewater irf 2010 the bagmati river which flows through the heart of kathmandu valley kv has been under strain for years resulting from lack of coordination poor planning and rapid urban expansion inputs of hazardous natural and anthropogenic contaminants result in high concentration of heavy metals such as nickel ni chromium cr and copper cu in the river especially in pre monsoon season which severely impacts the species relying in this aquatic ecosystem karunanidhi et al 2022 adhikari et al 2019 a comparison of estimated dissolved oxygen do and biochemical oxygen demand bod values for 2020 and 2030 with data from 2014 indicate that the river water quality is not likely to improve in the coming years mishra et al 2017 unless dramatic changes occur the 2020 projection has now been substantiated as the 2020 estimate was already exceeded by actual values in 2019 other water quality parameters such as measures of turbidity total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod as well as faecal coliform are all worsening predominantly during the dry seasons moud 2019a there is need for a comprehensive and scientific study for pollution control in the bagmati river that will assist policymakers researchers and technical people on restoring the river regime black to blue bagmati river the overarching goal of this study is to address the major technological efforts and activities along with the associated technical and practical challenges and opportunities for river restoration it also attempts to highlight a few potential technologies relevant to the current scenario of kv and a descriptive solution model that rectifies past shortcomings addresses current issues as well as aim to minimize potential future problems in the river 2 review methodology for the literature review the google scholar search engine https scholar google com was used and journal articles mostly after 2010 were reviewed keywords such as river pollution wastewater wastewater treatment and pollution control were used for the search to depict the status of river pollution in the bagmati river secondary data for river water quality parameters were taken from the department of urban development doud http bagmati gov np the current existing technologies were also thoroughly reviewed to obtain the status of their performance future possibilities and shortcomings in river water pollution mitigation then previous efforts in river restoration around the world were studied and a few technologies which could be relevant in the context of nepal were shortlisted to review the facts figures feasibility and performance capacity of those prospective technologies journal articles and online websites along with reports from different organizations were studied from their respective websites finally different locations were proposed for installation of each of the prospective technology considering the pollution level source of pollution as well as the topography of different places along the stretch of the river 3 brief description of river system within kv the bagmati river is the main and most religiously significant river in kathmandu it flows through various important parts of the district including the pashupatinath temple which exhibits remarkable cultural and religious landmark for the people throughout the country it is fed by 57 rivers and rivulets as its tributaries the major ones being bagmati bishnumati dhobikhola manohara nakkhu balkhu and tukucha ichhumati rivers and the five sub tributaries godavari hanumante sanga mahadev and kodku khola fig 1 and fig 2 the average elevation of the river in kv is 1325 m and the longitudinal profile is drastically changed from 2400 m shivapuri to 1300 m over the span of 10 km inside the kathmandu valley fig 3 however self cleaning velocity of the river water is lacking during the dry season 4 bagmati river pollution nepal was the fifth fastest urbanizing countries during the years of 1990 2018 and is projected to become the second fastest in the years 2018 2050 un 2019 kv has high population growth rate about 6 6 per annum and population density more than 2500 persons km2 kukl 2018a centralization and rapid urbanization has been the main driver for the valleys waste and wastewater generation shrestha et al 2015 hydro morphological disturbances poor solid waste and wastewater management ineffective enforcement of laws and regulations and economic activities such as business industry and services have created massive pressure on the urban rivers of the valley platman 2014 increase in the number of urban slum areas as well as haphazard unplanned road development near the river side and high traffic in the city khadka et al 2019 are also major stresses to the ecological balance of the river in addition unrestrained quarrying of sand has proved to be detrimental to the self purifying capacity of the river 5 major pollution sources in the bagmati river 5 1 solid wastes illegal dumping of solid waste and littering along the banks and into the bagmati river is one of the major and evident causes of river environment degradation such solid wastes include plastics organic wastes paper and paper products textiles rubbers and leathers metals glass etc adb 2013b over 60 of the solid trash in the valley is reported to be dumped on the road or near river banks and nearly 25 of the total solids reach open waterways uprety 2017 a study has shown that an average of more than 70 000 number of plastic pieces micro and macro per day passed a point in areas along the bagmati river within the valley milner et al 2015 around 17 metric tons of solid wastes from gusingal near tripureshwar two metric tons near bishnumati river and around 11 metric tons from samakhusi and gongabu were estimated to have been extracted from the river the kathmandu post 2017 5 2 domestic and industrial wastewater because of rapid modernization there has been an increase in water usage with installation of flush toilets washing machines and solar water heaters within the valley all of which increase the volume of wastewater generated nwcf 2009 industrial effluents include hazardous chemicals minerals high quantities of oxygen demanding wastes and synthetic organic compounds which can have severe impact on river health when discharged without treatment shukla et al 2012 industrial wastewater however makes up only 7 of the total wastewater generated while domestic wastewater contributes the remaining 93 kukl 2013 currently more than 95 of the sewerage generated ends up into the rivers without any form of treatment approximately 60 of households have direct connections to the sewage network but sewage canals are discharged directly into the bagmati river hpcidbc 2011 5 3 storm water runoff first flush of storm water runoff in urban areas contains the highest pollutant levels bach et al 2010 heavy rainfall can carry organic and inorganic pollutants from different sources such as uncollected solid wastes agricultural lands road surfaces atmosphere and can critically affect the urban river systems shukla et al 2012 agricultural runoff contains nutrients pesticides organics pathogens metals sediments and salts use of excessive fertilizer causes nitrogen and phosphorous to leach into groundwater or reach water bodies via runoff creating nutrient pollution mateo sagasta et al 2017 high alkalinity and salinity in groundwater can have devastating consequences on the drinking water quality as well as crop yield karunanidhi et al 2021 thus the presence of sizeable agricultural fields on the outskirts of the river especially at sundarijal and chovar area conceivably exacerbates the situation also road surfaces contain a number of pollutants such as dust particles heavy metals hydrocarbons suspended solids vehicle and road wear etc mangani et al 2005 such wide ranges of pollutants contribute to the contamination of aquatic systems in the valley 5 4 bagmati river water quality numerous studies on the water quality condition of the bagmati river mishra et al 2017 milner et al 2015 kayastha 2016 have indicated i very low do concentrations ii high bod and cod iii high concentrations of ammonia nitrate phosphate chloride sodium and manganese milner et al 2015 iv high coliform count v presence of heavy metals in the river water and sediments such as cadmium lead mercury copper zinc and chromium these poor water quality parameters have mostly been prevalent in the aryaghat chobar section as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 which is mainly attributed to the intense cremation activities at the aryaghat and direct disposal of domestic sewage in downstream section despite ongoing efforts to curb the river pollution fig 4 shows that do concentrations have gradually decreased over the years far below nepal s acceptable standard of 5 to 8 mg l for aquatic ecosystems cbs 2019 this corroborates the fact that most of the efforts for the improvement of the water quality of bagmati river have not met with much success the do value was found to be maximum at sundarijal around 7 mg l figs 5 and 6 which can be attributed to less mixing of polluted tributaries as well as low domestic discharge because of lower population density do levels were continuously found to decrease at other locations along the length the river with the do levels post monsoon being below acceptable ranges the do from minbhawan to chovar being below 1 mg l fig 6 shows mixing of different pollutants along the river and its consequent effects on the water quality sundarijal was found to be the least turbid both during dry and wet seasons while the value increased rapidly from minbhawan area to chovar this could be attributed to the highly inhabited area slightly downstream from the squatter settlements similar trends were observed for tss tds bod and cod as well given lower pollution levels during the monsoon it can be inferred that the heavy flow in the river has a great influence in the reduction of pollutants and improvement in the water quality as the water gets diluted and aerated because of the rapid flow this relationship also gives rise to the idea of possibly introducing a concept of designing large rainwater storage tanks near the river to influence the flow during the dry period 6 major current technologies and efforts for the river pollution management 6 1 centralized wastewater treatment plants centralized wastewater treatment plant is one of the most common forms of water pollution control technology in the world wastewater treatment plants wwtp provide processes that are designed and operated such that they mimic the natural treatment processes ramadan et al 2016 to address the growing crisis of water pollution health and sanitation in the kv five wastewater treatment plants hanumanghat sallaghari kodku dhobighat and guheswori wwtp were constructed circa 1980 funded and constructed through international aid however because of the poor operation and maintenance o m lack of technical manpower and mismanagement these plants have exhibited various problems such as sludge accumulation frequent power outage and non functioning flow control which results in flow short circuiting in the system causing the plants to remain either non functional or only partially functional since their construction 6 2 future prospects of the wwtps kathmandu valley wastewater management project kvwmp an asian development bank adb funded project has been proposed and is underway aspires to i expand and rehabilitate the existing wastewater treatment plants and sewage pumping station of the valley table 1 ii generate energy of approximately 434 kw kw through sludge digestion and or gasification iii rehabilitate approximately 126 km sewer and construct 151 km new sewer infrastructure iv rehabilitate and construct approximately 101 km of sewage interceptors along the urban rivers of the valley 6 3 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands cw introduced towards the end of 1990s are designed to mimic the natural processes found in natural wetland ecosystems in a more controlled environment which treats wastewater through wetland vegetation soils and associated microbial assemblages epso 2014 different cws have been used in nepal table 2 the most common type being the reed bed treatment system rbts which is a sub surface flow treatment system the common type of plant used in nepal is phragmites karka kvwmp has proposed the rehabilitation of a 0 925 ha rbts plant at gokarna a peri urban area which will have a capacity to treat 0 6 mld wastewater and bod effluent standard of 15 mg l kukl 2013 the biggest deterring factors against the use of cws are the low treatment capacity and large land requirements the low uptake and use of this infrastructure has also resulted in clogging and blockages of filter media and pipe systems moreover there are not appropriate desilting and primary settling ponds and wastewater overflow can also occur because of storm water infiltration during the monsoon considering the large amount of wastewater production in the valley and costly lands in dense urban areas cws has been limited to peri urban areas and emerging cities 6 4 flow augmentation dams river flow regime impacts many parameters of water quality like concentrations of pollutants and nutrients water temperature etc overton et al 2014 minimum flows are required to maintain riverine ecosystems and provide critical contributions to river health such as increased self purification capacity wang et al 2012 in order to address the need for flow augmentation in the bagmati river during the dry season and to enable dilution of wastewater effluents the government of nepal with support from adb envisioned the expansion of the existing dhap dam and the construction of another nagmati dam through the formulation of bagmati river basin improvement project brbip in early 2011 dhi group 2013 the operation of dhap dam is expected to provide water quality standard for bathing bod 6 mg l do 3 mg l at temple sites of pashupatinath in the dry season during festivals through the strategic disclosure of water the beneficial impacts of the construction of the dams include i increased groundwater recharge along the river stretch ii improved hygienic quality of the river water and reduction of health risks during recreational or religious use iii increased power generation providing opportunities for generating income for river basin improvements however consideration must be given to the fact that the construction of these dams interrupts the natural flow and the transportation of organic and inorganic matters in the river and impacts the biological and chemical properties of the river ecosystem therefore there is a need to determine the necessary volume and timing of water flows that more closely resembles the natural flow patterns needed to ensure a healthy river flow regime 6 5 riparian environment improvement the need to protect the river environment from human interventions and encroachments has necessitated the demarcation of buffer zones on both sides of the valley river corridor sharma and bremer 2009 building bye laws and high powered committee for integrated development of the bagmati civilization hpcidbc has specified a row right of way of 4 40 m on either side of the river banks guidelines by kathmandu valley town development committee kvtdc have stated that permanent structures are not allowed to be constructed within the 20 m buffer area of urban rivers kukl 2018c several previous studies have recommended the need for green zoning in urban rivers in kv dhi group 2013 sharma and bremer 2009 moud 2019b hpcidbc has been undertaking the creation and maintenance of the riparian buffer zones which includes afforestation landscaping development of public parks and extension and maintenance of riverside road networks of the 28 proposed locations for the construction of these parks 16 have been completed with six under construction hpcidbc 2018 6 6 cleaning campaigns among various grass root efforts bagmati river clean up mega campaign has been one of the longest running river clean up campaign taylor 2013 started in may 2013 by hpcidbc this weekly campaign with about 800 000 volunteers and about 1800 organizations has removed more than 8000 metric tonnes of waste by its fifth year hpcidbc 2018 until the problem of rampant waste disposal is tackled such efforts despite their apparent success are both laborious and potentially futile these campaigns do however provide important messaging to the population around the need to change behaviours in order to improve river health 7 prospective technologies with the current technologies and efforts as discussed failing to completely address the ongoing situation of the bagmati river pollution the need to introduce better scientific technologies and strategies in the immediate future is imminent the following technologies have been identified to potentially play key roles in mitigating river pollution in the bagmati river 7 1 artificial aeration using hydraulic structures aeration increases the do content and enhances the growth of various microorganisms to break down biological wastes using various biochemical and biodegradation processes wang et al 2012 gravity aeration is the least costly method which increases the do concentration through the turbulence created in the water bodies moulick et al 2010 it can be achieved by constructing simple hydraulic structures such as simple weirs and stepped cascades for the sole purpose of aeration installation of stepped cascades could be very effective in the kv situation because it has an intrinsic low cost high speed of construction and very low operating cost moreover potential air water gas exchange rate which is the spontaneity with which oxygen is transferred by diffusion is very high in stepped cascades as compared to linear streams the order of exchange depends upon the prevailing conditions of the river as well as the physical properties of the installed aerator thus although the contact time of water with the structure is short the amount of diffused oxygen is more or less equivalent to that over several kilometres along the river stretch khdhiri et al 2014 the aeration efficiency of the stepped cascade depends upon the physical properties water density dynamic viscosity of water roughness of step material flow properties water flow rate and geometric properties step length step height cascade width flow critical height stepped cascade total height khdhiri et al 2014 primarily three flow regimes can be visually observed at different flow rates for identical step geometry fig 7 at low flow rates nappe regime at high flow rates skimming regime and flow rates in between transition regime khdhiri et al 2014 it has been well documented that effective aeration occurs at nappe flow because of high residence time high turbulence and significant air entrainment baylar et al 2007 this can be achieved when the step height is increased and unit discharge and channel slope is decreased in the case of bagmati and its tributaries whose channel slope is relatively low within the valley from about 10 km from shivapuri up to chovar at 35 km referring to fig 3 and where the pollution load is high during dry season a nappe flow regime could be achieved with a properly designed stepped cascade furthermore such cascades could also be strategically placed downstream of wwtps to eliminate residual pollution 7 2 artificial floating island afi this technology is a modified aquatic ecosystem which is constructed using floating mat raft that supports the hydroponic growth of terrestrial and aquatic plants č ule et al 2017 it utilizes the symbiotic relationship between plants microorganisms algae substrates and water in order to effectively remove the pollutants basically there are three major mechanisms for pollutant removal i biological uptake in which plant roots directly absorb the pollutants especially nutrients from the water while also supporting the attached microorganisms ii microbial decomposition in which microorganisms in the rafts and roots degrade complex organic materials and reduce concentration of nitrate phosphate and heavy metals shahid et al 2019 iii filtration achieved by the plants which develop significant mass of root systems which form root biofilm network of an afi for fine suspended particulates and pollutants č ule et al 2017 regarding pollutants removal efficiency zhang et al compared different plant spacies and found that scirpus validus and alternanthera philoxeroides showed high nitrogen and phosphorus removal nearly 90 and 80 respectively zhang et al 2014 installation of such islands along the chicago and brent rivers are examples of where this approach has drastically improved river quality rei co op journal 2020 citylab 2019 this kind of technology may be suitable in the context of bagmati river too the main stem of the bagmati river within the kv has potential large swathes of land that could be utilized for constructing afis brbip project entails the construction of river walls along the stretches of the bagmati river to protect and delineate the river boundary this technology can be implemented in river stretches that lack natural riverbanks to bring back the natural edge of the rivers this technology is feasible even in the narrow river corridor such as dhobi khola which have sharp concrete riverbanks and whose edges could be utilized to construct a floating island similar to that in the chicago river for this technology to be feasible and effective haphazard disposal of solid wastes onto the river should be limited regarding the technical aspects of afis its design heavily depends upon the wastewater types and treatment objectives therefore it is difficult to generalize potential performance from past studies faulwetter et al 2011 further location specific research is required on the effectiveness of the native aquatic plants appropriate planting media and long term performance of full scale systems to develop robust design systems in the most pollution section of the river i e minbhawan balkhu from figs 5 and 6 a basic reconnaissance survey was carried out by the authors to propose the potential locations where the afis could be installed the basis primarily being the sufficiently large width of river stretches and the artificial rigid riverbank edges three of the six proposed locations table 3 are the intersection junctions between the bagmati river and its tributaries which are low flow rivers flowing at a gentle slope can be visualized with figs 2 and 3 this strategic installation can potentially decrease the levels of toxic ingredients like nitrogen and phosphorus before they intermix into the main river channel from these tributaries and lead to further pollution downstream 7 3 drainage nets first used in the city of kwinana western australia in 2018 drainage nets provide a simple yet effective technology which has proven to be sustainable for the management of solid wastes this technique has helped minimize the pressure on the city s environmental impact on the drainage structures it consists of a removable heavy duty ultraviolet specialized polyethylene net and a stainless steel sleeve extension which fits into an existing or new outlet fig 8 the net is capable of capturing and retaining various sizes of particulates ranging from 2000 to 16000 μm these captured particulates are transferred by the piped drainage system through residential or industrial areas with the gross pollutants capture efficiency being more than 90 for particulate size greater than 16 000 μm city of kwinana 2018 the unique release mechanism of the system allows it to disengage when full effectively avoiding the potential risks of clogging during heavy collection of wastes and large storm water runoff the fact that drainage nets can easily be retrofitted into any drainage outlet without any adverse consequences on the natural ecosystem and hydraulic properties of the flow makes the system viable for use uas 2019 these nets are feasible for locations with limited accessibility or significant cost constraint and work efficaciously in tidal partially submerged and dry environments the cleaning frequency and cost mostly depend upon the nearby environment and waste generated with low initial and maintainance costs large catchment potential and the life expectancies of nets being nearly 5 years city of kwinana 2018 this technology looks like a better prospect for management of solid wastes in urban river and mitigation of river water pollution drainage nets can potentially be installed along the drainage network outlets like fig 9 in between areas that have taken a heavy toll of unmanaged solid wastes and littering most prominently between the stretch from minbhawan to balkhu also with the proposed wwtps in tukucha and khokana along with the rehabilitation of the exisiting wwtps drainage nets could serve as excellent screening filters if properly installed at the upstream of the treatment plants they can also be installed at the waste outlet of the industries which have always found a way into the river and have been identified as one of the chief river water pollution contributors with massively increasing volumes of waste generated the bigger picture should be control of the solid waste at source points to prevent mixing in river water but still for the near future drainage nets could well serve as single waste collection points across and along the bagmati river and aid in the mitigation of the deterioration water quality in the river 8 proposed descriptive solution model given the issues identified and technologies discussed above the authors outline a brief synopsis of the solution model for urban river purification fig 10 along with the restoration actions that may be undertaken and the proposed outcome of those actions table 4 furthermore the authors also provide a comprehensive outlook of the potential locations of these technologies fig 11 as guidelines for implementing this strategy 9 challenges rapid and unmanaged urbanization and population increase are challenges that result in a poor waste management system political instability poor inter ministerial coordination lack of capacity as well as good intention on the part of development agencies are some of the impeding factors that has resulted in sluggish work culture and failure of policy challenges such as inefficient private sector and the lack of transparency in planning and implementation cannot be ignored campbell 2008 similarly lack of coordination between different wastewater sewerage disposal utilities is evident through the dilapidated state of the sewer networks and manholes as 10 20 repairs are currently required each month kukl 2008 only 30 of the 1750 households surveyed in the three districts within the kv were using septic tanks while the remaining 70 directly disposed wastewater into the sewers or municipal drains hpcidbc 2011 35 of those septic systems had a soak pit and in the remainder most of the faecal sludge collected found their way into the rivers kukl 2013 such poor management of faecal sludge and the lack of adequately functioning septic tanks has posed a major challenge in effective river pollution management lack of separation of sanitary sewers and storm water drains combined with frequent clogging of sewer drains causes the rainwater mixed sewage to overflow posing environmental and public health risk around 85 of about 17 000 illegal squatters in the valley reside along or in close proximity to the urban rivers and its flood plains un habitat 2015 squatter settlements pose as a major obstacle to river restoration because they occupy potential lands that could be used for interceptor drains and green spaces platman 2014 intensive settlement in the riverbanks and flood plains impairs the natural mechanisms of rivers which could also trigger potential catastrophes 10 opportunities healthy rivers achieved through various technologies and efforts offer various opportunities including social and economic benefits including the creation of pleasing and inviting environmental spaces energy can be recovered from wwtps in the form of biogas providing heat and electricity along with reduction in cost of managing biodegradable waste partially treated wastewater could be used as fertilizer through recycling of nutrients neczaj and grosser 2018 aquaculture which has huge potential to strengthen the economy in nepal has high water demand which could be addressed by reusing wastewater as a substantially high source of nutrients for algae and other organisms which could also be a feed source for aquaculture paudel et al 2019 adhikari et al 2020 investments in river pollution control technologies although costly can provide ongoing improvements and economic growth through increased ecological services tourism development lower health expenses and biodiversity restoration development of green spaces along the river bank can help to restore biodiversity through rejuvenation of aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna while providing natural soil cover and vegetation thereby preventing bank erosion sharma and bremer 2009 in addition controlling urban river pollution will also lead to increased ground water quality and increased flow in the urban rivers through the operation of dams which will increase ground water recharge rate and also activate restorative ecological processes hou et al 2007 11 future scope of the study regarding the future scope of this study there are ample opportunities to adopt various advanced tools and technologies to estimate water quality index parameters which will provide appropriate insights to the concerned authorities to make informed decisions in the future one of the limitations of this study is the evaluation of the selected prospective technologies with respect to uncertainties in different water quality parameters the technologies were selected on the basis of the feasibility in the bagmati river with regards to their technical performance ease of installation economy as well as maintenance however for a more systematic approach of selection techniques like sensitivity analysis sa could be performed in future studies appropriate data regarding technical capabilities along with the hydrological and sediment load data are required to perform such analysis sun et al 2012 also some technologies like advanced integrated wastewater ponds aiwp and chemically enhanced primary treatment cept are effective methods used in some developed countries but were not recommended in the context of developing country like nepal because of requirement of large capital cost land and costly maintenance thus in the future there is an opportunity to analyse various technologies under different scenario parameters uncertainty and confidence interval using sa for better selection of these technologies moreover mathematical techniques like fuzzy decision making have been recently adopted to estimate various water quality parameters like do bod cod ph and develop suitable fuzzy comprehensive water quality index fcwqi models singh et al 2019 such models can be used as decision support systems to estimate water quality in urban rivers like the bagmati river in the future and can also be useful for other beneficial uses like drinking water irrigation controlled waste disposal etc however specific regional datasets and large computational analysis pose as limitations for this approach another possibility includes the accurate estimation of non point sources of pollution parameters in order to increase the effectiveness of pollution controlling which is generally estimated by using export coefficient as a dynamic attribute bayesian based approach modelling has been used in the recent past to assess the different uncertainties of parameters in non point source pollution mechanism modelling xueman et al 2020 however this method is also highly time consuming and required a lot of runtime iterations and memory consumption 12 conclusions this study investigated the current environmental status with existing technological and policy efforts implemented in the bagmati river past efforts in the form of construction of wastewater treatment plants employing different technologies failed to adequately address the pollution of bagmati more recent efforts to reduce urban river pollution in the valley have shown positive impacts and the future of the bagmati river environment seems promising apart from the technological efforts simple infrastructure projects such afis drainage nets and stepped cascades provide promising opportunities for the improvement of any river environment policy makers should also be aware of the trade offs and opportunity costs that come from sacrificing the health of urban rivers for other benefits it is imperative to rethink the policy decisions to improve river health because of the longer term

11786,the bagmati river running through kathmandu valley is heavily polluted because of increasing and unmanaged urbanization solid waste disposal and uncontrolled domestic and industrial sewage discharge centralized wastewater management has achieved little change and further deterioration is anticipated this paper identifies the principal causes and proposes key measures for improvement using strategies such as artificial aeration artificial floating islands improved waste water treatment and drainage nets a descriptive solution model to further enhance the water quality in bagmati river is described that aims to restore the declining aquatic ecosystem and river environment the proposed descriptive solution model can be made applicable to any kind of river and or river corridor furthermore this study also suggests considering export coefficient as a dynamic variable while assessing non point pollution sources in the future graphical abstract image 1 keywords river water pollution pollution control bagmati river water quality wastewater 1 introduction water pollution is a critical global issue with over 80 of wastewater around the world being released into natural water systems the situation is more acute in developing countries where over 95 of wastewater is estimated to have been released into the water bodies without treatment un 2017 such pollution poses a major threat to environmental and human health and limits the proper reuse of water resources according to world health organization who the environmental burden of disease accounts for 24 of the total burden of disease in nepal who 2009 it is evident that developing countries are more impacted than developed countries in terms of water pollution especially faecal and heavy metal pollution sikder et al 2013 thus in accordance with the united nations sustainable goals by 2030 un 2020 urgent actions in wastewater management improving water quality and restoring water related ecosystems is necessary urban rivers pose their own set of challenges the urban areas are normally in a state of transition with social political economic ecological and environmental tensions leading to visible water stresses including water scarcity decreasing water quality and climatic variability ramtel et al 2021 however previous efforts have shown that it is possible to restore the natural condition of the rivers with the implementation of appropriate technologies strategies and policies such examples include the qinhuai river in china thames river in the uk and emscher river in germany adb 2008 wang et al 2012 hardach 2015 guanuna 2015 perini and sabbion 2017 the qinhuai river in nanjing city of china once heavily degraded because of industrial and municipal discharge which included solid waste was rehabilitated around 2002 by several integrated projects which included water replenishment river dredging sewage interception and treatment storm water drainage relocation of households and polluting factories riverbank restoration establishment of ecological parks and green spaces etc adb 2008 gon 2009 similarly thames river which was highly polluted around 19th century made a remarkable recovery through river restoration strategies such as improved waste treatment facilities removal of industrial trash and the addition of oxygen to the river using bubble boat technology use of biodegradable detergent along with nearly 400 habitat enhancement projects waste4change 2019 river emscher in germany which was extremely polluted during the age of industrialization primarily as a result of coal mining was successfully recovered through construction of decentralized wastewater treatment plants wwtps pumping stations interceptor drains along the rivers ecological restoration and naturalization of riverbanks and floodplains and the separation of storm water and wastewater irf 2010 the bagmati river which flows through the heart of kathmandu valley kv has been under strain for years resulting from lack of coordination poor planning and rapid urban expansion inputs of hazardous natural and anthropogenic contaminants result in high concentration of heavy metals such as nickel ni chromium cr and copper cu in the river especially in pre monsoon season which severely impacts the species relying in this aquatic ecosystem karunanidhi et al 2022 adhikari et al 2019 a comparison of estimated dissolved oxygen do and biochemical oxygen demand bod values for 2020 and 2030 with data from 2014 indicate that the river water quality is not likely to improve in the coming years mishra et al 2017 unless dramatic changes occur the 2020 projection has now been substantiated as the 2020 estimate was already exceeded by actual values in 2019 other water quality parameters such as measures of turbidity total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod as well as faecal coliform are all worsening predominantly during the dry seasons moud 2019a there is need for a comprehensive and scientific study for pollution control in the bagmati river that will assist policymakers researchers and technical people on restoring the river regime black to blue bagmati river the overarching goal of this study is to address the major technological efforts and activities along with the associated technical and practical challenges and opportunities for river restoration it also attempts to highlight a few potential technologies relevant to the current scenario of kv and a descriptive solution model that rectifies past shortcomings addresses current issues as well as aim to minimize potential future problems in the river 2 review methodology for the literature review the google scholar search engine https scholar google com was used and journal articles mostly after 2010 were reviewed keywords such as river pollution wastewater wastewater treatment and pollution control were used for the search to depict the status of river pollution in the bagmati river secondary data for river water quality parameters were taken from the department of urban development doud http bagmati gov np the current existing technologies were also thoroughly reviewed to obtain the status of their performance future possibilities and shortcomings in river water pollution mitigation then previous efforts in river restoration around the world were studied and a few technologies which could be relevant in the context of nepal were shortlisted to review the facts figures feasibility and performance capacity of those prospective technologies journal articles and online websites along with reports from different organizations were studied from their respective websites finally different locations were proposed for installation of each of the prospective technology considering the pollution level source of pollution as well as the topography of different places along the stretch of the river 3 brief description of river system within kv the bagmati river is the main and most religiously significant river in kathmandu it flows through various important parts of the district including the pashupatinath temple which exhibits remarkable cultural and religious landmark for the people throughout the country it is fed by 57 rivers and rivulets as its tributaries the major ones being bagmati bishnumati dhobikhola manohara nakkhu balkhu and tukucha ichhumati rivers and the five sub tributaries godavari hanumante sanga mahadev and kodku khola fig 1 and fig 2 the average elevation of the river in kv is 1325 m and the longitudinal profile is drastically changed from 2400 m shivapuri to 1300 m over the span of 10 km inside the kathmandu valley fig 3 however self cleaning velocity of the river water is lacking during the dry season 4 bagmati river pollution nepal was the fifth fastest urbanizing countries during the years of 1990 2018 and is projected to become the second fastest in the years 2018 2050 un 2019 kv has high population growth rate about 6 6 per annum and population density more than 2500 persons km2 kukl 2018a centralization and rapid urbanization has been the main driver for the valleys waste and wastewater generation shrestha et al 2015 hydro morphological disturbances poor solid waste and wastewater management ineffective enforcement of laws and regulations and economic activities such as business industry and services have created massive pressure on the urban rivers of the valley platman 2014 increase in the number of urban slum areas as well as haphazard unplanned road development near the river side and high traffic in the city khadka et al 2019 are also major stresses to the ecological balance of the river in addition unrestrained quarrying of sand has proved to be detrimental to the self purifying capacity of the river 5 major pollution sources in the bagmati river 5 1 solid wastes illegal dumping of solid waste and littering along the banks and into the bagmati river is one of the major and evident causes of river environment degradation such solid wastes include plastics organic wastes paper and paper products textiles rubbers and leathers metals glass etc adb 2013b over 60 of the solid trash in the valley is reported to be dumped on the road or near river banks and nearly 25 of the total solids reach open waterways uprety 2017 a study has shown that an average of more than 70 000 number of plastic pieces micro and macro per day passed a point in areas along the bagmati river within the valley milner et al 2015 around 17 metric tons of solid wastes from gusingal near tripureshwar two metric tons near bishnumati river and around 11 metric tons from samakhusi and gongabu were estimated to have been extracted from the river the kathmandu post 2017 5 2 domestic and industrial wastewater because of rapid modernization there has been an increase in water usage with installation of flush toilets washing machines and solar water heaters within the valley all of which increase the volume of wastewater generated nwcf 2009 industrial effluents include hazardous chemicals minerals high quantities of oxygen demanding wastes and synthetic organic compounds which can have severe impact on river health when discharged without treatment shukla et al 2012 industrial wastewater however makes up only 7 of the total wastewater generated while domestic wastewater contributes the remaining 93 kukl 2013 currently more than 95 of the sewerage generated ends up into the rivers without any form of treatment approximately 60 of households have direct connections to the sewage network but sewage canals are discharged directly into the bagmati river hpcidbc 2011 5 3 storm water runoff first flush of storm water runoff in urban areas contains the highest pollutant levels bach et al 2010 heavy rainfall can carry organic and inorganic pollutants from different sources such as uncollected solid wastes agricultural lands road surfaces atmosphere and can critically affect the urban river systems shukla et al 2012 agricultural runoff contains nutrients pesticides organics pathogens metals sediments and salts use of excessive fertilizer causes nitrogen and phosphorous to leach into groundwater or reach water bodies via runoff creating nutrient pollution mateo sagasta et al 2017 high alkalinity and salinity in groundwater can have devastating consequences on the drinking water quality as well as crop yield karunanidhi et al 2021 thus the presence of sizeable agricultural fields on the outskirts of the river especially at sundarijal and chovar area conceivably exacerbates the situation also road surfaces contain a number of pollutants such as dust particles heavy metals hydrocarbons suspended solids vehicle and road wear etc mangani et al 2005 such wide ranges of pollutants contribute to the contamination of aquatic systems in the valley 5 4 bagmati river water quality numerous studies on the water quality condition of the bagmati river mishra et al 2017 milner et al 2015 kayastha 2016 have indicated i very low do concentrations ii high bod and cod iii high concentrations of ammonia nitrate phosphate chloride sodium and manganese milner et al 2015 iv high coliform count v presence of heavy metals in the river water and sediments such as cadmium lead mercury copper zinc and chromium these poor water quality parameters have mostly been prevalent in the aryaghat chobar section as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 which is mainly attributed to the intense cremation activities at the aryaghat and direct disposal of domestic sewage in downstream section despite ongoing efforts to curb the river pollution fig 4 shows that do concentrations have gradually decreased over the years far below nepal s acceptable standard of 5 to 8 mg l for aquatic ecosystems cbs 2019 this corroborates the fact that most of the efforts for the improvement of the water quality of bagmati river have not met with much success the do value was found to be maximum at sundarijal around 7 mg l figs 5 and 6 which can be attributed to less mixing of polluted tributaries as well as low domestic discharge because of lower population density do levels were continuously found to decrease at other locations along the length the river with the do levels post monsoon being below acceptable ranges the do from minbhawan to chovar being below 1 mg l fig 6 shows mixing of different pollutants along the river and its consequent effects on the water quality sundarijal was found to be the least turbid both during dry and wet seasons while the value increased rapidly from minbhawan area to chovar this could be attributed to the highly inhabited area slightly downstream from the squatter settlements similar trends were observed for tss tds bod and cod as well given lower pollution levels during the monsoon it can be inferred that the heavy flow in the river has a great influence in the reduction of pollutants and improvement in the water quality as the water gets diluted and aerated because of the rapid flow this relationship also gives rise to the idea of possibly introducing a concept of designing large rainwater storage tanks near the river to influence the flow during the dry period 6 major current technologies and efforts for the river pollution management 6 1 centralized wastewater treatment plants centralized wastewater treatment plant is one of the most common forms of water pollution control technology in the world wastewater treatment plants wwtp provide processes that are designed and operated such that they mimic the natural treatment processes ramadan et al 2016 to address the growing crisis of water pollution health and sanitation in the kv five wastewater treatment plants hanumanghat sallaghari kodku dhobighat and guheswori wwtp were constructed circa 1980 funded and constructed through international aid however because of the poor operation and maintenance o m lack of technical manpower and mismanagement these plants have exhibited various problems such as sludge accumulation frequent power outage and non functioning flow control which results in flow short circuiting in the system causing the plants to remain either non functional or only partially functional since their construction 6 2 future prospects of the wwtps kathmandu valley wastewater management project kvwmp an asian development bank adb funded project has been proposed and is underway aspires to i expand and rehabilitate the existing wastewater treatment plants and sewage pumping station of the valley table 1 ii generate energy of approximately 434 kw kw through sludge digestion and or gasification iii rehabilitate approximately 126 km sewer and construct 151 km new sewer infrastructure iv rehabilitate and construct approximately 101 km of sewage interceptors along the urban rivers of the valley 6 3 constructed wetlands constructed wetlands cw introduced towards the end of 1990s are designed to mimic the natural processes found in natural wetland ecosystems in a more controlled environment which treats wastewater through wetland vegetation soils and associated microbial assemblages epso 2014 different cws have been used in nepal table 2 the most common type being the reed bed treatment system rbts which is a sub surface flow treatment system the common type of plant used in nepal is phragmites karka kvwmp has proposed the rehabilitation of a 0 925 ha rbts plant at gokarna a peri urban area which will have a capacity to treat 0 6 mld wastewater and bod effluent standard of 15 mg l kukl 2013 the biggest deterring factors against the use of cws are the low treatment capacity and large land requirements the low uptake and use of this infrastructure has also resulted in clogging and blockages of filter media and pipe systems moreover there are not appropriate desilting and primary settling ponds and wastewater overflow can also occur because of storm water infiltration during the monsoon considering the large amount of wastewater production in the valley and costly lands in dense urban areas cws has been limited to peri urban areas and emerging cities 6 4 flow augmentation dams river flow regime impacts many parameters of water quality like concentrations of pollutants and nutrients water temperature etc overton et al 2014 minimum flows are required to maintain riverine ecosystems and provide critical contributions to river health such as increased self purification capacity wang et al 2012 in order to address the need for flow augmentation in the bagmati river during the dry season and to enable dilution of wastewater effluents the government of nepal with support from adb envisioned the expansion of the existing dhap dam and the construction of another nagmati dam through the formulation of bagmati river basin improvement project brbip in early 2011 dhi group 2013 the operation of dhap dam is expected to provide water quality standard for bathing bod 6 mg l do 3 mg l at temple sites of pashupatinath in the dry season during festivals through the strategic disclosure of water the beneficial impacts of the construction of the dams include i increased groundwater recharge along the river stretch ii improved hygienic quality of the river water and reduction of health risks during recreational or religious use iii increased power generation providing opportunities for generating income for river basin improvements however consideration must be given to the fact that the construction of these dams interrupts the natural flow and the transportation of organic and inorganic matters in the river and impacts the biological and chemical properties of the river ecosystem therefore there is a need to determine the necessary volume and timing of water flows that more closely resembles the natural flow patterns needed to ensure a healthy river flow regime 6 5 riparian environment improvement the need to protect the river environment from human interventions and encroachments has necessitated the demarcation of buffer zones on both sides of the valley river corridor sharma and bremer 2009 building bye laws and high powered committee for integrated development of the bagmati civilization hpcidbc has specified a row right of way of 4 40 m on either side of the river banks guidelines by kathmandu valley town development committee kvtdc have stated that permanent structures are not allowed to be constructed within the 20 m buffer area of urban rivers kukl 2018c several previous studies have recommended the need for green zoning in urban rivers in kv dhi group 2013 sharma and bremer 2009 moud 2019b hpcidbc has been undertaking the creation and maintenance of the riparian buffer zones which includes afforestation landscaping development of public parks and extension and maintenance of riverside road networks of the 28 proposed locations for the construction of these parks 16 have been completed with six under construction hpcidbc 2018 6 6 cleaning campaigns among various grass root efforts bagmati river clean up mega campaign has been one of the longest running river clean up campaign taylor 2013 started in may 2013 by hpcidbc this weekly campaign with about 800 000 volunteers and about 1800 organizations has removed more than 8000 metric tonnes of waste by its fifth year hpcidbc 2018 until the problem of rampant waste disposal is tackled such efforts despite their apparent success are both laborious and potentially futile these campaigns do however provide important messaging to the population around the need to change behaviours in order to improve river health 7 prospective technologies with the current technologies and efforts as discussed failing to completely address the ongoing situation of the bagmati river pollution the need to introduce better scientific technologies and strategies in the immediate future is imminent the following technologies have been identified to potentially play key roles in mitigating river pollution in the bagmati river 7 1 artificial aeration using hydraulic structures aeration increases the do content and enhances the growth of various microorganisms to break down biological wastes using various biochemical and biodegradation processes wang et al 2012 gravity aeration is the least costly method which increases the do concentration through the turbulence created in the water bodies moulick et al 2010 it can be achieved by constructing simple hydraulic structures such as simple weirs and stepped cascades for the sole purpose of aeration installation of stepped cascades could be very effective in the kv situation because it has an intrinsic low cost high speed of construction and very low operating cost moreover potential air water gas exchange rate which is the spontaneity with which oxygen is transferred by diffusion is very high in stepped cascades as compared to linear streams the order of exchange depends upon the prevailing conditions of the river as well as the physical properties of the installed aerator thus although the contact time of water with the structure is short the amount of diffused oxygen is more or less equivalent to that over several kilometres along the river stretch khdhiri et al 2014 the aeration efficiency of the stepped cascade depends upon the physical properties water density dynamic viscosity of water roughness of step material flow properties water flow rate and geometric properties step length step height cascade width flow critical height stepped cascade total height khdhiri et al 2014 primarily three flow regimes can be visually observed at different flow rates for identical step geometry fig 7 at low flow rates nappe regime at high flow rates skimming regime and flow rates in between transition regime khdhiri et al 2014 it has been well documented that effective aeration occurs at nappe flow because of high residence time high turbulence and significant air entrainment baylar et al 2007 this can be achieved when the step height is increased and unit discharge and channel slope is decreased in the case of bagmati and its tributaries whose channel slope is relatively low within the valley from about 10 km from shivapuri up to chovar at 35 km referring to fig 3 and where the pollution load is high during dry season a nappe flow regime could be achieved with a properly designed stepped cascade furthermore such cascades could also be strategically placed downstream of wwtps to eliminate residual pollution 7 2 artificial floating island afi this technology is a modified aquatic ecosystem which is constructed using floating mat raft that supports the hydroponic growth of terrestrial and aquatic plants č ule et al 2017 it utilizes the symbiotic relationship between plants microorganisms algae substrates and water in order to effectively remove the pollutants basically there are three major mechanisms for pollutant removal i biological uptake in which plant roots directly absorb the pollutants especially nutrients from the water while also supporting the attached microorganisms ii microbial decomposition in which microorganisms in the rafts and roots degrade complex organic materials and reduce concentration of nitrate phosphate and heavy metals shahid et al 2019 iii filtration achieved by the plants which develop significant mass of root systems which form root biofilm network of an afi for fine suspended particulates and pollutants č ule et al 2017 regarding pollutants removal efficiency zhang et al compared different plant spacies and found that scirpus validus and alternanthera philoxeroides showed high nitrogen and phosphorus removal nearly 90 and 80 respectively zhang et al 2014 installation of such islands along the chicago and brent rivers are examples of where this approach has drastically improved river quality rei co op journal 2020 citylab 2019 this kind of technology may be suitable in the context of bagmati river too the main stem of the bagmati river within the kv has potential large swathes of land that could be utilized for constructing afis brbip project entails the construction of river walls along the stretches of the bagmati river to protect and delineate the river boundary this technology can be implemented in river stretches that lack natural riverbanks to bring back the natural edge of the rivers this technology is feasible even in the narrow river corridor such as dhobi khola which have sharp concrete riverbanks and whose edges could be utilized to construct a floating island similar to that in the chicago river for this technology to be feasible and effective haphazard disposal of solid wastes onto the river should be limited regarding the technical aspects of afis its design heavily depends upon the wastewater types and treatment objectives therefore it is difficult to generalize potential performance from past studies faulwetter et al 2011 further location specific research is required on the effectiveness of the native aquatic plants appropriate planting media and long term performance of full scale systems to develop robust design systems in the most pollution section of the river i e minbhawan balkhu from figs 5 and 6 a basic reconnaissance survey was carried out by the authors to propose the potential locations where the afis could be installed the basis primarily being the sufficiently large width of river stretches and the artificial rigid riverbank edges three of the six proposed locations table 3 are the intersection junctions between the bagmati river and its tributaries which are low flow rivers flowing at a gentle slope can be visualized with figs 2 and 3 this strategic installation can potentially decrease the levels of toxic ingredients like nitrogen and phosphorus before they intermix into the main river channel from these tributaries and lead to further pollution downstream 7 3 drainage nets first used in the city of kwinana western australia in 2018 drainage nets provide a simple yet effective technology which has proven to be sustainable for the management of solid wastes this technique has helped minimize the pressure on the city s environmental impact on the drainage structures it consists of a removable heavy duty ultraviolet specialized polyethylene net and a stainless steel sleeve extension which fits into an existing or new outlet fig 8 the net is capable of capturing and retaining various sizes of particulates ranging from 2000 to 16000 μm these captured particulates are transferred by the piped drainage system through residential or industrial areas with the gross pollutants capture efficiency being more than 90 for particulate size greater than 16 000 μm city of kwinana 2018 the unique release mechanism of the system allows it to disengage when full effectively avoiding the potential risks of clogging during heavy collection of wastes and large storm water runoff the fact that drainage nets can easily be retrofitted into any drainage outlet without any adverse consequences on the natural ecosystem and hydraulic properties of the flow makes the system viable for use uas 2019 these nets are feasible for locations with limited accessibility or significant cost constraint and work efficaciously in tidal partially submerged and dry environments the cleaning frequency and cost mostly depend upon the nearby environment and waste generated with low initial and maintainance costs large catchment potential and the life expectancies of nets being nearly 5 years city of kwinana 2018 this technology looks like a better prospect for management of solid wastes in urban river and mitigation of river water pollution drainage nets can potentially be installed along the drainage network outlets like fig 9 in between areas that have taken a heavy toll of unmanaged solid wastes and littering most prominently between the stretch from minbhawan to balkhu also with the proposed wwtps in tukucha and khokana along with the rehabilitation of the exisiting wwtps drainage nets could serve as excellent screening filters if properly installed at the upstream of the treatment plants they can also be installed at the waste outlet of the industries which have always found a way into the river and have been identified as one of the chief river water pollution contributors with massively increasing volumes of waste generated the bigger picture should be control of the solid waste at source points to prevent mixing in river water but still for the near future drainage nets could well serve as single waste collection points across and along the bagmati river and aid in the mitigation of the deterioration water quality in the river 8 proposed descriptive solution model given the issues identified and technologies discussed above the authors outline a brief synopsis of the solution model for urban river purification fig 10 along with the restoration actions that may be undertaken and the proposed outcome of those actions table 4 furthermore the authors also provide a comprehensive outlook of the potential locations of these technologies fig 11 as guidelines for implementing this strategy 9 challenges rapid and unmanaged urbanization and population increase are challenges that result in a poor waste management system political instability poor inter ministerial coordination lack of capacity as well as good intention on the part of development agencies are some of the impeding factors that has resulted in sluggish work culture and failure of policy challenges such as inefficient private sector and the lack of transparency in planning and implementation cannot be ignored campbell 2008 similarly lack of coordination between different wastewater sewerage disposal utilities is evident through the dilapidated state of the sewer networks and manholes as 10 20 repairs are currently required each month kukl 2008 only 30 of the 1750 households surveyed in the three districts within the kv were using septic tanks while the remaining 70 directly disposed wastewater into the sewers or municipal drains hpcidbc 2011 35 of those septic systems had a soak pit and in the remainder most of the faecal sludge collected found their way into the rivers kukl 2013 such poor management of faecal sludge and the lack of adequately functioning septic tanks has posed a major challenge in effective river pollution management lack of separation of sanitary sewers and storm water drains combined with frequent clogging of sewer drains causes the rainwater mixed sewage to overflow posing environmental and public health risk around 85 of about 17 000 illegal squatters in the valley reside along or in close proximity to the urban rivers and its flood plains un habitat 2015 squatter settlements pose as a major obstacle to river restoration because they occupy potential lands that could be used for interceptor drains and green spaces platman 2014 intensive settlement in the riverbanks and flood plains impairs the natural mechanisms of rivers which could also trigger potential catastrophes 10 opportunities healthy rivers achieved through various technologies and efforts offer various opportunities including social and economic benefits including the creation of pleasing and inviting environmental spaces energy can be recovered from wwtps in the form of biogas providing heat and electricity along with reduction in cost of managing biodegradable waste partially treated wastewater could be used as fertilizer through recycling of nutrients neczaj and grosser 2018 aquaculture which has huge potential to strengthen the economy in nepal has high water demand which could be addressed by reusing wastewater as a substantially high source of nutrients for algae and other organisms which could also be a feed source for aquaculture paudel et al 2019 adhikari et al 2020 investments in river pollution control technologies although costly can provide ongoing improvements and economic growth through increased ecological services tourism development lower health expenses and biodiversity restoration development of green spaces along the river bank can help to restore biodiversity through rejuvenation of aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna while providing natural soil cover and vegetation thereby preventing bank erosion sharma and bremer 2009 in addition controlling urban river pollution will also lead to increased ground water quality and increased flow in the urban rivers through the operation of dams which will increase ground water recharge rate and also activate restorative ecological processes hou et al 2007 11 future scope of the study regarding the future scope of this study there are ample opportunities to adopt various advanced tools and technologies to estimate water quality index parameters which will provide appropriate insights to the concerned authorities to make informed decisions in the future one of the limitations of this study is the evaluation of the selected prospective technologies with respect to uncertainties in different water quality parameters the technologies were selected on the basis of the feasibility in the bagmati river with regards to their technical performance ease of installation economy as well as maintenance however for a more systematic approach of selection techniques like sensitivity analysis sa could be performed in future studies appropriate data regarding technical capabilities along with the hydrological and sediment load data are required to perform such analysis sun et al 2012 also some technologies like advanced integrated wastewater ponds aiwp and chemically enhanced primary treatment cept are effective methods used in some developed countries but were not recommended in the context of developing country like nepal because of requirement of large capital cost land and costly maintenance thus in the future there is an opportunity to analyse various technologies under different scenario parameters uncertainty and confidence interval using sa for better selection of these technologies moreover mathematical techniques like fuzzy decision making have been recently adopted to estimate various water quality parameters like do bod cod ph and develop suitable fuzzy comprehensive water quality index fcwqi models singh et al 2019 such models can be used as decision support systems to estimate water quality in urban rivers like the bagmati river in the future and can also be useful for other beneficial uses like drinking water irrigation controlled waste disposal etc however specific regional datasets and large computational analysis pose as limitations for this approach another possibility includes the accurate estimation of non point sources of pollution parameters in order to increase the effectiveness of pollution controlling which is generally estimated by using export coefficient as a dynamic attribute bayesian based approach modelling has been used in the recent past to assess the different uncertainties of parameters in non point source pollution mechanism modelling xueman et al 2020 however this method is also highly time consuming and required a lot of runtime iterations and memory consumption 12 conclusions this study investigated the current environmental status with existing technological and policy efforts implemented in the bagmati river past efforts in the form of construction of wastewater treatment plants employing different technologies failed to adequately address the pollution of bagmati more recent efforts to reduce urban river pollution in the valley have shown positive impacts and the future of the bagmati river environment seems promising apart from the technological efforts simple infrastructure projects such afis drainage nets and stepped cascades provide promising opportunities for the improvement of any river environment policy makers should also be aware of the trade offs and opportunity costs that come from sacrificing the health of urban rivers for other benefits it is imperative to rethink the policy decisions to improve river health because of the longer term

11787,the world today is facing a water crisis water and sanitation are central to sustainable development and critical for the survival of people and the planet among various other water contaminants it has recognized fluoride contamination as a primary concern worldwide posing a serious risk to human health and affecting potable water security core shell adsorbents are appropriate substitutes for existing water defluoridation materials and have shown excellent efficiency due to their high adsorption capacity easy separability reusability excellent magnetic properties also recent progress in employing core shell based materials has opened up many avenues for water defluoridation technologies although a few studies have already covered the use of core shell as adsorbents in the remediation of various contaminants their sole adsorptive applications regarding fluoride remediation have not been thoroughly explored yet therefore for the first time we try to cover the extensive applications of core shell adsorbents in the field of fluoride elimination from water over the last ten years this work gives an insight into how core shell adsorbents are superior to conventional and non conventional methods of defluoridation also special attention is paid to the current developments and challenges of various novel core shell adsorbents because of their significant mechanism of action lastly emerging technologies and challenges faced in this area of research are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorbents core shell fluoride nanomaterials removal 1 introduction 1 1 water contamination water is an indispensable component of all living organisms on earth water plays a very crucial role in our body system 60 75 of our body weight comprises water its versatile nature helps to carry out various chemical reactions while the molecular form of water maintains the shape of cells in recent times fluoride has attracted much attention as a natural element fluoride is exposed to humans mainly through food and drinking water fluoride contamination in water is a general concern in developing nations such as kenya bangladesh africa mexico india etc biswas et al 2017 the prime sources of fluoride contamination are coal factories yadav et al 2019 fertilizer manufacturing companies kabir et al 2020 and fluoride based batteries kimambo et al 2019 fluoride in low concentrations is beneficial atasoy et al 2016 however excess of fluoride is noxious for the biosphere and gives rise to chronic and acute diseases such as skeletal fluorosis dental fluorosis dhillon et al 2016 and many others according to world health organization who more than 1 5 mg l concentration of fluoride will be noxious to the human body karabulut and atasoy 2019a it can damage our nervous system valdez jim é nez et al 2011 reproductive system hao et al 2010 endocrine glands garc í a montalvo et al 2009 liver and kidney chattopadhyay et al 2011 the direct need for clean drinking water requires eliminating the excess fluoride and for this various techniques have been developed bhaumik et al 2011 such as adsorption dhillon et al 2018 wang et al 2017a precipitation dhillon et al 2017a ion exchange mulyati et al 2013 membrane separation electrocoagulation karabulut and atasoy 2019b reverse osmosis dhillon and kumar 2018 and many more these techniques have merits and demerits for instance the generation of undesired precipitate is the main disadvantage of the precipitation process similarly ion exchange technique is very costly and the interference of other ions is also a disadvantage the membrane process needs high maintenance and membrane degradation is a problem the coagulation method on the other hand consumes high electricity yazici karabulut et al 2019 amidst these adsorption has been found a promising method for the uptake of fluoride in every aspect due to its low cost ease of handling and fast speed dhillon et al 2017b atasoy and yesilnacar 2017 out of the various required properties adsorbent s surface area plays a vital part in the efficient adsorption various adsorbents are widely used for water defluoridation including activated alumina activated carbon zeolite clay silica gel atasoy and ö zdemir ş ahin 2014 hydroxyapatite chitosan beads etc nano adsorbents gained attention in the adsorption process due to their desirable properties such as large surface area high specification high reactivity self assembly atasoy and ö zdemir ş ahin 2014 structural diversity etc although nano sized adsorbents have many advantages separating nano sized adsorbents from solutions causes difficulties tatarchuk et al 2020 magnetic adsorbents are recognized as a better option to overcome these problems they make it possible to segregate the spent sorbent from the solution upon applying a magnetic field magnetic adsorbents can be used directly or as core shell structured sorbents atasoy et al 2013 as a result core shell adsorbents have been extensively studied in recent years and are widely used in water defluoridation and as chemical sensors the core shell structure offers a versatile strategy for water remediation the core shell structure comprises two or more materials and can be modified based on requirements depending on the core and the shell s characteristics the combined functionality of the core shell structure allows an extensive scope of applications in core shell structured composites magnetic adsorbents are protected by another material fig 1 a niu et al 2016 this is done to enhance stability functionality and uniform distribution ahmad et al 2016 core shell structured nano adsorbents are reliable due to their high adsorption capacity large surface area fast mass exchange and easy elution activity ghosh chaudhuri and paria 2012 they provide huge pore sizes for the uptake of fluoride the fluoride adsorption process on core shell adsorbent depends on the adsorbate adsorbent and adsorbate water interactions reusability is a unique feature of core shell structured absorbents compared to the cores that had not been modified the modified ones were observed to have a greater specific surface area less surface energy better stability and high polarity by changing the material of either core or shell we can adjust the core shell adsorbents properties the materials for the core are chosen and altered for a better fixation with the shell the shell must have a suitable thickness to withstand enough recognition sites for this very purpose various types of core shell fusion such as organic inorganic organic organic inorganic organic inorganic inorganic can be synthesized by coprecipitation grafting and sol gel method fig 1 b niu et al 2016 this work illustrates a core shell adsorbent s diverse properties and adsorption function for fluoride removal this review also scrutinizes the effect of ph kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities and mechanical stability therefore the present work provides valuable information about core shell structured adsorbents importance in removing fluoride 2 fluoride in water 2 1 chemistry of fluoride fluorine is not found naturally so it exists in an ionic state or compound forms such as fluoride ion fluorapatite fluorspar and cryolite fluoride is the 13th most abundant element on our planet s surface niu et al 2016 the main root of fluoride is fluorite also known as fluorspar caf2 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and cryolite na3alf6 are also good sources of fluoride it acts as a lewis weak base and is soluble in water due to its small radius and high charge to mass ratio fluoride ions are strongly solvated in protic solvents in an aprotic solvent fluoride ions are not solvated and are known as naked fluoride various types of fluoride salts are used in many industrial areas fluoride ion forms many solvable complexes with polyvalent metal ions such as mg2 ca2 fe3 and al3 ions dhillon and kumar 2015 fluoride salts change into hydrogen fluoride or metal salts with standard acid treatment hydrogen fluoride is the conjugate acid of metal fluoride a neutralization reaction forms it hydrogen fluoride is more acidic than anhydrous acetic acid in water the fluoride pkb value is 10 8 hydrogen fluoride can be doubly protonated to give h2f in groundwater fluoride ions exist as free ions because of their lower binding affinity 2 2 hydrochemistry fluoride is the 13th ranked abundant element that is widely distributed in nature fluoride is naturally present in rocks carbonated sedimentary and volcanic layers ali et al 2016 so many minerals contain a huge variety of fluoride such as na2alf6 caf2 sellaite mgf2 topaz biotite etc harrison 2005 among these caf2 is an important commercial mineral that contains roughly 49 fluoride and is found globally sivasankar 2016 plants that absorb soil and water contain fluoride fluoride level in mature tea leaves is 10 20 times greater than in young leaves premathilaka and liyanagedera 2019 the fluoride concentration in water varies depending on the presence of fluoride containing minerals in some developing countries such as kenya bangladesh tanzania and india a high fluoride concentration is present in drinking water wong et al 2003 to decide the quality of the groundwater supply the study of hydrochemistry is significant hydrogeochemical processes responsible for temporary and geospatial changes in groundwater can be evaluated by hydrochemistry many factors affect groundwater chemistry such as irrigation practices movement through the rocks natural and artificial discharge the phrase hydrochemistry was used to study chemical variation and solubility kinetics jha et al 2013 vikas et al 2009 2 3 artificial sources and ideal levels of fluoride various types of human induced activities are the sources of fluoride the major anthropogenic source of groundwater contamination is the use of phosphate fertilizers machender et al 2014 phosphate and superphosphate fertilizers contain an appreciable amount of fluoride released into the soil and water coal factories industrial wastage and fluoride based batteries are great sources of fluoride in water yadav et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 different fluoride complexes are used in electronic glass and dental products fluoride containing water is a rich source of fluoride in human beings water constitutes more than 60 of the human body contaminated water is very harmful to us therefore different standards have been set for drinking water according to the who the fluoride concentration in drinking water should be less than 1 5 mg l at the same time environmental protection energy epa set the fluoride level to be 4 mg l khatri and tyagi 2015 and the department of health and human services dhhs niu et al 2016 limited the concentration to 0 7 ppm on the other hand the bureau of indian standards bis karabulut and atasoy 2019b recommended an optimal concentration of 0 6 1 2 mg l in contrast the indian council of medical research icmr decided the fluoride concentration in drinking water to not exceed more than 1 0 mg l as a safety standard 2 4 influence on health a high concentration of fluoride in water causes many diseases in the human body the main reason for dental fluorosis and skeletal deformities is that the fluoride intake is higher than optimal ameer et al 2018 hydroxyapatite is a major component that makes up the enamel the hydroxide ions of hydroxyapatite get replaced by the fluoride ions to form fluorapatite due to the formation of fluorapatite the teeth become hard and brittle harrison 2005 this is known as dental fluorosis excess intake of high concentrations of fluoride may cause acute to chronic diseases skeletal fluorosis symptoms include pain in joints muscle weakness hardness of joints and fatigue later skeletal fluorosis leads to osteoporosis due to the regular use of high fluoride in drinking water other chronic diseases such as neurological damage rbc deformation depression skin problems and male sterility can emerge fluoride forms kidney stones in the kidney and affects the function of the kidney dhillon et al 2017c 2 5 defluoridation techniques considering above health hazards it is crucial to eliminate extra fluoride from water to bring back its concentration to who recommended limits reardon and wang 2000 a few substitutes methods to attain water defluoridation are water consumption from a safe source developing alternate safe water sources lessening industrial fluoride releasing sources exercising suitable water defluoridation practices and utilization of new generation sorbents for defluoridation when alternative sources are inaccessible defluoridation is the top alternative to defluoridate drinking water these techniques are operated on the principle of ion exchange precipitation coagulation electrodialysis adsorption etc 2 5 1 precipitation techniques precipitation processes involve adding up some chemicals precipitants and creating fluoride precipitates reardon and wang 2000 liming and the associated fluorite precipitation are the conventional fluoride removal methods making water of high purity the precipitation and coagulation procedures with crushed limestone solanki et al 2022 activated alumina kumari et al 2022 alum sludge pillai et al 2021 and calcium wang et al 2019 as adsorbents have been widely investigated for fluoride uptake from water the precipitation method has the advantage that it is an everlasting and competent method and can effortlessly be put into practice for quick outcomes when the initial concentration of fluoride is very large it is generally precipitated as it easily attains the supersaturation level however when fluoride concentration is lower it is hard to precipitate thus it has been challenging to remove fluoride at low levels like 10 20 mg l in drinking water by precipitation method liu et al 2021 however a huge amount of precipitant dosage and alkaline ph of the resultant water makes it ill suited for field application several attempts have been made to remove fluoride by precipitation method in recent past using different types of precipitants nath and dutta 2010 mahapatra et al 2013 dubey et al 2018 2 5 2 membrane techniques while different conventional defluorination methods are employed none of them are user friendly or cost effective technique singh et al 2016 he et al 2017 yen et al 2017 membrane techniques are desired substitutes to supply safe drinking water with no associated problems as in other conventional methods therefore various membrane techniques like nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed and dialysis have been applied effectively for water defluoridation and are discussed in the following sections pan et al 2018 luo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 manohar et al 2017 thakur and mondal 2017 2 5 2 1 reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membrane separation methods based on pressure driving forces such as ro and nf are competent methods for purifying potable water until now the efficiency of these methods is associated with the inherent characteristics of the membranes pan et al 2018 and the finest membrane alternative relies on water quality chosen for treatment and working circumstances jiang et al 2017 many researchers have employed reverse osmosis practice successfully for water purification he et al 2017 as compared to other commercial techniques the ro membranes technique shows high quality water treatment i e defluorination a small quantity of chemicals is required low energy consumption and simultaneous removal of other dissolved species make it a good alternative for water defluorination however due to the requirement of advanced skills and electricity this ro technique cannot be employed in rural areas with no electricity supply tolkou et al 2021 nf membrane which works on the same principle as ro has also been employed to improve water quality the nf works at lower pressure and has somewhat larger pores than ro membranes therefore nf can remove larger size dissolved solids in the nf the pressures required are much lower with less energy requirement and higher permeate flux thus the nf has been a more workable and cost effective defluorination technique as compared to ro tolkou et al 2021 several systematic studies including nf theory have been carried out to remove nitrates monovalent anions and fluoride aliaskari and sch ä fer 2021 zhao et al 2021 tian et al 2021 khan et al 2021 xu et al 2022 although nf has achieved universal acceptance it still has restricted use in water scarce regions due to high quality water rejection 2 5 2 2 dialysis and electrodialysis ed unlike ro and nf which involve holding solutes while water passes from them dialysis involves remediation using a membrane the solute can be enforced through the membrane either by the donnan effect elazhar et al 2009 or by applying an electric field the membrane pores are larger and much less obstructive than nf zhang et al employed an anion exchange anion exchange zirconium graphene hybrid adsorbent for fluoride remediation zhang et al 2019 an electrochemical partition process that involves ions transfer via ion exchange membranes by a direct current dc voltage is known as ed the process services the transport of ionic species through anode and cathode generating a more dilute stream to a concentrate wastewater stream manohar et al 2017 ed is a more advanced and larger scale treatment technology used nowadays this technique works without chemical pre treatment and has been well adapted to environmental requirements donnan membrane technique has the compensation of being free from interference from neutral and anionic species it diminishes perturbation to the equilibrium composition of the sample solution and is comparatively sensitive nolan et al 2003 ed requires negligible feed water pre treatment compared to other membrane techniques due to the higher selectivity and little chemical demand of ed it has been established to be a consistent and competent method for water desalination and fluoride removal however ed has to date not been regularly used in fluoride remediation due to its costly nature thakur and mondal 2017 2 5 3 ion exchange techniques the ion exchange process utilizes ion exchange resins for water treatment this technique softens water and filters the major ionic contaminant fluoride from water fluoride selective purification can be done by employing the calcium form of dowex g 26 4 strong acid cation exchange resin ca2 ions present in the resin form precipitate with fluoride from water additionally strongly basic anion exchange resin having quaternary ammonium functional groups can be used for fluoride removal where equilibrium is established as shown below matrix r3n cl f matrix r3n f cl polymeric materials have various advantages such as easy handling nature high quality water production easy regenerability and speed therefore polymeric ion exchange resins have widely been used for toxic ions removal from water on a small scale some selected cation exchange resins have been found to be more selective than anion exchange resins however the selected resin has lower selectivity and also the presence of high sodium salt content in the raw water interferes with the resin s ability therefore there has always been room for developing polymeric resins for selective sorption of fluoride from water samples kantipuly et al 1990 erdem et al 2004 li et al 2011 2 5 4 adsorption techniques adsorption is defined as the process of removal of a substance formally present in one phase by accumulating it at an interface between that phase and separate solid phase the driving force for adsorption is reducing the interfacial surface tension between the liquid and solid adsorbent because of the adsorption of the adsorbate on the solid surface the conventional adsorption technique is superior for fluoride removal due to cost effectiveness flexibility simplicity of design ease of operation and maintenance the efficiency of the adsorption technique depends upon the nature of adsorbents used in recent past considerable efforts have been directed towards the study of fluoride removal using various types of adsorbents like natural synthetic and biomass materials which include activated alumina al based materials fly ash alum sludge algal bio sorbent chitosan beads red mud synthetic compounds amber lite resin zeolite calcite hydrated cement hydrotalcite and layered double hydroxides clays and soils carbon based materials synthetic hydroxyapatite quick lime dolomite etc chaudhary and prasad 2015 adsorption is controlled by various parameters such as temperature nature of the adsorbate and adsorbent and other pollutants along with the experimental conditions ph concentration of pollutants contact time particle size and temperature chaudhary and prasad 2015 dhillon et al 2015 meenakshi et al 2008 nehra et al 2020 wang and reardon 2001 nava et al 2003 swain et al 2011 shams et al 2010 3 purpose of using core shell adsorbents the selection of the ideal adsorbent for fluoride removal is an arduous task several adsorbents are used due to their large surface area high selectivity and fast adsorption process these adsorbents cannot perform the optimum removal of fluoride so currently core shell adsorbents are popularly used for defluoridation by virtue of their attractive properties 3 1 properties of core shell adsorbents core shell structured adsorbents comprise two different materials the core is the inner part of the adsorbent which is covered by a shell shell is the outer part that protects the core different core shell adsorbents can be formed by transforming the core and shell materials core shell adsorbent shapes can vary from a sphere cylindrical to star and octahedral shape the layering of shell material enhances its function ability selectivity and provides a large surface area core shell structure adsorbents play a significant role in eliminating fluoride from water the separation process follows several mechanisms for removing fluoride in various core shells to create a highly efficient core shell adsorbent one has to dive into a deep understanding of their removal mechanism core shell adsorbents remove fluoride through physisorption and chemisorption as well most of the interactions are ionic exchange and electrostatic chloride and hydroxyl groups have been found the most common ions that participated in the ionic exchange complexation is another common mechanism for fluoride interaction and separation fig 2 the functionalization of core shell adsorbents is the turning point which decides its affinity for the targeted ion thus functionalization of core shell adsorbents is the most important post synthetic process the structure and remarkable properties of core shell ensures effective removal of fluoride brindha et al 2011 core shell adsorbents are broadly used due to their large specific area high porosity high selectivity and low density mondal and sharma 2016 the fluoride molecules are precisely diffused on the surface because of the large surface area core shell nano adsorbents possess comprehensive physical properties such as conductivity dielectric nature and upconversion zu et al 2014 core shell adsorbents have the capability of a high and rapid adsorption process the unique structure of core shell adsorbents supports optimum removal and easy binding process of fluoride ions reusability is also an important characteristic of the core shell adsorbent they can be used many times to remove and recover fluoride kumar et al 2013 han et al 2013 this has been found because of good magnetic properties of the core shell adsorbents that allow the fluoride ions to adhere well the ability to efficiently interact with fluoride ions higher thermal stability and excellent adsorption skill make the core shell adsorbent extraordinary than other adsorbents as a result core shell adsorbent gives the best result in every aspect of fluoride removal 4 fluoride remediation using various types of core shell adsorbents this section of the review is dedicated to using core shell adsorbents for the adsorption of fluoride the advantages and shortcomings of various core shell adsorbents have also been highlighted the mechanisms of adsorption and adsorption efficiency of various adsorbents have also been reviewed and compared the core shell adsorbent can be categorized based on core inner layer and shell outer layer materials arrangement fig 3 here a wide range of core shell adsorbents is discussed in the following sections 4 1 iron oxide metal metal iron oxide has significant magnetic properties both fe3o4 and fe2o3 forms of iron oxide have extensive application in the field of magnetic separation iron oxide nanoparticles respond rapidly to the external magnetic field due to their high magnetic moment their magnetic properties and no risk of agglomeration make them more appealing and reliable the magnetic adsorbent has better stability and high strength against water scouring and provides a higher separation efficiency zhang et al prepared a nanocomposite by coating fe ti bimetallic oxide on the fe3o4 magnetic particle via a coprecipitation method zhang et al 2014 the adsorbent structure was examined by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem and x ray diffraction xrd the xrd peaks indicated that fe ti s coating did not affect the crystal structure of fe3o4 hrtem explained the irregular structure of the coating layer and the diffraction fringes of the fe3o4 composite a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm determined the magnetic properties of the adsorbent increased fe ti oxide coating reduced magnetization which indicated the non magnetic nature of fe ti oxide the magnetization saturation of the adsorbent was 18 4 emu g the adsorption capacity of fe ti bimetallic core shell adsorbent was 57 2 mg g table 1 this adsorption isotherm followed the langmuir isotherm model the fe3o4 fe ti oxide core shell adsorbent had a great adsorption rate so it reached equilibrium in less than 3 min after applying the magnetic field the nanocomposite got separated effectively but to further increase the separation efficiency magnetic capacity augmentation is needed zhang et al 2014 an improved remediation performance was noted by zhang et al by micro sized magnetic adsorbent developed using spray drying and calcination method zhang et al 2016a the ph range and interference of coexisting ions significantly affects an adsorbent s adsorption capacity in this case the adsorbent had a broad range of ph and was highly selective for coexisting ions the ample presence of hydroxyl group on fe3o4 fe ti provide an active site for fluoride making the separation easy and rapid the xrd and xps spectra supported fe o and ti components and fe3o4 and fe ti oxide integration the sem images indicated the nanocomposite s porosity and large surface area 99 2 m2 g the developed magnetic adsorbent took only 2 min to achieve the equilibrium the developed adsorbent presented the maximum adsorption capacity of fe3so4 fe ti core shell nps 41 8 mg g at ph 3 0 table 1 the adsorption followed the quasi second order model and the adsorption isotherm was well fitted with the freundlich model its adsorption process was rapid and easy and achieved completion within 2 min of initiation the regeneration process was extraordinarily high that is 10 cycles an ample number of hydroxyl groups on the adsorbent s surface were available for fluoride ions to adhere on the feso4 fe ti oxide core shell was an extensively reusable adsorbent as its adsorption capacity remained intact zhang et al 2016a zhang and his colleagues examined size dependent adsorption process in a fluidized bed with fe3o4 fe ti adsorbent zhang et al 2017a the core shell fe3o4 fe ti nanosorbent was synthesized effortlessly by dissolving fecl2 4h2o and fecl3 6h2o in ethanol then titrating this solution the purpose behind using fe3o4 fe ti was that layering of fe3o4 on the surface surmounts the impact of driving forces of fluidized beds such as centrifugal force magnetic force gravity etc fe3o4 fe ti adsorbent had a better adsorption rate than the previously reported zhang et al 2016a adsorbent the xrd peaks for fe3o4 were the same in all spectra at different temperatures and the coarse shape of fe3o4 fe ti changed into crystalline form at elevated temperatures fe3o4 fe ti adsorption process followed the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics equation the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 41 8 mg g and it achieved equilibrium within 2 min at ph 9 0 table 1 zhang et al 2017a a comparative study of core shell ce ti fe3o4 and ce ti adsorbent was performed by markeb and others for that the adsorbent was prepared by dissolving and mixing ticl4 and ce no3 6h2o at 25 c ph was elevated to 7 0 by slow addition of 12 5 nh3 the preparation of ce ti fe3o4 nanoparticles nps was done in the laboratory using the coprecipitation method the reusability of ce ti fe3o4 was evaluated at ph 7 0 for 60 min and the ce ti fe3o4 nps were found to be reusable up to five cycles the adsorbents were then evaluated by examining their adsorption process in real water samples that turned out to be under the desired limit i e below 1 5 mg l abo markeb et al 2017 hrtem electron diffraction ed and sem were used for structural characterization the sem analysis predicted the particle size of ce ti oxide and ce ti fe3o4 to be 1 2 nm and 10 15 nm respectively the ed pattern demonstrated the crystalline form of ce ti fe3o4 whereas the non crystalline form for ce ti oxide the adsorption data were fitted into freundlich and langmuir models also ce ti fe3o4 nps presented higher adsorption compared to ce ti oxides table 1 abo markeb et al 2017 electro coextrusion technique was employed by zhang et al to fabricate a novel core shell fe3o4 alginate la particle s adsorbent zhang et al 2016b preparation and separation of core shell fe3o4 alginate la took place via steps like crosslinking ion exchange followed by addition of fe3o4 alla proceeding adsorption magnetic separation and desorption fig 4 a zhang et al 2016b by image analysis of sem the core s size was noticed at 517 341 μm and the width of the shell was 109 893 μm xps spectra showed that the major components in the core were c o la ca and fe whereas c o la and ca existed as the main components in the shell during the development of the adsorbent these bands shifted to 1652 5 cm 1 and 1418 7 cm 1 because of the ion exchange between na and ca2 of particles with la3 of the solution the purpose of taking la3 in the solution was to make possible the ion exchange among lanthanum and fluoride ions before adsorption ftir spectra showed two peaks at 1624 5 cm 1 and 1417 9 cm 1 attributed to co asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations and after adsorption the peak shifted 1653 3 cm 1 and 1419 1 cm 1 for asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of co group which indicated that la3 might have interacted or bonded with fluoride in the solution further the adsorbent s superparamagnetic nature was supported by vsm data with the saturation magnetization of 14 353 emu g the non linear freundlich model well explained fluoride adsorption the pseudo second order kinetic model fitted well in this fluoride elimination process the adsorbent s defluoridation capacity was observed at 45 2 mg g within 15 h at ph 4 0 and 25 c table 1 the hydroxyl groups on the surface of fe3o4 alg la were protonated and positively charged there were electrostatic attractions of the positively charged adsorbent with f during the fluoride removal also on the surface of this adsorbent the hydroxyl groups were exchanged with f while la3 would get exchanged with some hard acid and preferred to bind with a hard base for instance f therefore the adsorption process by fe3o4 alg la might have taken place through electrostatic attraction and lewis acid base interaction fig 4 b zhang et al 2016b 4 2 iron oxide metal oxide in another study riahi et al synthesized fe3o4 nanocomposite with zro2 by coprecipitation riahi et al 2015 the nanocomposite was prepared by adding trace amount of solid zirconium tetrachloride into concentrated perchloric acid hclo4 the solution was made to 1 0 m by making up with water in zirconium solution and 0 23 m in hclo4 the sem and tem confirmed the amorphous spherical structure of fe3o4 zro2 composite particles and their uniform distribution the specific surface area of fe3o4 zro2 was 492 m2 g according to brunauer emmett teller bet method due to the high adsorption capacity 158 6 mg g and substantial saturation magnetization 10 13 emu g fe3o4 zro2 nps with a ratio of 2 5 was preferred for further activity table 1 the adsorptive capacity of fe3o4 zro2 was affected by ph and it was found that the increased ph value decreased the adsorption capacity therefore from the ph studies the ideal value of ph for the adsorption of fluoride was found to be 2 5 as a result 0 50 mg quantity of adsorbent was decided for the optimum elimination of fluoride this adsorption process followed both freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherms it was a potentially regenerable adsorbent as there was no decrease in the sorption capacity up to 8 cycles the surface layer of zro2 possessed special affinity towards fluoride and was found suitable for remediation of bulk volumes of real water samples easy laboratory synthesis was also a factor that made it ideal for practical defluoridation the fluoride adsorption mechanism was easily explained as surface complexation and ligand exchange where the fluoride adsorption was accompanied by the release of hydroxyl ions oh even though the developed fe3o4 zro2 adsorbent presented high adsorption capacity 158 6 mg g table 1 supported by high surface area the effect of contact time significantly affected the adsorbent performance and it was estimated that fe3o4 zro2 adsorbent took about 1 h to attain the equilibrium riahi et al 2015 also an adjustment of the ph of the treated water was required as the adsorption performance was found to be optimum at acidic ph zhao and others developed fe3o4 al oh 3 nanoadsorbent to remove aqueous fluoride zhao et al 2010 the structural properties of adsorbent were characterized using sem micrographs which exhibited the adsorbent s porous surface the sem studies revealed that the size of fe3o4 nps was 10 nm the vsm study displayed the superparamagnetic character of nps the saturation magnetization of fe3o4 al oh 3 was 16 3 emu g the surface area of nanocomposite as estimated by the bet method was 147 m2 g that supported the good adsorption capacity of fe3o4 al oh 3 adsorbent 88 4 mg g at ph 6 5 which required 1 h to reach equilibrium table 1 the adsorption results were well explained by the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics the adsorbent s saturation magnetization was 16 3 emu g which confirmed its easy separation from the solution after fluoride adsorption zhao et al 2010 minju and others synthesized magnesium coated fe3o4 nps for deflurodiation minju et al 2015 the adsorption capacity of mgo coated fe3o4 was 10 9 mg g at ph value 6 0 within 2 5 h and on the adsorbent dose of 2 g l after the contact time of 120 min table 1 the initial concentration of fluoride in water was 98 5 which the adsorbent could have reduced by 98 5 an observable amount of increase in the adsorption capacity was witnessed due to an increase in the adsorption dosage the plausible reason behind this could have been an increase in the number of binding sites available for fluoride to interact the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics were followed by this mgo coated fe3o4 adsorbent minju et al 2015 4 3 metal oxide metal oxide azari et al utilized a simple coprecipitation method to synthesize fe ag oxide nanoadsorbent azari et al 2015 the study of morphology particle size and shape of an adsorbent was analyzed by sem and tem analysis the shape of the adsorbent was spherical and iron oxide formed a circular structure while the silver oxide accumulated as nanoflakes fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis supported the presence of oh group on the adsorbent that played a key role in fluoride adsorption and confirmed the formation of fe o2 ag bonds in fe ag bimetal oxide nanocomposite the molar ratio of synthesized fe ag oxide nano adsorbent was fixed as 3 1 for the maximum adsorption performance at ph 3 0 this adsorbent s adsorption process was well fitted into the langmuir isotherm model and the kinetic behaviour supported pseudo second order kinetics the equilibrium time was 20 min for this adsorption action with the sorbent fixed 0 5 g l at 293 k at acidic ph value fluoride ions sorption increased in contrast the adsorption performance of fluoride ions decreased at basic and neutral ph values in an acidic medium positive ion dominated the adsorbent s surface and attached to fe ag s surface as a result the interaction of negative fluoride ions with the adsorbent surface increased the adsorption performance the adsorbed fluoride ions were replaced by surface hydroxyl groups m oh which played an essential role in fluoride desorption fig 5 a b azari et al 2015 however the study indicated that the adsorbent displayed a low adsorption capability of 22 8 mg g table 1 azari et al 2015 in this regard elahil and others fabricated calcined mg al layered dihydroxide by the coprecipitation process that carried out optimum fluoride adsorption under physiological ph conditions elhalil et al 2016 the pseudo second order kinetic model was followed by fluoride removal adsorbent and the adsorbent reached equilibrium in 6 h the best adsorbent performance was observed at ph 6 8 and the rate of adsorption increased with increased temperature from 10 to 40 c the well defined diffraction peaks of the parent samples were replaced by broad peaks thus indicating a poor long range ordered phase these broad peaks suggested a nanocrystalline material with tiny nanoparticles or even an amorphous phase the dosage of adsorbent was changed from 0 1 to 2 0 g l although the adsorbent performed well at almost physiological ph low adsorption capacity 0 9 mg g of the adsorbent and slow adsorption rate were the major disadvantages table 1 elhalil et al 2016 in this regard tang and zhang developed hierarchical pore structure ce fe bimetallic oxide by coprecipitation which showed a good adsorption rate tang and zhang 2016 the novel ce fe bimetal adsorbent was produced by the precipitation method the procedure of preparation included dissolution of fe no3 9h2o and ce no3 6h2o in 400 ml of deionized water the concentration ratio of ce and fe were 3 1 1 1 and 1 3 mol for preparation of cf 31 10 cf 11 10 and cf 13 10 respectively next step of preparation comprises adjusting of ph to 10 0 by adding 2 mol l naoh aqueous solution dropwise slowly preceded by centrifugation for 30 min these preparations were washed and heated at 70 c for a duration of 8 h thus cf 31 10 cf 11 10 and cf 13 10 ce fe bimetal oxide adsorbents were formed the adsorption result was well derived by the langmuir isotherm model and followed pseudo second order kinetics the maximal capacity of adsorption was observed at 60 9 mg g within 40 min table 1 the bet surface area was witnessed to be 164 9 m2 g the main driving force behind the adsorption here was ion exchange between the fluoride and ce oh group in the ce fe bimetal oxide the highest adsorption rate was between 2 9 and 6 1 ph which depicted the positive flexibility towards the ph tang and zhang 2016 still further improvement in adsorption performance and its rate is required for its field applications for improved adsorbent stability in the reaction medium and better reusability wu et al prepared mg fe composite oxide and alginate adsorbent wu et al 2017 the sem analysis predicted that the size of composite particles varied from 2 22 to 30 54 μam the thermal gravimetric analysis tga curve exhibited that the weight loss increased by increasing the temperature the major weight loss 25 84 was noticed in the range of 221 65 440 62 c the fluoride adsorption depends on ligand exchange and electrostatic interaction the developed adsorbent showed a maximal elimination capacity of 32 31 mg g at ph 6 5 with good mechanical stability and easy separability table 1 the data fitted better into the freundlich isotherm model the reusability of mg fe composite adsorbent was 79 6 after three regeneration cycles thus the adsorbent showed comparatively a bad regeneration capability than other adsorbents in the race the satisfying result of reusability indicated that the prepared adsorbent could be a favourable substance for defluoridation wu et al 2017 as compared to the above mentioned iron oxide adsorbent tio2 sio2 nanocomposite as prepared by zeng et al 2017 via the sol gel method or hydrothermal synthesis method showed improved performance fluoride adsorption ability of the tio2 adsorbents decreased with the increase of the po4 3 concentration whereas increase in concentration of cl ions had no definite effect on the adsorption the sem images revealed that tio2 particles were round and the tio2 sio2 particles were flat and amorphous the bet method calculated specific surface area of the nanocomposite which was 248 m2 g tio2 sio2 nanoadsorbent followed langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 94 3 mg g at ph 1 0 3 0 within 30 min zeng et al 2017 the high adsorption capacity can be attributed to its high surface area however acidic ph is its limiting factor for its wide scale application ca al double layered adsorbent synthesized by sun and others sun et al 2017 ca al was used in the synthesis process variations in the manufacturing conditions had a direct impact on the fluoride uptake from wastewater the sharp peak at 002 004 006 and 110 in xrd spectra indicated the formation of crystalline structure the ftir study analyzed the broadband at 3473 cm 1 of oh group and a weak band existed at 663 cm 1 for fluoride the highest adsorption capacity of ca al adsorbent was 146 6 mg g at ph 12 0 the adsorbent reached equilibrium within 1 h the freundlich isotherm model well elaborated the resulting data of this asorbent sun et al 2017 fu et al prepared a bimetallic al fe oxide for the fast elimination of fluoride fu et al 2020 the ftir spectra showed a band at 568 cm 1 which was assigned to the fe o stretching vibration and a new band at 643 cm 1 was related to the vibration of the fe o al bond the xrd study detected the high purity and lack of mineral impurities in the developed material the sem images displayed the uneven structure of magnetite particles and the particle size was less than 20 μam the maximum adsorption capacity observed was 26 5 mg g within 60 min at the ph range of 3 0 8 0 table 1 the adsorption results are well fitted in langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics the bimetallic al fe oxide was reported as a potential candidate for fluoride elimination due to the higher magnetism low cost easy preparation and recyclability fu et al 2020 the drawback of this adsorbent was the adverse effect of temperature on the adsorption process han and others developed la and ce bimetallic oxide shell han et al 2019 la ions showed high chemical attraction toward fluoride due to the highly electronegative nature of fluoride ions ce provided a large surface area high porosity and functional sites which enhanced the adsorption efficiency of the core shell adsorbent the adsorption capacity of this adsorbent was 60 3 mg g at ph 4 0 table 1 when the ph value of the solution was between 4 0 and 6 0 the surface of fe3o4 la ce became positively charged therefore the electrostatic interaction between fe3o4 la ce and negatively charged fluoride ions existed throughout the adsorption process and the electrostatic force repulsion between fe3o4 la ce was not favourable at a higher ph value between 6 0 and 12 0 so there was both lewis base interaction and ligand exchange mechanism for fluoride adsorption fig 6 a han et al 2019 the saturation magnetization value of fe3o4 la ce adsorbent was 41 5 emu g the saturation magnetization presented the magnetic nature of the adsorbent the higher the value of saturation magnetization the more it exhibits magnetism required for easy separation of fluoride from solution fe3o4 msio2 mldh350 exhibits magnetic separation using surface complexation and anionic exchange mechanism fig 6 b li et al 2020 the freundlich model and redlich peterson model easily expressed the adsorbent result the elovich equation described the adsorption kinetics han et al 2019 biswas et al modified the synthetic hydrous iron chromium bimetal oxide hicmo by the coprecipitation method biswas et al 2010 the tem images illustrated the irregular surface structure and the particle size was 40 55 nm the ftir spectra of hicmo showed bands between 3350 and 3450 cm 1 due to the o h stretching mode of water and hydroxide group after adsorption the bands found between 1635 and 1648 cm 1 were for the o h bending mode of water molecules the fluoride adsorption was raised between 3 0 and 7 0 ph levels the maximum fluoride was adsorbed at ph 3 0 due to high fluoride ions for positive charge and replacement of oh ions with fluoride the maximum adsorption capacity of hicmo was 16 3 mg g within 30 min table 1 the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics fitted very well with the equilibrium data biswas et al 2010 deng and colleagues designed granular mn ce bimetal oxide adsorbent by using the coprecipitation method deng et al 2011 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 131 1 mg g at ph 6 0 table 1 the adsorption process was very fast within the first hour and reached equilibrium after 3 h the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing ph value up to 6 0 langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics can well explain the adsorption data deng et al 2011 chai and others developed a sulfate doped fe3o4 al2o3 nano adsorbent for defluorodiation chai et al 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity of fe3o4 al2o3 nano adsorbent was 70 4 mg g at ph level 7 within 20 min table 1 upon adsorption over a ph range of 4 0 10 0 the initial and final adsorption capacities were 10 ml l and 50 mg l respectively the adsorption efficiency varied from 90 to 70 across the tested ph range of 4 0 10 0 the langmuir adsorption isotherm and elovich model well fitted into the adsorption data result the underlying adsorption mechanism was explained in the formation of inner sphere fluoride complex and anion exchange of sulfate with fluoride for fluoride removal by the sulfate doped fe3o4 al2o3nps chai et al 2013 chen et al synthesized fe ti bimetallic oxide nano adsorbent by the coprecipitation method by conducting ammonium titration at the room temperature chen et al 2012 the particle size of bimetallic oxide predicted by tem was 5 7 nm the xrd peaks confirmed the presence of crystalline feooh and amorphous ti oh 4 the characteristic peak in ftir spectra of fe oxide ti oxide and fe ti oxide was assigned at 587 9 cm 1 615 cm 1 and 571 cm 1 respectively after adsorption the intensity of the peak at 1401 cm 1 and 1125 cm 1 decreased the hydroxyl group got reduced on the adsorbent surface after adsorption the fluoride adsorption capacity was 47 0 mg g at ph 5 0 table 1 the langmuir isotherm easily explained the adsorption result model chen et al 2012 therefore due to the excellent anion exchange performance fe3o4 msio2 mldh nanocomposite was developed as a fluoride adsorbent by li and others li et al 2020 the xrd study demonstrated the peak intensity of fe3o4 which decreased after coating the mgal ldh layer indicating its successful formation a set of peaks at 003 006 009 012 015 018 and 110 indicated the formation of a crystalline mgal ldh shell the sem data confirmed the fe3o4 fe3o4 msio2 and fe3o4 msio2 mldh particle size was 395 nm 469 nm and 503 nm respectively in ftir spectra a band was observed at 1384 cm 1 which indicated the presence of no3 ions in the developed adsorbent the possible fluoride adsorption mechanism on the fe3o4 msio2 mldh composites was proposed which involved i anionic exchange between nitrate and fluoride anions in solution and ii surface complex of anions with the surface metal hydroxyls of a composite in the case of surface complexation fluoride is probably retained by outer sphere complexation the maximum capacity was 28 5 mg g at ph 9 0 within 24 h table 1 the langmuir model was well fitted in the adsorption result li et al 2020 the adsorbent presented good separability due to the magnetite fe3o4 core which allowed an external magnetic field and facilitated their recycling and reusability li et al 2020 4 4 metal metal oxide niu et al prepared a robust and thermally stable alginate fe fe3o4 core shell structured composite niu et al 2012 the adsorbent morphology was studied by tem ftir xps xrd and bet methods the tem analysis explained the irregular shape of nps the ftir spectra of alginate fe fe3o4 showed a peak at 1620 cm 1 due to hydroxyl group and water stretching vibrations and three different peaks at 1089 cm 1 1038 cm 1 and 1169 cm 1 were attributed to the coupling of c c c o and δ c o h vibration the adsorbent removed 90 fluoride within 1 h at ph 3 5 the saturation magnetization was 65 5 emu g niu et al 2012 mukhoupadhyay et al synthesized ce4 incorporated hydrous fe3 oxide cihfo mukhopadhyay et al 2017 the adsorbent was studied through tem sem ftir xrd and bet tem and sem analyses represented the asymmetrical morphology and the size of the nps was 5 nm ftir spectrum showed bands between 3000 cm 1 and 3500 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 denoted as o h bonds stretching and bending vibration after fluoride adsorption the intensity of oh stretching and bending band remarkably decreased and the band at 1400 cm 1 and 750 cm 1 disappeared the bet measured the surface area of cihfo which was found to be 140 711 m2 g in an acidic ph medium the fluoride adsorption capacity on cihfo increased due to electrostatic interaction between negative or positive charged ions on the adsorbent surface the maximum adsorption capacity of the cihfo adsorbent was 24 8 mg g at ph 5 0 7 0 table 1 the adsorption data well fitted in freundlich and redlich peterson isotherm model and kinetic data supported both pseudo first order reaction and pseudo second order kinetics mukhopadhyay et al 2017 4 5 metal oxide ppy however further improvement in the rate of adsorption performance is required for field applications hydrous tio2 polypyrrole nanocomposite was prepared by parashar et al 2016a for the defluoridation process it was synthesized via chemical oxidative polymerization of the pyrrole monomer in the laboratory the aqueous media of pyrrole monomer also contained htio2 nps in it sem and tem revealed the average size of nps to be 4 6 nm and the core shell morphology as a ball like structure of hydrous tio2 polypyrrole due to the stretching vibration of oh groups and h2o ftir spectra showed a broadband range of 3100 3400 cm 1 after adsorption the band of oh group slightly shifted from 3412 cm 1 3416 cm 1 the bet analyser calculated the surface area of synthesized nanocomposite to be 98 17 m2 g the optimum adsorption capability was observed to be 31 9 mg g at ph 6 5 and 25 c with the well fitted langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo second order kinetic theorem table 1 the possible adsorption mechanism of f by hydrous tio2 polypyrrole was found to be a function of ph at acidic ph the protonated hydroxyl group oh2 and protonated amine groups nh of the nps electrostatically interacted with negatively charged f ions there might have been an exchange ion between f ions in the solution and cl ions in polypyrrole chains at neutral ph therefore both electrostatic interaction and ion exchange were involved in fluoride ions adsorption mechanism it showed poor renewability i e only regenerable up to 3 cycles there are two plausible mechanisms for htio2 ppy to adsorb the fluoride ions in acidic ph by the interaction between protonated hydroxyl groups of htio2 nps and via interaction with protonated amine groups by electrostatic interactions fig 7 a parashar et al 2016a parashar and co workers explained the mechanistic pathways followed by their newly developed polypyrrole coated hydrous tin oxide ppy hsno nanocomposite for the rapid removal of fluoride parashar et al 2016b these polypyrrole hydrous tin oxide nanocomposites were prepared using in situ polymerization of fluoride by incorporating hsno by polypyrrole the adsorption data was well fitted into the langmuir isotherm model and followed pseudo second order kinetics the adsorption capacity of ppy hsno was 28 7 mg g at ph 6 5 within 45 min table 1 it showed a remarkable desorption efficiency of 95 81 up to 3 cycles tests were conducted on groundwater samples and they indicated ppy hsno nanocomposite to be a potential adsorbent the exchange between free surface hydroxyl groups and fluoride ions might be because both f and oh ions have comparable ionic radius being isoelectronic species the fluoride adsorption was mainly determined by electrostatic interaction and ion exchange mechanism between the hydroxyl and fluoride ions the possible electrostatic mechanism between f and ppy hsno can be described by two pathways i electrostatic interaction between na ions of ppy and f ions ii electrostatic interaction among hydroxyl groups of hsno and f ions as well as the ion exchange mechanism can be explained by two steps i ion exchange between cl ions and f ions ii ion exchange between hydroxyl groups and negatively charged f ions fig 7 b parashar et al 2016b nagaraj et al synthesized mgo2 ppy nanocomposite as a scavenger of fluoride nagaraj et al 2018 the sem investigated the structure of mgo2 ppy before and after adsorption and before fluoride uptake the adsorbent had a globular form and after adsorption the adsorbent showed a powder like structure the ftir spectra of mgo2 ppy manifested the band at 1142 cm 1 due to the oh bending vibration and a peak appeared for the mg f combination at 2436 cm 1 explaining its prime role in fluoride uptake langmuir model was better fitted than freundlich for the adsorption data although the adsorbent presented good chemical and mechanical stability wide range ph 3 0 11 0 applicability with good adsorption rate 50 min its low adsorption capacity 4 3 mg g needed to be addressed for its wide scale field applicability table 1 nagaraj et al 2018 using in situ polymerization wang and his colleagues fabricated fe3o4 ppy core shell nanocomposite for selective fluoride removal from water wang et al 2017b for the adsorption process of fluoride from water the fabricated fe3o4 ppy nanocomposites were placed in the electromagnetic device after fluoride separation the nanocomposite was collected from treated water using a magnet fig 8 wang et al 2017b the adsorption results fitted well with the freundlich isotherm model and kinetics data showed a pseudo second order model although the adsorbent can be easily separated and reused its low removal capacity 15 0 mg g table 1 limited its large scale applications wang et al 2017b aigbe et al synthesized polypyrrole magnetic nanocomposite by using in situ polymerization method aigbe and onyancha 2020 in the xrd pattern a peak was obtained for ppy at 24 64 and the particle size of composite estimated was 19 nm tem and sem micro images showed a core shell structure of nanocomposite with spherical shape and even structured the bet surface area of the ppy magnetic composite was 28 77 m2 g the varying rotating magnetic field stimulated the adsorption of fluoride the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 22 0 mg g at ph 6 0 within 10 min the freundlich isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics defined the adsorption process aigbe and onyancha 2020 chen and others synthesized a highly efficient ppy tio2 adsorbent by the in situ chemical method chen et al 2017 the ftir spectrum of ppy tio2 obtained peaks for pyrrole ring and tio2 after the adsorption all peaks of ppy were blue shifted due to π electron delocalization the electrostatic interaction and positively charged nitrogen atoms of ppy were responsible for better adsorption the peak of c n shifted from 1473 to 1482 cm 1 and the peak appeared at 1043 cm 1 which indicated c h in plane bending vibration which disappeared after adsorption the xrd peaks confirmed the presence of tio2 with the characteristic peaks at 25 3 37 8 and 48 1 the mechanism behind the adsorption of fluoride by adsorbent was the presence of hydroxyl and positively charged nitrogen atoms the adsorption process was found to be exothermic and spontaneous commenting upon the regeneration capacity it was excellent even after six cycles there was still high affinity in the ppy tio2 nano adsorbent for fluoride which indicated that it could be easily recycled without losing adsorption capacity regeneration capacity is the highlighting feature of this adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacity of the ppy tio2 nanoadsorbent was 33 1 mg g within 30 min at ph 7 0 this ppy tio2 adsorbent can be used six times without losing its adsorption capacity for fluoride removal the adsorption data are well fitted into langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics chen et al 2017 5 miscellaneous adsorbents among the conventional defluoridation methods adsorption is considered the most effective therefore chaudhary and his co workers synthesized iron oxyhydroxide from natural clay chaudhary et al 2016 to prepare iron hydroxide nps natural clay was filtered with acid to achieve iron precursors which constituted ferrous and ferric ions to synthesize iron oxyhydroxide nps sem and tem demonstrated the size of the nps 6 20 nm and endorsed the aggregation of nps the bet surface area of synthesized iron oxyhydroxide was 312 m2 g the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was noticed at 111 1 mg g within 45 min at ph 7 5 having adsorbent quantity varying from 0 2 to 1 5 g l with a well fitted freundlich isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics reaction according to the results of adsorption experiments the authors elucidated that the apt pore size and good surface area 312 m2 g are key for good fluoride removal performance 111 1 mg g from water chaudhary et al 2016 even though core shell fe3o4 alginate la came out as the state of the art sorbent for fluoride sorption one limiting factor is that optimal fluoride sorption chiefly occurred at acidic conditions largely below ph 6 0 with a narrow ph range which restricts its practical application consequently there is a demand for improved methods that involve fluoride ions remediation at almost neutral ph zhu and others prepared a high mechanical stable pectin al2o3 zro2 core shell adsorbent zhu et al 2016 sem analysis predicted beads particle size to be 2 5 1 0 and the powder form of al2o3 zro2 well wrapped over the beads after sorption the authors found out that the adsorbent s shape or surface did not change as much which indicated the high mechanical stability of the pectin al2o3 zro2 core shell xps peaks derived an appearance of ca al 74 71 ev zr 182 49 ev after adsorption a peak of f occurred at 685 01 ev and al s and zr s peak shifted from 74 71 ev to 182 49 ev 75 01 ev and 182 6 ev the adsorption results are well fixed in the freundlich isotherm adsorption process supporting multi layered non uniform heterogeneous adsorption surface sites the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo second order model the higher adsorption capacity of 98 0 mg g occurred within 8 h contact time at 4 0 ph bringing the concentration down to 0 5 mg l which is within the who permissible levels i e below 1 5 mg l the pectin al2o3 zro2 core shell adsorbent was produced by a coaxial electrostatic spinning device and was utilized to treat wastewater for defluoridation zhu et al 2016 however further studies are required to make it function over a wide ph range with a quick absorption rate the effect of ethanol on the shape of novel iron oxide adsorbent fabricated by wet chemical method was studied by zhang et al and was further used for defluorodiation zhang et al 2017b the sem and tem images showed that the structure of ethanol treated iron oxide was flake like while before ethanol treatment the iron oxide was needle like structure it might be due to ethanol s adsorption and the adsorbent produced high surface area and porosity the xrd spectra derived that the adsorbent has a crystalline structure and after the ethanol treatment structure became indefinite without ethanol the adsorption results followed the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics the ethanol treated adsorbent showed a good adsorption performance of 60 8 mg g table 1 which could be attributed to the adsorbent s high surface area 150 4 m2 g and porosity the adsorbent attained equilibrium within 2 min at ph range 3 5 10 3 zhang et al 2017b therefore this adsorbent can be a good fluoride removal candidate but only after improving its remediation performance the adsorption capacity of various tio2 based nanocomposites fe3o4 tio2 sio2 tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 tio2 prepared by liang et al using the sol gel method was compared the sem analysis revealed the size of sio2 tio2 fe3o4 tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 tio2 was found to be 40 60 μam 0 2 0 5 μam and 0 5 1 μam respectively among the three adsorbents sio2 tio2 was the most efficient adsorbent the bet method determined the surface area of sio2 tio2 fe3o4 tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 tio2 to be 249 31 m2 g 17 442 m2 g and 22 541 m2 g sio2 tio2 fe3o4 tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 tio2 adsorbents adsorption capacities were 152 2 mg g 22 9 mg g and 22 4 mg g respectively therefore the high surface area of the sio2 tio2 adsorbent supported its highest adsorption performance the adsorption process reached equilibrium within 30 min langmuir and freundlich both models well explained the data of the adsorption process liang et al 2017 wang et al fabricated mg al zr tri metal oxide by the coprecipitation method wang et al 2017c the adsorbent result data was well fitted into langmuir and freundlich model the kinetics followed by the adsorption process were a pseudo second order equation and the adsorption attained equilibrium in 6 h the adsorption capacity was 22 9 mg g ph 7 0 the exchange between the hydroxyl group and fluoride or ion exchange contributed significantly to fluoride removal in the adsorption mechanism wang et al 2017c cerium oxide is the least soluble amongst rare metal oxides therefore it could be a good alternative in modified materials for fluoride remediation zhu and co workers prepared cerium immobilized crosslinked chitosan composite zhu et al 2017 the chemical and mechanical stability of the developed adsorbent were improved after chitosan crosslinking and were beneficial to the application the ftir spectra signified main bands at 3420 cm 1 for oh and nh2 stretching vibrations 2926 cm 1 ch vibration and 1598 cm 1 for oh or nh2 bending stretching ce chitosan s spectrum showed a band at 3391 cm 1 shifted to 29 cm 1 which confirmed ce s interaction with the chitosan amino or hydroxyl group the strong peak at 1387 cm 1 revealed that ce s presence impacts the ch group and the no3 stretching band occurred after fluoride adsorption the peak intensity decreased which advised that fluoride ions replaced the ce no3 groups due to the chelation exchange mechanism the bet specific surface area of chitosan composite was 16 6 m2 g the ce chitosan composite s maximal adsorption capability was 153 0 mg g where the ph value was three and the adsorption process achieved equilibrium in 4 h the adsorption data was well defined by the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics the ligand exchange and complexation played a crucial role in the adsorption mechanism of fluoride ions by cerium chitosan composite the process involved three different paths i the electrostatic attraction between ce3 4 and nh3 with f ions ii the ligand exchange among f and no3 iii the generation of ce f chitosan composite fig 9 a zhu et al 2017 ayinde et al prepared layered ag mgo hydroxyapatite composite ayinde et al 2018 the uv visible spectrum indicated the formation of agnps agnps showed a characteristic absorption band maximum of 440 nm due to oh stretching vibration the ftir spectra showed a peak at 3290 cm 1 the sem and tem images revealed the amorphous flake shape of the composite and the particle size was 14 84 nm the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir isotherm model the adsorption capacity was observed at 2 1 mg g at ph 6 0 within 1 h showing that the adsorbent suffered major drawbacks of low adsorbent capacity and slow adsorption rate ayinde et al 2018 huang et al customized a special core shell alooh boehmite adsorbent huang et al 2020 the adsorbent presented an excellent adsorption capacity of 1070 6 mg g at ph 2 0 the abundant hydroxyl group on the adsorbent surface was the ultimate reason for the boehmite adsorbent s higher adsorption efficiency the authors found an acidic solution as more favourable for the adsorption of fluoride mainly because of the conversion of hf pyrazine and hf2 the bifluoride ion with a strong hydrogen bond effect from fluoride fig 9 b huang et al 2020 in an acidic medium there was a strong bonding between fluoride and al o h adsorption sites langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics well explained the result of adsorption the equilibrium of fluoride adsorption reached 10 h representing a slow adsorption process therefore the low adsorption rate and acidic ph need to be addressed before launching it in real world applications to bring the fluoride concentration within who permissible limits this research laid an important foundation regarding the structural design of the adsorbent yaghini and faghihian modified an adsorbent by impregnating a magnetized carbon core shell with lanthanum for the fluoride uptake from water the highest adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 20 7 mg g at ph 5 0 the adsorption results were well fitted into a second order reaction the saturation magnetization of this adsorbent was 60 emu g for fast and easy elimination of fluoride sufficient magnetism was needed and the higher magnetism of the adsorbent enables the strong attachment of fluoride ions to the adsorbent surface the sufficient magnetism both ph and contact time variable significantly influenced fluoride adsorption ph and time had the most and the least impact on fluoride adsorption respectively the adsorbent was investigated for its regeneration capacity and was found to be moderately regenerable on three regeneration cycles 73 of its adsorption capacity remained intact a change in the concentration of oh ions reduced the adsorption of fluoride while a rise in the cl thus we found that the adsorption properties of all core shell adsorbents are different despite such difficulties and challenges in this field core shell materials are beneficial for removing fluoride ions from wastewater concerted research in this field can make the practical use of core shell for water treatment a reality soon 6 future perspectives a detailed and systematic study of core shell adsorbents is necessary to examine the interconnection with fluoride of course fluoride removal by core shell adsorbent has been done very widely despite such a fast growth curve of the utilization of core shells for water treatment they are limited to the laboratory only in a nutshell their utility is limited industrialists and material scientists should collaborate and give access to each other in their fields to learn and bring the core shell adsorbents into practical routine usage despite the pros of core shell highly advanced systems are needed at a low cost future with less waste maximum use of available waste and minimal process wastage to continue defluoridation therefore the core shell adsorbent still has some drawbacks that can be improved like the need of the hour is an eco friendly core shell adsorbent that does not harm the environment as there is no risk of releasing harmful substances and exhausts from the core shell it would contribute to sustainable development so more research is needed in this direction although the core shell adsorbent has become the most reliable adsorbent it still needs much work to be done on the effect of coexisting ions on performing the core shell adsorbent in designing future core shell adsorbents surface modification is also worth considering for superior adsorption capacity on account of being less reactive and attaining a higher coordination number by reacting with hydroxide ions modifying core shell with inert metal can surmount the limitation of core shell adsorbent the bond strength between metal and ligand is also a major thing to discriminate while assembling a core shell adsorbent because the chemical stability of the adsorbent facilitates core shell competence metal size control and choice of correct nano adsorbent to incorporate the core shells within the biological matrix impacts the adsorption process to a great extent nanoparticle loading is equally important for the application as a core shell structured adsorbent broad ph range a higher number of hydroxyl ions and maximum active sites of the adsorbent are other relevant factors for improving the performance of the adsorption phenomenon the biological matrix durability can be enhanced by harmonizing the core shell with the inorganic materials more research is required to make core shell adsorbents precisely sustainable and increase their lifespan an inexpensive and eco friendly core shell adsorbent can be a better candidate to eliminate fluoride 7 conclusion this review has critically analyzed the use of core shell based nanosorbents for water decontamination and reuse core shell s high potential for water purification is supplied by their striking properties as high adsorption capacity magnetic properties reusability and precise target molecule recognition harmonizing them with other nanomaterials elevates their adsorption capacity and makes them even more than the precursors chemists and materials scientists should conspire together and triumph over the shortcomings faced in making core shell the excellent adsorbent for fluoride removal and handling technical aspects and other hindrances its good mechanical strength and negligible coexisting anions effect are attractive features as an excellent fluoride adsorbent the substantial interaction amidst contaminant ions fluoride and the core shells incorporated provides their effective elimination based on this review the undermentioned statements could be made due to the process suitability adsorption is acknowledged as one of the best methods among several reported techniques for the removal process however when fluoride removal is a major concern for us the low adsorption efficiency of conventional adsorbents is disappointing therefore the core shell adsorbent emerged for such a contaminant s adsorption from water due to its large surface area high porosity adjustable and docile structural properties apart from all these properties the core shell adsorbent faces challenges such as stability under various conditions large scale production and a cost effective synthesis route to recover the adsorbent and enhance the process s economic feasibility regeneration studies are also required to be performed to a great extent apart from this the low cost core shell adsorbent is one of the major requirements for industrial uses keeping this in mind the present review would help sort out the current defluoridation issues in the most appropriate way notwithstanding the existing problems and challenges in this field we believe that core shell structured adsorbents are very simple convenient cost effective and environmentally sustainable for water purification future studies should extend their applications to a large scale to benefit a large population declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

11787,the world today is facing a water crisis water and sanitation are central to sustainable development and critical for the survival of people and the planet among various other water contaminants it has recognized fluoride contamination as a primary concern worldwide posing a serious risk to human health and affecting potable water security core shell adsorbents are appropriate substitutes for existing water defluoridation materials and have shown excellent efficiency due to their high adsorption capacity easy separability reusability excellent magnetic properties also recent progress in employing core shell based materials has opened up many avenues for water defluoridation technologies although a few studies have already covered the use of core shell as adsorbents in the remediation of various contaminants their sole adsorptive applications regarding fluoride remediation have not been thoroughly explored yet therefore for the first time we try to cover the extensive applications of core shell adsorbents in the field of fluoride elimination from water over the last ten years this work gives an insight into how core shell adsorbents are superior to conventional and non conventional methods of defluoridation also special attention is paid to the current developments and challenges of various novel core shell adsorbents because of their significant mechanism of action lastly emerging technologies and challenges faced in this area of research are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords adsorbents core shell fluoride nanomaterials removal 1 introduction 1 1 water contamination water is an indispensable component of all living organisms on earth water plays a very crucial role in our body system 60 75 of our body weight comprises water its versatile nature helps to carry out various chemical reactions while the molecular form of water maintains the shape of cells in recent times fluoride has attracted much attention as a natural element fluoride is exposed to humans mainly through food and drinking water fluoride contamination in water is a general concern in developing nations such as kenya bangladesh africa mexico india etc biswas et al 2017 the prime sources of fluoride contamination are coal factories yadav et al 2019 fertilizer manufacturing companies kabir et al 2020 and fluoride based batteries kimambo et al 2019 fluoride in low concentrations is beneficial atasoy et al 2016 however excess of fluoride is noxious for the biosphere and gives rise to chronic and acute diseases such as skeletal fluorosis dental fluorosis dhillon et al 2016 and many others according to world health organization who more than 1 5 mg l concentration of fluoride will be noxious to the human body karabulut and atasoy 2019a it can damage our nervous system valdez jim é nez et al 2011 reproductive system hao et al 2010 endocrine glands garc í a montalvo et al 2009 liver and kidney chattopadhyay et al 2011 the direct need for clean drinking water requires eliminating the excess fluoride and for this various techniques have been developed bhaumik et al 2011 such as adsorption dhillon et al 2018 wang et al 2017a precipitation dhillon et al 2017a ion exchange mulyati et al 2013 membrane separation electrocoagulation karabulut and atasoy 2019b reverse osmosis dhillon and kumar 2018 and many more these techniques have merits and demerits for instance the generation of undesired precipitate is the main disadvantage of the precipitation process similarly ion exchange technique is very costly and the interference of other ions is also a disadvantage the membrane process needs high maintenance and membrane degradation is a problem the coagulation method on the other hand consumes high electricity yazici karabulut et al 2019 amidst these adsorption has been found a promising method for the uptake of fluoride in every aspect due to its low cost ease of handling and fast speed dhillon et al 2017b atasoy and yesilnacar 2017 out of the various required properties adsorbent s surface area plays a vital part in the efficient adsorption various adsorbents are widely used for water defluoridation including activated alumina activated carbon zeolite clay silica gel atasoy and ö zdemir ş ahin 2014 hydroxyapatite chitosan beads etc nano adsorbents gained attention in the adsorption process due to their desirable properties such as large surface area high specification high reactivity self assembly atasoy and ö zdemir ş ahin 2014 structural diversity etc although nano sized adsorbents have many advantages separating nano sized adsorbents from solutions causes difficulties tatarchuk et al 2020 magnetic adsorbents are recognized as a better option to overcome these problems they make it possible to segregate the spent sorbent from the solution upon applying a magnetic field magnetic adsorbents can be used directly or as core shell structured sorbents atasoy et al 2013 as a result core shell adsorbents have been extensively studied in recent years and are widely used in water defluoridation and as chemical sensors the core shell structure offers a versatile strategy for water remediation the core shell structure comprises two or more materials and can be modified based on requirements depending on the core and the shell s characteristics the combined functionality of the core shell structure allows an extensive scope of applications in core shell structured composites magnetic adsorbents are protected by another material fig 1 a niu et al 2016 this is done to enhance stability functionality and uniform distribution ahmad et al 2016 core shell structured nano adsorbents are reliable due to their high adsorption capacity large surface area fast mass exchange and easy elution activity ghosh chaudhuri and paria 2012 they provide huge pore sizes for the uptake of fluoride the fluoride adsorption process on core shell adsorbent depends on the adsorbate adsorbent and adsorbate water interactions reusability is a unique feature of core shell structured absorbents compared to the cores that had not been modified the modified ones were observed to have a greater specific surface area less surface energy better stability and high polarity by changing the material of either core or shell we can adjust the core shell adsorbents properties the materials for the core are chosen and altered for a better fixation with the shell the shell must have a suitable thickness to withstand enough recognition sites for this very purpose various types of core shell fusion such as organic inorganic organic organic inorganic organic inorganic inorganic can be synthesized by coprecipitation grafting and sol gel method fig 1 b niu et al 2016 this work illustrates a core shell adsorbent s diverse properties and adsorption function for fluoride removal this review also scrutinizes the effect of ph kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities and mechanical stability therefore the present work provides valuable information about core shell structured adsorbents importance in removing fluoride 2 fluoride in water 2 1 chemistry of fluoride fluorine is not found naturally so it exists in an ionic state or compound forms such as fluoride ion fluorapatite fluorspar and cryolite fluoride is the 13th most abundant element on our planet s surface niu et al 2016 the main root of fluoride is fluorite also known as fluorspar caf2 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and cryolite na3alf6 are also good sources of fluoride it acts as a lewis weak base and is soluble in water due to its small radius and high charge to mass ratio fluoride ions are strongly solvated in protic solvents in an aprotic solvent fluoride ions are not solvated and are known as naked fluoride various types of fluoride salts are used in many industrial areas fluoride ion forms many solvable complexes with polyvalent metal ions such as mg2 ca2 fe3 and al3 ions dhillon and kumar 2015 fluoride salts change into hydrogen fluoride or metal salts with standard acid treatment hydrogen fluoride is the conjugate acid of metal fluoride a neutralization reaction forms it hydrogen fluoride is more acidic than anhydrous acetic acid in water the fluoride pkb value is 10 8 hydrogen fluoride can be doubly protonated to give h2f in groundwater fluoride ions exist as free ions because of their lower binding affinity 2 2 hydrochemistry fluoride is the 13th ranked abundant element that is widely distributed in nature fluoride is naturally present in rocks carbonated sedimentary and volcanic layers ali et al 2016 so many minerals contain a huge variety of fluoride such as na2alf6 caf2 sellaite mgf2 topaz biotite etc harrison 2005 among these caf2 is an important commercial mineral that contains roughly 49 fluoride and is found globally sivasankar 2016 plants that absorb soil and water contain fluoride fluoride level in mature tea leaves is 10 20 times greater than in young leaves premathilaka and liyanagedera 2019 the fluoride concentration in water varies depending on the presence of fluoride containing minerals in some developing countries such as kenya bangladesh tanzania and india a high fluoride concentration is present in drinking water wong et al 2003 to decide the quality of the groundwater supply the study of hydrochemistry is significant hydrogeochemical processes responsible for temporary and geospatial changes in groundwater can be evaluated by hydrochemistry many factors affect groundwater chemistry such as irrigation practices movement through the rocks natural and artificial discharge the phrase hydrochemistry was used to study chemical variation and solubility kinetics jha et al 2013 vikas et al 2009 2 3 artificial sources and ideal levels of fluoride various types of human induced activities are the sources of fluoride the major anthropogenic source of groundwater contamination is the use of phosphate fertilizers machender et al 2014 phosphate and superphosphate fertilizers contain an appreciable amount of fluoride released into the soil and water coal factories industrial wastage and fluoride based batteries are great sources of fluoride in water yadav et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 different fluoride complexes are used in electronic glass and dental products fluoride containing water is a rich source of fluoride in human beings water constitutes more than 60 of the human body contaminated water is very harmful to us therefore different standards have been set for drinking water according to the who the fluoride concentration in drinking water should be less than 1 5 mg l at the same time environmental protection energy epa set the fluoride level to be 4 mg l khatri and tyagi 2015 and the department of health and human services dhhs niu et al 2016 limited the concentration to 0 7 ppm on the other hand the bureau of indian standards bis karabulut and atasoy 2019b recommended an optimal concentration of 0 6 1 2 mg l in contrast the indian council of medical research icmr decided the fluoride concentration in drinking water to not exceed more than 1 0 mg l as a safety standard 2 4 influence on health a high concentration of fluoride in water causes many diseases in the human body the main reason for dental fluorosis and skeletal deformities is that the fluoride intake is higher than optimal ameer et al 2018 hydroxyapatite is a major component that makes up the enamel the hydroxide ions of hydroxyapatite get replaced by the fluoride ions to form fluorapatite due to the formation of fluorapatite the teeth become hard and brittle harrison 2005 this is known as dental fluorosis excess intake of high concentrations of fluoride may cause acute to chronic diseases skeletal fluorosis symptoms include pain in joints muscle weakness hardness of joints and fatigue later skeletal fluorosis leads to osteoporosis due to the regular use of high fluoride in drinking water other chronic diseases such as neurological damage rbc deformation depression skin problems and male sterility can emerge fluoride forms kidney stones in the kidney and affects the function of the kidney dhillon et al 2017c 2 5 defluoridation techniques considering above health hazards it is crucial to eliminate extra fluoride from water to bring back its concentration to who recommended limits reardon and wang 2000 a few substitutes methods to attain water defluoridation are water consumption from a safe source developing alternate safe water sources lessening industrial fluoride releasing sources exercising suitable water defluoridation practices and utilization of new generation sorbents for defluoridation when alternative sources are inaccessible defluoridation is the top alternative to defluoridate drinking water these techniques are operated on the principle of ion exchange precipitation coagulation electrodialysis adsorption etc 2 5 1 precipitation techniques precipitation processes involve adding up some chemicals precipitants and creating fluoride precipitates reardon and wang 2000 liming and the associated fluorite precipitation are the conventional fluoride removal methods making water of high purity the precipitation and coagulation procedures with crushed limestone solanki et al 2022 activated alumina kumari et al 2022 alum sludge pillai et al 2021 and calcium wang et al 2019 as adsorbents have been widely investigated for fluoride uptake from water the precipitation method has the advantage that it is an everlasting and competent method and can effortlessly be put into practice for quick outcomes when the initial concentration of fluoride is very large it is generally precipitated as it easily attains the supersaturation level however when fluoride concentration is lower it is hard to precipitate thus it has been challenging to remove fluoride at low levels like 10 20 mg l in drinking water by precipitation method liu et al 2021 however a huge amount of precipitant dosage and alkaline ph of the resultant water makes it ill suited for field application several attempts have been made to remove fluoride by precipitation method in recent past using different types of precipitants nath and dutta 2010 mahapatra et al 2013 dubey et al 2018 2 5 2 membrane techniques while different conventional defluorination methods are employed none of them are user friendly or cost effective technique singh et al 2016 he et al 2017 yen et al 2017 membrane techniques are desired substitutes to supply safe drinking water with no associated problems as in other conventional methods therefore various membrane techniques like nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed and dialysis have been applied effectively for water defluoridation and are discussed in the following sections pan et al 2018 luo et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 manohar et al 2017 thakur and mondal 2017 2 5 2 1 reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membrane separation methods based on pressure driving forces such as ro and nf are competent methods for purifying potable water until now the efficiency of these methods is associated with the inherent characteristics of the membranes pan et al 2018 and the finest membrane alternative relies on water quality chosen for treatment and working circumstances jiang et al 2017 many researchers have employed reverse osmosis practice successfully for water purification he et al 2017 as compared to other commercial techniques the ro membranes technique shows high quality water treatment i e defluorination a small quantity of chemicals is required low energy consumption and simultaneous removal of other dissolved species make it a good alternative for water defluorination however due to the requirement of advanced skills and electricity this ro technique cannot be employed in rural areas with no electricity supply tolkou et al 2021 nf membrane which works on the same principle as ro has also been employed to improve water quality the nf works at lower pressure and has somewhat larger pores than ro membranes therefore nf can remove larger size dissolved solids in the nf the pressures required are much lower with less energy requirement and higher permeate flux thus the nf has been a more workable and cost effective defluorination technique as compared to ro tolkou et al 2021 several systematic studies including nf theory have been carried out to remove nitrates monovalent anions and fluoride aliaskari and sch ä fer 2021 zhao et al 2021 tian et al 2021 khan et al 2021 xu et al 2022 although nf has achieved universal acceptance it still has restricted use in water scarce regions due to high quality water rejection 2 5 2 2 dialysis and electrodialysis ed unlike ro and nf which involve holding solutes while water passes from them dialysis involves remediation using a membrane the solute can be enforced through the membrane either by the donnan effect elazhar et al 2009 or by applying an electric field the membrane pores are larger and much less obstructive than nf zhang et al employed an anion exchange anion exchange zirconium graphene hybrid adsorbent for fluoride remediation zhang et al 2019 an electrochemical partition process that involves ions transfer via ion exchange membranes by a direct current dc voltage is known as ed the process services the transport of ionic species through anode and cathode generating a more dilute stream to a concentrate wastewater stream manohar et al 2017 ed is a more advanced and larger scale treatment technology used nowadays this technique works without chemical pre treatment and has been well adapted to environmental requirements donnan membrane technique has the compensation of being free from interference from neutral and anionic species it diminishes perturbation to the equilibrium composition of the sample solution and is comparatively sensitive nolan et al 2003 ed requires negligible feed water pre treatment compared to other membrane techniques due to the higher selectivity and little chemical demand of ed it has been established to be a consistent and competent method for water desalination and fluoride removal however ed has to date not been regularly used in fluoride remediation due to its costly nature thakur and mondal 2017 2 5 3 ion exchange techniques the ion exchange process utilizes ion exchange resins for water treatment this technique softens water and filters the major ionic contaminant fluoride from water fluoride selective purification can be done by employing the calcium form of dowex g 26 4 strong acid cation exchange resin ca2 ions present in the resin form precipitate with fluoride from water additionally strongly basic anion exchange resin having quaternary ammonium functional groups can be used for fluoride removal where equilibrium is established as shown below matrix r3n cl f matrix r3n f cl polymeric materials have various advantages such as easy handling nature high quality water production easy regenerability and speed therefore polymeric ion exchange resins have widely been used for toxic ions removal from water on a small scale some selected cation exchange resins have been found to be more selective than anion exchange resins however the selected resin has lower selectivity and also the presence of high sodium salt content in the raw water interferes with the resin s ability therefore there has always been room for developing polymeric resins for selective sorption of fluoride from water samples kantipuly et al 1990 erdem et al 2004 li et al 2011 2 5 4 adsorption techniques adsorption is defined as the process of removal of a substance formally present in one phase by accumulating it at an interface between that phase and separate solid phase the driving force for adsorption is reducing the interfacial surface tension between the liquid and solid adsorbent because of the adsorption of the adsorbate on the solid surface the conventional adsorption technique is superior for fluoride removal due to cost effectiveness flexibility simplicity of design ease of operation and maintenance the efficiency of the adsorption technique depends upon the nature of adsorbents used in recent past considerable efforts have been directed towards the study of fluoride removal using various types of adsorbents like natural synthetic and biomass materials which include activated alumina al based materials fly ash alum sludge algal bio sorbent chitosan beads red mud synthetic compounds amber lite resin zeolite calcite hydrated cement hydrotalcite and layered double hydroxides clays and soils carbon based materials synthetic hydroxyapatite quick lime dolomite etc chaudhary and prasad 2015 adsorption is controlled by various parameters such as temperature nature of the adsorbate and adsorbent and other pollutants along with the experimental conditions ph concentration of pollutants contact time particle size and temperature chaudhary and prasad 2015 dhillon et al 2015 meenakshi et al 2008 nehra et al 2020 wang and reardon 2001 nava et al 2003 swain et al 2011 shams et al 2010 3 purpose of using core shell adsorbents the selection of the ideal adsorbent for fluoride removal is an arduous task several adsorbents are used due to their large surface area high selectivity and fast adsorption process these adsorbents cannot perform the optimum removal of fluoride so currently core shell adsorbents are popularly used for defluoridation by virtue of their attractive properties 3 1 properties of core shell adsorbents core shell structured adsorbents comprise two different materials the core is the inner part of the adsorbent which is covered by a shell shell is the outer part that protects the core different core shell adsorbents can be formed by transforming the core and shell materials core shell adsorbent shapes can vary from a sphere cylindrical to star and octahedral shape the layering of shell material enhances its function ability selectivity and provides a large surface area core shell structure adsorbents play a significant role in eliminating fluoride from water the separation process follows several mechanisms for removing fluoride in various core shells to create a highly efficient core shell adsorbent one has to dive into a deep understanding of their removal mechanism core shell adsorbents remove fluoride through physisorption and chemisorption as well most of the interactions are ionic exchange and electrostatic chloride and hydroxyl groups have been found the most common ions that participated in the ionic exchange complexation is another common mechanism for fluoride interaction and separation fig 2 the functionalization of core shell adsorbents is the turning point which decides its affinity for the targeted ion thus functionalization of core shell adsorbents is the most important post synthetic process the structure and remarkable properties of core shell ensures effective removal of fluoride brindha et al 2011 core shell adsorbents are broadly used due to their large specific area high porosity high selectivity and low density mondal and sharma 2016 the fluoride molecules are precisely diffused on the surface because of the large surface area core shell nano adsorbents possess comprehensive physical properties such as conductivity dielectric nature and upconversion zu et al 2014 core shell adsorbents have the capability of a high and rapid adsorption process the unique structure of core shell adsorbents supports optimum removal and easy binding process of fluoride ions reusability is also an important characteristic of the core shell adsorbent they can be used many times to remove and recover fluoride kumar et al 2013 han et al 2013 this has been found because of good magnetic properties of the core shell adsorbents that allow the fluoride ions to adhere well the ability to efficiently interact with fluoride ions higher thermal stability and excellent adsorption skill make the core shell adsorbent extraordinary than other adsorbents as a result core shell adsorbent gives the best result in every aspect of fluoride removal 4 fluoride remediation using various types of core shell adsorbents this section of the review is dedicated to using core shell adsorbents for the adsorption of fluoride the advantages and shortcomings of various core shell adsorbents have also been highlighted the mechanisms of adsorption and adsorption efficiency of various adsorbents have also been reviewed and compared the core shell adsorbent can be categorized based on core inner layer and shell outer layer materials arrangement fig 3 here a wide range of core shell adsorbents is discussed in the following sections 4 1 iron oxide metal metal iron oxide has significant magnetic properties both fe3o4 and fe2o3 forms of iron oxide have extensive application in the field of magnetic separation iron oxide nanoparticles respond rapidly to the external magnetic field due to their high magnetic moment their magnetic properties and no risk of agglomeration make them more appealing and reliable the magnetic adsorbent has better stability and high strength against water scouring and provides a higher separation efficiency zhang et al prepared a nanocomposite by coating fe ti bimetallic oxide on the fe3o4 magnetic particle via a coprecipitation method zhang et al 2014 the adsorbent structure was examined by high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem and x ray diffraction xrd the xrd peaks indicated that fe ti s coating did not affect the crystal structure of fe3o4 hrtem explained the irregular structure of the coating layer and the diffraction fringes of the fe3o4 composite a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm determined the magnetic properties of the adsorbent increased fe ti oxide coating reduced magnetization which indicated the non magnetic nature of fe ti oxide the magnetization saturation of the adsorbent was 18 4 emu g the adsorption capacity of fe ti bimetallic core shell adsorbent was 57 2 mg g table 1 this adsorption isotherm followed the langmuir isotherm model the fe3o4 fe ti oxide core shell adsorbent had a great adsorption rate so it reached equilibrium in less than 3 min after applying the magnetic field the nanocomposite got separated effectively but to further increase the separation efficiency magnetic capacity augmentation is needed zhang et al 2014 an improved remediation performance was noted by zhang et al by micro sized magnetic adsorbent developed using spray drying and calcination method zhang et al 2016a the ph range and interference of coexisting ions significantly affects an adsorbent s adsorption capacity in this case the adsorbent had a broad range of ph and was highly selective for coexisting ions the ample presence of hydroxyl group on fe3o4 fe ti provide an active site for fluoride making the separation easy and rapid the xrd and xps spectra supported fe o and ti components and fe3o4 and fe ti oxide integration the sem images indicated the nanocomposite s porosity and large surface area 99 2 m2 g the developed magnetic adsorbent took only 2 min to achieve the equilibrium the developed adsorbent presented the maximum adsorption capacity of fe3so4 fe ti core shell nps 41 8 mg g at ph 3 0 table 1 the adsorption followed the quasi second order model and the adsorption isotherm was well fitted with the freundlich model its adsorption process was rapid and easy and achieved completion within 2 min of initiation the regeneration process was extraordinarily high that is 10 cycles an ample number of hydroxyl groups on the adsorbent s surface were available for fluoride ions to adhere on the feso4 fe ti oxide core shell was an extensively reusable adsorbent as its adsorption capacity remained intact zhang et al 2016a zhang and his colleagues examined size dependent adsorption process in a fluidized bed with fe3o4 fe ti adsorbent zhang et al 2017a the core shell fe3o4 fe ti nanosorbent was synthesized effortlessly by dissolving fecl2 4h2o and fecl3 6h2o in ethanol then titrating this solution the purpose behind using fe3o4 fe ti was that layering of fe3o4 on the surface surmounts the impact of driving forces of fluidized beds such as centrifugal force magnetic force gravity etc fe3o4 fe ti adsorbent had a better adsorption rate than the previously reported zhang et al 2016a adsorbent the xrd peaks for fe3o4 were the same in all spectra at different temperatures and the coarse shape of fe3o4 fe ti changed into crystalline form at elevated temperatures fe3o4 fe ti adsorption process followed the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics equation the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 41 8 mg g and it achieved equilibrium within 2 min at ph 9 0 table 1 zhang et al 2017a a comparative study of core shell ce ti fe3o4 and ce ti adsorbent was performed by markeb and others for that the adsorbent was prepared by dissolving and mixing ticl4 and ce no3 6h2o at 25 c ph was elevated to 7 0 by slow addition of 12 5 nh3 the preparation of ce ti fe3o4 nanoparticles nps was done in the laboratory using the coprecipitation method the reusability of ce ti fe3o4 was evaluated at ph 7 0 for 60 min and the ce ti fe3o4 nps were found to be reusable up to five cycles the adsorbents were then evaluated by examining their adsorption process in real water samples that turned out to be under the desired limit i e below 1 5 mg l abo markeb et al 2017 hrtem electron diffraction ed and sem were used for structural characterization the sem analysis predicted the particle size of ce ti oxide and ce ti fe3o4 to be 1 2 nm and 10 15 nm respectively the ed pattern demonstrated the crystalline form of ce ti fe3o4 whereas the non crystalline form for ce ti oxide the adsorption data were fitted into freundlich and langmuir models also ce ti fe3o4 nps presented higher adsorption compared to ce ti oxides table 1 abo markeb et al 2017 electro coextrusion technique was employed by zhang et al to fabricate a novel core shell fe3o4 alginate la particle s adsorbent zhang et al 2016b preparation and separation of core shell fe3o4 alginate la took place via steps like crosslinking ion exchange followed by addition of fe3o4 alla proceeding adsorption magnetic separation and desorption fig 4 a zhang et al 2016b by image analysis of sem the core s size was noticed at 517 341 μm and the width of the shell was 109 893 μm xps spectra showed that the major components in the core were c o la ca and fe whereas c o la and ca existed as the main components in the shell during the development of the adsorbent these bands shifted to 1652 5 cm 1 and 1418 7 cm 1 because of the ion exchange between na and ca2 of particles with la3 of the solution the purpose of taking la3 in the solution was to make possible the ion exchange among lanthanum and fluoride ions before adsorption ftir spectra showed two peaks at 1624 5 cm 1 and 1417 9 cm 1 attributed to co asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations and after adsorption the peak shifted 1653 3 cm 1 and 1419 1 cm 1 for asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of co group which indicated that la3 might have interacted or bonded with fluoride in the solution further the adsorbent s superparamagnetic nature was supported by vsm data with the saturation magnetization of 14 353 emu g the non linear freundlich model well explained fluoride adsorption the pseudo second order kinetic model fitted well in this fluoride elimination process the adsorbent s defluoridation capacity was observed at 45 2 mg g within 15 h at ph 4 0 and 25 c table 1 the hydroxyl groups on the surface of fe3o4 alg la were protonated and positively charged there were electrostatic attractions of the positively charged adsorbent with f during the fluoride removal also on the surface of this adsorbent the hydroxyl groups were exchanged with f while la3 would get exchanged with some hard acid and preferred to bind with a hard base for instance f therefore the adsorption process by fe3o4 alg la might have taken place through electrostatic attraction and lewis acid base interaction fig 4 b zhang et al 2016b 4 2 iron oxide metal oxide in another study riahi et al synthesized fe3o4 nanocomposite with zro2 by coprecipitation riahi et al 2015 the nanocomposite was prepared by adding trace amount of solid zirconium tetrachloride into concentrated perchloric acid hclo4 the solution was made to 1 0 m by making up with water in zirconium solution and 0 23 m in hclo4 the sem and tem confirmed the amorphous spherical structure of fe3o4 zro2 composite particles and their uniform distribution the specific surface area of fe3o4 zro2 was 492 m2 g according to brunauer emmett teller bet method due to the high adsorption capacity 158 6 mg g and substantial saturation magnetization 10 13 emu g fe3o4 zro2 nps with a ratio of 2 5 was preferred for further activity table 1 the adsorptive capacity of fe3o4 zro2 was affected by ph and it was found that the increased ph value decreased the adsorption capacity therefore from the ph studies the ideal value of ph for the adsorption of fluoride was found to be 2 5 as a result 0 50 mg quantity of adsorbent was decided for the optimum elimination of fluoride this adsorption process followed both freundlich and langmuir adsorption isotherms it was a potentially regenerable adsorbent as there was no decrease in the sorption capacity up to 8 cycles the surface layer of zro2 possessed special affinity towards fluoride and was found suitable for remediation of bulk volumes of real water samples easy laboratory synthesis was also a factor that made it ideal for practical defluoridation the fluoride adsorption mechanism was easily explained as surface complexation and ligand exchange where the fluoride adsorption was accompanied by the release of hydroxyl ions oh even though the developed fe3o4 zro2 adsorbent presented high adsorption capacity 158 6 mg g table 1 supported by high surface area the effect of contact time significantly affected the adsorbent performance and it was estimated that fe3o4 zro2 adsorbent took about 1 h to attain the equilibrium riahi et al 2015 also an adjustment of the ph of the treated water was required as the adsorption performance was found to be optimum at acidic ph zhao and others developed fe3o4 al oh 3 nanoadsorbent to remove aqueous fluoride zhao et al 2010 the structural properties of adsorbent were characterized using sem micrographs which exhibited the adsorbent s porous surface the sem studies revealed that the size of fe3o4 nps was 10 nm the vsm study displayed the superparamagnetic character of nps the saturation magnetization of fe3o4 al oh 3 was 16 3 emu g the surface area of nanocomposite as estimated by the bet method was 147 m2 g that supported the good adsorption capacity of fe3o4 al oh 3 adsorbent 88 4 mg g at ph 6 5 which required 1 h to reach equilibrium table 1 the adsorption results were well explained by the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics the adsorbent s saturation magnetization was 16 3 emu g which confirmed its easy separation from the solution after fluoride adsorption zhao et al 2010 minju and others synthesized magnesium coated fe3o4 nps for deflurodiation minju et al 2015 the adsorption capacity of mgo coated fe3o4 was 10 9 mg g at ph value 6 0 within 2 5 h and on the adsorbent dose of 2 g l after the contact time of 120 min table 1 the initial concentration of fluoride in water was 98 5 which the adsorbent could have reduced by 98 5 an observable amount of increase in the adsorption capacity was witnessed due to an increase in the adsorption dosage the plausible reason behind this could have been an increase in the number of binding sites available for fluoride to interact the langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics were followed by this mgo coated fe3o4 adsorbent minju et al 2015 4 3 metal oxide metal oxide azari et al utilized a simple coprecipitation method to synthesize fe ag oxide nanoadsorbent azari et al 2015 the study of morphology particle size and shape of an adsorbent was analyzed by sem and tem analysis the shape of the adsorbent was spherical and iron oxide formed a circular structure while the silver oxide accumulated as nanoflakes fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis supported the presence of oh group on the adsorbent that played a key role in fluoride adsorption and confirmed the formation of fe o2 ag bonds in fe ag bimetal oxide nanocomposite the molar ratio of synthesized fe ag oxide nano adsorbent was fixed as 3 1 for the maximum adsorption performance at ph 3 0 this adsorbent s adsorption process was well fitted into the langmuir isotherm model and the kinetic behaviour supported pseudo second order kinetics the equilibrium time was 20 min for this adsorption action with the sorbent fixed 0 5 g l at 293 k at acidic ph value fluoride ions sorption increased in contrast the adsorption performance of fluoride ions decreased at basic and neutral ph values in an acidic medium positive ion dominated the adsorbent s surface and attached to fe ag s surface as a result the interaction of negative fluoride ions with the adsorbent surface increased the adsorption performance the adsorbed fluoride ions were replaced by surface hydroxyl groups m oh which played an essential role in fluoride desorption fig 5 a b azari et al 2015 however the study indicated that the adsorbent displayed a low adsorption capability of 22 8 mg g table 1 azari et al 2015 in this regard elahil and others fabricated calcined mg al layered dihydroxide by the coprecipitation process that carried out optimum fluoride adsorption under physiological ph conditions elhalil et al 2016 the pseudo second order kinetic model was followed by fluoride removal adsorbent and the adsorbent reached equilibrium in 6 h the best adsorbent performance was observed at ph 6 8 and the rate of adsorption increased with increased temperature from 10 to 40 c the well defined diffraction peaks of the parent samples were replaced by broad peaks thus indicating a poor long range ordered phase these broad peaks suggested a nanocrystalline material with tiny nanoparticles or even an amorphous phase the dosage of adsorbent was changed from 0 1 to 2 0 g l although the adsorbent performed well at almost physiological ph low adsorption capacity 0 9 mg g of the adsorbent and slow adsorption rate were the major disadvantages table 1 elhalil et al 2016 in this regard tang and zhang developed hierarchical pore structure ce fe bimetallic oxide by coprecipitation which showed a good adsorption rate tang and zhang 2016 the novel ce fe bimetal adsorbent was produced by the precipitation method the procedure of preparation included dissolution of fe no3 9h2o and ce no3 6h2o in 400 ml of deionized water the concentration ratio of ce and fe were 3 1 1 1 and 1 3 mol for preparation of cf 31 10 cf 11 10 and cf 13 10 respectively next step of preparation comprises adjusting of ph to 10 0 by adding 2 mol l naoh aqueous solution dropwise slowly preceded by centrifugation for 30 min these preparations were washed and heated at 70 c for a duration of 8 h thus cf 31 10 cf 11 10 and cf 13 10 ce fe bimetal oxide adsorbents were formed the adsorption result was well derived by the langmuir isotherm model and followed pseudo second order kinetics the maximal capacity of adsorption was observed at 60 9 mg g within 40 min table 1 the bet surface area was witnessed to be 164 9 m2 g the main driving force behind the adsorption here was ion exchange between the fluoride and ce oh group in the ce fe bimetal oxide the highest adsorption rate was between 2 9 and 6 1 ph which depicted the positive flexibility towards the ph tang and zhang 2016 still further improvement in adsorption performance and its rate is required for its field applications for improved adsorbent stability in the reaction medium and better reusability wu et al prepared mg fe composite oxide and alginate adsorbent wu et al 2017 the sem analysis predicted that the size of composite particles varied from 2 22 to 30 54 μam the thermal gravimetric analysis tga curve exhibited that the weight loss increased by increasing the temperature the major weight loss 25 84 was noticed in the range of 221 65 440 62 c the fluoride adsorption depends on ligand exchange and electrostatic interaction the developed adsorbent showed a maximal elimination capacity of 32 31 mg g at ph 6 5 with good mechanical stability and easy separability table 1 the data fitted better into the freundlich isotherm model the reusability of mg fe composite adsorbent was 79 6 after three regeneration cycles thus the adsorbent showed comparatively a bad regeneration capability than other adsorbents in the race the satisfying result of reusability indicated that the prepared adsorbent could be a favourable substance for defluoridation wu et al 2017 as compared to the above mentioned iron oxide adsorbent tio2 sio2 nanocomposite as prepared by zeng et al 2017 via the sol gel method or hydrothermal synthesis method showed improved performance fluoride adsorption ability of the tio2 adsorbents decreased with the increase of the po4 3 concentration whereas increase in concentration of cl ions had no definite effect on the adsorption the sem images revealed that tio2 particles were round and the tio2 sio2 particles were flat and amorphous the bet method calculated specific surface area of the nanocomposite which was 248 m2 g tio2 sio2 nanoadsorbent followed langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model with the maximum adsorption capacity of 94 3 mg g at ph 1 0 3 0 within 30 min zeng et al 2017 the high adsorption capacity can be attributed to its high surface area however acidic ph is its limiting factor for its wide scale application ca al double layered adsorbent synthesized by sun and others sun et al 2017 ca al was used in the synthesis process variations in the manufacturing conditions had a direct impact on the fluoride uptake from wastewater the sharp peak at 002 004 006 and 110 in xrd spectra indicated the formation of crystalline structure the ftir study analyzed the broadband at 3473 cm 1 of oh group and a weak band existed at 663 cm 1 for fluoride the highest adsorption capacity of ca al adsorbent was 146 6 mg g at ph 12 0 the adsorbent reached equilibrium within 1 h the freundlich isotherm model well elaborated the resulting data of this asorbent sun et al 2017 fu et al prepared a bimetallic al fe oxide for the fast elimination of fluoride fu et al 2020 the ftir spectra showed a band at 568 cm 1 which was assigned to the fe o stretching vibration and a new band at 643 cm 1 was related to the vibration of the fe o al bond the xrd study detected the high purity and lack of mineral impurities in the developed material the sem images displayed the uneven structure of magnetite particles and the particle size was less than 20 μam the maximum adsorption capacity observed was 26 5 mg g within 60 min at the ph range of 3 0 8 0 table 1 the adsorption results are well fitted in langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics the bimetallic al fe oxide was reported as a potential candidate for fluoride elimination due to the higher magnetism low cost easy preparation and recyclability fu et al 2020 the drawback of this adsorbent was the adverse effect of temperature on the adsorption process han and others developed la and ce bimetallic oxide shell han et al 2019 la ions showed high chemical attraction toward fluoride due to the highly electronegative nature of fluoride ions ce provided a large surface area high porosity and functional sites which enhanced the adsorption efficiency of the core shell adsorbent the adsorption capacity of this adsorbent was 60 3 mg g at ph 4 0 table 1 when the ph value of the solution was between 4 0 and 6 0 the surface of fe3o4 la ce became positively charged therefore the electrostatic interaction between fe3o4 la ce and negatively charged fluoride ions existed throughout the adsorption process and the electrostatic force repulsion between fe3o4 la ce was not favourable at a higher ph value between 6 0 and 12 0 so there was both lewis base interaction and ligand exchange mechanism for fluoride adsorption fig 6 a han et al 2019 the saturation magnetization value of fe3o4 la ce adsorbent was 41 5 emu g the saturation magnetization presented the magnetic nature of the adsorbent the higher the value of saturation magnetization the more it exhibits magnetism required for easy separation of fluoride from solution fe3o4 msio2 mldh350 exhibits magnetic separation using surface complexation and anionic exchange mechanism fig 6 b li et al 2020 the freundlich model and redlich peterson model easily expressed the adsorbent result the elovich equation described the adsorption kinetics han et al 2019 biswas et al modified the synthetic hydrous iron chromium bimetal oxide hicmo by the coprecipitation method biswas et al 2010 the tem images illustrated the irregular surface structure and the particle size was 40 55 nm the ftir spectra of hicmo showed bands between 3350 and 3450 cm 1 due to the o h stretching mode of water and hydroxide group after adsorption the bands found between 1635 and 1648 cm 1 were for the o h bending mode of water molecules the fluoride adsorption was raised between 3 0 and 7 0 ph levels the maximum fluoride was adsorbed at ph 3 0 due to high fluoride ions for positive charge and replacement of oh ions with fluoride the maximum adsorption capacity of hicmo was 16 3 mg g within 30 min table 1 the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics fitted very well with the equilibrium data biswas et al 2010 deng and colleagues designed granular mn ce bimetal oxide adsorbent by using the coprecipitation method deng et al 2011 the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 131 1 mg g at ph 6 0 table 1 the adsorption process was very fast within the first hour and reached equilibrium after 3 h the adsorption capacity decreased with increasing ph value up to 6 0 langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics can well explain the adsorption data deng et al 2011 chai and others developed a sulfate doped fe3o4 al2o3 nano adsorbent for defluorodiation chai et al 2013 the maximum adsorption capacity of fe3o4 al2o3 nano adsorbent was 70 4 mg g at ph level 7 within 20 min table 1 upon adsorption over a ph range of 4 0 10 0 the initial and final adsorption capacities were 10 ml l and 50 mg l respectively the adsorption efficiency varied from 90 to 70 across the tested ph range of 4 0 10 0 the langmuir adsorption isotherm and elovich model well fitted into the adsorption data result the underlying adsorption mechanism was explained in the formation of inner sphere fluoride complex and anion exchange of sulfate with fluoride for fluoride removal by the sulfate doped fe3o4 al2o3nps chai et al 2013 chen et al synthesized fe ti bimetallic oxide nano adsorbent by the coprecipitation method by conducting ammonium titration at the room temperature chen et al 2012 the particle size of bimetallic oxide predicted by tem was 5 7 nm the xrd peaks confirmed the presence of crystalline feooh and amorphous ti oh 4 the characteristic peak in ftir spectra of fe oxide ti oxide and fe ti oxide was assigned at 587 9 cm 1 615 cm 1 and 571 cm 1 respectively after adsorption the intensity of the peak at 1401 cm 1 and 1125 cm 1 decreased the hydroxyl group got reduced on the adsorbent surface after adsorption the fluoride adsorption capacity was 47 0 mg g at ph 5 0 table 1 the langmuir isotherm easily explained the adsorption result model chen et al 2012 therefore due to the excellent anion exchange performance fe3o4 msio2 mldh nanocomposite was developed as a fluoride adsorbent by li and others li et al 2020 the xrd study demonstrated the peak intensity of fe3o4 which decreased after coating the mgal ldh layer indicating its successful formation a set of peaks at 003 006 009 012 015 018 and 110 indicated the formation of a crystalline mgal ldh shell the sem data confirmed the fe3o4 fe3o4 msio2 and fe3o4 msio2 mldh particle size was 395 nm 469 nm and 503 nm respectively in ftir spectra a band was observed at 1384 cm 1 which indicated the presence of no3 ions in the developed adsorbent the possible fluoride adsorption mechanism on the fe3o4 msio2 mldh composites was proposed which involved i anionic exchange between nitrate and fluoride anions in solution and ii surface complex of anions with the surface metal hydroxyls of a composite in the case of surface complexation fluoride is probably retained by outer sphere complexation the maximum capacity was 28 5 mg g at ph 9 0 within 24 h table 1 the langmuir model was well fitted in the adsorption result li et al 2020 the adsorbent presented good separability due to the magnetite fe3o4 core which allowed an external magnetic field and facilitated their recycling and reusability li et al 2020 4 4 metal metal oxide niu et al prepared a robust and thermally stable alginate fe fe3o4 core shell structured composite niu et al 2012 the adsorbent morphology was studied by tem ftir xps xrd and bet methods the tem analysis explained the irregular shape of nps the ftir spectra of alginate fe fe3o4 showed a peak at 1620 cm 1 due to hydroxyl group and water stretching vibrations and three different peaks at 1089 cm 1 1038 cm 1 and 1169 cm 1 were attributed to the coupling of c c c o and δ c o h vibration the adsorbent removed 90 fluoride within 1 h at ph 3 5 the saturation magnetization was 65 5 emu g niu et al 2012 mukhoupadhyay et al synthesized ce4 incorporated hydrous fe3 oxide cihfo mukhopadhyay et al 2017 the adsorbent was studied through tem sem ftir xrd and bet tem and sem analyses represented the asymmetrical morphology and the size of the nps was 5 nm ftir spectrum showed bands between 3000 cm 1 and 3500 cm 1 and 1630 cm 1 denoted as o h bonds stretching and bending vibration after fluoride adsorption the intensity of oh stretching and bending band remarkably decreased and the band at 1400 cm 1 and 750 cm 1 disappeared the bet measured the surface area of cihfo which was found to be 140 711 m2 g in an acidic ph medium the fluoride adsorption capacity on cihfo increased due to electrostatic interaction between negative or positive charged ions on the adsorbent surface the maximum adsorption capacity of the cihfo adsorbent was 24 8 mg g at ph 5 0 7 0 table 1 the adsorption data well fitted in freundlich and redlich peterson isotherm model and kinetic data supported both pseudo first order reaction and pseudo second order kinetics mukhopadhyay et al 2017 4 5 metal oxide ppy however further improvement in the rate of adsorption performance is required for field applications hydrous tio2 polypyrrole nanocomposite was prepared by parashar et al 2016a for the defluoridation process it was synthesized via chemical oxidative polymerization of the pyrrole monomer in the laboratory the aqueous media of pyrrole monomer also contained htio2 nps in it sem and tem revealed the average size of nps to be 4 6 nm and the core shell morphology as a ball like structure of hydrous tio2 polypyrrole due to the stretching vibration of oh groups and h2o ftir spectra showed a broadband range of 3100 3400 cm 1 after adsorption the band of oh group slightly shifted from 3412 cm 1 3416 cm 1 the bet analyser calculated the surface area of synthesized nanocomposite to be 98 17 m2 g the optimum adsorption capability was observed to be 31 9 mg g at ph 6 5 and 25 c with the well fitted langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo second order kinetic theorem table 1 the possible adsorption mechanism of f by hydrous tio2 polypyrrole was found to be a function of ph at acidic ph the protonated hydroxyl group oh2 and protonated amine groups nh of the nps electrostatically interacted with negatively charged f ions there might have been an exchange ion between f ions in the solution and cl ions in polypyrrole chains at neutral ph therefore both electrostatic interaction and ion exchange were involved in fluoride ions adsorption mechanism it showed poor renewability i e only regenerable up to 3 cycles there are two plausible mechanisms for htio2 ppy to adsorb the fluoride ions in acidic ph by the interaction between protonated hydroxyl groups of htio2 nps and via interaction with protonated amine groups by electrostatic interactions fig 7 a parashar et al 2016a parashar and co workers explained the mechanistic pathways followed by their newly developed polypyrrole coated hydrous tin oxide ppy hsno nanocomposite for the rapid removal of fluoride parashar et al 2016b these polypyrrole hydrous tin oxide nanocomposites were prepared using in situ polymerization of fluoride by incorporating hsno by polypyrrole the adsorption data was well fitted into the langmuir isotherm model and followed pseudo second order kinetics the adsorption capacity of ppy hsno was 28 7 mg g at ph 6 5 within 45 min table 1 it showed a remarkable desorption efficiency of 95 81 up to 3 cycles tests were conducted on groundwater samples and they indicated ppy hsno nanocomposite to be a potential adsorbent the exchange between free surface hydroxyl groups and fluoride ions might be because both f and oh ions have comparable ionic radius being isoelectronic species the fluoride adsorption was mainly determined by electrostatic interaction and ion exchange mechanism between the hydroxyl and fluoride ions the possible electrostatic mechanism between f and ppy hsno can be described by two pathways i electrostatic interaction between na ions of ppy and f ions ii electrostatic interaction among hydroxyl groups of hsno and f ions as well as the ion exchange mechanism can be explained by two steps i ion exchange between cl ions and f ions ii ion exchange between hydroxyl groups and negatively charged f ions fig 7 b parashar et al 2016b nagaraj et al synthesized mgo2 ppy nanocomposite as a scavenger of fluoride nagaraj et al 2018 the sem investigated the structure of mgo2 ppy before and after adsorption and before fluoride uptake the adsorbent had a globular form and after adsorption the adsorbent showed a powder like structure the ftir spectra of mgo2 ppy manifested the band at 1142 cm 1 due to the oh bending vibration and a peak appeared for the mg f combination at 2436 cm 1 explaining its prime role in fluoride uptake langmuir model was better fitted than freundlich for the adsorption data although the adsorbent presented good chemical and mechanical stability wide range ph 3 0 11 0 applicability with good adsorption rate 50 min its low adsorption capacity 4 3 mg g needed to be addressed for its wide scale field applicability table 1 nagaraj et al 2018 using in situ polymerization wang and his colleagues fabricated fe3o4 ppy core shell nanocomposite for selective fluoride removal from water wang et al 2017b for the adsorption process of fluoride from water the fabricated fe3o4 ppy nanocomposites were placed in the electromagnetic device after fluoride separation the nanocomposite was collected from treated water using a magnet fig 8 wang et al 2017b the adsorption results fitted well with the freundlich isotherm model and kinetics data showed a pseudo second order model although the adsorbent can be easily separated and reused its low removal capacity 15 0 mg g table 1 limited its large scale applications wang et al 2017b aigbe et al synthesized polypyrrole magnetic nanocomposite by using in situ polymerization method aigbe and onyancha 2020 in the xrd pattern a peak was obtained for ppy at 24 64 and the particle size of composite estimated was 19 nm tem and sem micro images showed a core shell structure of nanocomposite with spherical shape and even structured the bet surface area of the ppy magnetic composite was 28 77 m2 g the varying rotating magnetic field stimulated the adsorption of fluoride the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 22 0 mg g at ph 6 0 within 10 min the freundlich isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics defined the adsorption process aigbe and onyancha 2020 chen and others synthesized a highly efficient ppy tio2 adsorbent by the in situ chemical method chen et al 2017 the ftir spectrum of ppy tio2 obtained peaks for pyrrole ring and tio2 after the adsorption all peaks of ppy were blue shifted due to π electron delocalization the electrostatic interaction and positively charged nitrogen atoms of ppy were responsible for better adsorption the peak of c n shifted from 1473 to 1482 cm 1 and the peak appeared at 1043 cm 1 which indicated c h in plane bending vibration which disappeared after adsorption the xrd peaks confirmed the presence of tio2 with the characteristic peaks at 25 3 37 8 and 48 1 the mechanism behind the adsorption of fluoride by adsorbent was the presence of hydroxyl and positively charged nitrogen atoms the adsorption process was found to be exothermic and spontaneous commenting upon the regeneration capacity it was excellent even after six cycles there was still high affinity in the ppy tio2 nano adsorbent for fluoride which indicated that it could be easily recycled without losing adsorption capacity regeneration capacity is the highlighting feature of this adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacity of the ppy tio2 nanoadsorbent was 33 1 mg g within 30 min at ph 7 0 this ppy tio2 adsorbent can be used six times without losing its adsorption capacity for fluoride removal the adsorption data are well fitted into langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics chen et al 2017 5 miscellaneous adsorbents among the conventional defluoridation methods adsorption is considered the most effective therefore chaudhary and his co workers synthesized iron oxyhydroxide from natural clay chaudhary et al 2016 to prepare iron hydroxide nps natural clay was filtered with acid to achieve iron precursors which constituted ferrous and ferric ions to synthesize iron oxyhydroxide nps sem and tem demonstrated the size of the nps 6 20 nm and endorsed the aggregation of nps the bet surface area of synthesized iron oxyhydroxide was 312 m2 g the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was noticed at 111 1 mg g within 45 min at ph 7 5 having adsorbent quantity varying from 0 2 to 1 5 g l with a well fitted freundlich isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics reaction according to the results of adsorption experiments the authors elucidated that the apt pore size and good surface area 312 m2 g are key for good fluoride removal performance 111 1 mg g from water chaudhary et al 2016 even though core shell fe3o4 alginate la came out as the state of the art sorbent for fluoride sorption one limiting factor is that optimal fluoride sorption chiefly occurred at acidic conditions largely below ph 6 0 with a narrow ph range which restricts its practical application consequently there is a demand for improved methods that involve fluoride ions remediation at almost neutral ph zhu and others prepared a high mechanical stable pectin al2o3 zro2 core shell adsorbent zhu et al 2016 sem analysis predicted beads particle size to be 2 5 1 0 and the powder form of al2o3 zro2 well wrapped over the beads after sorption the authors found out that the adsorbent s shape or surface did not change as much which indicated the high mechanical stability of the pectin al2o3 zro2 core shell xps peaks derived an appearance of ca al 74 71 ev zr 182 49 ev after adsorption a peak of f occurred at 685 01 ev and al s and zr s peak shifted from 74 71 ev to 182 49 ev 75 01 ev and 182 6 ev the adsorption results are well fixed in the freundlich isotherm adsorption process supporting multi layered non uniform heterogeneous adsorption surface sites the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo second order model the higher adsorption capacity of 98 0 mg g occurred within 8 h contact time at 4 0 ph bringing the concentration down to 0 5 mg l which is within the who permissible levels i e below 1 5 mg l the pectin al2o3 zro2 core shell adsorbent was produced by a coaxial electrostatic spinning device and was utilized to treat wastewater for defluoridation zhu et al 2016 however further studies are required to make it function over a wide ph range with a quick absorption rate the effect of ethanol on the shape of novel iron oxide adsorbent fabricated by wet chemical method was studied by zhang et al and was further used for defluorodiation zhang et al 2017b the sem and tem images showed that the structure of ethanol treated iron oxide was flake like while before ethanol treatment the iron oxide was needle like structure it might be due to ethanol s adsorption and the adsorbent produced high surface area and porosity the xrd spectra derived that the adsorbent has a crystalline structure and after the ethanol treatment structure became indefinite without ethanol the adsorption results followed the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics the ethanol treated adsorbent showed a good adsorption performance of 60 8 mg g table 1 which could be attributed to the adsorbent s high surface area 150 4 m2 g and porosity the adsorbent attained equilibrium within 2 min at ph range 3 5 10 3 zhang et al 2017b therefore this adsorbent can be a good fluoride removal candidate but only after improving its remediation performance the adsorption capacity of various tio2 based nanocomposites fe3o4 tio2 sio2 tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 tio2 prepared by liang et al using the sol gel method was compared the sem analysis revealed the size of sio2 tio2 fe3o4 tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 tio2 was found to be 40 60 μam 0 2 0 5 μam and 0 5 1 μam respectively among the three adsorbents sio2 tio2 was the most efficient adsorbent the bet method determined the surface area of sio2 tio2 fe3o4 tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 tio2 to be 249 31 m2 g 17 442 m2 g and 22 541 m2 g sio2 tio2 fe3o4 tio2 and fe3o4 sio2 tio2 adsorbents adsorption capacities were 152 2 mg g 22 9 mg g and 22 4 mg g respectively therefore the high surface area of the sio2 tio2 adsorbent supported its highest adsorption performance the adsorption process reached equilibrium within 30 min langmuir and freundlich both models well explained the data of the adsorption process liang et al 2017 wang et al fabricated mg al zr tri metal oxide by the coprecipitation method wang et al 2017c the adsorbent result data was well fitted into langmuir and freundlich model the kinetics followed by the adsorption process were a pseudo second order equation and the adsorption attained equilibrium in 6 h the adsorption capacity was 22 9 mg g ph 7 0 the exchange between the hydroxyl group and fluoride or ion exchange contributed significantly to fluoride removal in the adsorption mechanism wang et al 2017c cerium oxide is the least soluble amongst rare metal oxides therefore it could be a good alternative in modified materials for fluoride remediation zhu and co workers prepared cerium immobilized crosslinked chitosan composite zhu et al 2017 the chemical and mechanical stability of the developed adsorbent were improved after chitosan crosslinking and were beneficial to the application the ftir spectra signified main bands at 3420 cm 1 for oh and nh2 stretching vibrations 2926 cm 1 ch vibration and 1598 cm 1 for oh or nh2 bending stretching ce chitosan s spectrum showed a band at 3391 cm 1 shifted to 29 cm 1 which confirmed ce s interaction with the chitosan amino or hydroxyl group the strong peak at 1387 cm 1 revealed that ce s presence impacts the ch group and the no3 stretching band occurred after fluoride adsorption the peak intensity decreased which advised that fluoride ions replaced the ce no3 groups due to the chelation exchange mechanism the bet specific surface area of chitosan composite was 16 6 m2 g the ce chitosan composite s maximal adsorption capability was 153 0 mg g where the ph value was three and the adsorption process achieved equilibrium in 4 h the adsorption data was well defined by the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics the ligand exchange and complexation played a crucial role in the adsorption mechanism of fluoride ions by cerium chitosan composite the process involved three different paths i the electrostatic attraction between ce3 4 and nh3 with f ions ii the ligand exchange among f and no3 iii the generation of ce f chitosan composite fig 9 a zhu et al 2017 ayinde et al prepared layered ag mgo hydroxyapatite composite ayinde et al 2018 the uv visible spectrum indicated the formation of agnps agnps showed a characteristic absorption band maximum of 440 nm due to oh stretching vibration the ftir spectra showed a peak at 3290 cm 1 the sem and tem images revealed the amorphous flake shape of the composite and the particle size was 14 84 nm the adsorption process followed the pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir isotherm model the adsorption capacity was observed at 2 1 mg g at ph 6 0 within 1 h showing that the adsorbent suffered major drawbacks of low adsorbent capacity and slow adsorption rate ayinde et al 2018 huang et al customized a special core shell alooh boehmite adsorbent huang et al 2020 the adsorbent presented an excellent adsorption capacity of 1070 6 mg g at ph 2 0 the abundant hydroxyl group on the adsorbent surface was the ultimate reason for the boehmite adsorbent s higher adsorption efficiency the authors found an acidic solution as more favourable for the adsorption of fluoride mainly because of the conversion of hf pyrazine and hf2 the bifluoride ion with a strong hydrogen bond effect from fluoride fig 9 b huang et al 2020 in an acidic medium there was a strong bonding between fluoride and al o h adsorption sites langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetics well explained the result of adsorption the equilibrium of fluoride adsorption reached 10 h representing a slow adsorption process therefore the low adsorption rate and acidic ph need to be addressed before launching it in real world applications to bring the fluoride concentration within who permissible limits this research laid an important foundation regarding the structural design of the adsorbent yaghini and faghihian modified an adsorbent by impregnating a magnetized carbon core shell with lanthanum for the fluoride uptake from water the highest adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was 20 7 mg g at ph 5 0 the adsorption results were well fitted into a second order reaction the saturation magnetization of this adsorbent was 60 emu g for fast and easy elimination of fluoride sufficient magnetism was needed and the higher magnetism of the adsorbent enables the strong attachment of fluoride ions to the adsorbent surface the sufficient magnetism both ph and contact time variable significantly influenced fluoride adsorption ph and time had the most and the least impact on fluoride adsorption respectively the adsorbent was investigated for its regeneration capacity and was found to be moderately regenerable on three regeneration cycles 73 of its adsorption capacity remained intact a change in the concentration of oh ions reduced the adsorption of fluoride while a rise in the cl thus we found that the adsorption properties of all core shell adsorbents are different despite such difficulties and challenges in this field core shell materials are beneficial for removing fluoride ions from wastewater concerted research in this field can make the practical use of core shell for water treatment a reality soon 6 future perspectives a detailed and systematic study of core shell adsorbents is necessary to examine the interconnection with fluoride of course fluoride removal by core shell adsorbent has been done very widely despite such a fast growth curve of the utilization of core shells for water treatment they are limited to the laboratory only in a nutshell their utility is limited industrialists and material scientists should collaborate and give access to each other in their fields to learn and bring the core shell adsorbents into practical routine usage despite the pros of core shell highly advanced systems are needed at a low cost future with less waste maximum use of available waste and minimal process wastage to continue defluoridation therefore the core shell adsorbent still has some drawbacks that can be improved like the need of the hour is an eco friendly core shell adsorbent that does not harm the environment as there is no risk of releasing harmful substances and exhausts from the core shell it would contribute to sustainable development so more research is needed in this direction although the core shell adsorbent has become the most reliable adsorbent it still needs much work to be done on the effect of coexisting ions on performing the core shell adsorbent in designing future core shell adsorbents surface modification is also worth considering for superior adsorption capacity on account of being less reactive and attaining a higher coordination number by reacting with hydroxide ions modifying core shell with inert metal can surmount the limitation of core shell adsorbent the bond strength between metal and ligand is also a major thing to discriminate while assembling a core shell adsorbent because the chemical stability of the adsorbent facilitates core shell competence metal size control and choice of correct nano adsorbent to incorporate the core shells within the biological matrix impacts the adsorption process to a great extent nanoparticle loading is equally important for the application as a core shell structured adsorbent broad ph range a higher number of hydroxyl ions and maximum active sites of the adsorbent are other relevant factors for improving the performance of the adsorption phenomenon the biological matrix durability can be enhanced by harmonizing the core shell with the inorganic materials more research is required to make core shell adsorbents precisely sustainable and increase their lifespan an inexpensive and eco friendly core shell adsorbent can be a better candidate to eliminate fluoride 7 conclusion this review has critically analyzed the use of core shell based nanosorbents for water decontamination and reuse core shell s high potential for water purification is supplied by their striking properties as high adsorption capacity magnetic properties reusability and precise target molecule recognition harmonizing them with other nanomaterials elevates their adsorption capacity and makes them even more than the precursors chemists and materials scientists should conspire together and triumph over the shortcomings faced in making core shell the excellent adsorbent for fluoride removal and handling technical aspects and other hindrances its good mechanical strength and negligible coexisting anions effect are attractive features as an excellent fluoride adsorbent the substantial interaction amidst contaminant ions fluoride and the core shells incorporated provides their effective elimination based on this review the undermentioned statements could be made due to the process suitability adsorption is acknowledged as one of the best methods among several reported techniques for the removal process however when fluoride removal is a major concern for us the low adsorption efficiency of conventional adsorbents is disappointing therefore the core shell adsorbent emerged for such a contaminant s adsorption from water due to its large surface area high porosity adjustable and docile structural properties apart from all these properties the core shell adsorbent faces challenges such as stability under various conditions large scale production and a cost effective synthesis route to recover the adsorbent and enhance the process s economic feasibility regeneration studies are also required to be performed to a great extent apart from this the low cost core shell adsorbent is one of the major requirements for industrial uses keeping this in mind the present review would help sort out the current defluoridation issues in the most appropriate way notwithstanding the existing problems and challenges in this field we believe that core shell structured adsorbents are very simple convenient cost effective and environmentally sustainable for water purification future studies

11788,in groundwater management as a common pool the participation of the beneficiaries faces the problem of free riding therefore it is necessary to provide a framework that can minimize the water public tragedy and free riding this article used studies from around the world to develop a governance framework for the socio ecological and resilience system and express the function of element resilience within this system in protecting groundwater public and private rights the elements of water management were divided into the three sub systems of the aquifer the natural environment and the community above the aquifer and explained how the elements sustain water services through interacting with each other also determined how resilience characteristics of elements against control variables groundwater challenge public and private rights and cause controversy the discussions showed that the elements and resilience of the elements can be different and contradictory to each other and challenge the public and private rights of groundwater which can be very effective in building trust and stakeholder participation in water management the ses framework is used in planning and policy making and determining public and private rights strengthening the resilience of the system and assessing the dynamics of the groundwater system graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer human society groundwater system natural environment public and private rights resilience 1 introduction groundwater is now facing serious problems due to the expansion of agricultural activities population growth and climate change and thus it has become necessary to reconsider the exploitation and management processes numerous management strategies have been recommended regarding the use of groundwater resources these include technology use seed modification and modern irrigation and tillage systems despite the development of these systems worldwide groundwater still encounters reduction pollution and high demands with the advent of the 21st century and establishing the goals of the third millennium of sustainable development attitudes towards water management changed and water management and protection approaches have changed from purely technical strategies to ecological social governance regarding the socio ecological system ses governance of groundwater and sustainable use of resources several theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted in different parts of the world these studies can be divided into two main strands including studies on the use of the ses conceptual framework in water management and those on the development of ses concepts such as resilience concepts delgado et al 2020 used water governance in institutional networks governance tool matrices and conceptual cascades at the national regional provincial and local levels to address accounting financial technical institutional fragmentation and poor coordination issues van der voorn et al 2012 described adaptive management and its combination with participatory management to provide an appropriate framework for tackling climate change in their theoretical framework adaptive management is an approach to policy improvement through learning in this framework adaptation to change lock in breakdown and the gap between monitoring and environmental performance are done in four stages evaluation policy formulation implementation and monitoring according to the position of action petit et al 2017 used a socio ecological framework to understand the collapse of groundwater dependent agricultural economies in this framework understanding collapse is an important principle to manage change and tipping point transition in 2020 blomquist studied groundwater governance and addressed various issues of groundwater rights transfer to introduce the water market as an important strategy in water management in this study the aquifer shape and access level to the amount of water was the main issues of the water rights transfer the ses has contributed to governance in human dependence on nature which improved the cooperation among scientific disciplines methodological diversity and policy frameworks rica et al 2017 rica et al 2017 defined i social economic and political arrangements ii exploiters iii resource systems and iv governance systems as the main elements of ses in water governance analysis in addition the conceptual framework of bouchet et al 2019 is another study on the use of resilient ses and strategic groundwater management the conceptual framework was defined in three formats i ses for water observation ii sustainability and resilience of ses and iii strategic adaptive management or how to use ses in groundwater protection in the ses framework of human societies aquifers and ecosystems simultaneously define the governance structure of the water ses underground aquifers dependent ecosystems and human societies have characteristics dynamic and non linear relationships and open boundaries the openness feature exposes the water governance structure to extrinsic stimuli and the adaptability change and resistance to these stimuli determine the resilience of the structure resilience requires integrating different types of cultural social technical and institutional knowledge strategic adaptive management examines groundwater adaptation and participation in ses through three components goal hierarchy concern threshold and action based learning cumming et al 2020 addressed the institutional aspects of ses governance in balancing individual and group interests to resolve social conflicts and reduce ecological quality in this study the relationship between experience and theory used by institutions in water governance is discussed instead of expanding resource governance variables mathias et al 2020 defined three main features in the ses framework that can be useful in analyzing the transition path from the tipping point the culmination the ecological sub system and the social sub system are the three main features in ses that affect the dynamics of exploiters behavior however sess also has several weaknesses these systems are not helpful in understanding change but provide strong evidence of social and natural interactions bolognesi et al 2018 investigated changes and dynamics of ses s three causal mechanisms including institutional complexity trap difficulty trap and learning process and showed the changes and dynamics from saturation to reorganization groundwater governance is influenced by harding s 1968 public tragedy and human inertia foster and van der gun 2016 which leads to changes in groundwater services water storage water purification and safe water supply in the public tragedy the main issue of exploiters behavior concerning groundwater resources as public resources is based on two theorems first according to the logic of rationality personal interests are probably and generally prioritized over public interests at critical and sensitive times secondly everyone is responsible for his her action and must pay the price operators behavior is unbalanced due to the contradiction and conflict between individual and collective interests free riding competition in water depletion out of sight morphological status amount of water in the aquifer and different proximity of aquifers to threatening and useful elements there is an important issue in using ses to solve groundwater problems the problem is that ses use in water governance is often simplified leading to information loss about elements and biophysical and human interactions cumming et al 2020 in many cases the form of resilience in natural sub systems conflicts with ses social sub systems mathias et al 2020 thus if we consider resilience as the stability of the elements in the groundwater system the forms of adaptation service resistance and the tipping point of the elements in social sub systems conflict with natural sub systems and aquifers this process confronts groundwater governance with legal problems inconsistencies between public and private rights and the interaction of water management institutions this study addresses three key issues that are lacking in groundwater ses resources the first issue is that ses usually shows the general framework for water management but does not specify what elements make up groundwater ses second the available sources do not indicate the elements resilience against changes third in water management the boundary between public and private law is important in stakeholder participation the resilience of ses elements puts stakeholders in different and conflicting positions and may make them hesitant to choose a water service protection strategy possibly minimizing their involvement and enhancing free rides considering the participation of stakeholders in the management and governance of groundwater is very important disclosure of the boundary between public and private rights is also crucial for participation because transparency helps a lot to build trust therefore recognizing the challenges of the border between public and private rights and between the beneficiaries of private exploiters will lead to the wide participation of exploiters in many areas the abuse of public rights versus private rights and the abuse of rights of some private stakeholders over others is very common this article provides a good framework for protecting the rights of private and public stakeholders against each other in addition this text will help planners how to evaluate the change in ses elements given this background this paper aims to i determine the main elements of groundwater ses which have not been adequately addressed in previous research ii demonstrate the resilience pattern of key elements to slow variables and iii point to the important criteria in resolving public and private law issues that lead to stakeholder cooperation in groundwater service protection to achieve these goals in section 1 we define the groundwater ses framework based on adaptive capacity and resilience in section 2 the role and function of the resilience of ses groundwater elements in addressing public and private rights are discussed section 3 elaborates on the strategic adaptive management of groundwater and section 4 presents conclusions and lessons 2 resilience groundwater ses framework and public and private rights mathias et al 2020 addressed tipping points ecological sub systems and social sub systems in the context of ses bouchet et al 2019 studied three aquifer sub systems aquifer above ecosystem and aquifer community rica et al 2017 defined socio economic and political systems as well as exploiters and resource systems in the governance systems of resilient ses in this paper we defined the ses in three sub systems namely the aquifer the aquifer community and the aquifer ecosystem fig 1 we considered ecosystem services adaptation and resilience meuwissen et al 2019 at the local regional and national levels delgado et al 2021 as a framework of resilience resilience can also be assessed in terms of governments markets and social actors delgado et al 2021 this form of resilience assessment would be very useful in identifying governance gaps on the other hand with regard to the use of ses in groundwater governance the resilience of elements against the slow variable s salinity water quality groundwater volume and water demand bouchet et al 2019 taghilou and aftab 2022 of public and private rights blomquist 2020 are analyzed private rights were defined as exploiters access to equal extraction in the long run and to standard and drinkable water with lower salinity public rights included the community s access to the benefits of water exploitation and protection the hierarchy of goals concern thresholds and action based learning at local regional and national levels are used to evaluate the performance of adaptation self regulation and resistance meuwissen et al 2019 and the culmination of ses elements concern thresholds and goal hierarchies are used in adaptive management when there is data uncertainty due to limited data access and diversity complexity and management knowledge van der voorn et al 2017 in addition the mismatch between ecological conditions and management institutions would have existed cumming et al 2006 the hierarchy of goals concern thresholds and action based learning is used to evaluate the performance of adaptation self regulation resilience and the tipping point of elements fig 1 the hierarchy of goals is used when there is no cognitive element in the system and includes short to long term goals that lead to the sustainability of the water system when it is impossible to determine the tipping point of control variables the worry threshold increases capacity and resistance concern thresholds are operational actions and goals that monitor slow variable behavior learning in practice predicts key stimuli van der voorn et al 2012 and better understands the effects of feedback self regulation and system openness on the sustainability of water services learning refers to a set of small experiments to better understand the groundwater system megdal et al 2015 bouchet et al 2019 2 1 elements and function of human society above aquifers in the groundwater system human communities are affected more than the environmental structure of the aquifer and its services exploiters institutions foster and van der gun 2016 mathias et al 2020 and land are the main actors in the structure of human communities fig 1 which are effective in accessing equal extraction of drinkable water drinkable as private rights in addition it plays a role in public access to the benefits of water exploitation and protection as public rights 2 1 1 agricultural exploiters agricultural exploiters are elements in the structure of the community above the aquifer which are effective in the overall system of water governance there are two categories of agricultural exploiters i self exploiters and ii tenants each of these exploiters can have different motivations due to the feeling of groundwater ownership the exploiters try to stabilize its services in the presence of other conditions for example stability of livelihood however the tenants mainly pursue their immediate interests and their extraction rate is higher than the aquifer it is also not invested in water conservation due to a lack of ownership both exploitation groups can be studied in terms of the number and behavior of groundwater the number of exploiters is quantified with high medium and low density in the aquifer the multiplicity of exploiters is tied in several ways to the public tragedy extremist exploiters make it difficult to reach a consensus on water protection and conservation it also increases the potential for drilling wells and pumping water illegally if conditions allow exploiters behavior is another important issue concerning groundwater management mathias et al 2020 named three types of exploitation moderate productive extremist exploiters in the use of resources without considering the interests of others and environmentalist exploiters these exploiters capacity to understand critical conditions and collapse petit et al 2017 is an important step in stabilizing water resources 2 1 2 institution ngos and government agencies at the local and regional levels agricultural and irrigation systems at the local level and constitutions and civil laws related to water at the national level are the most important water governing bodies that regulate discharge through the issuance of drilling permits monitoring and sanctions possibly regulating groundwater ownership rights economical water valuation water distribution and design and consulting irrigation systems have major impacts on the sustainability of groundwater services foster et al 2010 foster and cherlet 2014 foster and van der gun 2016 institutions and communities above groundwater are reorganizing to reduce the destructive effects of trans systemic processes they likely use new irrigation systems purifiers desalination plants artificial recharge and reduced consumption galloway and burbey 2011 seed modification cultivation pattern change rental system change restrictive rules strict monitoring lifestyle changes and institution building a greater number of institutions and their complex relationships mainly determine the role of institutions in groundwater governance bolognesi and nahrath 2020 in addition there is no balance in rights and ecological conditions unless institutions intervene cumming et al 2020 institutions control human interactions based on rules decisions and financial capital that includes government systems from the national to the local level lake and fenner 2019 the multiplicity of incorrect institutions and supplements regarding water management and the complexity of their relationships reduce the coordination of management strategies bolognesi and nahrath 2020 moreover the overlaps and competitions among tasks for management decision making and implementation of water management projects create certain problems or delays in addition such problems confuse the government and exploiters in defining and protecting the public and private rights and challenge people s participation in government initiatives to address the public tragedy and human inertia 2 1 3 land land is another effective element in the sub system of society in this respect the type of its use the size of land ownership and the distribution of arable lands are considered the type of land use directly affects the function and services of the aquifer foster et al 2010 the type of land use in terms of consumption and pollution affects the sustainability of water purification and storage services popa et al 2019 land ownership size is another land feature that affects water abstraction villholth 2013 however land ownership size is directly related to the number of agriculturally dependent populations and groundwater resources small ownership limits the incentive to use new irrigation technology and also increases the dispersion of arable lands in transferring water from one land to another which has a direct effect on water depletion the structural elements of the adaptive groundwater system are constantly exposed to external stimuli such as economic growth crop production policies and food security population growth policies climate change national macro policies and laws in the field of water these stimuli severely alter the elements of the sub systems and affect the quality and quantity of water services population growth emphasis on the development and growth of agricultural products and gdp promotion through exporting agricultural products put additional pressure on groundwater resources followed by the expansion of irrigated lands and the cultivation of commercial crops as a result groundwater consumption increases schwarz and mathijs 2017 this reduces the groundwater level and water quality and increases salinity therefore it is important to study the dynamics and compatibility of system elements against these stimuli regarding the sustainability of water services dynamics and adaptation of groundwater system actors are managed through self regulation self regulation is a process in which the elements adapt to the new conditions to maintain their role and service in the system without external guidance self regulation is done through non linear dynamics and feedback 2 2 elements and function of aquifer sub system the aquifer is a layer of groundwater that occurs in uncompressed layers gravel sand and silt or in stones with interstice and gap thus underground layers blomquist 2020 and pores are the two main elements of aquifer structure xu et al 2013 taghilou and aftab 2022 their function is to purify store and protect water underground layers in addition to being a place to store water also play a role in purifying the flow of surface water the purified water is stored in the pores of the basement layers and forms the basement aquifer the feedback of the subterraneous layer and the pores of the aquifer is important against the changes drainage of water from basement pores and tectonic layers occurs due to the effect of ultra systemic stimuli water absorption from saline water sources such as lakes and land subsidence are the feedback of aquifer elements against water discharge schmid et al 2014 land subsidence is a double edged sword in protecting water services land subsidence on the one hand reduces the aquifer capacity to store and protect water on the other hand blinding the drained pores it prevents the infiltration from the lake saltwater which increases water salinity in general land subsidence reduces freshwater storage space and aquifer reconstruction will not be possible through self regulation or community involvement thus change will occur permanently 2 3 elements and function of natural environment sub system the main function of the natural environment structure is to nourish the aquifer which ensures the sustainability of water services among the environmental elements above the groundwater aquifer the three elements of the river network bed boulton and hancock 2006 the volume and type of rainfall lakes and wetlands have a direct impact on groundwater services kløve et al 2011 human performance affects the two elements in the network of rivers lakes and wetlands in the short term 2 3 1 rivers the width of the riverbed and the number of its branches are effective in nourishing the aquifer allen et al 2004 any amount of river bed with a large width can bring more volume of river water into the aquifers also the high density of river water supplies branches to farms and intensifies the infiltration of water into aquifers in addition the quality and length of rivers transferring water from rivers to farms can bring large volumes of water into the aquifer and be effective in the sustainability of water services 2 3 2 rainfall the volume of water entering the aquifers depends on the type and amount of rainfall snowfall has a higher yield in aquifer nourishment volume compared to rainfall earman and dettinger 2011 because drops are less exposed to evaporation due to sunlight reflection the speed of surface movement and drop transfer is less than that of rain and thus it has more opportunity to penetrate underground jasechko et al 2014 rainfall also determines the nutrition of aquifers consecutive droughts weaken water services as rainfall decreases water productivity and quality will decrease due to aquifer depletion and water purification and freshwater services will be compromised 2 3 3 lakes and wetlands lakes wetlands and other elements of the natural environment above the aquifer play a role in its nutrition kløve et al 2011 taghilou and aftab 2022 the nutrition volume of lakes depends on the amount of opened space in the groundwater aquifers and the adaptation of its layers to aquifer layers upper lakes of the aquifer are directly effective in nutrition and lakes adjacent to aquifers are related to the height of aquifer layers through the height of the lake bed ong 2010 of course the shape of the aquifer layering aquifer depth and aquifer height with the layers adjacent to the lake surface are very effective in the amount of water nutrition from the lake surface in the aquifer if the layers of the lake bed are higher than the aquifer layers the amount of aquifer nutrition from the lake will increase in case there is space and pores in the aquifer layers feedback of surface water network rainfall and lakes are also very important against aquifer drainage determining rainfall feedback volume and type against aquifers is very difficult and even impossible however the feedback of the surface water network and lakes in the groundwater system can be defined considering the amount of their nutrition if drained pores are present the permeability of surface water from rivers increases kalbus et al 2006 and may balance its services however if land subsidence occurs the infiltration of river water into the aquifers reduces yet the issue of lake water entering the aquifers is questionable the reason is that the infiltration of saline water reduces the quality of groundwater zekster 1995 although there are no experiments to prevent subsidence in areas where saline water enters drained aquifers it can be argued that nutrition groundwater by lakes increases salinity but prevents land subsidence this makes it possible for the system to return to its original state if groundwater is nourished with rainwater and snow 3 resilient ses public and private groundwater rights in fig 2 we examine the relationship among resilience concepts ses elements water services public and private laws and slow variables in fig 2 the x axis of the groundwater system potential and the y axis are the temporal trend of change the dark green zone is a stage where ses elements maintain water services through self regulation against slow variables and there is less conflict between public and private water rights the light and the dark yellow zone is the stage where the intensity of the effect of slow variables is higher than the self regulating capacity in this range the compatibility and resistance of human elements to some extent lead to prolonged water service at this stage water resources are limited by increasing demand and change and thus the conflict between public and private interests is formed the self regulation adaptation and resistance of ses elements are likely to create the conditions for a conflict of interest in protection action and challenge the decision of public and private stakeholders to protect water services in the orange zone water services are endangered and the costs of adaptation and resistance of social elements increase in these conflicting circumstances stakeholders take different steps regarding exploitation and protection and the conflict between public and private rights intensifies as a result free riding occurs which is addressed in the following paragraphs in the red zone the system changes completely at this stage the resilience capacities no longer respond to the performance of the slow variables and a new system is formed inspired by the theory of the adaptive cycle of holling 1986 if we consider the water cycle as a complete wheel and it into four quadrants divided each quadrant would contain 25 of the complete wheel so we think ses goes through four stages of groundwater over time thanks to a complete water cycle and water services the first stage makes up 25 of the cycle this stage is in the green range of fig 2 the rate of change at this stage is 25 of water elements and services and this amount of change is compensated by system self regulation the second stage is in the range of light and dark yellow at this stage along with the first stage about 50 of the elements and services change over time through slow variables that can define the threshold of concern in the system at this stage self regulation adaptation and resistance of social elements to slow variables enter the equation and maintain water services for a long time with the accumulation of slow variables the rate of change reaches 75 of water elements and services and the differences and contradictions of groundwater due to resilience create conditions for conflict of interest in protection action and challenge stakeholders to choose a strategy this stage is mainly located in the orange area finally the slow variables due to exponential accumulation overcome the resilience strategies and act like a coil purple zone causing ses to pass the tipping point and changing almost 100 of the aquifer red zone 3 1 the resilience of the system against water salinity and public and private rights with regard to groundwater ownership rights recognizing and determining the amount and type of resilience of slow variables and their role in maintaining public and private groundwater ownership is important to determine the tipping point of variables and prevent them from reaching the tipping point is not an easy task biggs et al 2015 due to different affecting stimuli and factors the tipping point of water salinity varies in different uses for example drinking washing and agriculture groundwater resilience keeps demand stable for different uses for example ec more than 1000 us cm has 100 demand less than 5000 us cm 50 90 demand and ec more than 10 000 us cm with 25 demand until water services change and the demands reaches zero bouchet et al 2019 the tipping point of groundwater salinity is affected by two intrinsic and extrinsic natural factors of the system the inflow of saline water into the aquifer increases the salinity by changing the bed of nourish rivers and reducing the freshwater infiltration due to drought therefore the aquifer salinity may exceed the tipping point and affect boundaries of public rights and private rights saline water can be expected to enter from the lake shores and far from the shoreline where it acts as possible water salinity due to direct rainfall and runoff morad et al 2014 it is very difficult to measure the amount of saline water entering the aquifer but it can be obtained using the salinity ratio of lake water to groundwater provided that the salinity of the lake water is constantly evaluated it is also possible to define and calculate the threshold of concern for salinity by measuring the density of rivers and their discharge to the plain area two human factors also affect water salinity changes and the tipping point crossing excessive use of chemical fertilizers repetition of one type of cultivation and non observance of fallow increase the salinity of water entering the aquifer the use of chemical fertilizers and successive cultivation increases the ec and ph of the soil which increases the aquifer salinity through secondary inlet water due to irrigation in aquifers rao 2008 measuring the amount of fertilizer application and successive cultivation in the plains and their role in groundwater pollution is easier than considering the role of lakes and rivers the amount of fertilizer used during the year and the area of fallow land relative to the total land area indicate the salinization capacity of groundwater groundwater salinization rate is not the same in all geographical parts of aquifers and varies in terms of volume and time between coastlines and central plains the volume and rate of salinization in shorelines is higher than in offshore areas which causes unfair access to freshwater aquifers therefore the exploiters of wells along the rivers have better access to fresh groundwater compared to other parts of plains of course this occurs when the aquifer bed is like a tub otherwise the rate of salinization will be different this issue was shown by gs cumming et al 2020 in determining private rights for the water market the difference in the geography of groundwater salinization the support and participation of exploiters in the plain interior and the river shoreline in water conservation measures will reduce water compared to the salinization areas it should be noted that these exploiters have an equal share in salinization fig 2 in groundwater system services against salinity variables self regulation of system elements at the local level is discussed self regulation of system elements includes the entrance of large volumes of surface water rivers and lagoons into the aquifer morad et al 2014 however land subsidence and blinding evacuated spaces due to water discharge is the self regulatory mechanism of the ecosystem against saline water entrance although land subsidence reduces the volume of the aquifer it prevents saline water entrance into the upper layers and then into the lower layers of the aquifer another form of self regulation includes the entrance of large water volumes from wetlands and rivers into the empty pores of the aquifer evacuated spaces due to groundwater extraction increase the nutrition capacity according to the law of fluid flow from a high pressure area to a low pressure area if there is fresh water the water of wetlands and rivers flows quickly with a large volume into the space of the aquifer and prevents complete changes in water services self regulation of the aquifer system puts the extent and boundaries of public and private groundwater rights in a different state freshwater suction of wetlands and rivers by aquifers puts unbalanced access to quality water and water extraction capacity in the areas close to wetlands and rivers the amount and quality of water is more favorable than other aquifer areas and the exploiters in these areas have favorable access and proper production compared to those far from these areas table 1 this can be due to the operation of other elements in the groundwater system groundwater self regulation plays a favorable role in determining the fair rights of exploiters when the poor performance of other elements is minimized this is the time when no water abstraction is done for several years until the groundwater level in all parts of the plain reaches a balanced static level which seems far from logic and rationality therefore due to the dependence of aquifer self regulation on other elements functions it seems difficult to assess its effect on water rights in these cases water governance institutions with short term and medium term goals can evaluate their role in water rights the relationship between rivers and groundwater is complicated petit et al 2017 surface water exploiters are less likely to help improve groundwater and take steps to repair groundwater of course this is a possibility and can be evaluated by defining short term goals investment incentives in surface water management are power relations rica et al 2017 and capital reconstruction one reason is that water transfer projects such as the construction of dams canals and diversion dams are implemented in surface water and cause a redistribution of wealth and profit generation for water companies according to the logic of capitalism the interests of groundwater exploiters are usually not considered an investment in addition transferring river water in concrete pipes and canals to increase the speed of water transfer and reduce water loss is one of the first and simple measures used by surface water exploiters that challenge the interests of groundwater dependent farmers blomquist 2020 these measures contradict the benefits of groundwater exploiters and aquifer protection which in turn leads to non participation of groundwater exploiters in conserving water projects and controlling water transition from the tipping points such conditions encourage a free riding process among groundwater exploiters the main issue in adapting the system to the salinity variable is to change the pattern of groundwater use and reduce water use the salinity range is different from freshwater with 100 consumption demand to ec above 10 000 us cm with zero consumption demand the type of saline water use varies from irrigation of saline plants motallebian et al 2019 to toilets baths etc another type of adaptation is to reduce dependence on groundwater resources by changing livelihood that occurs by people society and government habiba et al 2014 although no experimental study has been done on livelihood diversification to show the relationship between livelihood change and groundwater salinity reduction it can be inferred that water dependence can be reduced by decreasing its dependence on agriculture this is the case as water salinity further threatens the agricultural sector and livelihoods substitution of activities in human society reduces dependence on groundwater and water extraction the ratio of people with income and jobs to groundwater compared to those above the aquifer annually or every few years and the ratio of the number of environmentally friendly exploiters to balanced and extremist exploiters are guidelines that can determine the level of groundwater salinity and threshold of concern the issue of adaptation to water salinity and its relevance to water rights is complex highlighting the public tragedy and disrespect for rights more than any other dimension of resilience as table 1 shows human adaptation to water salinity is not the same as system self regulation exploiters adaptation to the salinity tipping point revives free riding farmers are more adaptable to extrinsic shocks such as the economic crisis population growth food demand and climate change than to groundwater salinity this form of adaptation is often at odds with self regulation and the adaptation of the natural elements in the groundwater system adaptation to water salinity is mainly associated with changing the pattern of cultivation or transfer of water to valuable crops changing livelihoods and reducing groundwater dependent activity usually in these cases the exploiters try to use the capacities created by others and reduce salinity with the help of other exploiters in such situations understanding the crisis and learning in practice can reduce the intensity of free riding petit et al 2017 and protect the public and private rights in terms of resistance to changing water services the control of salinity variables and effective factors are examined artificial groundwater nourishing preventing saline water infiltration into the aquifer saline water purification reducing the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture foster et al 2018 and reforming groundwater laws are the most important measures for the sustainability of water services also by creating and protecting open spaces observing the privacy of wetlands and preventing the change in pasture uses which are water supply holes in the plain the capacity of water infiltration into the aquifer is expanded also improving riverbeds can increase groundwater recharge and quality resistance to the transition from the salinity tipping point is done by the exploiters and is a form of resilience that does not work well in protecting individuals privacy rights this form of resilience is accompanied by adaptation to the issue of public tragedy and free riding more resistance is done by environmental exploiters which is less or never noticed by extremist exploiters in this form the resilience of the salting rights of environmentally friendly and somewhat balanced exploiters is transferred to extremist exploiters at no cost the form of government authority at the national level limits laws against water salinization enacting the actions of exploiters to protect water government actions often do not consider the salting rights and exploiter types and restrictive actions are likely to be carried out regardless of differences this causes some exploiters not to take resistance and participatory measures against water salinization 3 2 system resilience against changing water quality and public and private rights the tipping point of groundwater pollution is the case when water is not drinkable in agriculture it increases soil porosity and moisture loss several intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the system cause groundwater pollution municipal and industrial solid wastes petroleum hydrocarbons pollution of toxic elements such as arsenic and nitrate are sources of groundwater pollution caused by human activities above groundwater aquifers li et al 2020 water pollution deprives the public of the benefits of exploiting groundwater table 1 the system shows a certain dynamism against these contaminants and makes changes in itself to protect the water meanwhile testing the level of groundwater pollution at consecutive times is the guideline that shows the trend of pollution change by contrast determining the tipping point of pollution factors such as municipal and industrial solid waste petroleum hydrocarbons pollution heavy metals such as arsenic and nitrate is difficult and complex and a concern threshold can be used for these factors the amount of polluting waste production compared to non polluting water and treated wastewater compared to untreated water is a threshold of concern for some pollutants that express changes in water quality in ecosystem services against pollution self regulation of aquifer elements and natural environment and society are discussed the service of aquifer layers against pollution is the purification of contaminated water entering the aquifer aquifer layers and their components absorb large amounts of pollutants such as metals and organic matter as water enters the aquifer and prevents pollution balke and zhu 2008 in addition the riverbed with its constituents mainly prevents contaminated water entrance into the aquifer rivers engage the water with oxygen before it enters the aquifer and reduces the amount of pollution tian et al 2011 nonetheless community service against pollution is the purification of polluted water municipal and industrial wastewater is treated by purifiers before returning to nature and entering the aquifer li et al 2020 and delays the passage of water pollution tipping point or possibly prevents that of tipping point changes in services in some cases the speed and rate of pollution are higher than those of ecosystem services which necessitates changes in use by human society the main issue is the type of human community services to the aquifer that may not be done directly polluted water purification is not mainly for groundwater in simpler terms unpurified groundwater is provided for exploiters and this form of service is mainly for wastewater and pollution causes not groundwater pollution this deprives groundwater exploiters of the benefits of water purification and access to treated groundwater this is a fundamental issue concerning the private rights of groundwater exploiters in the short term in the long term it helps reduce groundwater pollution provided that other elements of pollution namely the use of chemical fertilizers are reduced in addition the purification of pollutants concerning public rights is very effective and can be useful in protecting groundwater and surface water in the long term therefore water purification services effectively balance public and private rights adaptability with water pollution is rather impossible and cannot sustain groundwater services but it is necessary to control and manage water pollution with regard to resistance to pollution variables controlling pollutant sources is of paramount importance groundwater pollution sources are point linear and surface surface contamination is done by agriculture using pesticides and chemical fertilizers municipal and industrial wastewater and landfill are point sources of pollution and polluted rivers cause linear pollution due to the combination of riverbed waste and sewage leading to rivers therefore groundwater service sustainability against pollution and less changes in groundwater services would be increased by controlling these pollutant sources through strict monitoring by public institutions rajaram and das 2008 and government policy shortle and dunn 1986 in polluted water purification the sustainability of groundwater services would be intensified by using natural purifiers uses such as converting lands from agriculture to forests and grassland and preventing a change of natural uses and encroachment on river basins and water pollution laws these laws include the issuance of pollution licenses for farmers factory owners and municipalities another issue in pollution is that not all groundwater exploiters are the source of pollution and the cause of pollution outside the aquifer destroys the rights of exploiters and complicates their relationships some exploiters may take steps to reduce pollution and others may not be willing to adapt to pollution resistance measures due to outside contamination sources therefore the extent of groundwater pollution sources raises the issue of free riding more limited contamination sources can control the free ride phenomenon through social norms and regulatory rules set by government agencies and exploiters organizations 3 3 the resilience of ses against changes in groundwater volume and public and private rights in terms of groundwater volume resilience the nature of the earth s layers the amount of annual nutrition the ratio of water volume to aquifer volume and extraction rate are considered martin and van de giesen 2005 sandwidi 2007 the tipping point of groundwater volume is where the ratio of groundwater volume to aquifer volume is less than half and the amount of extraction is more than the amount of its nutrition rivers nutrition wetlands rainfall harvest volume subsidence and tectonic layers are important in the dynamics of groundwater volume riverbeds and river transmission networks and tributaries affect the amount of nutrition kebede et al 2021 higher water network density leads to a higher nourishment rate provided that there is optimal rainfall sandwidi 2007 in addition plain surface wetlands are also involved in freshwater nourishment to the aquifer kebede et al 2021 wetland trap running water and continuously direct it to the aquifer land subsidence and aquifer blinding are effective in reducing the amount of groundwater land subsidence and aquifer blinding prevent the infiltration and storage of water and cause water volume to pass through the tipping point apart from the natural factors affecting the groundwater volume extraction as a human factor has a decisive effect on tipping point crossing in many cases the service of the natural system against water extraction is very weak and does not lead to the recovery of the aquifer the issue of groundwater volume and its availability to exploiters depend on aquifer morphology petit et al 2017 the aquifer water volume and fair access to it in bathtub like aquifers are different from egg carton like aquifers this issue becomes important when resistance measures for reducing water abstraction are considered equal for all in bathtub like aquifers different rights are created such as using the egg chamber to reduce the water volume or more cautiously table 1 determining the aquifer morphology can help with the public tragedy and free ride in free flowing aquifers it is far greater than in egg carton like aquifers therefore the same resilient and adaptive measures for all exploiters in cartoon like aquifers make private rights difficult however for bathtub like aquifers it can be useful if the free ride problem is solved groundwater system services against the change of aquifer water volume are self regulatory system elements they include increasing the nourishing role of rivers lakes and wetlands in humid climates and increased aquifer suction sandwidi 2007 in case of groundwater discharge due to the law of fluids and moving elements from dense to low density areas the amount of nourishment from rivers wetlands and lakes will increase on the other hand the absorption rate of the aquifer increases which leads to more freshwater absorption and prevents the passage of the tipping point due to the high dependence of society on groundwater in arid areas the amount of water extraction is done in the highest volume and causes drainage and reduction of water volume in such a society adaptation to water volume reduction by communities above the aquifer seems necessary the issue of aquifer morphology in the process of nourishing by surface and river waters creates different private rights in egg carton like aquifers the water volume in each egg chamber is different from the adjacent egg chamber also the nourishing position with the nourishing sources shows water volume in these chambers differently creating different rights for resistance and adaptation believing in these differences can strengthen the forms of resistance and adaptation in the community above the aquifer and water volume in adaptation to water volume reduction community performance is discussed decrease in urban green spaces runoff collection bigurra alzati et al 2021 change in livelihood less dependence on groundwater expansion of rainfed cultivation and dehydration resistant crops are forms of adaptation to changing water volume land subsidence is another form of aquifer adaptation which occurs through changing the aquifer water volume land subsidence balances the water volume with the aquifer volume and prevents other threats such as water intrusion and salinization in other words land subsidence is a kind of adaptation and resistance to changes in aquifer water volume adaptability through reducing water volume is not the only way to protect and sustain groundwater services and control measures are also essential in the sustainability of water services the issue of compatibility with water volume reduction under the aquifer system poses a problem for public and private rights land subsidence can be the first form of aquifer adaptation to reduced water volume this form of public rights adaptation challenges the protection of water and aquifers and leads to the loss of public rights and future generations however in this case the egg carton like aquifer morphology blomquist 2020 can work differently in addition land subsidence does not have the same destructive effect on all exploiters and influences those whose aquifer egg chamber is destroyed thus similar actions measures for public rights can infringe on the private rights of some exploiters in terms of groundwater system resistance to change in aquifer volume control mechanisms in groundwater volume reduction are investigated these mechanisms include artificial nourishing strict public and government oversight of good drilling and water extraction changes in irrigation system and extraction rules reforms as a set of measures taken by human society to sustain water services bresci and castelli 2021 artificial water nourishing through constructing dams nourishing wells and distributing river water in sub canals throughout the year are the mechanisms that increase the capacity of the groundwater system continuous monitoring by non governmental organizations such as water exploiters and government institutions consumption type and amount impacts proper use of groundwater also changing the irrigation system and creating sprinkler and drip systems play a role in reducing water extraction in addition changing the laws of wells and water extraction liu et al 2017 creating a culture of limited groundwater use and formalizing the issue of groundwater is a finite resource in society can help reduce extraction 3 4 the resilience of the system against groundwater demand and public and private rights water demand is one of the most effective variables in water services and is defined as demand for drinking and economic activities foster and van der gun 2016 molle et al 2018 determining the tipping point of water demand is not possible and probably a matter of course because water demand is not based on water capacity the tipping point of which be the passage of the nourishing capacity population and economic growth have a great impact on water demand population growth has two effects on increasing water demand the demand increases through direct consumption the increase in social welfare and the emergence of new activities such as tourism serrano and borrego marín 2020 emphasis on economic growth via the development of agricultural activities and product exports is effective in two ways in water demand first with the expansion of agricultural exports virtual water water return to the local cycle is delayed petit et al 2017 second it makes livelihoods dependent on the agricultural sector and increases the pressure on water resources water demand pits public rights against private groundwater rights and surface water exploiters against groundwater exploiters the stimuli for water demand originate more from the community due to population growth and increasing welfare and the government increased economic growth and food security to meet comprehensive public needs petit et al 2017 this may lead to surface water transfer to offshore lands delgado et al 2020 by the government for cultivation in response to food security and economic growth and dam construction on rivers due to the increase in water demand these measures cause the rivers to dry up and reduce the water in wetlands which nourishes the aquifer in addition excessive control of surface water causes the lakes to dry up and increases their salinity which in turn increases the salinity of groundwater wastes the rights of groundwater exploiters and protects surface water exploiters in addition it poses a serious challenge to groundwater protection for future generations and reduces the motivation for adaptation resilience and groundwater exploiters determining and measuring the violation culmination of private rights by these measures is very difficult and even impossible however a threshold of concern with guidelines such as reducing river and lake water rights pumping and transfer could be important in this respect adaptation to increasing water demand is done in several ways wang et al 2016 i increasing water extraction from the aquifer ii converting low efficiency activity with more water consumption to high efficiency activity with less consumption turner et al 2019 and iii purifying wastewater and accelerating healthy water circulation the first solution is the easiest way to meet the demand for water which is done by digging wells in some cases the constitution and civil society also help for example in the case of drinking water supply and demand the law removes restrictions and the use of groundwater for drinking is carried out without restrictions nevertheless special restrictions apply to economic activities which are common in public discourse and need no further explanation in this way the access of groundwater exploiters will be challenged in the long run and the future this will lead to public rights processes water protection and costs such as adaptation resistance and self regulation will be imposed on groundwater exploiters the second method is to respond to water demand by changing livelihoods and increasing productivity changing livelihoods to industrial and service activities minimizes the demand for groundwater and prevents it from reaching and exceeding the tipping point in the meantime safe water is provided by ecosystem services providing plenty of safe water through nourishing groundwater by rainwater and snow will be difficult in arid semi arid regions with continuous climate change therefore ecosystem services against water demand alone cannot prevent crossing the tipping point and stabilize water services unless the government and society control the amount of demand with regard to demand control society s actions play a greater role in the sustainability of water services compared to nature demands demand is controlled by reducing population growth and water intensive economic activities turner et al 2019 in the second approach reducing demand is done through punitive and incentive policies true water consumption increasing water productivity and reducing consumption in this approach the protection of stored water by reducing consumption is part of public rights it is debatable how much water is stored due to adaptive actions of nature lovers or whether the amount of water stored by extremist exploitation is not used with new measures in many cases the stored water is pumped to remote areas to create orchards and water farms and there is virtually no protection from stored water this occurs due to two reasons including human greed and unlimited water services and consuming the current rate for society despite changes in activity and productivity growth these two factors make it difficult to move beyond the concept of common tragedy and human inertia in water consumption due to the public tragedy the private rights of communal wells exploiters are more severe than those of private wells exploiters common wells exploiters are likely to sell their stored water rights in the aquifer which is often an ecosystem share and fear of being used by others to surface water exploiters and others or transfer it to other locations for exploitation this violates the rights of private wells exploiters for whom water storage does not make sense but adaptation resistance and self regulation in water protection are related to these bodies continuity of groundwater services depends on monitoring linear dynamics feedback and the self regulation of elements in the adaptive water system changes in groundwater control variables occur through feedback adaptation service and system resistance and include aquifers rivers lakes wetlands and community institutions the role of human society is devoted more attention in considering control and resistance to slow variables community institutions make water services operational through strategic planning hierarchy and prioritization of measures and solutions and determinants of sustainability while maintaining economic social and environmental developments 4 strategic adaptive management of groundwater strategic adaptive management shows self organization feedback and openness of the groundwater system and aims to increase the adaptive capacity and resistance of the groundwater system against slow variable changes in other words strategic adaptive management shows the resilience capacity of system elements against change and linear dynamics of slow variables bouchet et al 2019 strategic adaptive management considers adaptive capacity participation feedback self regulation and openness of the groundwater system through the use of a hierarchy of goals concern thresholds and action based learning and combines resilience structures with different patterns of social institutional and technical knowledge groundwater management uses strategies that change system dynamics at different stages the adaptive management process in the structural learning cycle has four consecutive stages i problem ii policy formulation iii policy implementation and iv monitoring which is used as input for the evaluation stage in the next cycle van der voorn et al 2012 adaptive management uses the resilience capacity to evaluate the dynamics of groundwater elements meuwissen et al 2019 showed the adaptive management path using the flexibility capacity at different stages these steps include the resilience of what resilience to what resilience for what purpose what resilience capacities are and what enhances resilience through these steps adaptive management can control the tipping point by identifying the threshold of concern several issues in strategic adaptive management are important in groundwater governance first the hierarchy of goals and perspectives by stakeholders that may be important in the adaptive management of the groundwater system should be determined to protect water services besides the management structure should be improved to generate public interest in accompanying them second slow and additional system variables such as the worry threshold for the tipping point of elements and water services institutional structure leadership and participation should be determined third management options for technical and financial support must be evaluated fourth there should be monitoring through worry threshold variables finally learning should be accomplished through evaluating management actions and stakeholder information 5 conclusions and recommendations this research highlights the components their functions and potential resilience and provides a framework for the issue of public and private groundwater rights a resilient ses framework can affect water governance in terms of controlling water salinity water demand groundwater volume and water pollution though great caution must be exercised in the ses element resilience against change affects the control variables of public and private rights and may lead to the loss of one of these rights at the expense of the other and participation reduction in water management we have shown that in governing and planning the transition to groundwater stability the ground elements and society must be taken into account in this regard the relationship between these two aspects must be given serious attention in this research in the resilient ses framework we introduced the elements of its sub systems and showed interactive functions and their role in changing public and private rights finally we have several recommendations for groundwater planners in this regard the relationship is the main thread that flows in time and space and is the essence of groundwater system stability for groundwater governance it is important to consider the participation of exploiters and official organizations to protect their rights and interests the tipping point and concern threshold of slow variables salinity pollution water volume and demand challenge private and public rights this is due to the fact that element resilience exacerbates the public tragedy of water consumption groundwater systems have the capacity of self regulation but not necessarily in a way that is responsive to catastrophic human exploitation groundwater systems operate on thresholds with unknown safety margins and eventually reach their tipping point on the other hand human society lives in an invisible state and therefore cannot always recognize cumulative effects this issue can be managed by defining a threshold of concern for the factors influencing groundwater change this study can be useful in mapping the institutional system of water management at the local and regional levels also could guide water exploitation help understand the groundwater crisis and provide a framework for evaluating the performance of institutions and water in ses evolution further studies could examine the relevance of surface water resilience in terms of groundwater rights further research may also investigate the role of a resilient ses in protecting the public and private groundwater ownership and measuring the dynamics of groundwater elements at different stages of the adaptive cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
11788,in groundwater management as a common pool the participation of the beneficiaries faces the problem of free riding therefore it is necessary to provide a framework that can minimize the water public tragedy and free riding this article used studies from around the world to develop a governance framework for the socio ecological and resilience system and express the function of element resilience within this system in protecting groundwater public and private rights the elements of water management were divided into the three sub systems of the aquifer the natural environment and the community above the aquifer and explained how the elements sustain water services through interacting with each other also determined how resilience characteristics of elements against control variables groundwater challenge public and private rights and cause controversy the discussions showed that the elements and resilience of the elements can be different and contradictory to each other and challenge the public and private rights of groundwater which can be very effective in building trust and stakeholder participation in water management the ses framework is used in planning and policy making and determining public and private rights strengthening the resilience of the system and assessing the dynamics of the groundwater system graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer human society groundwater system natural environment public and private rights resilience 1 introduction groundwater is now facing serious problems due to the expansion of agricultural activities population growth and climate change and thus it has become necessary to reconsider the exploitation and management processes numerous management strategies have been recommended regarding the use of groundwater resources these include technology use seed modification and modern irrigation and tillage systems despite the development of these systems worldwide groundwater still encounters reduction pollution and high demands with the advent of the 21st century and establishing the goals of the third millennium of sustainable development attitudes towards water management changed and water management and protection approaches have changed from purely technical strategies to ecological social governance regarding the socio ecological system ses governance of groundwater and sustainable use of resources several theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted in different parts of the world these studies can be divided into two main strands including studies on the use of the ses conceptual framework in water management and those on the development of ses concepts such as resilience concepts delgado et al 2020 used water governance in institutional networks governance tool matrices and conceptual cascades at the national regional provincial and local levels to address accounting financial technical institutional fragmentation and poor coordination issues van der voorn et al 2012 described adaptive management and its combination with participatory management to provide an appropriate framework for tackling climate change in their theoretical framework adaptive management is an approach to policy improvement through learning in this framework adaptation to change lock in breakdown and the gap between monitoring and environmental performance are done in four stages evaluation policy formulation implementation and monitoring according to the position of action petit et al 2017 used a socio ecological framework to understand the collapse of groundwater dependent agricultural economies in this framework understanding collapse is an important principle to manage change and tipping point transition in 2020 blomquist studied groundwater governance and addressed various issues of groundwater rights transfer to introduce the water market as an important strategy in water management in this study the aquifer shape and access level to the amount of water was the main issues of the water rights transfer the ses has contributed to governance in human dependence on nature which improved the cooperation among scientific disciplines methodological diversity and policy frameworks rica et al 2017 rica et al 2017 defined i social economic and political arrangements ii exploiters iii resource systems and iv governance systems as the main elements of ses in water governance analysis in addition the conceptual framework of bouchet et al 2019 is another study on the use of resilient ses and strategic groundwater management the conceptual framework was defined in three formats i ses for water observation ii sustainability and resilience of ses and iii strategic adaptive management or how to use ses in groundwater protection in the ses framework of human societies aquifers and ecosystems simultaneously define the governance structure of the water ses underground aquifers dependent ecosystems and human societies have characteristics dynamic and non linear relationships and open boundaries the openness feature exposes the water governance structure to extrinsic stimuli and the adaptability change and resistance to these stimuli determine the resilience of the structure resilience requires integrating different types of cultural social technical and institutional knowledge strategic adaptive management examines groundwater adaptation and participation in ses through three components goal hierarchy concern threshold and action based learning cumming et al 2020 addressed the institutional aspects of ses governance in balancing individual and group interests to resolve social conflicts and reduce ecological quality in this study the relationship between experience and theory used by institutions in water governance is discussed instead of expanding resource governance variables mathias et al 2020 defined three main features in the ses framework that can be useful in analyzing the transition path from the tipping point the culmination the ecological sub system and the social sub system are the three main features in ses that affect the dynamics of exploiters behavior however sess also has several weaknesses these systems are not helpful in understanding change but provide strong evidence of social and natural interactions bolognesi et al 2018 investigated changes and dynamics of ses s three causal mechanisms including institutional complexity trap difficulty trap and learning process and showed the changes and dynamics from saturation to reorganization groundwater governance is influenced by harding s 1968 public tragedy and human inertia foster and van der gun 2016 which leads to changes in groundwater services water storage water purification and safe water supply in the public tragedy the main issue of exploiters behavior concerning groundwater resources as public resources is based on two theorems first according to the logic of rationality personal interests are probably and generally prioritized over public interests at critical and sensitive times secondly everyone is responsible for his her action and must pay the price operators behavior is unbalanced due to the contradiction and conflict between individual and collective interests free riding competition in water depletion out of sight morphological status amount of water in the aquifer and different proximity of aquifers to threatening and useful elements there is an important issue in using ses to solve groundwater problems the problem is that ses use in water governance is often simplified leading to information loss about elements and biophysical and human interactions cumming et al 2020 in many cases the form of resilience in natural sub systems conflicts with ses social sub systems mathias et al 2020 thus if we consider resilience as the stability of the elements in the groundwater system the forms of adaptation service resistance and the tipping point of the elements in social sub systems conflict with natural sub systems and aquifers this process confronts groundwater governance with legal problems inconsistencies between public and private rights and the interaction of water management institutions this study addresses three key issues that are lacking in groundwater ses resources the first issue is that ses usually shows the general framework for water management but does not specify what elements make up groundwater ses second the available sources do not indicate the elements resilience against changes third in water management the boundary between public and private law is important in stakeholder participation the resilience of ses elements puts stakeholders in different and conflicting positions and may make them hesitant to choose a water service protection strategy possibly minimizing their involvement and enhancing free rides considering the participation of stakeholders in the management and governance of groundwater is very important disclosure of the boundary between public and private rights is also crucial for participation because transparency helps a lot to build trust therefore recognizing the challenges of the border between public and private rights and between the beneficiaries of private exploiters will lead to the wide participation of exploiters in many areas the abuse of public rights versus private rights and the abuse of rights of some private stakeholders over others is very common this article provides a good framework for protecting the rights of private and public stakeholders against each other in addition this text will help planners how to evaluate the change in ses elements given this background this paper aims to i determine the main elements of groundwater ses which have not been adequately addressed in previous research ii demonstrate the resilience pattern of key elements to slow variables and iii point to the important criteria in resolving public and private law issues that lead to stakeholder cooperation in groundwater service protection to achieve these goals in section 1 we define the groundwater ses framework based on adaptive capacity and resilience in section 2 the role and function of the resilience of ses groundwater elements in addressing public and private rights are discussed section 3 elaborates on the strategic adaptive management of groundwater and section 4 presents conclusions and lessons 2 resilience groundwater ses framework and public and private rights mathias et al 2020 addressed tipping points ecological sub systems and social sub systems in the context of ses bouchet et al 2019 studied three aquifer sub systems aquifer above ecosystem and aquifer community rica et al 2017 defined socio economic and political systems as well as exploiters and resource systems in the governance systems of resilient ses in this paper we defined the ses in three sub systems namely the aquifer the aquifer community and the aquifer ecosystem fig 1 we considered ecosystem services adaptation and resilience meuwissen et al 2019 at the local regional and national levels delgado et al 2021 as a framework of resilience resilience can also be assessed in terms of governments markets and social actors delgado et al 2021 this form of resilience assessment would be very useful in identifying governance gaps on the other hand with regard to the use of ses in groundwater governance the resilience of elements against the slow variable s salinity water quality groundwater volume and water demand bouchet et al 2019 taghilou and aftab 2022 of public and private rights blomquist 2020 are analyzed private rights were defined as exploiters access to equal extraction in the long run and to standard and drinkable water with lower salinity public rights included the community s access to the benefits of water exploitation and protection the hierarchy of goals concern thresholds and action based learning at local regional and national levels are used to evaluate the performance of adaptation self regulation and resistance meuwissen et al 2019 and the culmination of ses elements concern thresholds and goal hierarchies are used in adaptive management when there is data uncertainty due to limited data access and diversity complexity and management knowledge van der voorn et al 2017 in addition the mismatch between ecological conditions and management institutions would have existed cumming et al 2006 the hierarchy of goals concern thresholds and action based learning is used to evaluate the performance of adaptation self regulation resilience and the tipping point of elements fig 1 the hierarchy of goals is used when there is no cognitive element in the system and includes short to long term goals that lead to the sustainability of the water system when it is impossible to determine the tipping point of control variables the worry threshold increases capacity and resistance concern thresholds are operational actions and goals that monitor slow variable behavior learning in practice predicts key stimuli van der voorn et al 2012 and better understands the effects of feedback self regulation and system openness on the sustainability of water services learning refers to a set of small experiments to better understand the groundwater system megdal et al 2015 bouchet et al 2019 2 1 elements and function of human society above aquifers in the groundwater system human communities are affected more than the environmental structure of the aquifer and its services exploiters institutions foster and van der gun 2016 mathias et al 2020 and land are the main actors in the structure of human communities fig 1 which are effective in accessing equal extraction of drinkable water drinkable as private rights in addition it plays a role in public access to the benefits of water exploitation and protection as public rights 2 1 1 agricultural exploiters agricultural exploiters are elements in the structure of the community above the aquifer which are effective in the overall system of water governance there are two categories of agricultural exploiters i self exploiters and ii tenants each of these exploiters can have different motivations due to the feeling of groundwater ownership the exploiters try to stabilize its services in the presence of other conditions for example stability of livelihood however the tenants mainly pursue their immediate interests and their extraction rate is higher than the aquifer it is also not invested in water conservation due to a lack of ownership both exploitation groups can be studied in terms of the number and behavior of groundwater the number of exploiters is quantified with high medium and low density in the aquifer the multiplicity of exploiters is tied in several ways to the public tragedy extremist exploiters make it difficult to reach a consensus on water protection and conservation it also increases the potential for drilling wells and pumping water illegally if conditions allow exploiters behavior is another important issue concerning groundwater management mathias et al 2020 named three types of exploitation moderate productive extremist exploiters in the use of resources without considering the interests of others and environmentalist exploiters these exploiters capacity to understand critical conditions and collapse petit et al 2017 is an important step in stabilizing water resources 2 1 2 institution ngos and government agencies at the local and regional levels agricultural and irrigation systems at the local level and constitutions and civil laws related to water at the national level are the most important water governing bodies that regulate discharge through the issuance of drilling permits monitoring and sanctions possibly regulating groundwater ownership rights economical water valuation water distribution and design and consulting irrigation systems have major impacts on the sustainability of groundwater services foster et al 2010 foster and cherlet 2014 foster and van der gun 2016 institutions and communities above groundwater are reorganizing to reduce the destructive effects of trans systemic processes they likely use new irrigation systems purifiers desalination plants artificial recharge and reduced consumption galloway and burbey 2011 seed modification cultivation pattern change rental system change restrictive rules strict monitoring lifestyle changes and institution building a greater number of institutions and their complex relationships mainly determine the role of institutions in groundwater governance bolognesi and nahrath 2020 in addition there is no balance in rights and ecological conditions unless institutions intervene cumming et al 2020 institutions control human interactions based on rules decisions and financial capital that includes government systems from the national to the local level lake and fenner 2019 the multiplicity of incorrect institutions and supplements regarding water management and the complexity of their relationships reduce the coordination of management strategies bolognesi and nahrath 2020 moreover the overlaps and competitions among tasks for management decision making and implementation of water management projects create certain problems or delays in addition such problems confuse the government and exploiters in defining and protecting the public and private rights and challenge people s participation in government initiatives to address the public tragedy and human inertia 2 1 3 land land is another effective element in the sub system of society in this respect the type of its use the size of land ownership and the distribution of arable lands are considered the type of land use directly affects the function and services of the aquifer foster et al 2010 the type of land use in terms of consumption and pollution affects the sustainability of water purification and storage services popa et al 2019 land ownership size is another land feature that affects water abstraction villholth 2013 however land ownership size is directly related to the number of agriculturally dependent populations and groundwater resources small ownership limits the incentive to use new irrigation technology and also increases the dispersion of arable lands in transferring water from one land to another which has a direct effect on water depletion the structural elements of the adaptive groundwater system are constantly exposed to external stimuli such as economic growth crop production policies and food security population growth policies climate change national macro policies and laws in the field of water these stimuli severely alter the elements of the sub systems and affect the quality and quantity of water services population growth emphasis on the development and growth of agricultural products and gdp promotion through exporting agricultural products put additional pressure on groundwater resources followed by the expansion of irrigated lands and the cultivation of commercial crops as a result groundwater consumption increases schwarz and mathijs 2017 this reduces the groundwater level and water quality and increases salinity therefore it is important to study the dynamics and compatibility of system elements against these stimuli regarding the sustainability of water services dynamics and adaptation of groundwater system actors are managed through self regulation self regulation is a process in which the elements adapt to the new conditions to maintain their role and service in the system without external guidance self regulation is done through non linear dynamics and feedback 2 2 elements and function of aquifer sub system the aquifer is a layer of groundwater that occurs in uncompressed layers gravel sand and silt or in stones with interstice and gap thus underground layers blomquist 2020 and pores are the two main elements of aquifer structure xu et al 2013 taghilou and aftab 2022 their function is to purify store and protect water underground layers in addition to being a place to store water also play a role in purifying the flow of surface water the purified water is stored in the pores of the basement layers and forms the basement aquifer the feedback of the subterraneous layer and the pores of the aquifer is important against the changes drainage of water from basement pores and tectonic layers occurs due to the effect of ultra systemic stimuli water absorption from saline water sources such as lakes and land subsidence are the feedback of aquifer elements against water discharge schmid et al 2014 land subsidence is a double edged sword in protecting water services land subsidence on the one hand reduces the aquifer capacity to store and protect water on the other hand blinding the drained pores it prevents the infiltration from the lake saltwater which increases water salinity in general land subsidence reduces freshwater storage space and aquifer reconstruction will not be possible through self regulation or community involvement thus change will occur permanently 2 3 elements and function of natural environment sub system the main function of the natural environment structure is to nourish the aquifer which ensures the sustainability of water services among the environmental elements above the groundwater aquifer the three elements of the river network bed boulton and hancock 2006 the volume and type of rainfall lakes and wetlands have a direct impact on groundwater services kløve et al 2011 human performance affects the two elements in the network of rivers lakes and wetlands in the short term 2 3 1 rivers the width of the riverbed and the number of its branches are effective in nourishing the aquifer allen et al 2004 any amount of river bed with a large width can bring more volume of river water into the aquifers also the high density of river water supplies branches to farms and intensifies the infiltration of water into aquifers in addition the quality and length of rivers transferring water from rivers to farms can bring large volumes of water into the aquifer and be effective in the sustainability of water services 2 3 2 rainfall the volume of water entering the aquifers depends on the type and amount of rainfall snowfall has a higher yield in aquifer nourishment volume compared to rainfall earman and dettinger 2011 because drops are less exposed to evaporation due to sunlight reflection the speed of surface movement and drop transfer is less than that of rain and thus it has more opportunity to penetrate underground jasechko et al 2014 rainfall also determines the nutrition of aquifers consecutive droughts weaken water services as rainfall decreases water productivity and quality will decrease due to aquifer depletion and water purification and freshwater services will be compromised 2 3 3 lakes and wetlands lakes wetlands and other elements of the natural environment above the aquifer play a role in its nutrition kløve et al 2011 taghilou and aftab 2022 the nutrition volume of lakes depends on the amount of opened space in the groundwater aquifers and the adaptation of its layers to aquifer layers upper lakes of the aquifer are directly effective in nutrition and lakes adjacent to aquifers are related to the height of aquifer layers through the height of the lake bed ong 2010 of course the shape of the aquifer layering aquifer depth and aquifer height with the layers adjacent to the lake surface are very effective in the amount of water nutrition from the lake surface in the aquifer if the layers of the lake bed are higher than the aquifer layers the amount of aquifer nutrition from the lake will increase in case there is space and pores in the aquifer layers feedback of surface water network rainfall and lakes are also very important against aquifer drainage determining rainfall feedback volume and type against aquifers is very difficult and even impossible however the feedback of the surface water network and lakes in the groundwater system can be defined considering the amount of their nutrition if drained pores are present the permeability of surface water from rivers increases kalbus et al 2006 and may balance its services however if land subsidence occurs the infiltration of river water into the aquifers reduces yet the issue of lake water entering the aquifers is questionable the reason is that the infiltration of saline water reduces the quality of groundwater zekster 1995 although there are no experiments to prevent subsidence in areas where saline water enters drained aquifers it can be argued that nutrition groundwater by lakes increases salinity but prevents land subsidence this makes it possible for the system to return to its original state if groundwater is nourished with rainwater and snow 3 resilient ses public and private groundwater rights in fig 2 we examine the relationship among resilience concepts ses elements water services public and private laws and slow variables in fig 2 the x axis of the groundwater system potential and the y axis are the temporal trend of change the dark green zone is a stage where ses elements maintain water services through self regulation against slow variables and there is less conflict between public and private water rights the light and the dark yellow zone is the stage where the intensity of the effect of slow variables is higher than the self regulating capacity in this range the compatibility and resistance of human elements to some extent lead to prolonged water service at this stage water resources are limited by increasing demand and change and thus the conflict between public and private interests is formed the self regulation adaptation and resistance of ses elements are likely to create the conditions for a conflict of interest in protection action and challenge the decision of public and private stakeholders to protect water services in the orange zone water services are endangered and the costs of adaptation and resistance of social elements increase in these conflicting circumstances stakeholders take different steps regarding exploitation and protection and the conflict between public and private rights intensifies as a result free riding occurs which is addressed in the following paragraphs in the red zone the system changes completely at this stage the resilience capacities no longer respond to the performance of the slow variables and a new system is formed inspired by the theory of the adaptive cycle of holling 1986 if we consider the water cycle as a complete wheel and it into four quadrants divided each quadrant would contain 25 of the complete wheel so we think ses goes through four stages of groundwater over time thanks to a complete water cycle and water services the first stage makes up 25 of the cycle this stage is in the green range of fig 2 the rate of change at this stage is 25 of water elements and services and this amount of change is compensated by system self regulation the second stage is in the range of light and dark yellow at this stage along with the first stage about 50 of the elements and services change over time through slow variables that can define the threshold of concern in the system at this stage self regulation adaptation and resistance of social elements to slow variables enter the equation and maintain water services for a long time with the accumulation of slow variables the rate of change reaches 75 of water elements and services and the differences and contradictions of groundwater due to resilience create conditions for conflict of interest in protection action and challenge stakeholders to choose a strategy this stage is mainly located in the orange area finally the slow variables due to exponential accumulation overcome the resilience strategies and act like a coil purple zone causing ses to pass the tipping point and changing almost 100 of the aquifer red zone 3 1 the resilience of the system against water salinity and public and private rights with regard to groundwater ownership rights recognizing and determining the amount and type of resilience of slow variables and their role in maintaining public and private groundwater ownership is important to determine the tipping point of variables and prevent them from reaching the tipping point is not an easy task biggs et al 2015 due to different affecting stimuli and factors the tipping point of water salinity varies in different uses for example drinking washing and agriculture groundwater resilience keeps demand stable for different uses for example ec more than 1000 us cm has 100 demand less than 5000 us cm 50 90 demand and ec more than 10 000 us cm with 25 demand until water services change and the demands reaches zero bouchet et al 2019 the tipping point of groundwater salinity is affected by two intrinsic and extrinsic natural factors of the system the inflow of saline water into the aquifer increases the salinity by changing the bed of nourish rivers and reducing the freshwater infiltration due to drought therefore the aquifer salinity may exceed the tipping point and affect boundaries of public rights and private rights saline water can be expected to enter from the lake shores and far from the shoreline where it acts as possible water salinity due to direct rainfall and runoff morad et al 2014 it is very difficult to measure the amount of saline water entering the aquifer but it can be obtained using the salinity ratio of lake water to groundwater provided that the salinity of the lake water is constantly evaluated it is also possible to define and calculate the threshold of concern for salinity by measuring the density of rivers and their discharge to the plain area two human factors also affect water salinity changes and the tipping point crossing excessive use of chemical fertilizers repetition of one type of cultivation and non observance of fallow increase the salinity of water entering the aquifer the use of chemical fertilizers and successive cultivation increases the ec and ph of the soil which increases the aquifer salinity through secondary inlet water due to irrigation in aquifers rao 2008 measuring the amount of fertilizer application and successive cultivation in the plains and their role in groundwater pollution is easier than considering the role of lakes and rivers the amount of fertilizer used during the year and the area of fallow land relative to the total land area indicate the salinization capacity of groundwater groundwater salinization rate is not the same in all geographical parts of aquifers and varies in terms of volume and time between coastlines and central plains the volume and rate of salinization in shorelines is higher than in offshore areas which causes unfair access to freshwater aquifers therefore the exploiters of wells along the rivers have better access to fresh groundwater compared to other parts of plains of course this occurs when the aquifer bed is like a tub otherwise the rate of salinization will be different this issue was shown by gs cumming et al 2020 in determining private rights for the water market the difference in the geography of groundwater salinization the support and participation of exploiters in the plain interior and the river shoreline in water conservation measures will reduce water compared to the salinization areas it should be noted that these exploiters have an equal share in salinization fig 2 in groundwater system services against salinity variables self regulation of system elements at the local level is discussed self regulation of system elements includes the entrance of large volumes of surface water rivers and lagoons into the aquifer morad et al 2014 however land subsidence and blinding evacuated spaces due to water discharge is the self regulatory mechanism of the ecosystem against saline water entrance although land subsidence reduces the volume of the aquifer it prevents saline water entrance into the upper layers and then into the lower layers of the aquifer another form of self regulation includes the entrance of large water volumes from wetlands and rivers into the empty pores of the aquifer evacuated spaces due to groundwater extraction increase the nutrition capacity according to the law of fluid flow from a high pressure area to a low pressure area if there is fresh water the water of wetlands and rivers flows quickly with a large volume into the space of the aquifer and prevents complete changes in water services self regulation of the aquifer system puts the extent and boundaries of public and private groundwater rights in a different state freshwater suction of wetlands and rivers by aquifers puts unbalanced access to quality water and water extraction capacity in the areas close to wetlands and rivers the amount and quality of water is more favorable than other aquifer areas and the exploiters in these areas have favorable access and proper production compared to those far from these areas table 1 this can be due to the operation of other elements in the groundwater system groundwater self regulation plays a favorable role in determining the fair rights of exploiters when the poor performance of other elements is minimized this is the time when no water abstraction is done for several years until the groundwater level in all parts of the plain reaches a balanced static level which seems far from logic and rationality therefore due to the dependence of aquifer self regulation on other elements functions it seems difficult to assess its effect on water rights in these cases water governance institutions with short term and medium term goals can evaluate their role in water rights the relationship between rivers and groundwater is complicated petit et al 2017 surface water exploiters are less likely to help improve groundwater and take steps to repair groundwater of course this is a possibility and can be evaluated by defining short term goals investment incentives in surface water management are power relations rica et al 2017 and capital reconstruction one reason is that water transfer projects such as the construction of dams canals and diversion dams are implemented in surface water and cause a redistribution of wealth and profit generation for water companies according to the logic of capitalism the interests of groundwater exploiters are usually not considered an investment in addition transferring river water in concrete pipes and canals to increase the speed of water transfer and reduce water loss is one of the first and simple measures used by surface water exploiters that challenge the interests of groundwater dependent farmers blomquist 2020 these measures contradict the benefits of groundwater exploiters and aquifer protection which in turn leads to non participation of groundwater exploiters in conserving water projects and controlling water transition from the tipping points such conditions encourage a free riding process among groundwater exploiters the main issue in adapting the system to the salinity variable is to change the pattern of groundwater use and reduce water use the salinity range is different from freshwater with 100 consumption demand to ec above 10 000 us cm with zero consumption demand the type of saline water use varies from irrigation of saline plants motallebian et al 2019 to toilets baths etc another type of adaptation is to reduce dependence on groundwater resources by changing livelihood that occurs by people society and government habiba et al 2014 although no experimental study has been done on livelihood diversification to show the relationship between livelihood change and groundwater salinity reduction it can be inferred that water dependence can be reduced by decreasing its dependence on agriculture this is the case as water salinity further threatens the agricultural sector and livelihoods substitution of activities in human society reduces dependence on groundwater and water extraction the ratio of people with income and jobs to groundwater compared to those above the aquifer annually or every few years and the ratio of the number of environmentally friendly exploiters to balanced and extremist exploiters are guidelines that can determine the level of groundwater salinity and threshold of concern the issue of adaptation to water salinity and its relevance to water rights is complex highlighting the public tragedy and disrespect for rights more than any other dimension of resilience as table 1 shows human adaptation to water salinity is not the same as system self regulation exploiters adaptation to the salinity tipping point revives free riding farmers are more adaptable to extrinsic shocks such as the economic crisis population growth food demand and climate change than to groundwater salinity this form of adaptation is often at odds with self regulation and the adaptation of the natural elements in the groundwater system adaptation to water salinity is mainly associated with changing the pattern of cultivation or transfer of water to valuable crops changing livelihoods and reducing groundwater dependent activity usually in these cases the exploiters try to use the capacities created by others and reduce salinity with the help of other exploiters in such situations understanding the crisis and learning in practice can reduce the intensity of free riding petit et al 2017 and protect the public and private rights in terms of resistance to changing water services the control of salinity variables and effective factors are examined artificial groundwater nourishing preventing saline water infiltration into the aquifer saline water purification reducing the use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture foster et al 2018 and reforming groundwater laws are the most important measures for the sustainability of water services also by creating and protecting open spaces observing the privacy of wetlands and preventing the change in pasture uses which are water supply holes in the plain the capacity of water infiltration into the aquifer is expanded also improving riverbeds can increase groundwater recharge and quality resistance to the transition from the salinity tipping point is done by the exploiters and is a form of resilience that does not work well in protecting individuals privacy rights this form of resilience is accompanied by adaptation to the issue of public tragedy and free riding more resistance is done by environmental exploiters which is less or never noticed by extremist exploiters in this form the resilience of the salting rights of environmentally friendly and somewhat balanced exploiters is transferred to extremist exploiters at no cost the form of government authority at the national level limits laws against water salinization enacting the actions of exploiters to protect water government actions often do not consider the salting rights and exploiter types and restrictive actions are likely to be carried out regardless of differences this causes some exploiters not to take resistance and participatory measures against water salinization 3 2 system resilience against changing water quality and public and private rights the tipping point of groundwater pollution is the case when water is not drinkable in agriculture it increases soil porosity and moisture loss several intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the system cause groundwater pollution municipal and industrial solid wastes petroleum hydrocarbons pollution of toxic elements such as arsenic and nitrate are sources of groundwater pollution caused by human activities above groundwater aquifers li et al 2020 water pollution deprives the public of the benefits of exploiting groundwater table 1 the system shows a certain dynamism against these contaminants and makes changes in itself to protect the water meanwhile testing the level of groundwater pollution at consecutive times is the guideline that shows the trend of pollution change by contrast determining the tipping point of pollution factors such as municipal and industrial solid waste petroleum hydrocarbons pollution heavy metals such as arsenic and nitrate is difficult and complex and a concern threshold can be used for these factors the amount of polluting waste production compared to non polluting water and treated wastewater compared to untreated water is a threshold of concern for some pollutants that express changes in water quality in ecosystem services against pollution self regulation of aquifer elements and natural environment and society are discussed the service of aquifer layers against pollution is the purification of contaminated water entering the aquifer aquifer layers and their components absorb large amounts of pollutants such as metals and organic matter as water enters the aquifer and prevents pollution balke and zhu 2008 in addition the riverbed with its constituents mainly prevents contaminated water entrance into the aquifer rivers engage the water with oxygen before it enters the aquifer and reduces the amount of pollution tian et al 2011 nonetheless community service against pollution is the purification of polluted water municipal and industrial wastewater is treated by purifiers before returning to nature and entering the aquifer li et al 2020 and delays the passage of water pollution tipping point or possibly prevents that of tipping point changes in services in some cases the speed and rate of pollution are higher than those of ecosystem services which necessitates changes in use by human society the main issue is the type of human community services to the aquifer that may not be done directly polluted water purification is not mainly for groundwater in simpler terms unpurified groundwater is provided for exploiters and this form of service is mainly for wastewater and pollution causes not groundwater pollution this deprives groundwater exploiters of the benefits of water purification and access to treated groundwater this is a fundamental issue concerning the private rights of groundwater exploiters in the short term in the long term it helps reduce groundwater pollution provided that other elements of pollution namely the use of chemical fertilizers are reduced in addition the purification of pollutants concerning public rights is very effective and can be useful in protecting groundwater and surface water in the long term therefore water purification services effectively balance public and private rights adaptability with water pollution is rather impossible and cannot sustain groundwater services but it is necessary to control and manage water pollution with regard to resistance to pollution variables controlling pollutant sources is of paramount importance groundwater pollution sources are point linear and surface surface contamination is done by agriculture using pesticides and chemical fertilizers municipal and industrial wastewater and landfill are point sources of pollution and polluted rivers cause linear pollution due to the combination of riverbed waste and sewage leading to rivers therefore groundwater service sustainability against pollution and less changes in groundwater services would be increased by controlling these pollutant sources through strict monitoring by public institutions rajaram and das 2008 and government policy shortle and dunn 1986 in polluted water purification the sustainability of groundwater services would be intensified by using natural purifiers uses such as converting lands from agriculture to forests and grassland and preventing a change of natural uses and encroachment on river basins and water pollution laws these laws include the issuance of pollution licenses for farmers factory owners and municipalities another issue in pollution is that not all groundwater exploiters are the source of pollution and the cause of pollution outside the aquifer destroys the rights of exploiters and complicates their relationships some exploiters may take steps to reduce pollution and others may not be willing to adapt to pollution resistance measures due to outside contamination sources therefore the extent of groundwater pollution sources raises the issue of free riding more limited contamination sources can control the free ride phenomenon through social norms and regulatory rules set by government agencies and exploiters organizations 3 3 the resilience of ses against changes in groundwater volume and public and private rights in terms of groundwater volume resilience the nature of the earth s layers the amount of annual nutrition the ratio of water volume to aquifer volume and extraction rate are considered martin and van de giesen 2005 sandwidi 2007 the tipping point of groundwater volume is where the ratio of groundwater volume to aquifer volume is less than half and the amount of extraction is more than the amount of its nutrition rivers nutrition wetlands rainfall harvest volume subsidence and tectonic layers are important in the dynamics of groundwater volume riverbeds and river transmission networks and tributaries affect the amount of nutrition kebede et al 2021 higher water network density leads to a higher nourishment rate provided that there is optimal rainfall sandwidi 2007 in addition plain surface wetlands are also involved in freshwater nourishment to the aquifer kebede et al 2021 wetland trap running water and continuously direct it to the aquifer land subsidence and aquifer blinding are effective in reducing the amount of groundwater land subsidence and aquifer blinding prevent the infiltration and storage of water and cause water volume to pass through the tipping point apart from the natural factors affecting the groundwater volume extraction as a human factor has a decisive effect on tipping point crossing in many cases the service of the natural system against water extraction is very weak and does not lead to the recovery of the aquifer the issue of groundwater volume and its availability to exploiters depend on aquifer morphology petit et al 2017 the aquifer water volume and fair access to it in bathtub like aquifers are different from egg carton like aquifers this issue becomes important when resistance measures for reducing water abstraction are considered equal for all in bathtub like aquifers different rights are created such as using the egg chamber to reduce the water volume or more cautiously table 1 determining the aquifer morphology can help with the public tragedy and free ride in free flowing aquifers it is far greater than in egg carton like aquifers therefore the same resilient and adaptive measures for all exploiters in cartoon like aquifers make private rights difficult however for bathtub like aquifers it can be useful if the free ride problem is solved groundwater system services against the change of aquifer water volume are self regulatory system elements they include increasing the nourishing role of rivers lakes and wetlands in humid climates and increased aquifer suction sandwidi 2007 in case of groundwater discharge due to the law of fluids and moving elements from dense to low density areas the amount of nourishment from rivers wetlands and lakes will increase on the other hand the absorption rate of the aquifer increases which leads to more freshwater absorption and prevents the passage of the tipping point due to the high dependence of society on groundwater in arid areas the amount of water extraction is done in the highest volume and causes drainage and reduction of water volume in such a society adaptation to water volume reduction by communities above the aquifer seems necessary the issue of aquifer morphology in the process of nourishing by surface and river waters creates different private rights in egg carton like aquifers the water volume in each egg chamber is different from the adjacent egg chamber also the nourishing position with the nourishing sources shows water volume in these chambers differently creating different rights for resistance and adaptation believing in these differences can strengthen the forms of resistance and adaptation in the community above the aquifer and water volume in adaptation to water volume reduction community performance is discussed decrease in urban green spaces runoff collection bigurra alzati et al 2021 change in livelihood less dependence on groundwater expansion of rainfed cultivation and dehydration resistant crops are forms of adaptation to changing water volume land subsidence is another form of aquifer adaptation which occurs through changing the aquifer water volume land subsidence balances the water volume with the aquifer volume and prevents other threats such as water intrusion and salinization in other words land subsidence is a kind of adaptation and resistance to changes in aquifer water volume adaptability through reducing water volume is not the only way to protect and sustain groundwater services and control measures are also essential in the sustainability of water services the issue of compatibility with water volume reduction under the aquifer system poses a problem for public and private rights land subsidence can be the first form of aquifer adaptation to reduced water volume this form of public rights adaptation challenges the protection of water and aquifers and leads to the loss of public rights and future generations however in this case the egg carton like aquifer morphology blomquist 2020 can work differently in addition land subsidence does not have the same destructive effect on all exploiters and influences those whose aquifer egg chamber is destroyed thus similar actions measures for public rights can infringe on the private rights of some exploiters in terms of groundwater system resistance to change in aquifer volume control mechanisms in groundwater volume reduction are investigated these mechanisms include artificial nourishing strict public and government oversight of good drilling and water extraction changes in irrigation system and extraction rules reforms as a set of measures taken by human society to sustain water services bresci and castelli 2021 artificial water nourishing through constructing dams nourishing wells and distributing river water in sub canals throughout the year are the mechanisms that increase the capacity of the groundwater system continuous monitoring by non governmental organizations such as water exploiters and government institutions consumption type and amount impacts proper use of groundwater also changing the irrigation system and creating sprinkler and drip systems play a role in reducing water extraction in addition changing the laws of wells and water extraction liu et al 2017 creating a culture of limited groundwater use and formalizing the issue of groundwater is a finite resource in society can help reduce extraction 3 4 the resilience of the system against groundwater demand and public and private rights water demand is one of the most effective variables in water services and is defined as demand for drinking and economic activities foster and van der gun 2016 molle et al 2018 determining the tipping point of water demand is not possible and probably a matter of course because water demand is not based on water capacity the tipping point of which be the passage of the nourishing capacity population and economic growth have a great impact on water demand population growth has two effects on increasing water demand the demand increases through direct consumption the increase in social welfare and the emergence of new activities such as tourism serrano and borrego marín 2020 emphasis on economic growth via the development of agricultural activities and product exports is effective in two ways in water demand first with the expansion of agricultural exports virtual water water return to the local cycle is delayed petit et al 2017 second it makes livelihoods dependent on the agricultural sector and increases the pressure on water resources water demand pits public rights against private groundwater rights and surface water exploiters against groundwater exploiters the stimuli for water demand originate more from the community due to population growth and increasing welfare and the government increased economic growth and food security to meet comprehensive public needs petit et al 2017 this may lead to surface water transfer to offshore lands delgado et al 2020 by the government for cultivation in response to food security and economic growth and dam construction on rivers due to the increase in water demand these measures cause the rivers to dry up and reduce the water in wetlands which nourishes the aquifer in addition excessive control of surface water causes the lakes to dry up and increases their salinity which in turn increases the salinity of groundwater wastes the rights of groundwater exploiters and protects surface water exploiters in addition it poses a serious challenge to groundwater protection for future generations and reduces the motivation for adaptation resilience and groundwater exploiters determining and measuring the violation culmination of private rights by these measures is very difficult and even impossible however a threshold of concern with guidelines such as reducing river and lake water rights pumping and transfer could be important in this respect adaptation to increasing water demand is done in several ways wang et al 2016 i increasing water extraction from the aquifer ii converting low efficiency activity with more water consumption to high efficiency activity with less consumption turner et al 2019 and iii purifying wastewater and accelerating healthy water circulation the first solution is the easiest way to meet the demand for water which is done by digging wells in some cases the constitution and civil society also help for example in the case of drinking water supply and demand the law removes restrictions and the use of groundwater for drinking is carried out without restrictions nevertheless special restrictions apply to economic activities which are common in public discourse and need no further explanation in this way the access of groundwater exploiters will be challenged in the long run and the future this will lead to public rights processes water protection and costs such as adaptation resistance and self regulation will be imposed on groundwater exploiters the second method is to respond to water demand by changing livelihoods and increasing productivity changing livelihoods to industrial and service activities minimizes the demand for groundwater and prevents it from reaching and exceeding the tipping point in the meantime safe water is provided by ecosystem services providing plenty of safe water through nourishing groundwater by rainwater and snow will be difficult in arid semi arid regions with continuous climate change therefore ecosystem services against water demand alone cannot prevent crossing the tipping point and stabilize water services unless the government and society control the amount of demand with regard to demand control society s actions play a greater role in the sustainability of water services compared to nature demands demand is controlled by reducing population growth and water intensive economic activities turner et al 2019 in the second approach reducing demand is done through punitive and incentive policies true water consumption increasing water productivity and reducing consumption in this approach the protection of stored water by reducing consumption is part of public rights it is debatable how much water is stored due to adaptive actions of nature lovers or whether the amount of water stored by extremist exploitation is not used with new measures in many cases the stored water is pumped to remote areas to create orchards and water farms and there is virtually no protection from stored water this occurs due to two reasons including human greed and unlimited water services and consuming the current rate for society despite changes in activity and productivity growth these two factors make it difficult to move beyond the concept of common tragedy and human inertia in water consumption due to the public tragedy the private rights of communal wells exploiters are more severe than those of private wells exploiters common wells exploiters are likely to sell their stored water rights in the aquifer which is often an ecosystem share and fear of being used by others to surface water exploiters and others or transfer it to other locations for exploitation this violates the rights of private wells exploiters for whom water storage does not make sense but adaptation resistance and self regulation in water protection are related to these bodies continuity of groundwater services depends on monitoring linear dynamics feedback and the self regulation of elements in the adaptive water system changes in groundwater control variables occur through feedback adaptation service and system resistance and include aquifers rivers lakes wetlands and community institutions the role of human society is devoted more attention in considering control and resistance to slow variables community institutions make water services operational through strategic planning hierarchy and prioritization of measures and solutions and determinants of sustainability while maintaining economic social and environmental developments 4 strategic adaptive management of groundwater strategic adaptive management shows self organization feedback and openness of the groundwater system and aims to increase the adaptive capacity and resistance of the groundwater system against slow variable changes in other words strategic adaptive management shows the resilience capacity of system elements against change and linear dynamics of slow variables bouchet et al 2019 strategic adaptive management considers adaptive capacity participation feedback self regulation and openness of the groundwater system through the use of a hierarchy of goals concern thresholds and action based learning and combines resilience structures with different patterns of social institutional and technical knowledge groundwater management uses strategies that change system dynamics at different stages the adaptive management process in the structural learning cycle has four consecutive stages i problem ii policy formulation iii policy implementation and iv monitoring which is used as input for the evaluation stage in the next cycle van der voorn et al 2012 adaptive management uses the resilience capacity to evaluate the dynamics of groundwater elements meuwissen et al 2019 showed the adaptive management path using the flexibility capacity at different stages these steps include the resilience of what resilience to what resilience for what purpose what resilience capacities are and what enhances resilience through these steps adaptive management can control the tipping point by identifying the threshold of concern several issues in strategic adaptive management are important in groundwater governance first the hierarchy of goals and perspectives by stakeholders that may be important in the adaptive management of the groundwater system should be determined to protect water services besides the management structure should be improved to generate public interest in accompanying them second slow and additional system variables such as the worry threshold for the tipping point of elements and water services institutional structure leadership and participation should be determined third management options for technical and financial support must be evaluated fourth there should be monitoring through worry threshold variables finally learning should be accomplished through evaluating management actions and stakeholder information 5 conclusions and recommendations this research highlights the components their functions and potential resilience and provides a framework for the issue of public and private groundwater rights a resilient ses framework can affect water governance in terms of controlling water salinity water demand groundwater volume and water pollution though great caution must be exercised in the ses element resilience against change affects the control variables of public and private rights and may lead to the loss of one of these rights at the expense of the other and participation reduction in water management we have shown that in governing and planning the transition to groundwater stability the ground elements and society must be taken into account in this regard the relationship between these two aspects must be given serious attention in this research in the resilient ses framework we introduced the elements of its sub systems and showed interactive functions and their role in changing public and private rights finally we have several recommendations for groundwater planners in this regard the relationship is the main thread that flows in time and space and is the essence of groundwater system stability for groundwater governance it is important to consider the participation of exploiters and official organizations to protect their rights and interests the tipping point and concern threshold of slow variables salinity pollution water volume and demand challenge private and public rights this is due to the fact that element resilience exacerbates the public tragedy of water consumption groundwater systems have the capacity of self regulation but not necessarily in a way that is responsive to catastrophic human exploitation groundwater systems operate on thresholds with unknown safety margins and eventually reach their tipping point on the other hand human society lives in an invisible state and therefore cannot always recognize cumulative effects this issue can be managed by defining a threshold of concern for the factors influencing groundwater change this study can be useful in mapping the institutional system of water management at the local and regional levels also could guide water exploitation help understand the groundwater crisis and provide a framework for evaluating the performance of institutions and water in ses evolution further studies could examine the relevance of surface water resilience in terms of groundwater rights further research may also investigate the role of a resilient ses in protecting the public and private groundwater ownership and measuring the dynamics of groundwater elements at different stages of the adaptive cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

11789,the prevalence of emerging contaminants ecs in wastewaters is troublesome because of their widespread and persistent nature posing a threat to living organisms when exposed for prolonged durations we conducted an extensive literature assessment for this study to present the overall global status of the occurrence of ecs regardless of their class by compiling relevant publications from the previous decade the most commonly investigated category were pharmaceuticals particularly antibiotics and anti inflammatories analgesics personal care products pcps and industrial chemicals idc the most concentrated compounds in the global influents and effluents were acetaminophen 500 μg l an analgesic and saccharine 379 μg l an artificial sweetener reported from canada and india respectively irrespective of its prevalence the presence of artificial sweeteners asws surfactants etc in wastewaters have often been overlooked most of the sub classes exhibited minor to moderate elimination efficiency with anti diabetic drugs showing the highest among all however insignificant changes artificial sweeteners phthalates etc and negative removal anti depressants anti psychotics etc were also observed furthermore caffeine ampicillin and trimethoprim were reported at extremely high concentrations in india than in the rest of the world irgasan benzothiazoles sparfloxacin etc were also quite predominant in india which has yet to be recorded in any other country therefore the universally implemented conventional approaches are incapable of total elimination for all ecs hence the traditional methods should be paired with the advanced techniques that have shown positive removal for certain ecs which can be a promising solution to this problem these findings will aid in establishing which classes and compounds demand immediate attention for further investigation and monitoring allowing water managers to take necessary measures to reduce pollutant levels at the source and develop water protection policies graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging contaminants wastewater wastewater treatment plants pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners saccharine 1 introduction water is a vital natural resource that supports aquatic biota and is utilized for various purposes including industrial processes agricultural activities and human consumption despite being indispensable water resources have been subjected to constant anthropogenic pressure resulting in severe pollution and posing a threat to water security for the growing population that relies on it acuña et al 2015 yusuf et al 2021 to address this issue wastewater treatment plants wwtps were developed to remove and destroy harmful contaminants of various sizes and chemical physical and biological properties from sewage generated from several sources acting as a barrier between the toxic substances and the natural environment however the existing literature indicates the presence of certain toxic chemicals in the treated wastewaters cukierman et al 2019 rout et al 2021 owing to the existing wwtps operating on conventional processes these wwtps are unequipped to eliminate these contaminants that are now being considered critical for ecosystems and human health chaturvedi et al 2021 karpińska and kotowska 2021 khazri et al 2019 mukhopadhyay et al 2022 ripanda et al 2021 yadav

contaminants or reduce their concentration to ecologically acceptable levels before being discharged to the water bodies this category of contaminants is termed emerging contaminants ecs or contaminants of emerging concern the ecs are mostly synthetic or natural compounds originating primarily from anthropogenic activities released from various products of different families used widely noutsopoulos et al 2019 valsecchi et al 2015 exhibiting diverse chemical properties soulier et al 2016 some commonly reported contaminants originate from pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides industrial chemicals veterinary drugs illicit drugs etc in contrast other naturally occurring compounds such as hormones sterols and amino acids are excreted by humans and animals tong et al 2022 which are included in the ecs list they occur in trace amounts nanograms to micrograms per liter and remain undetected during the wastewater treatment process noguera oviedo and aga 2016 their complex nature also makes its detection a challenging task their ubiquitous occurrence in various environmental compartments particularly in wastewaters khan et al 2022 and organisms tissues exhibits varying concentrations depending on the population density land use water consumption pattern sampling period wastewater source sewer and treatment units conditions etc chen et al 2019 patel et al

contaminants also transform due to several natural or wastewater treatment processes arman et al 2021 dévier et al 2011 forming more complex and toxic products many of which remain unidentified richardson 2003 and their additive impacts on ecosystems are yet to be ascertained the physicochemical characteristics of the environmental media govern their fate and persistence which remains to be poorly understood biošić et al 2021 although a substantial amount of research has been conducted to comprehend the environmental implications of individual contaminants necibi et al 2021 their long term impacts are still untouched most of the ecs lack regulatory guidelines and are not included in routine monitoring programs ripanda et al 2021 which is highly concerning a few organizations have established statutory guidelines for a very small proportion of ecs frequently detected in aqueous environments moreover these guidelines are not strictly followed due to inadequate knowledge of their occurrence behavior fate and impacts european parliament proposed the inclusion of ecs under the priority substances list commision of the european communities 2006 similarly the united states environmental protection agency usepa has also added certain ecs to the list of priority substances revised every five years us epa 2017 furthermore usepa declared organophosphate flame retardants to be highly hazardous thus highlighting the need for thorough research on their impacts us epa 2015 likewise european union eu world health organization who and australian drinking water guidelines have also provided regulations for maximum permissible limits for a few ecs mostly belonging to the pharmaceutical class australian guidelines for water recycling 2008 eu 2008 us epa 2015 the norman network of reference laboratories research centers and related organizations for monitoring of emerging environmental substances network was created to track this group of contaminants brack et al 2012 that has identified more than a thousand chemical compounds geissen et al 2015 many conventional wwtps use the biological approach which reveals the improper elimination of ecs because of their high resistance to microbial activity rathi et al 2021 the conventional methods are often integrated with advanced techniques involving membrane and oxidation processes to enhance the removal efficiency despite superior efficacy higher energy demands overpriced nature and generation of new wastes are some of the significant drawbacks of the advanced techniques gogoi et al 2018 karpińska and kotowska 2021 parida et al 2021 nevertheless some compounds successfully escape the treatment phases and find their way into the receiving environments particularly surface water bodies through the effluents therefore wwtps are the primary point sources and other diffused sources such as untreated wastewater storm water runoff from urban and rural areas and leaching from agricultural lands and landfills which also contribute to these contaminants to the natural environment inostroza et al 2016 most of the research has been restricted to a specific class or geographical location contaminants other than pharmaceuticals and personal care products are relatively less reviewed and hence this comprehensive analysis aims to fill this knowledge gap this work is the first ever attempt at compiling information about all the ecs irrespective of their types and concentration levels to the best of our knowledge all the relevant information regarding the occurrence sources fate concentration levels and impacts of contaminants in wastewater effluents reported during the last decade have been collected compiled and analyzed accordingly the analysis will provide an overall picture of the prominent contaminants in global wastewaters furthermore multi class monitoring of ecs are missing on a broader spectrum resulting in scarce information from an indian perspective therefore a comparison between the concentrations of contaminants in india and worldwide was also performed to gain a deeper understanding of the status of ecs in indian wastewaters this will facilitate identifying the contaminants that are a possible ecological threat and would require immediate attention for their removal from wastewaters in the indian context 2 sources and fate of emerging contaminants in the environment the addition of ecs into the natural environment from diverse sources is a never ending process and can be categorized into two major classes direct discharge of these chemicals through effluents of wwtps receiving sewage from industries households and hospitals are recognized as point sources fig 1 ecs can also enter the environment through various non point sources including agricultural and urban runoff leakage from septic tanks leaching sludge application on farms etc rout et al 2021 monitoring the release of these toxic chemicals through non point sources is relatively more complex than the point sources among all the mentioned sources households are of utmost importance as they release most of the compounds belonging to pharmaceuticals and personal care products a meager amount of the medicines consumed is metabolized in the human body at the same time the remaining unmetabolized portion is excreted via urine and feces and ultimately released into the natural environment via treated effluent streams rout et al 2021 being exceptionally polar and water soluble pharmaceutically active compounds phacs tend to have a higher residence time in the receiving environments behera et al 2011 patel et al 2019 dumping unused and expired medicines from health care centers and hospitals is a common practice rathi et al 2021 furthermore wastewaters from pharmaceutical industries are also major contributors to phacs barbosa et al 2016 likewise the administration of pharmaceutical drugs in livestock rearing animal healthcare etc are also potential sources of these chemicals in the environment rathi et al 2021 antibacterial and antifungal compounds uv filters etc are released from personal care products pcps routinely used by humans and have been quantified at exceedingly high levels in several nations affirming their global predominance in the aqueous environments amdany et al 2014 archana et al 2017 similar to pharmaceuticals the available literature also revealed pcps emanating from manufacturing units barbosa et al 2016 likewise artificial sweeteners are primarily used as a substitute for sugar in various human and animal food products that have also been detected at significant concentrations subedi et al 2015 tran et al 2015 2019 industrial and commercial chemicals such as flame retardants and plasticizers are widely used and can reach different environmental matrices through leaching volatilization runoff etc kim et al 2017 parida et al 2021 apart from these synthetic chemicals naturally occurring compounds such as amino acids excreted from human and animal bodies have also been considered ecs due to their large numbers and exceptionally high levels in the wastewaters gago ferrero et al 2020 after being discharged into the surface waters these toxic compounds follow various pathways and reach different environmental matrices such as soil groundwater drinking water etc however their concentration alters in different aquatic environments influenced by several factors seasonality is one of the factors that play a substantial role in determining the environmental concentrations of the ecs for example uv filters detected in the summer months are higher than in other seasons petrie et al 2015 similarly the consumption of certain pharmaceutical drugs is higher during winter due to seasonal illnesses thereby resulting in greater concentrations kim et al 2017 generally conventional wwtps are employed worldwide with primary and secondary methods involved in treating organic matter and nutrients from sewage at times an additional tertiary step might also be involved ecs adsorb onto the sludge that is essentially removed in the primary stage of the treatment to some extent the secondary step involves biological degradation which has shown relatively higher removal efficiency of up to 70 than 50 in the case of the primary stage whereas the occasionally employed tertiary treatment processes have demonstrated the highest efficacy in removing the ecs from incoming sewages luo et al 2014 tiwari et al 2017 tran et al 2018 furthermore an increase in the contaminant concentration after treatment has also been observed in some instances which could be due to the transformation of conjugates forming parent compounds through enzymatic cleavage gracia lor et al 2012a kosma et al 2014 singh et al 2014 these contaminants also undergo a biological or chemical transformation forming novel more complex toxic and persistent strains than their parent compounds gogoi et al 2018 3 impacts of emerging contaminants 3 1 impacts on aquatic life the aquatic ecosystems are the first to be exposed to ecs and are highly susceptible to its toxicity due to prolonged exposure planktons and invertebrates play a crucial part in ecosystem functioning and the food web macrofauna relies on planktons at the bottom of the aquatic food chain especially zooplanktons to meet their food requirements therefore any kind of toxicity exerted by these contaminants on lower level species can collapse the entire ecosystem sub lethal concentrations of diltiazem a pharmaceutical drug increased the heart rate and offspring s size with a reduction in their numbers resulting in a population decline of daphnia magna steinkey et al 2019 chemicals derived from pcps and pharmaceutical drugs bioaccumulated in mussels tissues which on exposure for more extended periods can modify the immune system lipid metabolism etc kookana et al 2013 mezzelani et al 2018 similarly due to its prevalence in aquatic environments caffeine induced negative impacts on the gills of mytilus californianus mussels at the molecular level del rey et al 2011 other studies have also indicated alterations in physical sexual genetic and reproductive traits in higher level organisms such as fishes gauthier and vijayan 2020 mcgovarin et al 2018 raut et al 2011 vidal dorsch et al 2013 alterations in animal behavior on exposure to these novel contaminants have also been reported in the literature barry 2014 brodin et al 2013 luis et al 2016 meador et al 2018 yeh et al 2017 for instance tadpoles were at a higher risk of predation from dragonfly larvae when exposed to fluoxetine barry 2014 furthermore certain combinations of these chemical compounds might be more toxic than exposure to individual contaminants beyer et al 2014 gogoi et al 2018 pérez coyotl et al 2019 ecs can be equally toxic to aquatic plants as the aquatic animals however very few studies have been conducted in this regard one such study revealed that triclosan and carbamazepine hindered fatty acid synthesis caused accumulation of proteins and impaired cell membrane functioning thus proving toxic to green algae chlorococcum sp xin et al 2017 a low concentration of ibuprofen can stimulate the growth of duckweed i e lemna gibba l di baccio et al 2015 therefore aquatic flora can also aid in monitoring removal and degradation of ecs 3 2 impacts on plants global water shortages have resulted in wastewater reclamation for irrigation purposes particularly in developing nations households and industrial activities ecs in post treatment wastewater will tend to settle in the soil further taken up by the crops resulting in a reduction in crop productivity busse et al 2020 relatively lower concentrations of antibiotics in agricultural soils can delay the germination period of crop and non crop plants further increasing competition among plant species thereby ultimately altering the species composition in natural communities similarly in the case of agricultural crop species delayed germination and biomass reduction can result in yield loss ultimately threatening food security higher organisms dependent on plants will be directly affected when such changes in the plant community occur delayed germination will have more pronounced implications especially in water deficit regions minden et al 2017 similarly other studies have also reported alterations in plant roots that might reduce water uptake affecting plant growth hillis et al 2011 michelini et al 2012 minden et al 2017 plant growth increased when the concentration of enrofloxacin was below 100 μg l which decreased at a concentration greater than 100 μg l migliore et al 2003 also the toxic potential of the ecs on plants is more significant for a mixture of compounds than for individual contaminants christou et al 2016 pharmaceutical chemicals that have been detected in vegetable crops picó et al 2019 might bioaccumulate through natural food webs mohapatra et al 2016 and can become a potential entry point into the human and animal food chain busse et al 2020 3 3 impacts on human beings global consumption of contaminated fish other aquatic organisms crops and treated wastewater for drinking purposes can introduce this new category of chemicals into humans riva et al 2018 the majority of these chemical compounds have the potential to interfere with the functioning of the endocrine system and are commonly classified as endocrine disrupting compounds prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents even at low concentrations can form antibiotic resistance genes args reducing the curative property of antibiotics to protect humans from pathogens tran et al 2018 commonly prescribed anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine and cardiovascular agent atenolol have been reported to interfere with embryonic stem cells growth estrada arriaga et al 2016 tran et al 2015 studied the impact of artificial sweeteners on humans and found that exposure to these contaminants can lead to inflammatory bowel disease tran et al 2015 a significant positive correlation between perfluorinated compounds pfcs amounts and prostate cancer incidence has been documented by eriksen et al 2009 and hardell et al 2014 pfcs also cause reproductive malfunctioning such as infertility breastfeeding problems and semen quality deterioration fei et al 2009 2010 and thyroid diseases melzer et al 2010 furthermore the preliminary reports have indicated possible neurological and immunological disorders cancer incidence and mutations lei et al 2015 sanchez and egea 2018 however the number of studies on this aspect is very limited and its findings are not conclusive hence thorough investigations are required to produce more reliable and convincing outcomes and determine the safe permissible limits 4 literature search strategy selection criteria and limitations to understand the status of research on this category of chemical contaminants the google scholar sciencedirect scopus and web of science were sought to retrieve articles concerning the occurrence of ecs in wastewaters search terms included contaminants of emerging concern emerging contaminants emerging pollutants wastewater wastewater treatment plants effluents and treated wastewater searches were restricted to articles published from 2011 to 2020 the duplicates were excluded and the results obtained were further screened based on the title and abstract and all the relevant articles were identified and downloaded fig 2 furthermore the articles which reported the concentration of ecs either mean or maximum minimum or both concentrations were only finalized for this study the detection and analysis method was not a selection criterion for this work also papers published worldwide were considered to understand better the decadal status of research on this relatively new category of contaminants on the global level and identify the dominant contaminant class and chemical compound after following all of these steps 57 published articles reported from about 19 different countries were shortlisted fig 3 shows the country wise map with the types of contaminants investigated in the former decade the influent and effluent concentration data of ecs from all of these papers were carefully compiled the contaminants were categorized into two distinct classes based on the concentration levels compounds exceeding a concentration of 1 μg l in either the influents or effluents or both were grouped into the predominant ecs in wastewaters worldwide and those reported below 1 μg l were all included in the low concentration class among the predominant ones the contaminants with concentrations greater than 10 μg l in the untreated and treated global wastewaters were graphically represented as box plots to understand the variation in their worldwide concentration fig 5 furthermore the global levels were compared with concentrations reported in indian wastewaters which helped enumerate the contaminants requiring immediate attention in the country the literature selected was based on a few search words and therefore this work may not provide complete information on the ecs however based on the number of articles reviewed the findings still provide an insight into the contaminants that require attention and can form the base for further research the studies followed different methodologies detection and analytical techniques as a result the sample collection time and methods and the detection and quantification limits varied which would have resulted in a complete and better picture if it had been consistent other factors such as seasonal variation and sewage load that play a very influential role in determining the contamination levels in wastewaters have not been considered during the data analysis the removal efficiency for the contaminants was determined based on the overall influent and effluent concentration as it was not specified in most of the studies 5 global status of emerging contaminants even though the investigations on ecs began in the second half of the 20th century the development and enhancement of techniques to detect contaminants at very low concentrations have resulted in a substantial rise in the number of publications in recent years agüera et al 2013 mukhopadhyay et al 2022 saidulu et al 2021 this momentum of research on ecs is likely to continue until the late 2030s and is expected to reach saturation by the late 2050s parida et al 2021 among all the countries china and india had the highest number of publications with 9 articles each followed by spain and the usa as inferred from the compiled data supplementary material fig s1 china india and the usa are among the most populated countries globally with a very high population density in spain the exponential population growth with rapid urbanization and industrialization generates an enormous volume of sewage which could have influenced the research communities of respective countries to monitor these novel contaminants archer et al 2021 a dearth of publications from the remaining countries can have multitudinous repercussions on the countries natural environment and human population similarly several countries lack investigations in this area or are still in their nascent stages even though all the countries face the challenging task of detecting and eliminating these chemicals the poor and underdeveloped nations will have to bear the brunt due to the lack of funds for installing operating and managing sewage treatment plants the summarized decadal data from global wastewaters documented the occurrence of 745 contaminants consisting of the parent compounds including their metabolites and transformation products the most investigated ec class was pharmaceuticals comprising more than 60 of the compounds followed by pcps and industrial and commercial chemicals idc the majority of the already identified ecs belong to these three classes and hence they have been targeted the most by the scientific community based on the concentration levels the 745 analytes were sub divided into two major categories the predominant class concentration 1 μg l consisted of 218 contaminants and the remaining 527 contaminants detected below 1 μg l were all included in the low concentration class supplementary material table s1 although the low concentration compounds may not be an immediate concern such large numbers and prolonged exposure can have unprecedented consequences particularly for aquatic life the predominant contaminants were further classified into 23 sub classes and compared to obtain a precise idea about the concentration range worldwide fig 4 5 1 pharmaceuticals and related compounds pharmaceuticals are essential for preventing curing and treating diseases and reestablishing living organisms well being the compiled data revealed exceptionally high numbers of pharmaceutically active compounds in the global wastewaters indicating their comprehensive administration and consumption except for serbia all other countries reported the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in its wastewaters their prevalence in the environment is a matter of environmental concern with the impacts of most of them frequently studied aarab et al 2020 an extremely high proportion of the contaminants in the predominant category originated from pharmaceuticals among the various therapeutic classes of pharmaceuticals antibiotics were quite dominant with about 45 analytes in the global wastewaters included in the predominant class besides antibiotics other pharmaceutical compounds such as anti inflammatories analgesics stimulants and illicit drugs and contrast media were also present in significant amounts in the treated wastewaters 100 μg l antibiotics and anti inflammatories analgesics are frequently investigated and monitored in wastewaters by the scientific community they are readily available over the counter drugs with and without prescription and are widely consumed garcía et al 2009 jelic et al 2011 extensive administration of antibiotics globally is mainly due to its efficiency against a wide range of microbial strains which on the other hand can develop antimicrobial resistance when released into the environment chaturvedi et al 2021 ripanda et al 2021 the higher concentration of stimulants and illicit drugs class is very concerning as their source and consumption rates are difficult to track due to the prohibitory laws placed on these compounds in many nations also the presence of illicit drugs and certain illegal stimulants have been investigated in only a few countries irrespective of their worldwide consumption on comparing the concentrations of various sub classes shown in fig 4 it is evident that antibiotics anti inflammatories analgesics antiulcer antidiabetics and cardiovascular agents showed slight to a significant reduction in their concentration after treatment however the concentration of certain compounds belonging to contrast media lipid regulators and nnrtis non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors did not differ in their pre and post treatment levels negative removal of anti depressants anti epileptics anti psychotics and snris serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors was also observed such contrasting removal efficiency indicates the difference in the analyte s properties even within the same broad category of pharmaceutical compounds seasonality and wwtp types guerra et al 2014 the global influent and effluent concentration distribution of compounds detected above 100 μg l and between 10 μg l to 100 μg l has been graphically depicted in fig 5 a b c and d respectively among all the predominant compounds acetaminophen a commonly used analgesic drug was the most concentrated ec globally with a maximum concentration of 500 μg l reported in the untreated wastewaters of canada canada treated wastewaters from hospitals and retirement homes which resulted in the predominance of acetaminophen guerra et al 2014 similarly elevated levels of acetaminophen were also found in other countries like china india new zealand singapore south korea spain thailand and the usa even after employing primary secondary and advanced treatment methods the highest overall effluent concentration of acetaminophen was also recorded in canada 62 μg l in contrast other countries that reported the presence of acetaminophen in their wastewaters showed very low concentrations after treatment thus the influent concentration is consequential for the concentration of contaminants present in the environment this was also true for other highly predominant pharmaceutical compounds like ibuprofen amdany et al 2014 salicylic acid gracia lor et al 2012b ciprofloxacin ampicillin iohexol tran et al 2019 etc with the same countries reporting the high influent and effluent concentrations fig 5 likewise the universal intake of caffeine through beverages and pharmaceutical drugs could have resulted in its elevated concentration levels the highest concentration of caffeine ciprofloxacin and ampicillin in influents was reported from india indicating very high consumption in the country archana et al 2017 mutiyar and mittal 2014 primary and secondary activated sludge process treatments were operational in indian wwtps resulting in an overall reduction in contaminants concentration however greece papageorgiou et al 2016 and spain guedes alonso et al 2013 reported unaltered concentration and negative removal in their wastewaters even after employing the same treatment method as india with an additional membrane bioreactor system in spain which might be due to local climate and conjugate formation 5 2 personal care products compounds originating from pcps such as uv filters antifungal antibacterial chemicals disinfectants insect repellents fragrances preservatives etc have also been detected at significant concentrations in several countries amdany et al 2014 archana et al 2017 godayol et al 2015 the booming of cosmetic industries has led to extensive use and release of pcps particularly from urbanized locations among all the ecs 11 antifungal antibacterial compounds were detected in global wastewaters with 4 of them triclocarban triclosan methylparaben and irgasan quantified above 1 μg l irgasan was the most concentrated contaminant both in the influents and effluents of this category reported from india table 1 archana et al 2017 followed by triclosan in south africa amdany et al 2014 these compounds showed positive removal with considerably high concentrations in the treated wastewaters high concentrations of fragrances and preservatives used in cosmetics such as dihydromyrcenol dhmol galaxolide hhcb celestolide adbi and many others have also been identified in the wastewaters however their concentrations in untreated wastewaters were much lower than the antifungal antibacterial compounds all the predominant compounds of fragrances and preservatives category were significantly reduced except hhcb lactone biotransformation of hhcb during activated sludge based biological process increased the concentration of hhcb lactone in spain vallecillos et al 2014 however the same study also confirmed the efficacy of the ro based advanced tertiary method by a substantial reduction in the analyte s concentration only one compound used in insect repellents i e n n diethyl meta toluamide deet was detected above 1 μg l in singapore tran et al 2018 uv filters such as benzophenone oxybenzone and benzophenone 4 commonly present in cosmetic products like sunscreens have also been recorded at significant amounts with comparatively higher concentrations in the effluents than in the influents however studies that reported higher effluent concentrations of the aforementioned compounds did not report their corresponding influent concentration making it difficult to establish their removal efficiency nonetheless benzophenone has endocrine disrupting properties and therefore even such levels in the treated waters can be detrimental to living organisms particularly human beings surfactants another commonly found ecs in wastewaters are widely used as wetting agents detergents disinfectants and emulsifying agents according to our findings surfactants have been studied only in greece gago ferrero et al 2020 with influent concentrations ranging from 1 μg l to 431 μg l emphasizing the need for its surveillance in other nations as well however the concentration of surfactants was significantly reduced indicating the efficiency of the conventional secondary treatment methods 5 3 industrial and commercial chemicals besides pharmaceuticals and pcps chemicals manufactured or and used in industries and commercial processes including plasticizers phthalates and flame retardants also occur predominantly in global wastewaters gago ferrero et al 2020 gani et al 2016 gao et al 2014 karthikraj and kannan 2017 the overall global influent and effluent concentrations of industrial chemicals showed moderate removal and phthalates including plasticizers did not vary significantly in contrast the post treatment wastewaters reported higher flame retardant levels than the raw untreated wastewaters among all the compounds documented in this class benzothiazoles karthikraj and kannan 2017 and diethylhexyl phthalate gani et al 2016 reported in india and tboep tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate in the usa have been quantified with concentrations above 100 μg l in either raw untreated wastewaters or treated wastewaters or both phthalates such as butyl benzyl phthalate and di n octyl phthalate and flame retardants such as bdcipp bis 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate pbdpp p p 1 3 phenylene p p p p tetraphenyl ester phosphate tboep tcipp tris 1 chloro 2 24 propyl phosphate and tdcipp tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate showed negative removal after treatment therefore the primary and secondary sludge based techniques implemented to remove these compounds demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the treatment methods furthermore our findings also revealed that very few countries phthalates in china greece india serbia and flame retardants in new zealand and the usa had investigated compounds belonging to this category highlighting the pressing need for its research in other nations a vast number of compounds belonging to pesticides and perfluoroalkyl compounds were also documented with all of them included in the low concentration class see supplementary material table s1 such high concentrations and large numbers of industrial and commercially used chemicals can be toxic for the biota present in the receiving water bodies 5 4 artificial sweeteners the widespread utilization of artificial sweeteners asws in food industries to produce sugar less minimum calories food products and extensive human consumption due to its non glycemic effect insulin response has led to the mass discharge of the compounds in the natural environment kookana et al 2013 the majority of the asws are excreted from human bodies without undergoing any transformation and metabolism and hence are present at very high levels in various environmental matrices according to our findings only four compounds acesulfame cyclamate saccharin and sucralose have been detected in the wastewaters of four nations diaz sosa et al 2020 gago ferrero et al 2020 liu et al 2016 subedi et al 2015 tran et al 2015 2019 with no significant reduction in the overall worldwide concentration the order of these compounds based on their overall concentration is saccharine cyclamate acesulfame sucralose the highest concentration of saccharine was reported in india subedi et al 2015 saccharine is the cheapest and most extensively used artificial sweetener in the country which explains its dominant presence in the indian wastewaters tripathi et al 2006 the prevention of adulteration of food act in india allows 100 mg kg of saccharine in carbonated drinks however other products like pan masala ice candy and crushed ice were found to have higher amounts of saccharine than the permitted quantity tripathi et al 2006 even after treatment the maximum effluent concentration of saccharine was extremely high 379 μg l indicating towards inefficiency of the treatment method employed for its removal subedi et al 2015 the influent concentration of the other three compounds of this group acesulfame cyclamate and sucralose ranged from 1 μg l to 40 μg l with their maximum levels reported from singapore fig 5cand d similar to other compounds the conventional treatment processes resulted in elevated concentrations of this class and the lack of attention paid to them ouda et al 2021 implies the need for further investigation and improvement of the existing removal mechanisms or the development of new methods to treat this class from sewages properly 5 5 other contaminants another interesting finding of this study was the occurrence of naturally occurring chemical compounds i e amino acids in the wastewaters the presence of these compounds has been mostly neglected due to their natural origin a total of 8 amino acid compounds were screened in the wastewaters of greece with influent concentrations greater than 1 μg l thus included in the predominant class positive removal was observed for most amino acids except g aminobutiric acid gaba whose concentration increased after treatment the concentration of certain compounds marked in bold in table 1 increased after the treatment process which could be due to the microbial transformation of conjugate molecules during the conventional primary and secondary treatment process gulkowska et al 2008 miao et al 2002 subedi et al 2015 therefore the incomplete elimination and increase in the concentration of these contaminants reveal the inefficiency of commonly practiced conventional removal techniques and advanced tertiary methods 6 global versus indian concentration of emerging contaminants with a large population developing nations like india generate approximately 62 million liters of sewage daily the number of wwtps present in the country is about 37 of the total wastewater generated most of which are equipped with only primary and secondary treatment facilities treating merely 30 of the sewage and discharging large volumes of raw and ineffectively treated wastewater to the environment while others are non operational cpcb 2015 it was also discovered that 39 of wwtps do not adhere to the authorized limitations when releasing effluents into aquatic systems many small towns and rural areas lack wwtps as a result of the insufficient number of operational wwtps and the absence of regulatory enforcement india can expect increased ec emissions into the environment subedi et al 2017 furthermore due to the country s water scarcity the agricultural sector has been compelled to rely on wastewater for irrigation introducing these toxic chemicals into the soil and ultimately the food chain sharma et al 2019 until now most of the studies in india have reported ecs in river waters biswas and vellanki 2021 chakraborty et al 2021 selvaraj et al 2021 sharma et al 2019 with relatively less information from treated and untreated wastewaters the concentration of ecs in surface waters is generally observed to be decreasing owing to dilution arman et al 2021 because the compounds already existing in the water bodies can react and generate transformation products in some situations knowing the types of ecs and their concentrations in wastewaters collected at the treatment unit outlets can aid in understanding their behavior 86 ecs were quantified in indian wastewaters belonging to a wide range of classes like in other countries most of the compounds studied in india were pharmaceuticals likewise antibiotics have been detected the most with an overall influent and effluent concentration of 0 059 μg l 263 3 μg l and 0 0625 μg l 51 82 μg l respectively followed by cardiovascular agents and anti inflammatories analgesics probably because india is one of the leading producers of pharmaceuticals with very high consumption rates as well archana et al 2017 table 2 compares the concentrations of all ecs found in india to their corresponding global concentrations many parent contaminants and some metabolites and transformation products were only quantified in india such as irgasan table 2 highlights similar compounds with unusually high levels recorded in indian wastewaters in india significant negative removal for ibuprofen naproxen sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim atenolol and other drugs was observed as opposed to the global setting where it was effectively treated contrarily the post treatment concentration of antibiotic compounds ciprofloxacin and lincomycin and uv filters benzophenone and oxybenzone increased globally but was positively removed in india despite the various treatment processes employed the concentration of carbamazepine inclined in both the indian and global contexts indicating the inefficiency of the treatment techniques adopted and other factors that could have influenced the concentration to rise such as environmental and physicochemical parameters of the treatment units the compound specific characteristics of contaminants that exhibited negative removal also need to be further analyzed to draw conclusions on their behavior in the wastewaters that enhance their concentrations also the effluent concentration of pharmaceutical compounds such as ampicillin trimethoprim carbamazepine and caffeine also a stimulant was comparatively higher than the global levels fig 6 caffeine showed positive removal worldwide including in india with effluent concentration still considerably very high indicating moderate efficiency of both the conventional and advanced treatment methods employed in the wwtps also two metabolites belonging to the stimulants class i e 3 4 methylenedioxyamphetamine and 3 4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine were detected in indian wastewaters with a slight increase in concentration after treatment this suggests that not only the applied methods are unable to remove them but the conjugated forms of the contaminants undergo a microbial transformation during the treatment process increasing the concentration of the parent compounds in the effluents calisto and esteves 2009 as well triclocarban and triclosan were also detected in indian wastewaters triclocarban reduced significantly in both contexts whereas triclosan levels remained the same in india even after treatment the effluent concentration of the asws detected in india was much lower than worldwide except for saccharine the extremely high concentration of saccharine in both the untreated and treated wastewaters in india is extremely concerning requiring immediate attention in this regard among the chemicals released from industrial and commercial activities and products the concentrations of phthalates and benzothiazoles were detected in indian wastewaters at significantly higher levels table 2 the concentration of benzothiazoles in indian wastewaters was reported to be the highest globally suggesting its extensive usage in the country released primarily from rubber and textile products although positive reduction with varying degrees of removal was observed for all the compounds the overall effluent concentration ranged from 0 0176 μg l to 106 548 μg l suggesting incomplete or inefficient removal phthalates are carcinogenic and can also disrupt the endocrine system hence even much lower levels of these chemicals can be detrimental india is the only country that reported all the bisphenol compounds bisphenol analogues and other industrial and commercial chemicals in its wastewaters unlike others that monitored only diethyl phthalate and bisphenol a diethyl phthalate has been detected in the wastewaters of china and greece with the global influent concentration 16 86 μg l slightly higher than in india 16 375 μg l however the effluent concentration of this phthalate compound was more elevated in india than in the other two countries fig 6 where it was reported all the ecs that were found to be predominantly present in the indian effluents have been shown in fig 7 therefore their occurrence in the environment is a critical issue and should not be ignored 7 mitigation strategies wwtps are primarily responsible for the presence of a large number of ecs at elevated concentrations in the natural environment therefore all the necessary steps must be taken to address this emerging problem due to the difficulty of detecting and treating ecs regulations requiring the limited environmental discharge of the compounds and public awareness must be emphasized however given the societal dependence on these compounds reducing ecs by acting on the source is impossible as a result developing effective techniques to eliminate ecs is critical for lowering potential public health threats also complete information on the bioaccumulation properties and ecotoxicological consequences of ecs in the food web and the hazards to the local ecology and human health is necessary for proper prioritization of ecs removal in wwtps they are rarely monitored because of the dearth of knowledge about the persistence and toxicity of ecs transformed products the extraction of ecs or their transformation products from intricate environmental matrices and their measurement and identification should be the focus of new methods development furthermore the treatment efficiency of different wwtp processes needs re evaluation to determine the contaminant wise best suited process lastly most of the traditional treatment processes have certain disadvantages as they were not designed to remove this novel category of contaminants on the other hand emerging technologies are expensive and inappropriate for commercial usage in underdeveloped countries as a result combining traditional and developing methods should be considered to strike a balance between feasibility and cost therefore the development of universally accessible relatively cheaper and user friendly treatment solutions should be prioritized besides the type of treatment implemented compound specific properties environmental conditions sewage intake rate and physicochemical parameters in the wwtps also influence the concentration levels of these contaminants in effluents all of these parameters must be taken into account while determining the optimized treatment process 8 conclusions this review broadly discusses the occurrence sources fate known impacts global and national status of ecs in treated and untreated wastewaters and the mitigation approaches that can help deal with this problem according to our findings the conventional wwtps are efficient to a certain degree in treating ecs very high removal efficiency observed for anti diabetics however it may not be accurate for all the classes of the contaminants the contamination levels of certain compounds anti depressants anti psychotics etc increased after treatment while a few artificial sweeteners phthalates etc also displayed insignificant removal also asws naturally occurring amino acids and surfactants in wastewaters have often been neglected irrespective of their exceedingly high concentration similarly irgasan benzothiazoles and other phthalate compounds were quite prominent in india and reported nowhere else in the world exceptionally high concentrations of these compounds can be toxic and would create challenging future scenarios and require immediate and equal focus like the commonly studied compounds furthermore their impacts have been explored individually and mostly on aquatic animals the information on the combined impacts of two or more compounds and the implications of ecs on aquatic photosynthetic organisms agricultural and non agricultural plants and terrestrial animals need further and detailed investigation a thorough understanding and modeling of the fate of these contaminants will essentially aid in forecasting their effects on the natural environment ecs can be challenging if left unregulated hence this extensive understanding will help determine its permissible limits and formulate policies that would include these chemical compounds in the regular surveillance and monitoring programs these policies must also be enforced globally to help generate

11789,the prevalence of emerging contaminants ecs in wastewaters is troublesome because of their widespread and persistent nature posing a threat to living organisms when exposed for prolonged durations we conducted an extensive literature assessment for this study to present the overall global status of the occurrence of ecs regardless of their class by compiling relevant publications from the previous decade the most commonly investigated category were pharmaceuticals particularly antibiotics and anti inflammatories analgesics personal care products pcps and industrial chemicals idc the most concentrated compounds in the global influents and effluents were acetaminophen 500 μg l an analgesic and saccharine 379 μg l an artificial sweetener reported from canada and india respectively irrespective of its prevalence the presence of artificial sweeteners asws surfactants etc in wastewaters have often been overlooked most of the sub classes exhibited minor to moderate elimination efficiency with anti diabetic drugs showing the highest among all however insignificant changes artificial sweeteners phthalates etc and negative removal anti depressants anti psychotics etc were also observed furthermore caffeine ampicillin and trimethoprim were reported at extremely high concentrations in india than in the rest of the world irgasan benzothiazoles sparfloxacin etc were also quite predominant in india which has yet to be recorded in any other country therefore the universally implemented conventional approaches are incapable of total elimination for all ecs hence the traditional methods should be paired with the advanced techniques that have shown positive removal for certain ecs which can be a promising solution to this problem these findings will aid in establishing which classes and compounds demand immediate attention for further investigation and monitoring allowing water managers to take necessary measures to reduce pollutant levels at the source and develop water protection policies graphical abstract image 1 keywords emerging contaminants wastewater wastewater treatment plants pharmaceuticals artificial sweeteners saccharine 1 introduction water is a vital natural resource that supports aquatic biota and is utilized for various purposes including industrial processes agricultural activities and human consumption despite being indispensable water resources have been subjected to constant anthropogenic pressure resulting in severe pollution and posing a threat to water security for the growing population that relies on it acuña et al 2015 yusuf et al 2021 to address this issue wastewater treatment plants wwtps were developed to remove and destroy harmful contaminants of various sizes and chemical physical and biological properties from sewage generated from several sources acting as a barrier between the toxic substances and the natural environment however the existing literature indicates the presence of certain toxic chemicals in the treated wastewaters cukierman et al 2019 rout et al 2021 owing to the existing wwtps operating on conventional processes these wwtps are unequipped to eliminate these contaminants that are now being considered critical for ecosystems and human health chaturvedi et al 2021 karpińska and kotowska 2021 khazri et al 2019 mukhopadhyay et al 2022 ripanda et al 2021 yadav et al 2021 this fact necessitates upgrading of the treatment plants gimeno et al 2018 luo et al 2018 necibi et al 2021 rodil et al 2012 and the development of efficient technologies to eliminate these contaminants or reduce their concentration to ecologically acceptable levels before being discharged to the water bodies this category of contaminants is termed emerging contaminants ecs or contaminants of emerging concern the ecs are mostly synthetic or natural compounds originating primarily from anthropogenic activities released from various products of different families used widely noutsopoulos et al 2019 valsecchi et al 2015 exhibiting diverse chemical properties soulier et al 2016 some commonly reported contaminants originate from pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides industrial chemicals veterinary drugs illicit drugs etc in contrast other naturally occurring compounds such as hormones sterols and amino acids are excreted by humans and animals tong et al 2022 which are included in the ecs list they occur in trace amounts nanograms to micrograms per liter and remain undetected during the wastewater treatment process noguera oviedo and aga 2016 their complex nature also makes its detection a challenging task their ubiquitous occurrence in various environmental compartments particularly in wastewaters khan et al 2022 and organisms tissues exhibits varying concentrations depending on the population density land use water consumption pattern sampling period wastewater source sewer and treatment units conditions etc chen et al 2019 patel et al 2019 tran and gin 2017 ecs can resist degradation and persist and bioaccumulate in various environmental media making the living organisms vulnerable to their effects dimpe and nomngongo 2016 these contaminants also transform due to several natural or wastewater treatment processes arman et al 2021 dévier et al 2011 forming more complex and toxic products many of which remain unidentified richardson 2003 and their additive impacts on ecosystems are yet to be ascertained the physicochemical characteristics of the environmental media govern their fate and persistence which remains to be poorly understood biošić et al 2021 although a substantial amount of research has been conducted to comprehend the environmental implications of individual contaminants necibi et al 2021 their long term impacts are still untouched most of the ecs lack regulatory guidelines and are not included in routine monitoring programs ripanda et al 2021 which is highly concerning a few organizations have established statutory guidelines for a very small proportion of ecs frequently detected in aqueous environments moreover these guidelines are not strictly followed due to inadequate knowledge of their occurrence behavior fate and impacts european parliament proposed the inclusion of ecs under the priority substances list commision of the european communities 2006 similarly the united states environmental protection agency usepa has also added certain ecs to the list of priority substances revised every five years us epa 2017 furthermore usepa declared organophosphate flame retardants to be highly hazardous thus highlighting the need for thorough research on their impacts us epa 2015 likewise european union eu world health organization who and australian drinking water guidelines have also provided regulations for maximum permissible limits for a few ecs mostly belonging to the pharmaceutical class australian guidelines for water recycling 2008 eu 2008 us epa 2015 the norman network of reference laboratories research centers and related organizations for monitoring of emerging environmental substances network was created to track this group of contaminants brack et al 2012 that has identified more than a thousand chemical compounds geissen et al 2015 many conventional wwtps use the biological approach which reveals the improper elimination of ecs because of their high resistance to microbial activity rathi et al 2021 the conventional methods are often integrated with advanced techniques involving membrane and oxidation processes to enhance the removal efficiency despite superior efficacy higher energy demands overpriced nature and generation of new wastes are some of the significant drawbacks of the advanced techniques gogoi et al 2018 karpińska and kotowska 2021 parida et al 2021 nevertheless some compounds successfully escape the treatment phases and find their way into the receiving environments particularly surface water bodies through the effluents therefore wwtps are the primary point sources and other diffused sources such as untreated wastewater storm water runoff from urban and rural areas and leaching from agricultural lands and landfills which also contribute to these contaminants to the natural environment inostroza et al 2016 most of the research has been restricted to a specific class or geographical location contaminants other than pharmaceuticals and personal care products are relatively less reviewed and hence this comprehensive analysis aims to fill this knowledge gap this work is the first ever attempt at compiling information about all the ecs irrespective of their types and concentration levels to the best of our knowledge all the relevant information regarding the occurrence sources fate concentration levels and impacts of contaminants in wastewater effluents reported during the last decade have been collected compiled and analyzed accordingly the analysis will provide an overall picture of the prominent contaminants in global wastewaters furthermore multi class monitoring of ecs are missing on a broader spectrum resulting in scarce information from an indian perspective therefore a comparison between the concentrations of contaminants in india and worldwide was also performed to gain a deeper understanding of the status of ecs in indian wastewaters this will facilitate identifying the contaminants that are a possible ecological threat and would require immediate attention for their removal from wastewaters in the indian context 2 sources and fate of emerging contaminants in the environment the addition of ecs into the natural environment from diverse sources is a never ending process and can be categorized into two major classes direct discharge of these chemicals through effluents of wwtps receiving sewage from industries households and hospitals are recognized as point sources fig 1 ecs can also enter the environment through various non point sources including agricultural and urban runoff leakage from septic tanks leaching sludge application on farms etc rout et al 2021 monitoring the release of these toxic chemicals through non point sources is relatively more complex than the point sources among all the mentioned sources households are of utmost importance as they release most of the compounds belonging to pharmaceuticals and personal care products a meager amount of the medicines consumed is metabolized in the human body at the same time the remaining unmetabolized portion is excreted via urine and feces and ultimately released into the natural environment via treated effluent streams rout et al 2021 being exceptionally polar and water soluble pharmaceutically active compounds phacs tend to have a higher residence time in the receiving environments behera et al 2011 patel et al 2019 dumping unused and expired medicines from health care centers and hospitals is a common practice rathi et al 2021 furthermore wastewaters from pharmaceutical industries are also major contributors to phacs barbosa et al 2016 likewise the administration of pharmaceutical drugs in livestock rearing animal healthcare etc are also potential sources of these chemicals in the environment rathi et al 2021 antibacterial and antifungal compounds uv filters etc are released from personal care products pcps routinely used by humans and have been quantified at exceedingly high levels in several nations affirming their global predominance in the aqueous environments amdany et al 2014 archana et al 2017 similar to pharmaceuticals the available literature also revealed pcps emanating from manufacturing units barbosa et al 2016 likewise artificial sweeteners are primarily used as a substitute for sugar in various human and animal food products that have also been detected at significant concentrations subedi et al 2015 tran et al 2015 2019 industrial and commercial chemicals such as flame retardants and plasticizers are widely used and can reach different environmental matrices through leaching volatilization runoff etc kim et al 2017 parida et al 2021 apart from these synthetic chemicals naturally occurring compounds such as amino acids excreted from human and animal bodies have also been considered ecs due to their large numbers and exceptionally high levels in the wastewaters gago ferrero et al 2020 after being discharged into the surface waters these toxic compounds follow various pathways and reach different environmental matrices such as soil groundwater drinking water etc however their concentration alters in different aquatic environments influenced by several factors seasonality is one of the factors that play a substantial role in determining the environmental concentrations of the ecs for example uv filters detected in the summer months are higher than in other seasons petrie et al 2015 similarly the consumption of certain pharmaceutical drugs is higher during winter due to seasonal illnesses thereby resulting in greater concentrations kim et al 2017 generally conventional wwtps are employed worldwide with primary and secondary methods involved in treating organic matter and nutrients from sewage at times an additional tertiary step might also be involved ecs adsorb onto the sludge that is essentially removed in the primary stage of the treatment to some extent the secondary step involves biological degradation which has shown relatively higher removal efficiency of up to 70 than 50 in the case of the primary stage whereas the occasionally employed tertiary treatment processes have demonstrated the highest efficacy in removing the ecs from incoming sewages luo et al 2014 tiwari et al 2017 tran et al 2018 furthermore an increase in the contaminant concentration after treatment has also been observed in some instances which could be due to the transformation of conjugates forming parent compounds through enzymatic cleavage gracia lor et al 2012a kosma et al 2014 singh et al 2014 these contaminants also undergo a biological or chemical transformation forming novel more complex toxic and persistent strains than their parent compounds gogoi et al 2018 3 impacts of emerging contaminants 3 1 impacts on aquatic life the aquatic ecosystems are the first to be exposed to ecs and are highly susceptible to its toxicity due to prolonged exposure planktons and invertebrates play a crucial part in ecosystem functioning and the food web macrofauna relies on planktons at the bottom of the aquatic food chain especially zooplanktons to meet their food requirements therefore any kind of toxicity exerted by these contaminants on lower level species can collapse the entire ecosystem sub lethal concentrations of diltiazem a pharmaceutical drug increased the heart rate and offspring s size with a reduction in their numbers resulting in a population decline of daphnia magna steinkey et al 2019 chemicals derived from pcps and pharmaceutical drugs bioaccumulated in mussels tissues which on exposure for more extended periods can modify the immune system lipid metabolism etc kookana et al 2013 mezzelani et al 2018 similarly due to its prevalence in aquatic environments caffeine induced negative impacts on the gills of mytilus californianus mussels at the molecular level del rey et al 2011 other studies have also indicated alterations in physical sexual genetic and reproductive traits in higher level organisms such as fishes gauthier and vijayan 2020 mcgovarin et al 2018 raut et al 2011 vidal dorsch et al 2013 alterations in animal behavior on exposure to these novel contaminants have also been reported in the literature barry 2014 brodin et al 2013 luis et al 2016 meador et al 2018 yeh et al 2017 for instance tadpoles were at a higher risk of predation from dragonfly larvae when exposed to fluoxetine barry 2014 furthermore certain combinations of these chemical compounds might be more toxic than exposure to individual contaminants beyer et al 2014 gogoi et al 2018 pérez coyotl et al 2019 ecs can be equally toxic to aquatic plants as the aquatic animals however very few studies have been conducted in this regard one such study revealed that triclosan and carbamazepine hindered fatty acid synthesis caused accumulation of proteins and impaired cell membrane functioning thus proving toxic to green algae chlorococcum sp xin et al 2017 a low concentration of ibuprofen can stimulate the growth of duckweed i e lemna gibba l di baccio et al 2015 therefore aquatic flora can also aid in monitoring removal and degradation of ecs 3 2 impacts on plants global water shortages have resulted in wastewater reclamation for irrigation purposes particularly in developing nations households and industrial activities ecs in post treatment wastewater will tend to settle in the soil further taken up by the crops resulting in a reduction in crop productivity busse et al 2020 relatively lower concentrations of antibiotics in agricultural soils can delay the germination period of crop and non crop plants further increasing competition among plant species thereby ultimately altering the species composition in natural communities similarly in the case of agricultural crop species delayed germination and biomass reduction can result in yield loss ultimately threatening food security higher organisms dependent on plants will be directly affected when such changes in the plant community occur delayed germination will have more pronounced implications especially in water deficit regions minden et al 2017 similarly other studies have also reported alterations in plant roots that might reduce water uptake affecting plant growth hillis et al 2011 michelini et al 2012 minden et al 2017 plant growth increased when the concentration of enrofloxacin was below 100 μg l which decreased at a concentration greater than 100 μg l migliore et al 2003 also the toxic potential of the ecs on plants is more significant for a mixture of compounds than for individual contaminants christou et al 2016 pharmaceutical chemicals that have been detected in vegetable crops picó et al 2019 might bioaccumulate through natural food webs mohapatra et al 2016 and can become a potential entry point into the human and animal food chain busse et al 2020 3 3 impacts on human beings global consumption of contaminated fish other aquatic organisms crops and treated wastewater for drinking purposes can introduce this new category of chemicals into humans riva et al 2018 the majority of these chemical compounds have the potential to interfere with the functioning of the endocrine system and are commonly classified as endocrine disrupting compounds prolonged exposure to antimicrobial agents even at low concentrations can form antibiotic resistance genes args reducing the curative property of antibiotics to protect humans from pathogens tran et al 2018 commonly prescribed anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine and cardiovascular agent atenolol have been reported to interfere with embryonic stem cells growth estrada arriaga et al 2016 tran et al 2015 studied the impact of artificial sweeteners on humans and found that exposure to these contaminants can lead to inflammatory bowel disease tran et al 2015 a significant positive correlation between perfluorinated compounds pfcs amounts and prostate cancer incidence has been documented by eriksen et al 2009 and hardell et al 2014 pfcs also cause reproductive malfunctioning such as infertility breastfeeding problems and semen quality deterioration fei et al 2009 2010 and thyroid diseases melzer et al 2010 furthermore the preliminary reports have indicated possible neurological and immunological disorders cancer incidence and mutations lei et al 2015 sanchez and egea 2018 however the number of studies on this aspect is very limited and its findings are not conclusive hence thorough investigations are required to produce more reliable and convincing outcomes and determine the safe permissible limits 4 literature search strategy selection criteria and limitations to understand the status of research on this category of chemical contaminants the google scholar sciencedirect scopus and web of science were sought to retrieve articles concerning the occurrence of ecs in wastewaters search terms included contaminants of emerging concern emerging contaminants emerging pollutants wastewater wastewater treatment plants effluents and treated wastewater searches were restricted to articles published from 2011 to 2020 the duplicates were excluded and the results obtained were further screened based on the title and abstract and all the relevant articles were identified and downloaded fig 2 furthermore the articles which reported the concentration of ecs either mean or maximum minimum or both concentrations were only finalized for this study the detection and analysis method was not a selection criterion for this work also papers published worldwide were considered to understand better the decadal status of research on this relatively new category of contaminants on the global level and identify the dominant contaminant class and chemical compound after following all of these steps 57 published articles reported from about 19 different countries were shortlisted fig 3 shows the country wise map with the types of contaminants investigated in the former decade the influent and effluent concentration data of ecs from all of these papers were carefully compiled the contaminants were categorized into two distinct classes based on the concentration levels compounds exceeding a concentration of 1 μg l in either the influents or effluents or both were grouped into the predominant ecs in wastewaters worldwide and those reported below 1 μg l were all included in the low concentration class among the predominant ones the contaminants with concentrations greater than 10 μg l in the untreated and treated global wastewaters were graphically represented as box plots to understand the variation in their worldwide concentration fig 5 furthermore the global levels were compared with concentrations reported in indian wastewaters which helped enumerate the contaminants requiring immediate attention in the country the literature selected was based on a few search words and therefore this work may not provide complete information on the ecs however based on the number of articles reviewed the findings still provide an insight into the contaminants that require attention and can form the base for further research the studies followed different methodologies detection and analytical techniques as a result the sample collection time and methods and the detection and quantification limits varied which would have resulted in a complete and better picture if it had been consistent other factors such as seasonal variation and sewage load that play a very influential role in determining the contamination levels in wastewaters have not been considered during the data analysis the removal efficiency for the contaminants was determined based on the overall influent and effluent concentration as it was not specified in most of the studies 5 global status of emerging contaminants even though the investigations on ecs began in the second half of the 20th century the development and enhancement of techniques to detect contaminants at very low concentrations have resulted in a substantial rise in the number of publications in recent years agüera et al 2013 mukhopadhyay et al 2022 saidulu et al 2021 this momentum of research on ecs is likely to continue until the late 2030s and is expected to reach saturation by the late 2050s parida et al 2021 among all the countries china and india had the highest number of publications with 9 articles each followed by spain and the usa as inferred from the compiled data supplementary material fig s1 china india and the usa are among the most populated countries globally with a very high population density in spain the exponential population growth with rapid urbanization and industrialization generates an enormous volume of sewage which could have influenced the research communities of respective countries to monitor these novel contaminants archer et al 2021 a dearth of publications from the remaining countries can have multitudinous repercussions on the countries natural environment and human population similarly several countries lack investigations in this area or are still in their nascent stages even though all the countries face the challenging task of detecting and eliminating these chemicals the poor and underdeveloped nations will have to bear the brunt due to the lack of funds for installing operating and managing sewage treatment plants the summarized decadal data from global wastewaters documented the occurrence of 745 contaminants consisting of the parent compounds including their metabolites and transformation products the most investigated ec class was pharmaceuticals comprising more than 60 of the compounds followed by pcps and industrial and commercial chemicals idc the majority of the already identified ecs belong to these three classes and hence they have been targeted the most by the scientific community based on the concentration levels the 745 analytes were sub divided into two major categories the predominant class concentration 1 μg l consisted of 218 contaminants and the remaining 527 contaminants detected below 1 μg l were all included in the low concentration class supplementary material table s1 although the low concentration compounds may not be an immediate concern such large numbers and prolonged exposure can have unprecedented consequences particularly for aquatic life the predominant contaminants were further classified into 23 sub classes and compared to obtain a precise idea about the concentration range worldwide fig 4 5 1 pharmaceuticals and related compounds pharmaceuticals are essential for preventing curing and treating diseases and reestablishing living organisms well being the compiled data revealed exceptionally high numbers of pharmaceutically active compounds in the global wastewaters indicating their comprehensive administration and consumption except for serbia all other countries reported the occurrence of pharmaceutical compounds in its wastewaters their prevalence in the environment is a matter of environmental concern with the impacts of most of them frequently studied aarab et al 2020 an extremely high proportion of the contaminants in the predominant category originated from pharmaceuticals among the various therapeutic classes of pharmaceuticals antibiotics were quite dominant with about 45 analytes in the global wastewaters included in the predominant class besides antibiotics other pharmaceutical compounds such as anti inflammatories analgesics stimulants and illicit drugs and contrast media were also present in significant amounts in the treated wastewaters 100 μg l antibiotics and anti inflammatories analgesics are frequently investigated and monitored in wastewaters by the scientific community they are readily available over the counter drugs with and without prescription and are widely consumed garcía et al 2009 jelic et al 2011 extensive administration of antibiotics globally is mainly due to its efficiency against a wide range of microbial strains which on the other hand can develop antimicrobial resistance when released into the environment chaturvedi et al 2021 ripanda et al 2021 the higher concentration of stimulants and illicit drugs class is very concerning as their source and consumption rates are difficult to track due to the prohibitory laws placed on these compounds in many nations also the presence of illicit drugs and certain illegal stimulants have been investigated in only a few countries irrespective of their worldwide consumption on comparing the concentrations of various sub classes shown in fig 4 it is evident that antibiotics anti inflammatories analgesics antiulcer antidiabetics and cardiovascular agents showed slight to a significant reduction in their concentration after treatment however the concentration of certain compounds belonging to contrast media lipid regulators and nnrtis non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors did not differ in their pre and post treatment levels negative removal of anti depressants anti epileptics anti psychotics and snris serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors was also observed such contrasting removal efficiency indicates the difference in the analyte s properties even within the same broad category of pharmaceutical compounds seasonality and wwtp types guerra et al 2014 the global influent and effluent concentration distribution of compounds detected above 100 μg l and between 10 μg l to 100 μg l has been graphically depicted in fig 5 a b c and d respectively among all the predominant compounds acetaminophen a commonly used analgesic drug was the most concentrated ec globally with a maximum concentration of 500 μg l reported in the untreated wastewaters of canada canada treated wastewaters from hospitals and retirement homes which resulted in the predominance of acetaminophen guerra et al 2014 similarly elevated levels of acetaminophen were also found in other countries like china india new zealand singapore south korea spain thailand and the usa even after employing primary secondary and advanced treatment methods the highest overall effluent concentration of acetaminophen was also recorded in canada 62 μg l in contrast other countries that reported the presence of acetaminophen in their wastewaters showed very low concentrations after treatment thus the influent concentration is consequential for the concentration of contaminants present in the environment this was also true for other highly predominant pharmaceutical compounds like ibuprofen amdany et al 2014 salicylic acid gracia lor et al 2012b ciprofloxacin ampicillin iohexol tran et al 2019 etc with the same countries reporting the high influent and effluent concentrations fig 5 likewise the universal intake of caffeine through beverages and pharmaceutical drugs could have resulted in its elevated concentration levels the highest concentration of caffeine ciprofloxacin and ampicillin in influents was reported from india indicating very high consumption in the country archana et al 2017 mutiyar and mittal 2014 primary and secondary activated sludge process treatments were operational in indian wwtps resulting in an overall reduction in contaminants concentration however greece papageorgiou et al 2016 and spain guedes alonso et al 2013 reported unaltered concentration and negative removal in their wastewaters even after employing the same treatment method as india with an additional membrane bioreactor system in spain which might be due to local climate and conjugate formation 5 2 personal care products compounds originating from pcps such as uv filters antifungal antibacterial chemicals disinfectants insect repellents fragrances preservatives etc have also been detected at significant concentrations in several countries amdany et al 2014 archana et al 2017 godayol et al 2015 the booming of cosmetic industries has led to extensive use and release of pcps particularly from urbanized locations among all the ecs 11 antifungal antibacterial compounds were detected in global wastewaters with 4 of them triclocarban triclosan methylparaben and irgasan quantified above 1 μg l irgasan was the most concentrated contaminant both in the influents and effluents of this category reported from india table 1 archana et al 2017 followed by triclosan in south africa amdany et al 2014 these compounds showed positive removal with considerably high concentrations in the treated wastewaters high concentrations of fragrances and preservatives used in cosmetics such as dihydromyrcenol dhmol galaxolide hhcb celestolide adbi and many others have also been identified in the wastewaters however their concentrations in untreated wastewaters were much lower than the antifungal antibacterial compounds all the predominant compounds of fragrances and preservatives category were significantly reduced except hhcb lactone biotransformation of hhcb during activated sludge based biological process increased the concentration of hhcb lactone in spain vallecillos et al 2014 however the same study also confirmed the efficacy of the ro based advanced tertiary method by a substantial reduction in the analyte s concentration only one compound used in insect repellents i e n n diethyl meta toluamide deet was detected above 1 μg l in singapore tran et al 2018 uv filters such as benzophenone oxybenzone and benzophenone 4 commonly present in cosmetic products like sunscreens have also been recorded at significant amounts with comparatively higher concentrations in the effluents than in the influents however studies that reported higher effluent concentrations of the aforementioned compounds did not report their corresponding influent concentration making it difficult to establish their removal efficiency nonetheless benzophenone has endocrine disrupting properties and therefore even such levels in the treated waters can be detrimental to living organisms particularly human beings surfactants another commonly found ecs in wastewaters are widely used as wetting agents detergents disinfectants and emulsifying agents according to our findings surfactants have been studied only in greece gago ferrero et al 2020 with influent concentrations ranging from 1 μg l to 431 μg l emphasizing the need for its surveillance in other nations as well however the concentration of surfactants was significantly reduced indicating the efficiency of the conventional secondary treatment methods 5 3 industrial and commercial chemicals besides pharmaceuticals and pcps chemicals manufactured or and used in industries and commercial processes including plasticizers phthalates and flame retardants also occur predominantly in global wastewaters gago ferrero et al 2020 gani et al 2016 gao et al 2014 karthikraj and kannan 2017 the overall global influent and effluent concentrations of industrial chemicals showed moderate removal and phthalates including plasticizers did not vary significantly in contrast the post treatment wastewaters reported higher flame retardant levels than the raw untreated wastewaters among all the compounds documented in this class benzothiazoles karthikraj and kannan 2017 and diethylhexyl phthalate gani et al 2016 reported in india and tboep tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate in the usa have been quantified with concentrations above 100 μg l in either raw untreated wastewaters or treated wastewaters or both phthalates such as butyl benzyl phthalate and di n octyl phthalate and flame retardants such as bdcipp bis 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate pbdpp p p 1 3 phenylene p p p p tetraphenyl ester phosphate tboep tcipp tris 1 chloro 2 24 propyl phosphate and tdcipp tris 1 3 dichloro 2 propyl phosphate showed negative removal after treatment therefore the primary and secondary sludge based techniques implemented to remove these compounds demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the treatment methods furthermore our findings also revealed that very few countries phthalates in china greece india serbia and flame retardants in new zealand and the usa had investigated compounds belonging to this category highlighting the pressing need for its research in other nations a vast number of compounds belonging to pesticides and perfluoroalkyl compounds were also documented with all of them included in the low concentration class see supplementary material table s1 such high concentrations and large numbers of industrial and commercially used chemicals can be toxic for the biota present in the receiving water bodies 5 4 artificial sweeteners the widespread utilization of artificial sweeteners asws in food industries to produce sugar less minimum calories food products and extensive human consumption due to its non glycemic effect insulin response has led to the mass discharge of the compounds in the natural environment kookana et al 2013 the majority of the asws are excreted from human bodies without undergoing any transformation and metabolism and hence are present at very high levels in various environmental matrices according to our findings only four compounds acesulfame cyclamate saccharin and sucralose have been detected in the wastewaters of four nations diaz sosa et al 2020 gago ferrero et al 2020 liu et al 2016 subedi et al 2015 tran et al 2015 2019 with no significant reduction in the overall worldwide concentration the order of these compounds based on their overall concentration is saccharine cyclamate acesulfame sucralose the highest concentration of saccharine was reported in india subedi et al 2015 saccharine is the cheapest and most extensively used artificial sweetener in the country which explains its dominant presence in the indian wastewaters tripathi et al 2006 the prevention of adulteration of food act in india allows 100 mg kg of saccharine in carbonated drinks however other products like pan masala ice candy and crushed ice were found to have higher amounts of saccharine than the permitted quantity tripathi et al 2006 even after treatment the maximum effluent concentration of saccharine was extremely high 379 μg l indicating towards inefficiency of the treatment method employed for its removal subedi et al 2015 the influent concentration of the other three compounds of this group acesulfame cyclamate and sucralose ranged from 1 μg l to 40 μg l with their maximum levels reported from singapore fig 5cand d similar to other compounds the conventional treatment processes resulted in elevated concentrations of this class and the lack of attention paid to them ouda et al 2021 implies the need for further investigation and improvement of the existing removal mechanisms or the development of new methods to treat this class from sewages properly 5 5 other contaminants another interesting finding of this study was the occurrence of naturally occurring chemical compounds i e amino acids in the wastewaters the presence of these compounds has been mostly neglected due to their natural origin a total of 8 amino acid compounds were screened in the wastewaters of greece with influent concentrations greater than 1 μg l thus included in the predominant class positive removal was observed for most amino acids except g aminobutiric acid gaba whose concentration increased after treatment the concentration of certain compounds marked in bold in table 1 increased after the treatment process which could be due to the microbial transformation of conjugate molecules during the conventional primary and secondary treatment process gulkowska et al 2008 miao et al 2002 subedi et al 2015 therefore the incomplete elimination and increase in the concentration of these contaminants reveal the inefficiency of commonly practiced conventional removal techniques and advanced tertiary methods 6 global versus indian concentration of emerging contaminants with a large population developing nations like india generate approximately 62 million liters of sewage daily the number of wwtps present in the country is about 37 of the total wastewater generated most of which are equipped with only primary and secondary treatment facilities treating merely 30 of the sewage and discharging large volumes of raw and ineffectively treated wastewater to the environment while others are non operational cpcb 2015 it was also discovered that 39 of wwtps do not adhere to the authorized limitations when releasing effluents into aquatic systems many small towns and rural areas lack wwtps as a result of the insufficient number of operational wwtps and the absence of regulatory enforcement india can expect increased ec emissions into the environment subedi et al 2017 furthermore due to the country s water scarcity the agricultural sector has been compelled to rely on wastewater for irrigation introducing these toxic chemicals into the soil and ultimately the food chain sharma et al 2019 until now most of the studies in india have reported ecs in river waters biswas and vellanki 2021 chakraborty et al 2021 selvaraj et al 2021 sharma et al 2019 with relatively less information from treated and untreated wastewaters the concentration of ecs in surface waters is generally observed to be decreasing owing to dilution arman et al 2021 because the compounds already existing in the water bodies can react and generate transformation products in some situations knowing the types of ecs and their concentrations in wastewaters collected at the treatment unit outlets can aid in understanding their behavior 86 ecs were quantified in indian wastewaters belonging to a wide range of classes like in other countries most of the compounds studied in india were pharmaceuticals likewise antibiotics have been detected the most with an overall influent and effluent concentration of 0 059 μg l 263 3 μg l and 0 0625 μg l 51 82 μg l respectively followed by cardiovascular agents and anti inflammatories analgesics probably because india is one of the leading producers of pharmaceuticals with very high consumption rates as well archana et al 2017 table 2 compares the concentrations of all ecs found in india to their corresponding global concentrations many parent contaminants and some metabolites and transformation products were only quantified in india such as irgasan table 2 highlights similar compounds with unusually high levels recorded in indian wastewaters in india significant negative removal for ibuprofen naproxen sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim atenolol and other drugs was observed as opposed to the global setting where it was effectively treated contrarily the post treatment concentration of antibiotic compounds ciprofloxacin and lincomycin and uv filters benzophenone and oxybenzone increased globally but was positively removed in india despite the various treatment processes employed the concentration of carbamazepine inclined in both the indian and global contexts indicating the inefficiency of the treatment techniques adopted and other factors that could have influenced the concentration to rise such as environmental and physicochemical parameters of the treatment units the compound specific characteristics of contaminants that exhibited negative removal also need to be further analyzed to draw conclusions on their behavior in the wastewaters that enhance their concentrations also the effluent concentration of pharmaceutical compounds such as ampicillin trimethoprim carbamazepine and caffeine also a stimulant was comparatively higher than the global levels fig 6 caffeine showed positive removal worldwide including in india with effluent concentration still considerably very high indicating moderate efficiency of both the conventional and advanced treatment methods employed in the wwtps also two metabolites belonging to the stimulants class i e 3 4 methylenedioxyamphetamine and 3 4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine were detected in indian wastewaters with a slight increase in concentration after treatment this suggests that not only the applied methods are unable to remove them but the conjugated forms of the contaminants undergo a microbial transformation during the treatment process increasing the concentration of the parent compounds in the effluents calisto and esteves 2009 as well triclocarban and triclosan were also detected in indian wastewaters triclocarban reduced significantly in both contexts whereas triclosan levels remained the same in india even after treatment the effluent concentration of the asws detected in india was much lower than worldwide except for saccharine the extremely high concentration of saccharine in both the untreated and treated wastewaters in india is extremely concerning requiring immediate attention in this regard among the chemicals released from industrial and commercial activities and products the concentrations of phthalates and benzothiazoles were detected in indian wastewaters at significantly higher levels table 2 the concentration of benzothiazoles in indian wastewaters was reported to be the highest globally suggesting its extensive usage in the country released primarily from rubber and textile products although positive reduction with varying degrees of removal was observed for all the compounds the overall effluent concentration ranged from 0 0176 μg l to 106 548 μg l suggesting incomplete or inefficient removal phthalates are carcinogenic and can also disrupt the endocrine system hence even much lower levels of these chemicals can be detrimental india is the only country that reported all the bisphenol compounds bisphenol analogues and other industrial and commercial chemicals in its wastewaters unlike others that monitored only diethyl phthalate and bisphenol a diethyl phthalate has been detected in the wastewaters of china and greece with the global influent concentration 16 86 μg l slightly higher than in india 16 375 μg l however the effluent concentration of this phthalate compound was more elevated in india than in the other two countries fig 6 where it was reported all the ecs that were found to be predominantly present in the indian effluents have been shown in fig 7 therefore their occurrence in the environment is a critical issue and should not be ignored 7 mitigation strategies wwtps are primarily responsible for the presence of a large number of ecs at elevated concentrations in the natural environment therefore all the necessary steps must be taken to address this emerging problem due to the difficulty of detecting and treating ecs regulations requiring the limited environmental discharge of the compounds and public awareness must be emphasized however given the societal dependence on these compounds reducing ecs by acting on the source is impossible as a result developing effective techniques to eliminate ecs is critical for lowering potential public health threats also complete information on the bioaccumulation properties and ecotoxicological consequences of ecs in the food web and the hazards to the local ecology and human health is necessary for proper prioritization of ecs removal in wwtps they are rarely monitored because of the dearth of knowledge about the persistence and toxicity of ecs transformed products the extraction of ecs or their transformation products from intricate environmental matrices and their measurement and identification should be the focus of new methods development furthermore the treatment efficiency of different wwtp processes needs re evaluation to determine the contaminant wise best suited process lastly most of the traditional treatment processes have certain disadvantages as they were not designed to remove this novel category of contaminants on the other hand emerging technologies are expensive and inappropriate for commercial usage in underdeveloped countries as a result combining traditional and developing methods should be considered to strike a balance between feasibility and cost therefore the development of universally accessible relatively cheaper and user friendly treatment solutions should be prioritized besides the type of treatment implemented compound specific properties environmental conditions sewage intake rate and physicochemical parameters in the wwtps also influence the concentration levels of these contaminants in effluents all of these parameters must be taken into account while determining the optimized treatment process 8 conclusions this review broadly discusses the occurrence sources fate known impacts global and national status of ecs in treated and untreated wastewaters and the mitigation approaches that can help deal with this problem according to our findings the conventional wwtps are efficient to a certain degree in treating ecs very high removal efficiency observed for anti diabetics however it may not be accurate for all the classes of the contaminants the contamination levels of certain compounds anti depressants anti psychotics etc increased after treatment while a few artificial sweeteners phthalates etc also displayed insignificant removal also asws naturally occurring amino acids and surfactants in wastewaters have often been neglected irrespective of their exceedingly high concentration similarly irgasan benzothiazoles and other phthalate compounds were quite prominent in india and reported nowhere else in the world exceptionally high concentrations of these compounds can be toxic and would create challenging future scenarios and require immediate and equal focus like the commonly studied compounds furthermore their impacts have been explored individually and mostly on aquatic animals the information on the combined impacts of two or more compounds and the implications of ecs on aquatic photosynthetic organisms agricultural and non agricultural plants and terrestrial animals need further and detailed investigation a thorough understanding and modeling of the fate of these contaminants will essentially aid in forecasting their effects on the natural environment ecs can be challenging if left unregulated hence this extensive understanding will help determine its permissible limits and formulate policies that would include these chemical compounds in the regular surveillance and monitoring programs these policies must also be enforced globally to help generate
