15610,landfills are the main plastic sinks and microplastics mps sources in the anthropogenic terrestrial system understanding the dynamic process of generating mps is a prerequisite to reducing their potential risk which remains unexplored because of the complex stabilization process of landfills in this study we investigated the evolution process of mps generated in a partitioned landfill with well recorded disposal ages of over 30 years considering the initial plastic proportions in fresh landfilled waste the occurrence of mps increased exponentially with the disposal age a booming generation of mps occurred from 71 3 17 7 items g plastic to 653 1 191 5 items g plastic the generation rates of mps varied greatly depending on the individual polymer types with polyethylene pe having the highest generation rate of 28 4 items g plastic per year at 31 years compared to that of polypropylene pp and polystyrene ps at 15 0 and 9 6 items g plastic per year respectively the variation in the carbonyl index indicated that environmental oxidation might facilitate the fragmentation of plastic waste the relative abundance of plastic degrading microbes increased more than three times in the plastisphere after 30 years of landfilling indicating that the potential biodegradation might be a nonnegligible driver for plastic fragmentation after long term natural acclimatization this study revealed the dynamic evolution process of mps in landfills and predicted the booming stage which might provide an important guideline for reducing the leakage risk of mps

generation rate biodegradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction landfills are the ultimate sink for plastic waste in the terrestrial ecosystem approximately 300 million tons of plastic waste accounting for over 10 of annual municipal solid waste msw were generated worldwide annually and more than half of them were disposed of in landfills geyer et al 2017 kaza 2018 lebreton and andrady 2019 despite the huge efforts that have been invested in reducing landfilled msw the number of landfills and the accumulation of plastics has continuously increased due to economic growth and urbanization process cai et al 2018 geyer et al 2017 kaza 2018 considering the current growth rate the mass of plastic waste accumulated in landfills is predicted to double over the near three decades revell et al 2021 usually landfills should operate for more than 20 years and the aftercare period of landfills would continue for several decades after closure epa 2007 turner et al 2017 thus plastic waste in landfills undergoes a long term and complex evolution process with five stabilization stages under the coupling drivers of geomechanics hydromechanics thermology and biology chen et al 2020 de la cruz et al 2021 mcdougall 2007 wijekoon et al 2022 yadav et al 2020 despite the inherent durability and stability of plastics they will undergo a macro to micro process during an extended disposal time forming microplastics mps that can infiltrate many places fu et al 2020 these mps may be released into the environment via leachate aerosol or landfill mining afrin et al 2020 he et al 2019 yadav et al 2020 and unregulated or poor management would increase the risks of mp leakage in particular the mps could act as vectors of contaminants such as heavy metals antibiotic resistance genes and organic pollutants shi et al 2021 su et al 2019 the chemical substances contained in mps can be released and caused harm to organisms bharath k et al 2021 microplastics have been observed in some landfills recently and the abundance of mps in waste and leachates was higher than those in surface rivers and soil he et al 2019 liu et al 2018 mccormick et al 2014 silva et al 2021 su et al 2019 to reduce the interference of other waste in landfills laser direct infrared spectroscopy and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry were employed to identify the mps in landfills zhang et al 2021 the variations in the physicochemical characteristics of polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp were measured after 10 years of burial canopoli et al 2020 the occurrence of mps under discontinuous or narrow time spans has been identified by previous studies however delineating the mechanism of mps generation under a continuous and long term temporal pattern could provide substantial information on how to avoid or reduce the risk of mps generation and spread in such plastic tombs some researchers simulated the degradation of plastics in lab scale experiments over two years xochitl et al 2021 but the scale and time effects reduced the accuracy of the mps evolution process and could not reflect the reality of landfilling landfills are the main plastic sinks and microplastics mps sources in the anthropogenic terrestrial system understanding the evolution process of mps in landfills is key to reducing the potential risk of mps pollution the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the dynamic evolution process of mps under a continuous temporal pattern and characterized the mps of different ages 2 reveal the potential biodegradation of plastic polymers in landfills by tracing the variation of plastic degrading microbes and 3 predict the accumulation of mps in landfills and provide a recommendation for risk reduction to explain the overall footprint of the evolution process and aging characteristics of mps the study was conducted in a long term operated landfill with separated compartments we considered the composition of the initial waste composition into consideration to reduce the uncertainty of the plastic components to determine one of the main drivers of plastic degradation the microbial communities in the plastisphere and the surrounding environment were analyzed our data could provide an important guideline for reducing landfill reclamation risk 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling collection the selected representative landfill is located in shanghai china it is divided into more than 53 compartments with different disposal ages and has been in operation since 1989 with more than 28 08 million tons of msw disposed of in phases i iii information on disposal capacity and waste composition were recorded annually to ensure consistency among the environmental factors samplings were conducted at the same depth and the selected cell compartments were under the same operating conditions without leachate recirculation the selected cell compartments covered a large span of disposal ages ranging from 7 to 31 years and two to three sampling holes were drilled in each cell compartment fig 1 a the sampled cores were collected using a drilling machine sh 30a type jiangsu xitan china with a sawtooth end sleeve drilling diameter 12 cm hammering to the depths of 2 4 and 8 m respectively fig 1b the edge of each core 2 cm was removed to prevent the contamination during the drilling process the treated cores of different depths from one sampling hole were manually homogenized into one sample 6 8 kg and the quartering method was employed to collect the test sample collected samples were immediately stored in an aluminum foil bag and some were stored at 80 c for subsequent microbiological analysis the disposal ages of the collected samples were grouped into six sets starting from samples with disposal ages of 10 years to samples with disposal ages of 30 years 2 2 microplastics separation and identification the mps separation protocol was implemented using a modified method described in previous studies li et al 2018 su et al 2019 the details of the mps separation protocol are described in the supporting information text s1 and a visual description of the procedure is shown in fig 1c the separation process above was conducted in triplicate and the average values were presented the suspected mps retained in the sieves 37 μm were inspected and counted under a stereomicroscope sz61 olympus japan according to their morphological characteristics which were categorized as fiber slender and soft material film sheet like material with two dimensional extension sphere particles without edges fragment irregular pieces of broken items with three dimensional extension shaft long and hard cylindrical bar and cluster a mass of fibers the typical types of mps are shown in fig s1 the selected items were examined and photographed under a super depth of field microscope vhx 6000 keyence japan the fuzzy item was individually transferred to a glass slide and observed on the screen in high resolution form which vividly presented the morphology of the item and reduced artificial judgment errors a subset with over 80 of the suspected plastic items was randomly chosen and identified using the micro fourier transform infrared spectrometer μftir nicolet in10 mx thermo fisher scientific usa the polymer type was identified after the obtained spectra were matched with the omnic spectrum library the recovery experiment was performed to assess the reliability of the methods three typical types of plastic particles were used to stimulate the mps in the waste samples the size of the plastic particles ranged from 75 to 1000 μm marked in yellow these plastic particles were spiked into clean waste samples which had previously undergone the mps extraction the separation and quantification of plastic particles were performed using the procedure described above the results showed that the extraction efficiency ranged from 89 3 3 1 to 100 table s1 indicating that the separation and counting methods of this study were efficient and reliable 2 3 characterization of mps changes in the functional groups of aged microplastics were characterized by μftir and the carbonyl index ci was calculated to identify the degree of polymer degradation ter halle et al 2017 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was implied to analyze the chemical compositions of mps the contact angle and morphology were characterized by an optical contact angle goniometer dsa100 kruss germany and scanning electron microscope rise magna tescan czech republic the details of the analysis method are described in text s2 2 4 dna extraction and sequencing the dna extraction method is based on previous studies li et al 2019 niu et al 2021 for the plastisphere the mps collected from the waste samples were washed with deionized water to remove soil and waste on their surface and the dna of the colonized microbial community was extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa for surrounding waste sw all materials at least 1 mm away from the plastic surface were collected and used for dna extraction in triplicate using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa the dna extraction from both the plastisphere and surrounding waste was conducted in triplicate the details of the dna extraction and the subsequent 16s rna sequencing are described in text s3 2 5 data analysis we used the ratio of mps number in waste to the proportion of plastic waste to represent the abundance of mps in waste and expressed this as the number of mps per gram of plastic waste the generation rate of mps was calculated and expressed as mps items generated per gram of plastic waste per year and an exponential was fitted r 2 0 74 p 0 05 pearson correlation analysis between mps items and disposal ages was conducted using spss spss statistics 19 ibm and was found to be significant p 0 01 the fragmentation rate curves were fitted to an exponential growth using originpro 2021 software originlab co ma and one way analysis of variance anova was also performed to quantify the variability statistical significance was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 mps generation process under temporal pattern the ratio of mps number to the proportion of plastic waste mps pw was used to reflect the actual abundance of mps in the landfill and was defined by the number of mps items in per gram of plastic waste the proportions of plastic waste are shown in fig s2 the mps pw increased from 71 3 17 7 items g plastic to 653 1 191 5 items g plastic fig 2 a as the disposal time lapsed the mps pw mainly remained stable pre 15 years of landfilling while a sharp increase was observed after 25 years the relationship between the mps pw and the disposal age showed a positive correlation pearson s r 0 80 p 0 01 fig s3 indicating that the generation process of mps was closely associated with the disposal age the evolution process of mps was well fitted to an exponential curve r 2 0 95 p 0 01 indicating that the formation of mps is a gradually accelerated process three predominant polymer types including pe pp and polystyrene ps were selected and the individual evolution process was developed with a similar exponential growth fig 2b d the abundance of pe reached 163 3 items g plastic which was more than twice that of ps a distinction in the generation rate of mps from different mother plastics was found fig s4 and pe had the highest generation rate at 31 years with 28 4 items g plastic per year compared to pp and ps which was 15 0 and 9 6 items g plastic per year respectively polyethylene especially low density polyethylene ldpe films are widely used in food packaging carrier bags and textile products which are generally fragile and generate mps moharir and kumar 2019 differential structures also lead to the different degradability of plastic polymers stubbins et al 2021 plastics with unsaturated double bonds generally degraded more easily than plastics with saturated bonds however additives metals and catalyst residues added to plastic polymers would accelerate the degradation of plastics with saturated bonds canopoli et al 2018 thus the abundance and degradation rate varied depending on the polymer type 3 2 indicators identification for mps generation process the shapes polymer types colors and sizes of mps are shown in fig 3 the smaller plastic debris 0 5 mm was found to be correlated with the disposal age p 0 001 and the proportion gradually increased with the disposal age from 42 1 to 67 8 reaching a peak value at 25 30 years fig s5a the results indicated that the plastics were destined for the micro or nano processes and the percentage of small plastic debris might be an indicator of plastic fragmentation diverse polymer types were found in these mps samples while more than 70 of them were pe pp and ps because pe and pp are widely used for food packaging sweet and snack wrappers microwave containers and agricultural films in our daily life plasticseurope 2020 millions of tons of discarded plastic packaging flowed into the landfill system over recent decades resulting in the presence of mps films at a mean proportion of 41 1 followed by fragments and fibers with mean proportions of 24 9 and 18 8 respectively most of the colors were white and transparent with mean values of 45 4 and 18 3 respectively the overall shapes polymer types and colors did not differ significantly with different disposal ages showing that these parameters cannot be used as indicators fig s5b 3 3 variations of aging characteristics of mps 3 3 1 morphology the surface morphology of mps at different magnifications is shown in fig 4 a a smooth surface or corrugated structure was found in the 7 years old samples however small holes and microcracks began to form thereafter while numerous holes and deeper cracks appeared irregularly on the surface as the disposal age increased the cracks and holes on the surface occurred because of long term environmental degradation induced by heat light chemicals and mechanical power chamas et al 2020 moharir and kumar 2019 wang et al 2021a these cracks and holes would increase the surface area for microbial colonization providing access for microbes to the polymer bulk which may enhance the biodegradation of plastics adamcová et al 2018 singh and sharma 2008 the contact angles of mps were analyzed to explore the hydrophilic characteristics of mps fig 4b the corresponding contact angles of mps distinctly dropped from 89 6 1 4 to 80 6 0 5 indicating that the long term aging process enhanced the hydrophilicity of mps which may allow them to adsorb various pollutants yu et al 2019 3 3 2 chemical compositions the functional groups of mps are presented in fig 5 a broad peak at 3200 3400 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl group oh huang et al 2020 a new characteristic peak was observed at 1780 1600 cm 1 which was associated with the structure of the carbonyl group c o the occurrence of a carbonyl signal might result from the chemical biological oxidation or enzymatic reactions on the plastic polymers in the landfill potrykus et al 2021 the generation of hydroxylated chemical groups such as the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups led to the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity lin et al 2020 the carbonyl index ci the calculation formula described in text s2 values of three typical plastic polymers were small around 0 10 at disposal age 10 years and visibly increased as the disposal age increased indicating an enhancement of the degradation degree of plastic polymers the corresponding values of pe pp and ps increased from 0 156 0 04 0 121 0 03 and 0 09 0 02 to 2 63 0 37 0 97 0 12 and 0 36 0 03 respectively during the landfill stabilization process while pe had the most significant increase more than ten times positive relationships were found between ci values and disposal ages p 0 05 suggesting that plastics could be decomposed as the disposal age increased which is similar to other organic matters and unlike durable resistant matters the surface chemical composition of mps was analyzed using xps fig 6 the high resolution spectra of c1s were employed and presented in fig 6b d and f to explore the bonding modes of c1 s the c1s peak could be deconvoluted into three peaks with bonding energy at 284 78 285 58 and 287 50 ev corresponding to the functional groups c c c o and c o respectively in particular the peak area of c o increased from 1001 3 to 1314 8 during the span of the disposal age this increase was associated with the carbonyl signal and was consistent with the previously mentioned changes in the functional groups in the ftir spectra 3 4 microbial analysis and the potential induced degradation for mps the α diversity indices including shannon chao 1 and ace were used to evaluate the complexity of the microbial communities fig s7 the shannon chao 1 and ace indices values of aged refuse collected in the initial stage remained relatively stable all index values showed an upward trend with the highest values being observed after 30 years indicating that the microbial communities of the plastisphere and surrounding waste tend to be more diverse after long term landfilling the compositions of the microbial communities with different disposal ages at the phylum level were shown in fig s8 firmicutes 14 9 82 3 chloroflexi 2 6 27 0 and proteobacteria 2 2 26 3 were the predominant phyla found in the substrates of the surrounding waste and plastisphere which were commonly detected in the landfill ecosystem song et al 2015 the proportion of firmicutes and proteobacteria presented a sharp increase in the initial period because of the abundant ready biodegradable organic matters in the fresh waste as they readily assist in decomposing this type of materials wang et al 2021b however the number of these microbes started to decline as the biodegradable organic matter decomposed therefore the composition of the microbial communities at the genus level was further investigated fig 7 a clear differences among microbial communities at different disposal ages were observed t test p 0 05 in the plastisphere sbr1031 17 2 and thiobacillus 10 5 were the most dominant genera in samples aged for 10 years in comparison the samples preserved in the landfill for 30 years showed a different fingerprint of predominant microbes and the main genera were anaerolineae 9 5 sbr1031 8 1 and js1 6 9 a principal component analysis pca revealed the similarity of microbial composition between the surrounding waste and the plastisphere under a spatial pattern fig 6b this suggests that mps may serve as a comfortable habitat for microbes de tender et al 2015 as for the temporal pattern the microbial communities of aged samples of 10 years and 30 years were differentiated from each other and the samples with a disposal age of 10 25 years were clustered into a group in both pc1 and pc2 these results demonstrated the evolution process of colonized biofilm during the landfill process and the microbial communities of aged refuse showed a significant distinction from those in fresh waste t test p 0 05 the indicative plastic degrading microbes i e acinetobacter bacillus pseudomonas straptomyces and methylobacter were found in both the surrounding waste and plastisphere fig 7c which have been proven to possess the ability to degrade plastic polymers niu et al 2021 veethahavya et al 2016 the relative abundances of indicative plastic degrading microbes show a temporal increase with the disposal age by more than three times plastic degrading microbes would secrete exoenzymes to break down the polymeric structures and transform polymers into oligomers dimers and monomers palmisano and pettigrew 1992 all these short monomeric chains can be utilized as a carbon source moharir and kumar 2019 biodegradation effects might lead to a decrease in the stability of plastic polymers in the environment hence the plastic waste landfilled for decades was more likely to disintegrate into mps 4 discussion 4 1 the dynamic distribution patterns of mps in the landfill plastic waste in landfills was supposed to be degraded instead of inert substances which was similar to the ready organic matter in landfills however the degradation rate of plastic was very slow as the specific surface degradation rate of high density polyethylene only ranged from 0 to 11 μm per year chamas et al 2020 the distinction between the degradation rates of organic matter and plastic waste in landfills prompted us to consider the proportion of plastic waste in fresh waste and describe the evolution process of mps in terms of items g plastic especially since this phenomenon has been neglected in previous studies su et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 plastic waste of different years should be collected and assessed under a dynamic pattern instead of investigating samples of a static or discontinuous disposal age it is important to identify the dynamic evolution process of mps in waste with different disposal ages under continuous temporal trends by considering the initial plastic proportion the dynamic evolution process of mps followed an exponential growth and a booming generation stage could be set after 25 years of landfilling macroscopically landfills were static and mild containers with a complex and intense reaction to plastics in the initial stage plastic polymers maintained their stability which made it difficult to form mps however dramatic environmental factors including aerobic or anaerobic oxidation leachate erosion physical press high temperature and microbial activities directly or indirectly broke down the physicochemical structure of plastic polymers and facilitated the embrittlement of macroplastics hao et al 2017 kjeldsen et al 2002 mahon et al 2017 plastic waste became fragile and more likely to break down into small debris after long term stabilization processes in landfills resulting in the booming generation of mps the mps items smaller than 0 5 mm accounted for most of plastic stocks their proportion gradually increased and had a positive correlation with disposal age p 0 001 fig s5a thus the size distribution of mps may be used as an indicator to assess whether the landfill has entered a booming stage of mps generation 4 2 mps accumulation prediction and risk reduction recommendation the exponential evolution process of mps provided a solid foundation for predicting mps generation and quantifying the phenomenon of mps accumulation the annual generation rate could be deduced from the exponential curves of the mps evolution process fig s9 the amounts of mps generated dt and accumulated qt were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 d t i 0 t p i m i k t i 10 6 2 q t i 0 t p i m i c m e e t t 10 6 where dt is the number of mps generated within 1 year of t years landfill items qt is the number of accumulated mps in the landfill after t years burial items t is the buried time of the msw in the landfill from the beginning years p is the proportion of plastic in the msw m is the mass of msw landfilled within 1 year of t years operation tons kt is the generation rate of t years burial items g year plastic cm is the mps correction factor 2 843 and ct is the disposal age correction factor 0 174 in a business as usual scenario which follows the same operational conditions and the average generation rate continues to increase exponentially fig s9 one ton of plastics buried in the landfill was estimated to generate around 4 7 billion items of mps annually after 50 years of landfilling resulting in a total of 17 1 billion items of accumulated mps for example shanghai produced 9 5 million tons of landfilled msw from 1991 to 2018 fig s2 considering the annual proportion of plastic waste shown in fig s2 mps were projected to accumulate approximately 5 6 trillion items in landfills in shanghai here we did not take into account the development of biodegradable plastic a new tendency under the rise of environmental consciousness bioplastics are considered to be biodegradable and environmentally friendly which may have an impact on the generation process of mps however they have also been shown to be a potential source of mps generated and cause of environmental problems accinelli et al 2020 edo et al 2022 lópez ibáñez and beiras 2022 our results suggested that the landfill is a timebomb owing to the burgeoning number of mps therefore the risk of mps pollution cannot be neglected or underestimated during the landfill reclamation process the risk of mps leakage varied greatly from different levels of management the dumping sites with poor management had a more serious mps leakage risk without the sophisticated construction and environmental protection measures the surface runoff and leachate were prone to transport mps to the surrounding environment the unsealed landfill piles made it possible to transfer the mps to remote areas via the airborne spread and might attract animals looking for food resulting in the unintentional ingestion of mps fei et al 2021 wan et al 2022 yadav et al 2020 in contrast well managed landfills have stringently designed operation and closure requirements and the leachate might be the main pathway for mps discharged into the environment although leachate treatment facilities can remove more than 98 of mps lares et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 the effluence of sludge might introduce the mps to the environment it should be noted that a significant number of mps accumulated in landfills have made their way into the environment by wind surface runoff leachate and landfill mining canopoli et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 and the leakage of mps have already been found in the nearby environments of landfills bharath k et al 2021 kazour et al 2019 with the enhancement of hydrophilicity mps can also adsorb contaminants and redistribute toxic substances to the environment wang et al 2018 the unintentional intake of mps would certainly cause physical injury to animals or human beings chu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 considering the deleterious effect of accumulating mps the burden on the environment appears inevitable because mps surged exponentially their accumulation will introduce a greater burden on the environment in the future to date it is still inaccessible to remove mps in landfills economically and technologically thus the waste legacy in old landfills will remain a problem in the foreseeable future to solve problems of old dumping sites with poor management and increase landfill capacity landfill excavation mining has been employed in the past era krook et al 2012 lou et al 2015 however the excavation and screening separation of deposited materials in landfills would release the mps via the airborne spread and the fine fraction utilized for soil application might redistribute mps to the environment our results found that the mps generation would step into the booming stage after 25 years of landfilling thus if excavation is carried out before that stage it might mitigate the mps pollution future research should develop efficient separation processes to remove mps from deposited waste 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to quantify the mps generation process under a continuous temporal pattern while considering the initial proportion of plastic waste to modify the actual abundance of mps in landfills the dynamic generation process of mps with exponential growth was found with the landfill age the proportion of small sized mps 0 5 mm showed a positive relationship with disposal age and can possibly be used as an indicator to assess whether the landfill has entered a booming stage of mps generation the results of this study provide valuable information for understanding the dynamic process of mps generated in landfills providing an important guideline for reducing the landfill reclamation risk further works should be carried out to quantify the influence of different factors such as temperature mechanical pressure and microbial activities on plastic degradation and further investigate the underlying mechanism of the dynamic generation

an aluminum foil bag and some were stored at 80 c for subsequent microbiological analysis the disposal ages of the collected samples were grouped into six sets starting from samples with disposal ages of 10 years to samples with disposal ages of 30 years 2 2 microplastics separation and identification the mps separation protocol was implemented using a modified method described in previous studies li et al 2018 su et al 2019 the details of the mps separation protocol are described in the supporting information text s1 and a visual description of the procedure is shown in fig 1c the separation process above was conducted in triplicate and the average values were presented the suspected mps retained in the sieves 37 μm were inspected and counted under a stereomicroscope sz61 olympus japan according to their morphological characteristics which were categorized as fiber slender and soft material film sheet like material with two dimensional extension sphere particles without edges fragment irregular pieces of broken items with three dimensional extension shaft long and hard cylindrical bar and cluster a mass of fibers the typical types of mps are shown in fig s1 the selected items were examined and photographed under a super depth of field microscope vhx 6000 keyence japan the fuzzy item was individually transferred to a glass slide and observed on the screen in high resolution form which vividly presented the morphology of the item and reduced artificial judgment errors a subset with over 80 of the suspected plastic items was randomly chosen and identified using the micro fourier transform infrared spectrometer μftir nicolet in10 mx thermo fisher scientific usa the polymer type was identified after the obtained spectra were matched with the omnic spectrum library the recovery experiment was performed to assess the reliability of the methods three typical types of plastic particles were used to stimulate the mps in the waste samples the size of the plastic particles ranged from 75 to 1000 μm marked in yellow these plastic particles were spiked into clean waste samples which had previously undergone the mps extraction the separation and quantification of plastic particles were performed using the procedure described above the results showed that the extraction efficiency ranged from 89 3 3 1 to 100 table s1 indicating that the separation and counting methods of this study were efficient and reliable 2 3 characterization of mps changes in the functional groups of aged microplastics were characterized by μftir and the carbonyl index ci was calculated to identify the degree of polymer degradation ter halle et al 2017 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was implied to analyze the chemical compositions of mps the contact angle and morphology were characterized by an optical contact angle goniometer dsa100 kruss germany and scanning electron microscope rise magna tescan czech republic the details of the analysis method are described in text s2 2 4 dna extraction and sequencing the dna extraction method is based on previous studies li et al 2019 niu et al 2021 for the plastisphere the mps collected from the waste samples were washed with deionized water to remove soil and waste on their surface and the dna of the colonized microbial community was extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa for surrounding waste sw all materials at least 1 mm away from the plastic surface were collected and used for dna extraction in triplicate using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa the dna extraction from both the plastisphere and surrounding waste was conducted in triplicate the details of the dna extraction and the subsequent 16s rna sequencing are described in text s3 2 5 data analysis we used the ratio of mps number in waste to the proportion of plastic waste to represent the abundance of mps in waste and expressed this as the number of mps per gram of plastic waste the generation rate of mps was calculated and expressed as mps items generated per gram of plastic waste per year and an exponential was fitted r 2 0 74 p 0 05 pearson correlation analysis between mps items and disposal ages was conducted using spss spss statistics 19 ibm and was found to be significant p 0 01 the fragmentation rate curves were fitted to an exponential growth using originpro 2021 software originlab co ma and one way analysis of variance anova was also performed to quantify the variability statistical significance was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 mps generation process under temporal pattern the ratio of mps number to the proportion of plastic waste mps pw was used to reflect the actual abundance of mps in the landfill and was defined by the number of mps items in per gram of plastic waste the proportions of plastic waste are shown in fig s2 the mps pw increased from 71 3 17 7 items g plastic to 653 1 191 5 items g plastic fig 2 a as the disposal time lapsed the mps pw mainly remained stable pre 15 years of landfilling while a sharp increase was observed after 25 years the relationship between the mps pw and the disposal age showed a positive correlation pearson s r 0 80 p 0 01 fig s3 indicating that the generation process of mps was closely associated with the disposal age the evolution process of mps was well fitted to an exponential curve r 2 0 95 p 0 01 indicating that the formation of mps is a gradually accelerated process three predominant polymer types including pe pp and polystyrene ps were selected and the individual evolution process was developed with a similar exponential growth fig 2b d the abundance of pe reached 163 3 items g plastic which was more than twice that of ps a distinction in the generation rate of mps from different mother plastics was found fig s4 and pe had the highest generation rate at 31 years with 28 4 items g plastic per year compared to pp and ps which was 15 0 and 9 6 items g plastic per year respectively polyethylene especially low density polyethylene ldpe films are widely used in food packaging carrier bags and textile products which are generally fragile and generate mps moharir and kumar 2019 differential structures also lead to the different degradability of plastic polymers stubbins et al 2021 plastics with unsaturated double bonds generally degraded more easily than plastics with saturated bonds however additives metals and catalyst residues added to plastic polymers would accelerate the degradation of plastics with saturated bonds canopoli et al 2018 thus the abundance and degradation rate varied depending on the polymer type 3 2 indicators identification for mps generation process the shapes polymer types colors and sizes of mps are shown in fig 3 the smaller plastic debris 0 5 mm was found to be correlated with the disposal age p 0 001 and the proportion gradually increased with the disposal age from 42 1 to 67 8 reaching a peak value at 25 30 years fig s5a the results indicated that the plastics were destined for the micro or nano processes and the percentage of small plastic debris might be an indicator of plastic fragmentation diverse polymer types were found in these mps samples while more than 70 of them were pe pp and ps because pe and pp are widely used for food packaging sweet and snack wrappers microwave containers and agricultural films in our daily life plasticseurope 2020 millions of tons of discarded plastic packaging flowed into the landfill system over recent decades resulting in the presence of mps films at a mean proportion of 41 1 followed by fragments and fibers with mean proportions of 24 9 and 18 8 respectively most of the colors were white and transparent with mean values of 45 4 and 18 3 respectively the overall shapes polymer types and colors did not differ significantly with different disposal ages showing that these parameters cannot be used as indicators fig s5b 3 3 variations of aging characteristics of mps 3 3 1 morphology the surface morphology of mps at different magnifications is shown in fig 4 a a smooth surface or corrugated structure was found in the 7 years old samples however small holes and microcracks began to form thereafter while numerous holes and deeper cracks appeared irregularly on the surface as the disposal age increased the cracks and holes on the surface occurred because of long term environmental degradation induced by heat light chemicals and mechanical power chamas et al 2020 moharir and kumar 2019 wang et al 2021a these cracks and holes would increase the surface area for microbial colonization providing access for microbes to the polymer bulk which may enhance the biodegradation of plastics adamcová et al 2018 singh and sharma 2008 the contact angles of mps were analyzed to explore the hydrophilic characteristics of mps fig 4b the corresponding contact angles of mps distinctly dropped from 89 6 1 4 to 80 6 0 5 indicating that the long term aging process enhanced the hydrophilicity of mps which may allow them to adsorb various pollutants yu et al 2019 3 3 2 chemical compositions the functional groups of mps are presented in fig 5 a broad peak at 3200 3400 cm 1 was associated with the stretching vibrations of the hydroxyl group oh huang et al 2020 a new characteristic peak was observed at 1780 1600 cm 1 which was associated with the structure of the carbonyl group c o the occurrence of a carbonyl signal might result from the chemical biological oxidation or enzymatic reactions on the plastic polymers in the landfill potrykus et al 2021 the generation of hydroxylated chemical groups such as the hydroxyl and carbonyl groups led to the enhancement of surface hydrophilicity lin et al 2020 the carbonyl index ci the calculation formula described in text s2 values of three typical plastic polymers were small around 0 10 at disposal age 10 years and visibly increased as the disposal age increased indicating an enhancement of the degradation degree of plastic polymers the corresponding values of pe pp and ps increased from 0 156 0 04 0 121 0 03 and 0 09 0 02 to 2 63 0 37 0 97 0 12 and 0 36 0 03 respectively during the landfill stabilization process while pe had the most significant increase more than ten times positive relationships were found between ci values and disposal ages p 0 05 suggesting that plastics could be decomposed as the disposal age increased which is similar to other organic matters and unlike durable resistant matters the surface chemical composition of mps was analyzed using xps fig 6 the high resolution spectra of c1s were employed and presented in fig 6b d and f to explore the bonding modes of c1 s the c1s peak could be deconvoluted into three peaks with bonding energy at 284 78 285 58 and 287 50 ev corresponding to the functional groups c c c o and c o respectively in particular the peak area of c o increased from 1001 3 to 1314 8 during the span of the disposal age this increase was associated with the carbonyl signal and was consistent with the previously mentioned changes in the functional groups in the ftir spectra 3 4 microbial analysis and the potential induced degradation for mps the α diversity indices including shannon chao 1 and ace were used to evaluate the complexity of the microbial communities fig s7 the shannon chao 1 and ace indices values of aged refuse collected in the initial stage remained relatively stable all index values showed an upward trend with the highest values being observed after 30 years indicating that the microbial communities of the plastisphere and surrounding waste tend to be more diverse after long term landfilling the compositions of the microbial communities with different disposal ages at the phylum level were shown in fig s8 firmicutes 14 9 82 3 chloroflexi 2 6 27 0 and proteobacteria 2 2 26 3 were the predominant phyla found in the substrates of the surrounding waste and plastisphere which were commonly detected in the landfill ecosystem song et al 2015 the proportion of firmicutes and proteobacteria presented a sharp increase in the initial period because of the abundant ready biodegradable organic matters in the fresh waste as they readily assist in decomposing this type of materials wang et al 2021b however the number of these microbes started to decline as the biodegradable organic matter decomposed therefore the composition of the microbial communities at the genus level was further investigated fig 7 a clear differences among microbial communities at different disposal ages were observed t test p 0 05 in the plastisphere sbr1031 17 2 and thiobacillus 10 5 were the most dominant genera in samples aged for 10 years in comparison the samples preserved in the landfill for 30 years showed a different fingerprint of predominant microbes and the main genera were anaerolineae 9 5 sbr1031 8 1 and js1 6 9 a principal component analysis pca revealed the similarity of microbial composition between the surrounding waste and the plastisphere under a spatial pattern fig 6b this suggests that mps may serve as a comfortable habitat for microbes de tender et al 2015 as for the temporal pattern the microbial communities of aged samples of 10 years and 30 years were differentiated from each other and the samples with a disposal age of 10 25 years were clustered into a group in both pc1 and pc2 these results demonstrated the evolution process of colonized biofilm during the landfill process and the microbial communities of aged refuse showed a significant distinction from those in fresh waste t test p 0 05 the indicative plastic degrading microbes i e acinetobacter bacillus pseudomonas straptomyces and methylobacter were found in both the surrounding waste and plastisphere fig 7c which have been proven to possess the ability to degrade plastic polymers niu et al 2021 veethahavya et al 2016 the relative abundances of indicative plastic degrading microbes show a temporal increase with the disposal age by more than three times plastic degrading microbes would secrete exoenzymes to break down the polymeric structures and transform polymers into oligomers dimers and monomers palmisano and pettigrew 1992 all these short monomeric chains can be utilized as a carbon source moharir and kumar 2019 biodegradation effects might lead to a decrease in the stability of plastic polymers in the environment hence the plastic waste landfilled for decades was more likely to disintegrate into mps 4 discussion 4 1 the dynamic distribution patterns of mps in the landfill plastic waste in landfills was supposed to be degraded instead of inert substances which was similar to the ready organic matter in landfills however the degradation rate of plastic was very slow as the specific surface degradation rate of high density polyethylene only ranged from 0 to 11 μm per year chamas et al 2020 the distinction between the degradation rates of organic matter and plastic waste in landfills prompted us to consider the proportion of plastic waste in fresh waste and describe the evolution process of mps in terms of items g plastic especially since this phenomenon has been neglected in previous studies su et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 plastic waste of different years should be collected and assessed under a dynamic pattern instead of investigating samples of a static or discontinuous disposal age it is important to identify the dynamic evolution process of mps in waste with different disposal ages under continuous temporal trends by considering the initial plastic proportion the dynamic evolution process of mps followed an exponential growth and a booming generation stage could be set after 25 years of landfilling macroscopically landfills were static and mild containers with a complex and intense reaction to plastics in the initial stage plastic polymers maintained their stability which made it difficult to form mps however dramatic environmental factors including aerobic or anaerobic oxidation leachate erosion physical press high temperature and microbial activities directly or indirectly broke down the physicochemical structure of plastic polymers and facilitated the embrittlement of macroplastics hao et al 2017 kjeldsen et al 2002 mahon et al 2017 plastic waste became fragile and more likely to break down into small debris after long term stabilization processes in landfills resulting in the booming generation of mps the mps items smaller than 0 5 mm accounted for most of plastic stocks their proportion gradually increased and had a positive correlation with disposal age p 0 001 fig s5a thus the size distribution of mps may be used as an indicator to assess whether the landfill has entered a booming stage of mps generation 4 2 mps accumulation prediction and risk reduction recommendation the exponential evolution process of mps provided a solid foundation for predicting mps generation and quantifying the phenomenon of mps accumulation the annual generation rate could be deduced from the exponential curves of the mps evolution process fig s9 the amounts of mps generated dt and accumulated qt were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 d t i 0 t p i m i k t i 10 6 2 q t i 0 t p i m i c m e e t t 10 6 where dt is the number of mps generated within 1 year of t years landfill items qt is the number of accumulated mps in the landfill after t years burial items t is the buried time of the msw in the landfill from the beginning years p is the proportion of plastic in the msw m is the mass of msw landfilled within 1 year of t years operation tons kt is the generation rate of t years burial items g year plastic cm is the mps correction factor 2 843 and ct is the disposal age correction factor 0 174 in a business as usual scenario which follows the same operational conditions and the average generation rate continues to increase exponentially fig s9 one ton of plastics buried in the landfill was estimated to generate around 4 7 billion items of mps annually after 50 years of landfilling resulting in a total of 17 1 billion items of accumulated mps for example shanghai produced 9 5 million tons of landfilled msw from 1991 to 2018 fig s2 considering the annual proportion of plastic waste shown in fig s2 mps were projected to accumulate approximately 5 6 trillion items in landfills in shanghai here we did not take into account the development of biodegradable plastic a new tendency under the rise of environmental consciousness bioplastics are considered to be biodegradable and environmentally friendly which may have an impact on the generation process of mps however they have also been shown to be a potential source of mps generated and cause of environmental problems accinelli et al 2020 edo et al 2022 lópez ibáñez and beiras 2022 our results suggested that the landfill is a timebomb owing to the burgeoning number of mps therefore the risk of mps pollution cannot be neglected or underestimated during the landfill reclamation process the risk of mps leakage varied greatly from different levels of management the dumping sites with poor management had a more serious mps leakage risk without the sophisticated construction and environmental protection measures the surface runoff and leachate were prone to transport mps to the surrounding environment the unsealed landfill piles made it possible to transfer the mps to remote areas via the airborne spread and might attract animals looking for food resulting in the unintentional ingestion of mps fei et al 2021 wan et al 2022 yadav et al 2020 in contrast well managed landfills have stringently designed operation and closure requirements and the leachate might be the main pathway for mps discharged into the environment although leachate treatment facilities can remove more than 98 of mps lares et al 2018 murphy et al 2016 the effluence of sludge might introduce the mps to the environment it should be noted that a significant number of mps accumulated in landfills have made their way into the environment by wind surface runoff leachate and landfill mining canopoli et al 2020 yadav et al 2020 and the leakage of mps have already been found in the nearby environments of landfills bharath k et al 2021 kazour et al 2019 with the enhancement of hydrophilicity mps can also adsorb contaminants and redistribute toxic substances to the environment wang et al 2018 the unintentional intake of mps would certainly cause physical injury to animals or human beings chu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 considering the deleterious effect of accumulating mps the burden on the environment appears inevitable because mps surged exponentially their accumulation will introduce a greater burden on the environment in the future to date it is still inaccessible to remove mps in landfills economically and technologically thus the waste legacy in old landfills will remain a problem in the foreseeable future to solve problems of old dumping sites with poor management and increase landfill capacity landfill excavation mining has been employed in the past era krook et al 2012 lou et al 2015 however the excavation and screening separation of deposited materials in landfills would release the mps via the airborne spread and the fine fraction utilized for soil application might redistribute mps to the environment our results found that the mps generation would step into the booming stage after 25 years of landfilling thus if excavation is carried out before that stage it might mitigate the mps pollution future research should develop efficient separation processes to remove mps from deposited waste 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to quantify the mps generation process under a continuous temporal pattern while considering the initial proportion of plastic waste to modify the actual abundance of mps in landfills the dynamic generation process of mps with exponential growth was found with the landfill age the proportion of small sized mps 0 5 mm showed a positive relationship with disposal age and can possibly be used as an indicator to assess whether the landfill has entered a booming stage of mps generation the results of this study provide valuable information for understanding the dynamic process of mps generated in landfills providing an important guideline for reducing the landfill reclamation risk further works should be carried out to quantify the influence of different factors such as temperature mechanical pressure and microbial activities on plastic degradation and further investigate the underlying mechanism of the dynamic generation

15611,as a promising energy and carbon efficient process for nitrogen removal from wastewater mainstream nitrite shunt has been extensively researched however beyond the laboratory it is challenging to maintain stable performance by suppressing nitrite oxidising bacteria nob in this study a pilot scale reactor system receiving real sewage was operated in two stages for 850 days to evaluate two novel nob suppression strategies for achieving nitrite shunt i sidestream sludge treatment based on alternating free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa and ii sidestream fna fa sludge treatment integrated with in situ nob suppression via step feed the results showed that with sidestream sludge treatment alone nob developed resistance relatively quickly to the treatment leading to unstable nitrite shunt in contrast robust nitrite shunt was achieved and stably maintained for more than a year when sidestream sludge treatment was integrated with a step feed strategy kinetic analyses suggested that sludge treatment and step feed worked in synergy leading to stable nob suppression the integrated strategy demonstrated in this study removes a key barrier to the implementation of stable mainstream nitrite shunt graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrite shunt nob suppression sludge treatment step feed free nitrous acid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to achieve energy and resource efficient wastewater treatment many water utilities have made long term plans to upgrade conventional nitrification denitrification nh4 no3 n2 to the nitrite shunt process nh4 no2 n2 the nitrite shunt reduces carbon requirement for denitrification by 40 and aeration energy demand for nitrification by 25 turk and mavinic 1986 in addition nitrite shunt is a low risk retrofitting option that retains the robustness of nitrifiers and denitrifiers the nitrite shunt process is achieved by selectively inhibiting nob activities no2 no3 while retaining the activities of ammonia oxidising bacteria aob nh4 no2 and denitrifiers no2 n2 peng and zhu 2006 based on the different physiological characteristics of aob and nob nob suppression strategies mainly comprise two categories in situ nob suppression and sidestream nob inactivation the in situ approaches establish wastewater treatment conditions which are less favourable for nob than for aob these approaches include limiting the dissolved oxygen do levels blackburne et al 2008b ma et al 2009 sliekers et al 2005 applying step feed or intermittent aeration ge et al 2014 miao et al 2021 real time aeration control blackburne et al 2008a ma et al 2017b regmi et al 2014 yang et al 2007 shortening the sludge retention time srt van dongen et al 2001 wang et al 2019 yuan and oleszkiewicz 2011 and creating acidic conditions duan et al 2019a wang et al 2021b the sidestream treatment approaches involve continuously or intermittently circulating a designated amount of activated sludge from the mainstream reactor through a sidestream sludge treatment reactor in the sidestream reactor nob are inactivated by chemical treatment with free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite duan et al 2018 wang et al 2014 free ammonia fa wang et al 2017 wang et al 2021a sulfide seuntjens et al 2018 or by physical treatment such as ultrasound zheng et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 and heat shock chen et al 2016 pilot scale demonstrations of the nitrite shunt process have been carried out with in situ nob suppression approaches such as low do 0 3 0 8 mgo2 l and real time aeration control ma et al 2009 wang et al 2007 yang et al 2009 however it was experienced that low do or aeration duration control alone could not stably control nob activities wang et al 2019 likely due to bacterial adaptation in laboratory liu and wang 2013 and full scale cao et al 2018 studies nob gradually developed capacity to compete with aob for oxygen under low do conditions 0 16 0 37mgo2 l through a population shift to nitrospira eventually leading to a failure of nob control subsequently low do or aeration duration control has been combined with short srt 4 8 d to achieve more stable nitrite shunt larriba et al 2020 regmi et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 wang et al 2019 recently low do 0 5 mg l has been combined with short srt 5d to achieve nitrite shunt at a full scale wwtp at warm temperatures in the us jimenez et al 2020 despite the success of large scale demonstrations application of the nitrite shunt is still rare the application of low do real time aeration and short srt strategy may be limited to warm climate region where nitrogen removal can be stably achieved under short srt and or oxygen limitation in contrast to in situ approaches the performance of the sidestream treatment strategies at large scale is unknown at present uncertainty about nob adaptation is a key barrier to achieving stable nitrite shunt through sidestream treatment nob may develop resistance to sidestream fna treatment or fa treatment through population shifts in the bacterial community duan et al 2019b duan et al 2019c jiang et al 2021 li et al 2020 wang et al 2016 however duan et al 2019b demonstrated that nob adaptation was overcome by alternating fna and fa sidestream sludge treatment nitrospira and nitrobacter the key nob genera in most wwtps can adapt to fna and fa treatment respectively but do not adapt to alternating fna and fa treatments the alternation concept was applied in a recent study to overcome nob adaptation by alternating fna based treatment and heat shock treatment liu et al 2022 however these studies were exclusively conducted in laboratories under controlled conditions and mostly with synthetic wastewater the effectiveness of these nob suppression strategies with real sewage and field conditions urgently requires investigation for further scale up and implementation in this study we aimed to establish robust mainstream nitrite shunt at pilot scale using the sidestream treatment approach a pilot scale reactor system receiving real sewage was operated for 850 days at a wastewater treatment plant to achieve nitrite shunt through two novel nob suppression strategies i sidestream sludge treatment alternating fna and fa and ii sidestream sludge treatment integrated with in situ nob suppression via step feed the nutrient removal performance bacterial activities and microbial communities were closely monitored during pilot system operation to evaluate nitrite shunt performance and nob suppression effectiveness the robustness of the nitrite shunt process was challenged by reintroduction of nob a kinetic analysis provided insight into nob suppression strategies 2 material and methods 2 1 overall experimental plan the study was divided into two stages to progressively investigate the feasibility of achieving robust nitrite shunt under field conditions with two strategies in stage i the alternating sidestream sludge treatment strategy with fna and fa was investigated with unstable performance in the first stage in stage ii the sidestream sludge treatment was integrated with in situ nob suppression via step feed to achieve a more stable nitrite shunt process the step feed operation can suppress nob growth by substrate limitation and starvation recovery inhibition kornaros et al 2010 miao et al 2021 high level details of stage i and stage ii are summarised in table 1 detailed operational parameters are presented in section 2 2 stage i day 1 500 the system was initially operated for full nitrification and denitrification day 1 216 serving as a baseline for following experiments in the experimental phase post day 216 the system was commissioned to treat sludge with fna fa for nob suppression the sludge treatment consisted of fna treatment day 217 344 followed by fa treatment day 345 day 500 to overcome nob adaptation to fna treatment stage ii day 501 865 to test the integrated control strategy the pilot system was reconfigured and restarted receiving fna treated sidestream sludge and operated for 232 days day 501 732 to test robustness of the mainstream nitrite shunt fna treatment was suspended in the second phase day 733 802 in this period nob was added to the reactor on day 794 to disrupt the nitrite shunt by replacing 20 of the pilot reactor sludge with sludge containing nob from the full scale wwtp in the last phase day 803 865 fna treatment recommenced to re establish the disrupted nitrite shunt 2 2 pilot system set up and operation 2 2 1 stage i the pilot plant was configured as a modified ludzack ettinger mle process figure s1 the system comprised an anoxic tank 1 5 m3 tank volume 1 m3 working volume an aerobic tank 3 m3 tank volume 2 m3 working volume and a clarifier in series the nitrite recirculation flow from the aerobic reactor to the anoxic reactor was four times the influent flow rate while the returned activated sludge ras flow matched the influent flow rate the system received primary effluent at 6 m3 day giving rise to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 hours sludge was discharged semi continuously timer based on off control from the aerobic reactor to maintain an srt of 15 days the amount of sludge in sidestream storage and treatment has been considered in the srt calculation the do concentration of the aerobic tank was controlled between 1 0 1 5 mgo2 l the aerobic tank had do ph and tss probes for online monitoring 2 2 2 stage ii implementation of step feed in a continuous reactor requires its division into cascaded zones with the wastewater simultaneously fed to multiple anoxic zones this was difficult to achieve with the pilot scale reactor instead of pursuing a spatial re arrangement a temporal arrangement of step feed was implemented in sequential batch mode figure 1 this arrangement is widely applied to mimic the step feed principle in a continuous multi stage plug flow system miao et al 2021 the pilot system in stage ii was fed with 2 m3 wastewater per day in 6 h cycles each cycle comprising first anoxic feeding 185 l feed in 37 min anoxic reaction 13 min first aerobic reaction 62 min second anoxic feeding 165 l feed in 33 min anoxic reaction 9 min second aerobic reaction 56 min third anoxic feeding 150 l feed in 30 min anoxic reaction 10 min third aerobic reaction 50 min settling 45 min and decanting 15 min periods giving an hrt of 24 hours the srt was maintained at 15 days ammonium based real time aeration control was not used in the operation the do concentrations in all three aerobic phases were controlled between 1 0 to 1 5 mgo2 l based only on do sensor reading note that the feed volumes decreased slightly over the aerobic reaction cycles from 185 l in sub cycle 1 to 165 l in sub cycle 2 and then 150 l in sub cycle 3 to lower the oxidised nitrogen concentrations in the final effluent 2 2 3 sludge treatment for both stage i and ii all the sludge in the pilot system was initially treated with fna before operating the system at the designated sludge treatment ratio defined as the ratio of the amount of sludge receiving treatment to the total amount of sludge in the system a certain amount of gravity settled sludge determined by the sludge treatment ratio was collected from the clarifier in stage i or at the end of each settling period in stage ii this sludge was transferred to the treatment tanks where nano2 and hcl 2m or nh4cl and naoh 2m were added to achieve designated fna or fa levels after 24 hr treatment the treated sludge was pumped into a holding tank for stage i the treated sludge was continuously recirculated back to the anoxic tank for stage ii the treated sludge was returned to the reactor over 4 cycles 24 hr during the first feed of each cycle i e approx 44 l returned during each first feed period the recirculation of treated sludge resulted in an additional 6 4 mg no2 n l in the reactor at the operating volume of the first feed phase an fna concentration of 1 6 1 9 mgn l no2 250 mgn l ph 5 5 temperature 22 30 c and an fa concentration of 214 312 mgn l nh3 nh4 800 mgn l ph 8 9 temperature 22 30 c were used to treat sludge during respective designed experimental period in stage i the sludge treatment ratio was increased from 15 day 217 425 to 22 day 426 504 toward the end of the experimental phase in stage ii the sludge treatment ratio was approximately 25 the design of sludge treatment conditions i e fna fa concentrations and sludge treatment ratio is based on previous studies duan et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2 3 monitoring protocol and analytical methods the concentration of nitrogenous compounds nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the reactors or the effluent were analyzed 2 3 times a week concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and sludge volume index svi30 were measured weekly aob and nob activities in the reactor were determined as the biomass specific ammonium removal and nitrate production rates respectively calculated by dividing the corresponding volumetric rates by the measured mlvss concentration the volumetric rates were determined in batch tests with sufficient substrates cycle studies were performed weekly in stage ii by determining the concentration of nitrogenous compounds every half an hour throughout a cycle the n2o emissions from the pilot system were only monitored during stage ii when the steady state was reached by a multi component online gas analyser horiba va 5000 series microbial community composition was evaluated by amplicon sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish detailed analytical procedures and statistical analysis can be found in supplementary information section 1 2 4 inoculum activated sludge and wastewater characteristics the pilot scale system was located at the luggage point wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia which has a typical bardenpho process treating primarily domestic sewage at an srt of 15 d the pilot scale system was seeded with waste activated sludge was collected from the full scale wwtp and received primary effluent from the full scale plant as feed major characteristics of the primary effluent are summarised in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 stage i with sidestream sludge treatment as the sole nob control strategy 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance the pilot system was operated in stage i for 500 days the nitrogen removal performance and aob nob activities are shown in figure 2 and summarised in table 3 satisfactory ammonium removal was achieved during the baseline period with only 0 2 0 2 mgn l ammonium remaining in the effluent the effluent nitrite concentration was also low 0 1 0 1 mgn l nitrate was the main inorganic nitrogen species in the final effluent with a concentration of 11 0 5 4 mgn l the system performed well in denitrification with a low nox concentration of 2 4 3 7 mgn l in the anoxic zone figure 2 the system achieved a nitrogen removal efficiency of 79 6 8 3 close to the maximum removal efficiency of 83 3 limited by the internal mixed liquor recycling and ras rates being four and one time of the influent flow rate respectively the volumetric and specific aob and nob activities figure 2 and table 3 were relatively stable with a low aob nob activity ratio of 0 4 in real wastewater treatment systems nob activity is often observed much higher than aob activity due to a nitrite loop yao and peng 2017 indeed nitrate reduction in the anoxic zone caused nitrite accumulation with an average concentration of 1 1 1 7 mgn l figure 2 in turn the presence of nitrite led to higher nob growth and activities than that of aob following the initial harsh treatment of sludge with fna the system temporarily lost ammonium oxidation activity resulting in an effluent ammonium concentration close to the influent concentration the aob and nob activities quickly recovered after 10 days figure 2 reflected by the low effluent ammonium concentration 0 0 1 mgn l and elevated effluent nitrite 5 2 8 4 mgn l and nitrate 3 0 6 4 mgn l concentrations between day 230 and 234 the aob nob activity ratio increased greatly to 1 25 on day 233 after recovery from an operational failure day 237 the reactor achieved relatively stable ammonium removal performance from day 255 to 344 the nob volumetric activity decreased by 66 following sludge treatment dropping from 13 5 0 5 mgn l h baseline to 4 6 mgn l h day 269 figure 2 demonstrating the effectiveness of fna treatment in nob suppression however the nob activity began to increase steadily after day 300 reaching as high as 17 2 mgn l h toward the end of this phase indicating adaptation of the nob community to fna treatment nitrogen removal efficiency before adaptation day 255 to 300 reached 84 8 3 9 with effluent nitrate concentration at 2 9 2 1 mgn l as nob became resistant to fna treatment the pilot system performed full nitrification and denitrification during this period day 301 344 the effluent nitrite concentration was low 0 6 0 4 mgn l with nitrate being the key oxidised nitrogen species in the effluent 8 5 3 2 mgn l the nitrogen removal efficiency was reduced to 78 9 6 0 similar to that in the baseline consequently the sludge treatment was alternated from fna to fa treatment to overcome the adaptation with fa treatment of the sludge the nitrate concentration in the effluent decreased from 12 1 3 0 mgn l day 325 339 to 2 0 0 7 mgn l day 365 410 indicating efficient nob suppression this was further validated by a consistently high aob nob activity ratio of 2 2 during this operational condition day 345 425 the results confirmed that the alternating fna fa sludge treatment strategy is effective in overcoming nob adaptation despite efficient nob control the overall tn removal deteriorated due to unstable ammonium removal table 3 from day 412 the nob activity and the nitrate concentration in the effluent began to recover increase to improve the nob suppression efficiency the sludge treatment ratio was increased from 15 to 22 however this high sludge treatment ratio resulted in the collapse of the nitrogen removal both aob and nob activities were lost under the harsh treatment table 3 while aob and nob later recovered from the treatment performance was unstable in addition high cod removal was achieved in all periods with an efficiency of 81 6 10 2 table s2 and figure s2 the effluent cod concentration was not significantly different p 0 05 during operational periods table s2 and figure s2 the treatment did not affect sludge settleability with similar svi measured for baseline 321 8 106 9 ml g and experimental phases 300 1 87 9 ml g table s2 figure s2 3 1 2 nob microbial community and adaptation a clear shift in nob microbial community composition was observed as a result of fna fa sludge treatment figure 3 nitrospira was initially the dominant nob genus in the system however following the sidestream sludge treatment nitrospira abundance progressively decreased from the initial level of 1 5 to undetectable levels at the end of operation in comparison nitrobacter maintained its presence in the system despite a reduction from 0 19 0 03 to 0 07 0 01 with treatment switched from fna to fa treatment ratio of 15 however after the treatment ratio was increased nitrobacter abundance also increased reaching 0 3 at the end of the experiment the doubling of its initial abundance under these conditions may be due to nitrobacter being an r strategist with a relatively high growth rate and low affinity to nitrite winkler et al 2017 under the pressure of a higher treatment ratio nitrobacter gained the advantage due to its relatively high growth rate ca nitrotoga was detected in low abundance 0 05 in two samples during the fa treatment period in previous laboratory studies ca nitrotoga demonstrated high resistance to both fna and fa treatment li et al 2020 ma et al 2017a while ca nitrotoga was detected in the current system it did not dominate the nob community the adaptation of nob to fna or fa based sludge treatment has been reported previously nitrospira and nitrobacter the key nob populations in wastewater treatment have the ability to adapt to fna and fa respectively duan et al 2019b candidatus nitrotoga reportedly adapt to both fna and fa treatment li et al 2020 ma et al 2017a it was shown in laboratory studies that alternating sludge treatment with fna and fa or fna and heat shock was effective in overcoming nob adaptation in synthetic wastewaters duan et al 2019b liu et al 2022 however the same could not be achieved in this pilot scale study with real wastewater different from synthetic wastewater real wastewater contains nob which may repopulate bioreactors after sludge treatment duan et al 2019c other factors such as varied temperature and influent composition may also play a role in promoting nob adaptation this study shows that under field conditions the alternating fna fa control strategy alone cannot maintain stable mainstream nitrite shunt due to the relatively quick adaptation of nob a more reliable nob control strategy is required 3 2 stage ii with integrated sidestream sludge treatment and in situ nob suppression 3 2 1 nitrogen removal performance in stage ii the step feed system was operated continuously for one year the nitrogen removal performance and aob nob activities during operation are shown in figure 4 and summarised in table 4 the one off fna treatment at the beginning of operation effectively suppressed nob activities figure 4 and led to reduced aob activities and high ammonium level in the effluent the aob activities recovered after one srt indicated by a relatively low ammonium concentration of 5 0 mgn l in the effluent on day 521 after start up and addressing operational issues the reactor system achieved stable performance from day 640 during the stable performance period day 640 732 satisfactory nitrogen removal was achieved with a tn removal efficiency of 91 5 3 7 and low effluent ammonium level of 1 1 1 7 mgn l aob activity was high and relatively stable at 3 36 0 40 mgn gmlvss h table 4 while the volumetric aob activity displayed an upward trend due to a continuous increase in sludge concentration figure s3 importantly stable nob suppression was achieved as indicated by an average nob activity of 0 25 0 12 gn gmlvss h and a negligible level of nitrate in the effluent 0 1 0 1 mgn l the nitrogen conversion in a typical cycle during this period is shown in figure 5 a during each of the three aerobic phases the majority 90 of the ammonium was oxidized to nitrite rather than nitrate nitrite was then removed by denitrification in the following anoxic phase the establishment of nitrogen conversion via nitrite was a clear indication that stable mainstream nitrite shunt was successfully achieved in the pilot system online n2o monitoring during day 750 760 no sludge treatment showed relatively high n2o emissions with an emission factor of 1 86 0 23 mean s e n2o n tn defined as the portion of n2o converted from total nitrogen loading in wastewater the measured n2o emission factor is around 20 higher than the emission factor of 1 6 that ipcc used for calculating emissions from wwtps de haas and andrews 2022 nonetheless the current results are consistent with previous studies reporting increased n2o emissions in nitrite shunt systems due to the accumulation of nitrite massara et al 2017 vasilaki et al 2019 in addition satisfactory cod removal and sludge settleability were maintained throughout the whole operation figure s3 table s3 3 2 2 robustness of the mainstream nitrite shunt and nob suppression after stable operation for over 100 days sidestream sludge treatment was stopped on day 733 to test the robustness of the nitrite shunt subsequently the system was operated for 60 days without sludge treatment and the process exhibited superior robustness the suspension of sludge treatment increased sludge concentration figure s3 and higher volumetric aob activities figure 4 yielding better nitrogen removal performance than with sludge treatment from day 733 to 793 the effluent ammonium concentration was 0 1 0 1 mgn l and the tn removal efficiency increased to 94 8 0 8 notably the nob activity did not recover remaining at 0 10 0 13 gn gmlvss h comparable to that in the preceding period when sludge treatment was applied the nitrite shunt was stably maintained during this period with effluent nitrate concentration of 0 1 0 1 mgn l and nitrite concentration of 2 5 0 7 mgn l cycle studies showed that nitrogen conversion figure 5b over a cycle was similar to the preceding period which had fna treatment the stable performance of nitrite shunt in this period showed the harsh sludge treatment condition applied is redundant when worked in synergy with an in situ suppression strategy the sludge treatment condition may be relaxed while still maintaining sufficient suppressions on nob a reduced treatment frequency or treatment ratio can significantly reduce the operational cost of the sidestream sludge treatment approach which should be optimized in future studies to further evaluate the robustness of the established nitrite shunt on day 794 around 20 of the sludge in the pilot system was replaced with sludge containing nob from the full scale wwtp as expected the introduction of nob disrupted the nitrite shunt leading to an effluent nitrate and nitrite concentration of 4 6 1 0 mgn l and 0 2 0 3 mgn l respectively figure 4 the nob activity increased rapidly to 7 26 0 78 mgn l h in 10 days figure 5c shows that ammonium was fully oxidised to nitrate rather than nitrite at the end of each aerobic period showing disruption of the nitrite shunt the rapid increase in nitrate level in the effluent and recovery of nob activities from day 794 to 803 also demonstrated that the step feed strategy alone does not sufficiently suppress nob following the reintroduction of regular sludge treatment with fna from day 804 the nob activity decreased to negligible levels 0 67 0 50 mgn l h in 20 days figure 4 the nitrite shunt process was successfully re established with effluent ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations of 0 3 0 4 mgn l 3 6 0 9 mgn l and 0 1 0 1 mgn l respectively the nitrogen conversion in a cycle figure 5d was very similar to those in other periods with stable nitrite shunt microbial communities were monitored with 16s rrna sequencing and fish throughout the experiment in most samples nob were not detectable or in very low abundance 0 03 figure 6 ca nitrotoga was not detected during bioreactor operation after the reintroduction of nob on day 794 both nitrospira and nitrobacter were detected by 16s rrna analysis at 3 58 and 0 16 respectively these results were confirmed by fish analysis figure s4 after sludge treatment with fna was restarted on day 804 nob populations were quickly eliminated the fluctuation in nob is consistent with nob activity data and the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor these results collectively demonstrate the robustness of the integrated strategy for nob control and stable nitrite shunt performance 3 3 kinetic analysis of the integrated strategy in this study robust nitrite shunt was achieved through integrating sidestream nob inactivation and in situ suppression via step feed the kinetic learnings of this long term pilot study are summarized below to guide future implementation in order to eliminate nob while retaining aob in equations 1 2 should be satisfied 1 μ m nob s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 n o b s no 2 s no 2 k no 2 b nob 1 s r t 0 2 μ m aob s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 a o b s nh 4 s nh 4 k nh 4 b aob 1 s r t 0 where μ m nob and μ m aob are the maximum nob and aob growth rates 1 h s o 2 is the dissolved oxygen concentration mgo2 l k o 2 n o b and k o 2 a o b are kinetic parameters estimated by the half saturation constant of nob and aob for do mgo2 l s n o 2 is the concentration of nitrite mgn l k n o 2 is the half saturation constant of nob for nitrite mgn l s nh 4 is the concentration of ammonium mgn l k nh 4 is the half saturation constant of aob for ammonium mgn l b nob and b aob are the decay rates for nob and aob 1 h and srt is the sludge retention time h the reduction in srt affects both aob and nob and may cause the elimination of aob with subsequent process failure in contrast the selective control of growth rate μ and decay rate b is more successful for targeting nob in stage i of this work nob decay b nob was selectively enhanced through the regular sidestream sludge treatment which is a general feature for sidestream sludge treatment approaches sludge treatment by fna and fa was known to cause more cell death lysis for nob than for aob duan et al 2020 i e a larger increase in b nob leading to a situation satisfying in equation 1 with the initial effect on nob nitrite started to accumulate in the reactor however the accumulation of nitrite s no 2 undesirably promoted the growth rate of nob μ nob μ m nob s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 n o b s no 2 s no 2 k no 2 therefore while the increased b nob reduced the presence of nob in the system nob survived in the system through elevated μ nob which created opportunities for nob to adapt to the treatment therefore sidestream sludge treatment alone is unlikely sufficient to achieve stable nitrite shunt the strategies implemented in stage ii integrated b nob and μ nob control while b nob was selectively increased by sidestream sludge treatment denitrification outcompeted nob for nitrite in the anoxic phase of the step feed system furthermore the transient anoxia also affected the maximum growth rate of nob μ m nob miao et al 2021 therefore in the step feed system nob decay was promoted and the growth rate of nob was also effectively suppressed by nitrite limitation and transient anoxia leading to a minimized μ nob b nob term the effective integrated control strategy gave little chance for nob to adapt to the strategies achieving nearly complete nob elimination it was observed that in periods when sludge treatment was suspended day 794 803 stable nitrite shunt could not be achieved by reducing μ m nob alone clearly strategies which focus on either μ nob or b nob control are not as effective as integrating controls on μ and b simultaneously in other words effective nob control requires both suppressing nob growth and promoting the decay inactivation of nob in this study the nitrite shunt was robustly maintained for 60 days without fna fa sludge treatment in stage ii the results show potential to greatly reduce the frequency of sludge treatment for b nob control intermittent sludge treatment e g every two months could significantly reduce the operational cost of the proposed integrated control strategy and further studies are required to scale up the process combined with step feed design for wwtps other integrated sidestream treatment and mainstream control strategy may also be tested in the future to verify the integration strategy 4 conclusions in this study the feasibility of achieving robust nitrite shunt by sidestream fna and or fa based sludge treatment was evaluated under field conditions long term pilot system operation showed that sidestream sludge treatment was effective in short term nob suppression however nob developed resistance relatively quickly to the sludge treatment leading to unstable nitrite shunt the sidestream treatment strategy alone can unlikely attain robust nob suppression in real wastewater treatment systems in comparison a robust mainstream nitrite shunt with stable nob suppression was achieved and maintained for over one year with integrated sidestream treatment and in situ step feed control a kinetic analysis suggested the integration of sidestream treatment and in situ μ nob control was key to achieving robust nitrite shunt with stable nob suppression there is potential for intermitted sludge treatment with in situ step feed and other integrated sidestream and mainstream control strategies to be tested in the future with the effective nob control strategy verified in this work full scale implementation of mainstream nitrite shunt

15611,as a promising energy and carbon efficient process for nitrogen removal from wastewater mainstream nitrite shunt has been extensively researched however beyond the laboratory it is challenging to maintain stable performance by suppressing nitrite oxidising bacteria nob in this study a pilot scale reactor system receiving real sewage was operated in two stages for 850 days to evaluate two novel nob suppression strategies for achieving nitrite shunt i sidestream sludge treatment based on alternating free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa and ii sidestream fna fa sludge treatment integrated with in situ nob suppression via step feed the results showed that with sidestream sludge treatment alone nob developed resistance relatively quickly to the treatment leading to unstable nitrite shunt in contrast robust nitrite shunt was achieved and stably maintained for more than a year when sidestream sludge treatment was integrated with a step feed strategy kinetic analyses suggested that sludge treatment and step feed worked in synergy leading to stable nob suppression the integrated strategy demonstrated in this study removes a key barrier to the implementation of stable mainstream nitrite shunt graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrite shunt nob suppression sludge treatment step feed free nitrous acid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction to achieve energy and resource efficient wastewater treatment many water utilities have made long term plans to upgrade conventional nitrification denitrification nh4 no3 n2 to the nitrite shunt process nh4 no2 n2 the nitrite shunt reduces carbon requirement for denitrification by 40 and aeration energy demand for nitrification by 25 turk and mavinic 1986 in addition nitrite shunt is a low risk retrofitting option that retains the robustness of nitrifiers and denitrifiers the nitrite shunt process is achieved by selectively inhibiting nob activities no2 no3 while retaining the activities of ammonia oxidising bacteria aob nh4 no2 and denitrifiers no2 n2 peng and zhu 2006 based on the different physiological characteristics of aob and nob nob suppression strategies mainly comprise two categories in situ nob suppression and sidestream nob inactivation the in situ approaches establish wastewater treatment conditions which are less favourable for nob than for aob these approaches include limiting the dissolved oxygen do levels blackburne et al 2008b ma et al 2009 sliekers et al 2005 applying step feed or intermittent aeration ge et al 2014 miao et al 2021 real time aeration control blackburne et al 2008a ma et al 2017b regmi et al 2014 yang et al 2007 shortening the sludge retention time srt van dongen et al 2001 wang et al 2019 yuan and oleszkiewicz 2011 and creating acidic conditions duan et al 2019a wang et al 2021b the sidestream treatment approaches involve continuously or intermittently circulating a designated amount of activated sludge from the mainstream reactor through a sidestream sludge treatment reactor in the sidestream reactor nob are inactivated by chemical treatment with free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite duan et al 2018 wang et al 2014 free ammonia fa wang et al 2017 wang et al 2021a sulfide seuntjens et al 2018 or by physical treatment such as ultrasound zheng et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 and heat shock chen et al 2016 pilot scale demonstrations of the nitrite shunt process have been carried out with in situ nob suppression approaches such as low do 0 3 0 8 mgo2 l and real time aeration control ma et al 2009 wang et al 2007 yang et al 2009 however it was experienced that low do or aeration duration control alone could not stably control nob activities wang et al 2019 likely due to bacterial adaptation in laboratory liu and wang 2013 and full scale cao et al 2018 studies nob gradually developed capacity to compete with aob for oxygen under low do conditions 0 16 0 37mgo2 l through a population shift to nitrospira eventually leading to a failure of nob control subsequently low do or aeration duration control has been combined with short srt 4 8 d to achieve more stable nitrite shunt larriba et al 2020 regmi et al 2015 regmi et al 2014 wang et al 2019 recently low do 0 5 mg l has been combined with short srt 5d to achieve nitrite shunt at a full scale wwtp at warm temperatures in the us jimenez et al 2020 despite the success of large scale demonstrations application of the nitrite shunt is still rare the application of low do real time aeration and short srt strategy may be limited to warm climate region where nitrogen removal can be stably achieved under short srt and or oxygen limitation in contrast to in situ approaches the performance of the sidestream treatment strategies at large scale is unknown at present uncertainty about nob adaptation is a key barrier to achieving stable nitrite shunt through sidestream treatment nob may develop resistance to sidestream fna treatment or fa treatment through population shifts in the bacterial community duan et al 2019b duan et al 2019c jiang et al 2021 li et al 2020 wang et al 2016 however duan et al 2019b demonstrated that nob adaptation was overcome by alternating fna and fa sidestream sludge treatment nitrospira and nitrobacter the key nob genera in most wwtps can adapt to fna and fa treatment respectively but do not adapt to alternating fna and fa treatments the alternation concept was applied in a recent study to overcome nob adaptation by alternating fna based treatment and heat shock treatment liu et al 2022 however these studies were exclusively conducted in laboratories under controlled conditions and mostly with synthetic wastewater the effectiveness of these nob suppression strategies with real sewage and field conditions urgently requires investigation for further scale up and implementation in this study we aimed to establish robust mainstream nitrite shunt at pilot scale using the sidestream treatment approach a pilot scale reactor system receiving real sewage was operated for 850 days at a wastewater treatment plant to achieve nitrite shunt through two novel nob suppression strategies i sidestream sludge treatment alternating fna and fa and ii sidestream sludge treatment integrated with in situ nob suppression via step feed the nutrient removal performance bacterial activities and microbial communities were closely monitored during pilot system operation to evaluate nitrite shunt performance and nob suppression effectiveness the robustness of the nitrite shunt process was challenged by reintroduction of nob a kinetic analysis provided insight into nob suppression strategies 2 material and methods 2 1 overall experimental plan the study was divided into two stages to progressively investigate the feasibility of achieving robust nitrite shunt under field conditions with two strategies in stage i the alternating sidestream sludge treatment strategy with fna and fa was investigated with unstable performance in the first stage in stage ii the sidestream sludge treatment was integrated with in situ nob suppression via step feed to achieve a more stable nitrite shunt process the step feed operation can suppress nob growth by substrate limitation and starvation recovery inhibition kornaros et al 2010 miao et al 2021 high level details of stage i and stage ii are summarised in table 1 detailed operational parameters are presented in section 2 2 stage i day 1 500 the system was initially operated for full nitrification and denitrification day 1 216 serving as a baseline for following experiments in the experimental phase post day 216 the system was commissioned to treat sludge with fna fa for nob suppression the sludge treatment consisted of fna treatment day 217 344 followed by fa treatment day 345 day 500 to overcome nob adaptation to fna treatment stage ii day 501 865 to test the integrated control strategy the pilot system was reconfigured and restarted receiving fna treated sidestream sludge and operated for 232 days day 501 732 to test robustness of the mainstream nitrite shunt fna treatment was suspended in the second phase day 733 802 in this period nob was added to the reactor on day 794 to disrupt the nitrite shunt by replacing 20 of the pilot reactor sludge with sludge containing nob from the full scale wwtp in the last phase day 803 865 fna treatment recommenced to re establish the disrupted nitrite shunt 2 2 pilot system set up and operation 2 2 1 stage i the pilot plant was configured as a modified ludzack ettinger mle process figure s1 the system comprised an anoxic tank 1 5 m3 tank volume 1 m3 working volume an aerobic tank 3 m3 tank volume 2 m3 working volume and a clarifier in series the nitrite recirculation flow from the aerobic reactor to the anoxic reactor was four times the influent flow rate while the returned activated sludge ras flow matched the influent flow rate the system received primary effluent at 6 m3 day giving rise to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 hours sludge was discharged semi continuously timer based on off control from the aerobic reactor to maintain an srt of 15 days the amount of sludge in sidestream storage and treatment has been considered in the srt calculation the do concentration of the aerobic tank was controlled between 1 0 1 5 mgo2 l the aerobic tank had do ph and tss probes for online monitoring 2 2 2 stage ii implementation of step feed in a continuous reactor requires its division into cascaded zones with the wastewater simultaneously fed to multiple anoxic zones this was difficult to achieve with the pilot scale reactor instead of pursuing a spatial re arrangement a temporal arrangement of step feed was implemented in sequential batch mode figure 1 this arrangement is widely applied to mimic the step feed principle in a continuous multi stage plug flow system miao et al 2021 the pilot system in stage ii was fed with 2 m3 wastewater per day in 6 h cycles each cycle comprising first anoxic feeding 185 l feed in 37 min anoxic reaction 13 min first aerobic reaction 62 min second anoxic feeding 165 l feed in 33 min anoxic reaction 9 min second aerobic reaction 56 min third anoxic feeding 150 l feed in 30 min anoxic reaction 10 min third aerobic reaction 50 min settling 45 min and decanting 15 min periods giving an hrt of 24 hours the srt was maintained at 15 days ammonium based real time aeration control was not used in the operation the do concentrations in all three aerobic phases were controlled between 1 0 to 1 5 mgo2 l based only on do sensor reading note that the feed volumes decreased slightly over the aerobic reaction cycles from 185 l in sub cycle 1 to 165 l in sub cycle 2 and then 150 l in sub cycle 3 to lower the oxidised nitrogen concentrations in the final effluent 2 2 3 sludge treatment for both stage i and ii all the sludge in the pilot system was initially treated with fna before operating the system at the designated sludge treatment ratio defined as the ratio of the amount of sludge receiving treatment to the total amount of sludge in the system a certain amount of gravity settled sludge determined by the sludge treatment ratio was collected from the clarifier in stage i or at the end of each settling period in stage ii this sludge was transferred to the treatment tanks where nano2 and hcl 2m or nh4cl and naoh 2m were added to achieve designated fna or fa levels after 24 hr treatment the treated sludge was pumped into a holding tank for stage i the treated sludge was continuously recirculated back to the anoxic tank for stage ii the treated sludge was returned to the reactor over 4 cycles 24 hr during the first feed of each cycle i e approx 44 l returned during each first feed period the recirculation of treated sludge resulted in an additional 6 4 mg no2 n l in the reactor at the operating volume of the first feed phase an fna concentration of 1 6 1 9 mgn l no2 250 mgn l ph 5 5 temperature 22 30 c and an fa concentration of 214 312 mgn l nh3 nh4 800 mgn l ph 8 9 temperature 22 30 c were used to treat sludge during respective designed experimental period in stage i the sludge treatment ratio was increased from 15 day 217 425 to 22 day 426 504 toward the end of the experimental phase in stage ii the sludge treatment ratio was approximately 25 the design of sludge treatment conditions i e fna fa concentrations and sludge treatment ratio is based on previous studies duan et al 2018 wang et al 2017 2 3 monitoring protocol and analytical methods the concentration of nitrogenous compounds nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the reactors or the effluent were analyzed 2 3 times a week concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and sludge volume index svi30 were measured weekly aob and nob activities in the reactor were determined as the biomass specific ammonium removal and nitrate production rates respectively calculated by dividing the corresponding volumetric rates by the measured mlvss concentration the volumetric rates were determined in batch tests with sufficient substrates cycle studies were performed weekly in stage ii by determining the concentration of nitrogenous compounds every half an hour throughout a cycle the n2o emissions from the pilot system were only monitored during stage ii when the steady state was reached by a multi component online gas analyser horiba va 5000 series microbial community composition was evaluated by amplicon sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish detailed analytical procedures and statistical analysis can be found in supplementary information section 1 2 4 inoculum activated sludge and wastewater characteristics the pilot scale system was located at the luggage point wastewater treatment plant brisbane australia which has a typical bardenpho process treating primarily domestic sewage at an srt of 15 d the pilot scale system was seeded with waste activated sludge was collected from the full scale wwtp and received primary effluent from the full scale plant as feed major characteristics of the primary effluent are summarised in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 stage i with sidestream sludge treatment as the sole nob control strategy 3 1 1 nitrogen removal performance the pilot system was operated in stage i for 500 days the nitrogen removal performance and aob nob activities are shown in figure 2 and summarised in table 3 satisfactory ammonium removal was achieved during the baseline period with only 0 2 0 2 mgn l ammonium remaining in the effluent the effluent nitrite concentration was also low 0 1 0 1 mgn l nitrate was the main inorganic nitrogen species in the final effluent with a concentration of 11 0 5 4 mgn l the system performed well in denitrification with a low nox concentration of 2 4 3 7 mgn l in the anoxic zone figure 2 the system achieved a nitrogen removal efficiency of 79 6 8 3 close to the maximum removal efficiency of 83 3 limited by the internal mixed liquor recycling and ras rates being four and one time of the influent flow rate respectively the volumetric and specific aob and nob activities figure 2 and table 3 were relatively stable with a low aob nob activity ratio of 0 4 in real wastewater treatment systems nob activity is often observed much higher than aob activity due to a nitrite loop yao and peng 2017 indeed nitrate reduction in the anoxic zone caused nitrite accumulation with an average concentration of 1 1 1 7 mgn l figure 2 in turn the presence of nitrite led to higher nob growth and activities than that of aob following the initial harsh treatment of sludge with fna the system temporarily lost ammonium oxidation activity resulting in an effluent ammonium concentration close to the influent concentration the aob and nob activities quickly recovered after 10 days figure 2 reflected by the low effluent ammonium concentration 0 0 1 mgn l and elevated effluent nitrite 5 2 8 4 mgn l and nitrate 3 0 6 4 mgn l concentrations between day 230 and 234 the aob nob activity ratio increased greatly to 1 25 on day 233 after recovery from an operational failure day 237 the reactor achieved relatively stable ammonium removal performance from day 255 to 344 the nob volumetric activity decreased by 66 following sludge treatment dropping from 13 5 0 5 mgn l h baseline to 4 6 mgn l h day 269 figure 2 demonstrating the effectiveness of fna treatment in nob suppression however the nob activity began to increase steadily after day 300 reaching as high as 17 2 mgn l h toward the end of this phase indicating adaptation of the nob community to fna treatment nitrogen removal efficiency before adaptation day 255 to 300 reached 84 8 3 9 with effluent nitrate concentration at 2 9 2 1 mgn l as nob became resistant to fna treatment the pilot system performed full nitrification and denitrification during this period day 301 344 the effluent nitrite concentration was low 0 6 0 4 mgn l with nitrate being the key oxidised nitrogen species in the effluent 8 5 3 2 mgn l the nitrogen removal efficiency was reduced to 78 9 6 0 similar to that in the baseline consequently the sludge treatment was alternated from fna to fa treatment to overcome the adaptation with fa treatment of the sludge the nitrate concentration in the effluent decreased from 12 1 3 0 mgn l day 325 339 to 2 0 0 7 mgn l day 365 410 indicating efficient nob suppression this was further validated by a consistently high aob nob activity ratio of 2 2 during this operational condition day 345 425 the results confirmed that the alternating fna fa sludge treatment strategy is effective in overcoming nob adaptation despite efficient nob control the overall tn removal deteriorated due to unstable ammonium removal table 3 from day 412 the nob activity and the nitrate concentration in the effluent began to recover increase to improve the nob suppression efficiency the sludge treatment ratio was increased from 15 to 22 however this high sludge treatment ratio resulted in the collapse of the nitrogen removal both aob and nob activities were lost under the harsh treatment table 3 while aob and nob later recovered from the treatment performance was unstable in addition high cod removal was achieved in all periods with an efficiency of 81 6 10 2 table s2 and figure s2 the effluent cod concentration was not significantly different p 0 05 during operational periods table s2 and figure s2 the treatment did not affect sludge settleability with similar svi measured for baseline 321 8 106 9 ml g and experimental phases 300 1 87 9 ml g table s2 figure s2 3 1 2 nob microbial community and adaptation a clear shift in nob microbial community composition was observed as a result of fna fa sludge treatment figure 3 nitrospira was initially the dominant nob genus in the system however following the sidestream sludge treatment nitrospira abundance progressively decreased from the initial level of 1 5 to undetectable levels at the end of operation in comparison nitrobacter maintained its presence in the system despite a reduction from 0 19 0 03 to 0 07 0 01 with treatment switched from fna to fa treatment ratio of 15 however after the treatment ratio was increased nitrobacter abundance also increased reaching 0 3 at the end of the experiment the doubling of its initial abundance under these conditions may be due to nitrobacter being an r strategist with a relatively high growth rate and low affinity to nitrite winkler et al 2017 under the pressure of a higher treatment ratio nitrobacter gained the advantage due to its relatively high growth rate ca nitrotoga was detected in low abundance 0 05 in two samples during the fa treatment period in previous laboratory studies ca nitrotoga demonstrated high resistance to both fna and fa treatment li et al 2020 ma et al 2017a while ca nitrotoga was detected in the current system it did not dominate the nob community the adaptation of nob to fna or fa based sludge treatment has been reported previously nitrospira and nitrobacter the key nob populations in wastewater treatment have the ability to adapt to fna and fa respectively duan et al 2019b candidatus nitrotoga reportedly adapt to both fna and fa treatment li et al 2020 ma et al 2017a it was shown in laboratory studies that alternating sludge treatment with fna and fa or fna and heat shock was effective in overcoming nob adaptation in synthetic wastewaters duan et al 2019b liu et al 2022 however the same could not be achieved in this pilot scale study with real wastewater different from synthetic wastewater real wastewater contains nob which may repopulate bioreactors after sludge treatment duan et al 2019c other factors such as varied temperature and influent composition may also play a role in promoting nob adaptation this study shows that under field conditions the alternating fna fa control strategy alone cannot maintain stable mainstream nitrite shunt due to the relatively quick adaptation of nob a more reliable nob control strategy is required 3 2 stage ii with integrated sidestream sludge treatment and in situ nob suppression 3 2 1 nitrogen removal performance in stage ii the step feed system was operated continuously for one year the nitrogen removal performance and aob nob activities during operation are shown in figure 4 and summarised in table 4 the one off fna treatment at the beginning of operation effectively suppressed nob activities figure 4 and led to reduced aob activities and high ammonium level in the effluent the aob activities recovered after one srt indicated by a relatively low ammonium concentration of 5 0 mgn l in the effluent on day 521 after start up and addressing operational issues the reactor system achieved stable performance from day 640 during the stable performance period day 640 732 satisfactory nitrogen removal was achieved with a tn removal efficiency of 91 5 3 7 and low effluent ammonium level of 1 1 1 7 mgn l aob activity was high and relatively stable at 3 36 0 40 mgn gmlvss h table 4 while the volumetric aob activity displayed an upward trend due to a continuous increase in sludge concentration figure s3 importantly stable nob suppression was achieved as indicated by an average nob activity of 0 25 0 12 gn gmlvss h and a negligible level of nitrate in the effluent 0 1 0 1 mgn l the nitrogen conversion in a typical cycle during this period is shown in figure 5 a during each of the three aerobic phases the majority 90 of the ammonium was oxidized to nitrite rather than nitrate nitrite was then removed by denitrification in the following anoxic phase the establishment of nitrogen conversion via nitrite was a clear indication that stable mainstream nitrite shunt was successfully achieved in the pilot system online n2o monitoring during day 750 760 no sludge treatment showed relatively high n2o emissions with an emission factor of 1 86 0 23 mean s e n2o n tn defined as the portion of n2o converted from total nitrogen loading in wastewater the measured n2o emission factor is around 20 higher than the emission factor of 1 6 that ipcc used for calculating emissions from wwtps de haas and andrews 2022 nonetheless the current results are consistent with previous studies reporting increased n2o emissions in nitrite shunt systems due to the accumulation of nitrite massara et al 2017 vasilaki et al 2019 in addition satisfactory cod removal and sludge settleability were maintained throughout the whole operation figure s3 table s3 3 2 2 robustness of the mainstream nitrite shunt and nob suppression after stable operation for over 100 days sidestream sludge treatment was stopped on day 733 to test the robustness of the nitrite shunt subsequently the system was operated for 60 days without sludge treatment and the process exhibited superior robustness the suspension of sludge treatment increased sludge concentration figure s3 and higher volumetric aob activities figure 4 yielding better nitrogen removal performance than with sludge treatment from day 733 to 793 the effluent ammonium concentration was 0 1 0 1 mgn l and the tn removal efficiency increased to 94 8 0 8 notably the nob activity did not recover remaining at 0 10 0 13 gn gmlvss h comparable to that in the preceding period when sludge treatment was applied the nitrite shunt was stably maintained during this period with effluent nitrate concentration of 0 1 0 1 mgn l and nitrite concentration of 2 5 0 7 mgn l cycle studies showed that nitrogen conversion figure 5b over a cycle was similar to the preceding period which had fna treatment the stable performance of nitrite shunt in this period showed the harsh sludge treatment condition applied is redundant when worked in synergy with an in situ suppression strategy the sludge treatment condition may be relaxed while still maintaining sufficient suppressions on nob a reduced treatment frequency or treatment ratio can significantly reduce the operational cost of the sidestream sludge treatment approach which should be optimized in future studies to further evaluate the robustness of the established nitrite shunt on day 794 around 20 of the sludge in the pilot system was replaced with sludge containing nob from the full scale wwtp as expected the introduction of nob disrupted the nitrite shunt leading to an effluent nitrate and nitrite concentration of 4 6 1 0 mgn l and 0 2 0 3 mgn l respectively figure 4 the nob activity increased rapidly to 7 26 0 78 mgn l h in 10 days figure 5c shows that ammonium was fully oxidised to nitrate rather than nitrite at the end of each aerobic period showing disruption of the nitrite shunt the rapid increase in nitrate level in the effluent and recovery of nob activities from day 794 to 803 also demonstrated that the step feed strategy alone does not sufficiently suppress nob following the reintroduction of regular sludge treatment with fna from day 804 the nob activity decreased to negligible levels 0 67 0 50 mgn l h in 20 days figure 4 the nitrite shunt process was successfully re established with effluent ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations of 0 3 0 4 mgn l 3 6 0 9 mgn l and 0 1 0 1 mgn l respectively the nitrogen conversion in a cycle figure 5d was very similar to those in other periods with stable nitrite shunt microbial communities were monitored with 16s rrna sequencing and fish throughout the experiment in most samples nob were not detectable or in very low abundance 0 03 figure 6 ca nitrotoga was not detected during bioreactor operation after the reintroduction of nob on day 794 both nitrospira and nitrobacter were detected by 16s rrna analysis at 3 58 and 0 16 respectively these results were confirmed by fish analysis figure s4 after sludge treatment with fna was restarted on day 804 nob populations were quickly eliminated the fluctuation in nob is consistent with nob activity data and the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor these results collectively demonstrate the robustness of the integrated strategy for nob control and stable nitrite shunt performance 3 3 kinetic analysis of the integrated strategy in this study robust nitrite shunt was achieved through integrating sidestream nob inactivation and in situ suppression via step feed the kinetic learnings of this long term pilot study are summarized below to guide future implementation in order to eliminate nob while retaining aob in equations 1 2 should be satisfied 1 μ m nob s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 n o b s no 2 s no 2 k no 2 b nob 1 s r t 0 2 μ m aob s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 a o b s nh 4 s nh 4 k nh 4 b aob 1 s r t 0 where μ m nob and μ m aob are the maximum nob and aob growth rates 1 h s o 2 is the dissolved oxygen concentration mgo2 l k o 2 n o b and k o 2 a o b are kinetic parameters estimated by the half saturation constant of nob and aob for do mgo2 l s n o 2 is the concentration of nitrite mgn l k n o 2 is the half saturation constant of nob for nitrite mgn l s nh 4 is the concentration of ammonium mgn l k nh 4 is the half saturation constant of aob for ammonium mgn l b nob and b aob are the decay rates for nob and aob 1 h and srt is the sludge retention time h the reduction in srt affects both aob and nob and may cause the elimination of aob with subsequent process failure in contrast the selective control of growth rate μ and decay rate b is more successful for targeting nob in stage i of this work nob decay b nob was selectively enhanced through the regular sidestream sludge treatment which is a general feature for sidestream sludge treatment approaches sludge treatment by fna and fa was known to cause more cell death lysis for nob than for aob duan et al 2020 i e a larger increase in b nob leading to a situation satisfying in equation 1 with the initial effect on nob nitrite started to accumulate in the reactor however the accumulation of nitrite s no 2 undesirably promoted the growth rate of nob μ nob μ m nob s o 2 s o 2 k o 2 n o b s no 2 s no 2 k no 2 therefore while the increased b nob reduced the presence of nob in the system nob survived in the system through elevated μ nob which created opportunities for nob to adapt to the treatment therefore sidestream sludge treatment alone is unlikely sufficient to achieve stable nitrite shunt the strategies implemented in stage ii integrated b nob and μ nob control while b nob was selectively increased by sidestream sludge treatment denitrification outcompeted nob for nitrite in the anoxic phase of the step feed system furthermore the transient anoxia also affected the maximum growth rate of nob μ m nob miao et al 2021 therefore in the step feed system nob decay was promoted and the growth rate of nob was also effectively suppressed by nitrite limitation and transient anoxia leading to a minimized μ nob b nob term the effective integrated control strategy gave little chance for nob to adapt to the strategies achieving nearly complete nob elimination it was observed that in periods when sludge treatment was suspended day 794 803 stable nitrite shunt could not be achieved by reducing μ m nob alone clearly strategies which focus on either μ nob or b nob control are not as effective as integrating controls on μ and b simultaneously in other words effective nob control requires both suppressing nob growth and promoting the decay inactivation of nob in this study the nitrite shunt was robustly maintained for 60 days without fna fa sludge treatment in stage ii the results show potential to greatly reduce the frequency of sludge treatment for b nob control intermittent sludge treatment e g every two months could significantly reduce the operational cost of the proposed integrated control strategy and further studies are required to scale up the process combined with step feed design for wwtps other integrated sidestream treatment and mainstream control strategy may also be tested in the future to verify the integration strategy 4 conclusions in this study the feasibility of achieving robust nitrite shunt by sidestream fna and or fa based sludge treatment was evaluated under field conditions long term pilot system operation showed that sidestream sludge treatment was effective in short term nob suppression however nob developed resistance relatively quickly to the sludge treatment leading to unstable nitrite shunt the sidestream treatment strategy alone can unlikely attain robust nob suppression in real wastewater treatment systems in comparison a robust mainstream nitrite shunt with stable nob suppression was achieved and maintained for over one year with integrated sidestream treatment and in situ step feed control a kinetic analysis suggested the integration of sidestream treatment and in situ μ nob control was key to achieving robust nitrite shunt with stable nob suppression there is potential for intermitted sludge treatment with in situ step feed and other integrated sidestream and mainstream control strategies to be tested in the future with the effective nob control strategy verified in this work full scale implementation of mainstream nitrite shunt

15612,melanin is a critical component of fungal cell wall which protect fungi from adverse environmental tress however the role of melanin for fungi during the disinfection with chlorine based disinfectants has not been elucidated the results showed that the inactivation rate constants of aspergillus niger with chlorine and chlorine dioxide decreased from 0 08 to 2 10 min 1 to 0 after addition of 0 32 mg l melanin the results indicated addition of extracted fungal melanin inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide in contrast the k of aspergillus niger after inactivation with monochloramine ranged from 1 50 to 1 78 min 1 after addition of melanin which indicated effect of melanin on the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine was negligible in addition the extracted fungal melanin exhibited high reactivity with chlorine and chlorine dioxide but very low reactivity with monochloramine the different inactivation mechanisms of chlorine based disinfectants and different reactivity of melanin with chlorine based disinfectants led to the different protective mechanism of melanin for a niger and a flavus spores against disinfection with chlorine based disinfectants the chlorine and chlorine dioxide appeared to react with functional groups of melanin in cell wall of spores so sacrificial reactions between melanin and disinfectants decreased the available disinfectants and limited the diffusion of disinfectants to the reactive site on cell membrane which led to the decrease of the disinfection efficiency for chlorine and chlorine dioxide the monochloramine could penetrate into cell and damage dna without the effect of melanin due to its strong penetration and low reactivity with melanin our results systematically demonstrate the protective roles of melanin on the fungal spores against chlorine based disinfectants and the underlying mechanisms in resisting the environmental stress caused by chlorine based disinfectants which provides important implications for the control of fungi especially for fungi producing melanin graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fungi melanin protective role mechanism chlorine based disinfectants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fungi are ubiquitous heterotrophic organisms exist in different water resource including surface water groundwater and drinking water even in bottled water hageskal et al 2007 pereira et al 2009 more than 400 different fungal species separated from groundwater surface water and drinking water in europe over the last 30 years novak babic et al 2018 the secondary metabolite produced by fungi in drinking water would cause the deterioration of water quality mainly including taste and odor problems pipeline blockage and interfering with the chlorination process paterson and lima 2005 some secondary metabolites are toxic to animals even pose a risk for human health such as allergies opportunistic infections and intoxications hageskal et al 2009 not only secondary metabolite components of the fungus load and cell wall may be harmful to humans causing allergies and other opportunistic diseases particularly in immunocompromised people anaissie et al 2002 despite the fact that fungi are becoming recognized as pathogenic microorganisms in water they are often ignored in water treatment babič et al 2017 it is essential to develop effective disinfection methods for controlling the pollution of fungi during the drinking water treatment the pollution of fungi has attracted more and more attention which led to many studies about inactivation of fungi in water in recent years the commonly used disinfection methods such as chlorine monochloramine chlorine dioxide ozonation and uv have been studied in inactivating fungi the fungi were reported to be resistant to chlorine disinfection in addition fungi showed much higher chlorine resistance than bacteria and virus pereira et al 2013 ma and bibby 2017 reported the inactivation kinetic of aspergillus and penicillium by chlorine and monochloramine ma and bibby 2017 in previous studies chlorine dioxide and ozone showed high efficiency for the inactivation of fungi wen et al 2020c wen et al 2017a the lpuv and uv led have been used for the inactivation of fungi in water nourmoradi et al 2012 oliveira et al 2020 and uv leds showed better performance than lpuv in the inactivation of fungal spores wan et al 2020a except for traditional disinfection methods advanced oxidation processes have also been studied for inactivating fungi in water the uv peroxymonosulfate pms system caused more severe damage of the cell structure of fungal spores than the individual treatment wen et al 2017b the pipe corrosion products have been used to activating pms for the inactivation of fungi in water wen et al 2020b the tio2 mediated activated visible light showed high performance for the disinfection of a niger huang et al 2019 the combination of uv and chlorine has been proved to be a promising method for inactivation of fungi in water al gabr et al 2013 wan et al 2020b significant synergistic effects were observed for the inactivation of fungi with the combined use of uv and peracetic acid paa xu et al 2022 although many different disinfection methods have been reported to be effective for the inactivation of fungi chlorine based disinfectants are the most widely used in the water treatment around the world ngwenya et al 2013 the inactivation of fungi by chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide have been reported respectively but the comparison of inactivation efficiency and mechanism of fungal spores between three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants have not been reported systematically the fungi showed high chlorine resistance but the mechanism of high chlorine resistance for fungi has not been reported systematically the high chlorine resistance of fungi could be attributed to the following factors firstly the production of pigments such as melanin may protect the fungi against adverse environment including uv radiation and oxidants esbelin et al 2013 then enzymes like catalases that reduce the reactive oxidation species formed during disinfection was another important mechanism that increase the chlorine resistance azevedo et al 2007 finally the existence of a thick cell wall containing chitin mannan glucan and various lipids protect fungi against disinfection oliveira et al 2020 filamentous fungi have been reported to produce different kinds of pigments including carotenoids melanins flavins phenazines and quinones dufosse et al 2014 melanin a common pigment is a hydrophobic polymer with negative charge synthesized by phenols or indole compounds cordero and casadevall 2017 melanin in fungi protect themselves against environmental challenges such as uv light oxidants and ionizing radiation it makes fungi more capable of surviving in harsh environments eisenman and casadevall 2012 the protective role of aspergillus fumigatus melanin against uv has been reported in previous study allam and abd el zaher 2012 the melanin confer resistance to uv light by absorbing a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum and preventing photoinduced damage allam and abd el zaher 2012 melanin could efficiently scavenge reactive oxygen species ros generated by uva irradiation in solution geng et al 2008 zotti et al 2008 found that ozonation induced pigments bleaching in fungal colonies during the inactivation of aspergillus spp by ozone treatment zotti et al 2008 the color of the fungi colonies exhibited the change from green to white after treatment with ozone due to the oxidation of pigments de alencar et al 2012 the stability of fungal pigment under treatment of ozone has been evaluated and fungal pigment was found to show higher stability than other natural pigments previously reported zotti et al 2008 ambrico et al 2020 found that the conidia of a carbonarius and a alternaria with more pigment were more resistant to the plasma treatment compared with b cinerea and m fructicola conidia with less pigment and thinner cell wall they assumed that melanin played the protective action of aspergillus species against plasma treatment ambrico et al 2020 melanized conidia of s schenckii were more resistant to ionizing irradiation and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species than melanin deficient mutants of s schenckii romero martinez et al 2000 the fungi showed higher resistance to chlorine than bacteria and virus the protective role of melanin might be one of defense mechanism of fungi against chlorine disinfection ma and bibby 2017 although previous researches have illustrated the role of melanin in protecting fungi against oxidant agustinho and nosanchuk 2017 the role of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants and its protective mechanism remains to be investigated currently there is no systematic study that has illustrated the role of melanin in protecting fungi against disinfection with chlorine based disinfectants in addition the protective mechanism of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants was unclear therefore we aim to elucidate the role of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants in the present work specifically the aims of this study were to 1 compare the inactivation efficiency and mechanism of fungal spores between three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants 2 explore the protective role of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants for the inactivation of fungal spores 3 explore the underlying protective mechanism of melanin against disinfection of chlorine based disinfectants 2 materials and method 2 1 microorganisms a niger and a flavus are potential pathogenic fungi species and they have been reported to produce melanin chang et al 2019 pal et al 2014 therefore they were chosen as indicator to study the inactivation of fungal spore by the chlorine based disinfectants oliveira et al 2020 the preparation of fungal spore suspension has been described previously wen et al 2017a 2 2 the extraction and purification of melanin the procedure for the extraction of melanin are as follows firstly 5 ml of spore suspension was added into centrifuge tube contained 5 ml naoh 1 mol l and autoclaved for 20 min at 121 c then the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm the precipitate was abandoned and hcl 2 mol l was added to adjust the ph at 2 5 at last precipitate was collected after centrifugation and then washed for three times with ultrapure water suwannarach et al 2019 2 3 characterization of fungal melanin the melanin that has been dissolved in koh 1 mol l was scanned using a uv visible spectrophotometer u 3900 hitachi japan with the wavelength range of 200 750 nm goncalves et al 2012 the extracted melanin was ground with ir grade kbr and recorded at 4000 400 cm 1 using a ft ir spectrophotometer nicole is50 thermo scientific america 2 4 preparation and determination of chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide the purchased 10 sodium hypochlorite solution was used as chlorine stock solution to prepare the monochloramine stock solution free chlorine and ammonium chloride solution was mixed as the ratio of cl2 n weight ratio of 4 1 at ph 8 lee et al 2011 the concentration of free chlorine and monochloramine stock solution was determined by the dpd titration method federation and association 2005 the production of chlorine dioxide was described in previous study huber et al 2005 spectrophotometry was used to determine the concentration of chlorine dioxide stock solution huber et al 2005 2 5 inactivation procedure the conical flask 150 ml contained fungal spores 104 105 and 106 cfu ml was used to conduct the inactivation experiments the free chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide stock solution were added at the target concentration to start the reaction at preset contact times one milliliter of sample was aspirated into a centrifuge tube sodium thiosulfate solution 0 1 m was used to quench the leftover disinfectant then the sample was diluted with ten fold dilutions and 0 1 ml of the sample after diluted was plated on drbc agar in triplicate the plates were transformed to constant temperature incubator at 28 c the number of fungi colonies cfu ml was recorded using the average number of colonies after incubation 2 3 days 2 6 analytic method the membrane integrity of fungal spores was determined by flow cytometry fcm combined with pi sg dye dihydroethidium dhe sigma merck usa was applied to determine the intracellular ros level of the two kinds of aspergillus spores before and after inactivation the detailed procedure for dying was described in supporting information wen et al 2020a a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa was used to perform measurements cao et al 2021 the cell morphology of fungal spores before and after inactivation was observed by scanning electron microscope sem the procedures for pretreatment and measurements of samples were described in supporting information wen et al 2017a 2 7 data analysis the inactivation rate constants k were calculated using the geeraerd and van impe inactivation model fitting tool ginafit geeraerd et al 2005 the models of log linear regression and log linear regression plus shoulder were used the specific formulas of log linear regression eq 1 and log linear regression plus shoulder model eq 2 are described as follows 1 n n 0 e k max t 2 n n 0 e k max t e k max sl 1 e k max sl 1 e k max t where n0 and n represent the number of colonies cfu ml before and after inactivation k max is the maximum inactivation rate constant min 1 and sl is the shoulder length min the degradation of pigment with chlorine based disinfectants was fitted to a first order kinetic model as following eq 3 3 o d o d 0 k t where od is the optical density at time t od 0 is the initial value and k is the degradation rate constant aguilar et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 the comparison of the inactivation efficiency between chlorine based disinfectants the inactivation curves of different concentration aspergillus spores by chlorine based disinfectants are shown in fig s1 the ginafit was used to calculate the inactivation rate constant of a niger and a flavus the inactivation of two kinds of aspergillus spores by monochloramine fitted well with the log linear plus shoulder model while the log linear model was more suitable for chlorine and chlorine dioxide the k of different spore concentration by chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide are presented in fig 1 the results showed that the k of chlorine and chlorine dioxide decreased with increase of spore concentration the change of k of monochloramine could be negligible with the increase of spore concentration as shown in fig 1 chlorine dioxide was the most effective for the inactivation of two kinds of aspergillus spores when spore concentration was 1 2 104 and 1 2 105 cfu ml however the monochloramine was the most effective when the spore concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml and the monochloramine was more effective than chlorine in all conditions specifically the k of a niger and a flavus for monochloramine was 5 18 and 4 70 times bigger than it for chlorine with 1 2 104 cfu ml spores the k of monochloramine for a niger and a flavus was 14 25 and 11 75 times greater than it for chlorine when the spore suspension was 1 2 105 cfu ml the k of a niger and a flavus with chlorine and chlorine dioxide were all almost 0 when the spore concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml while it was 0 53 and 0 41 min 1 for monochloramine the results indicated that monochloramine was more effective than chlorine for the inactivation of two kinds of aspergillus spores it even more effective than chlorine dioxide when the spore concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml however the chlorine showed higher efficiency than monochloramine for the inactivation of bacteria and virus and chlorine dioxide was more effective than chlorine for the inactivation of microorganism in previous studies buse et al 2019 lim et al 2010 wen et al 2017a the oxidation potential of chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine is in the following order chlorine dioxide 1 51 v chlorine 1 36 v monochloramine 1 13 v li et al 2011 wen et al 2017a generally the higher oxidation ability will lead to more stronger disinfection efficiency the increase of spore concentration inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide significantly while its effect on monochloramine could be negligible the reasons for increase of fungi spore concentration decreased the disinfection efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide could be attributed two following factors firstly the concentration of melanin would increase with the increase of spore concentration the higher concentration of melanin might decrease the disinfection efficiency then the increase of spore concentration would decrease the available disinfectants that acted on every single spore thus decrease the disinfection efficiency as showed in fig 1 the k of a niger after inactivation with chlorine based disinfectants was higher than that of a flavus which indicated that a flavus spores showed higher resistance to the disinfection by three kinds of chlorine based disinfectant the results were in agreement with our previous study which found that a flavus showed higher resistance to paa inactivation than a niger zuo et al 2022 the presence of melanin may be the important factor that led to the different resistance of two kinds of aspergillus species the a flavus melanin showed relative lower reactivity with chlorine based disinfectants in section 3 5 the more resistant melanin in a flavus made it more resistant to disinfection by chlorine based disinfectants the spores size was another factor that affect the resistance of fungal spores the diameter a flavus was 3 33 0 1 μm which was bigger than that of a niger 2 50 0 1 μm the bigger size of spore would lead to the higher resistance wen et al 2017 the comparison of the inactivation of bacteria by chlorine and monochloramine was also conducted in this study as shown in fig s2 the k of e coli by chlorine was 1 39 times bigger than monochloramine which indicated that chlorine showed higher performance than monochloramine for the inactivation of e coli the results were different from the inactivation of aspergillus spores which found that the monochloramine was more effective than chlorine the changes of spore suspension color were observed during the inactivation of a niger and a flavus spores with chlorine and chlorine dioxide melanin in the fungal spores was assumed as the important factor that affect the disinfection efficiency of two kinds of aspergillus spores with chlorine based disinfectants experiments were conducted to prove the speculation and results were presented in the following section 3 2 the characteristics of melanin and its effect on the inactivation efficiency previous review articles have concluded that pigment could protect fungi from adverse environment including radiation oxidants and heavy mental which could enhance the survival of fungal spores cordero and casadevall 2017 however the role of melanin on the inactivation efficiency of fungi by chlorine based disinfectants has not been reported fig s3 presents the pictures of a niger and a flavus on drbc and two kinds of melanin in water the melanin has been extracted from a niger and a flavus spores and then it was characterized by full wavelength scanning and ftir fig s4 the full wavelength scanning indicated that the two kinds of melanin all showed absorption peak at 295 nm the ftir spectra of the extracted melanin from aspergillus spores showed some strong absorption peaks and broad bands in the 3400 3200 cm 1 region which are related to oh and nh2 stretching as showed in fig s4 b the two kinds of melanin have similar ftir spectra the two kinds of melanin exhibited an absorption in 2930 2860 cm 1 region assigned to ch2 and ch3 stretching the spectra of a niger and a flavus melanin exhibited a strong absorption at 1650 1620 cm 1 due to stretching vibrations of aromatic cc or co groups goncalves et al 2012 the same functional group of a niger and a flavus melanin including oh groups aromatic cc or co groups have been reported previously pal et al 2014 in order to explore the role of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants different concentration of extracted melanin was added into the reaction system during the inactivation of aspergillus spores by three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants as shown in figs 2 and s5 the addition of melanin significantly inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide while the effect of melanin on the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine could be negligible as shown in fig 2 the k of a niger after inactivation with chlorine decreased from 0 17 to 0 08 0 0 min 1 with added melanin increased from 0 to 0 14 0 20 and 0 32 mg l for chlorine dioxide the k of a niger were 2 10 to 1 61 1 40 0 min 1 with addition melanin of 0 to 0 14 0 20 and 0 32 mg l but the k of a niger by monochloramine ranged from 1 50 to 1 78 min 1 without significant difference p 0 05 with addition of different concentration melanin the k for inactivation of a flavus with chlorine based disinfectants with addition of melanin showed the same trend with the inactivation of a niger the results showed that the extracted melanin acted a protective role of aspergillus spores against chlorine and chlorine dioxide while its effect on inactivation efficiency of aspergillus spores by monochloramine could negligible the protection of melanin against oxidant and antifungal drugs has been reported in previous studies jacobson et al 1995 studied the antioxidant function of melanin in black fungi and found that compared with albino strains melanized strains could withstood higher concentrations of permanganate and hypochlorite it required more 1000 fold higher concentrations of h2o2 to kill melanized strains jacobson et al 1995 goncalves et al reported that the melanin from a nidulans is a potential hocl scavenger goncalves and pombeiro sponchiado 2005 melanized c neoformans cells are more resistant than nonmelanized cells to the treatment of chemically generated nitrogen and oxygen derived oxidants wang and casadevall 1994 a fumigatus mutant strain white with less pigment was isolated and mutant conidia were more susceptible to killing by oxidants in vitro jahn et al 1997 baltazar et al 2015 found that melanin serves as a nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species scavenger defending the fungus cell from antifungal medications baltazar et al 2015 3 3 the comparison of inactivation mechanisms of chlorine based disinfectants the changes of membrane permeability of aspergillus spores after inactivation with three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants were measured by flow cytometry combined with sg pi dye as shown in figs 3 s6 and s7 the membrane intact cell decreased significantly after treated with chlorine and chlorine dioxide while the change of membrane integrity cell after inactivation by monochloramine was negligible the membrane integrity cell of a flavus and a niger reduced from 99 0 and 96 4 to 3 9 and 0 2 after treated by chlorine dioxide with 10 min the membrane integrity cell of a flavus and a niger dropped from 91 2 and 94 8 to 9 2 and 30 4 after inactivation with chlorine for 30 min the membrane integrity cell of a flavus and a niger ranged from 88 4 to 94 0 and 89 0 to 97 3 after treatment with monochloramine within 30 min the damage of cell membrane integrity of aspergillus spores caused by chlorine based was in the following order chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine the results of membrane integrity of a niger and a flavus spores after treatment with chlorine based disinfectants showed that chlorine and chlorine dioxide caused serious damage of cell membrane while the damage of cell membrane caused by monochloramine was negligible which indicated that the three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants showed different mechanism of fungal spores previous studies have reported that chlorine and chlorine dioxide inactivated bacteria by destroying the cell wall and cell membrane while monochloramine penetrated into cell without damage of cell membrane cho et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 mogoa et al 2011 found that monochloramine showed different mode of action for the inactivation of amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii compared to chlorine and chlorine dioxide the change of cell morphology and cell membrane permeabilization after monochloramine treatment was negligible while chlorine and chlorine dioxide induced serious cell shrinking and permeabilization mogoa et al 2011 monochloramine inactivated bacteria by penetrating into the cell and damaging the dna and protein which was different from chlorine and chlorine dioxide coburn et al 2016 holder et al 2013 the present study found that chlorine and chlorine dioxide caused serious damage of fungal spores while monochloramine treatment hardly affect the membrane integrity of two kinds of aspergillus spores when microorganism was under stress the quantity of intracellular ros commonly increased and higher ros concentration would destroy cellular components and activities gessler et al 2007 microbial cells produce antioxidants such as catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod to maintain a balance between ros production and elimination dukan et al 1999 the changes of intracellular ros level were determined by fcm combined with dhe dye as shown in figs 4 s8 and s9 high ros cell increased after inactivation by chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide the high ros cell of a niger and a flavus after inactivation by chlorine dioxide increased quickly from 4 9 and 1 2 to 97 7 and 97 2 within 5 min then it kept stable at high level the high ros cell of a niger and a flavus increased from 5 6 and 5 5 to 18 7 and 32 3 after inactivation by chlorine at 30 min the high ros level of a niger and a flavus ranged from 11 0 and 4 4 to 1 2 and 13 2 after inactivation by chlorine and monochloramine at 30 min the results indicated that the three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants could cause stress response of fungal spores and the increase of high ros level the change of ros after inactivation with chlorine based disinfectants was in the following order chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine the high ros cell increased most quickly after being treated with chlorine dioxide due to its high oxidation potential fig 5 presents the sem photos of aspergillus spores cell morphology after inactivated by three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants as shown in fig 5 a niger and a flavus spores before inactivation were full and smooth the surface of spores became rough after treatment with monochloramine while the structure of spores was seriously damaged after treatment with chlorine dioxide the a niger and a flavus spores after treatment with chlorine was only slightly deformed the chlorine dioxide caused most serious damage of fungal spores chlorine was the second while monochloramine caused the least structure damage of fungal spores the results confirmed the results of cell membrane integrity which indicated that chlorine dioxide induced most serious damage of cell membrane integrity chlorine was the next and monochloramine hardly affected the cell membrane integrity of two kinds of aspergillus spores as shown in fig s10 the damage of different cell structures by chlorine disinfection follows the following order culturability of fungal spores cellular stress response level of intracellular ros cell membrane damage visual structural damage of cells sem dna damage the mechanism for the inactivation fungal spores with chlorine could be concluded from the above results firstly the chlorine first attacked the cell wall and cell membrane of fungal spores and destroyed the cell membrane then caused oxidative stress response and increase of intracellular ros finally the cell membrane was damaged and disinfectants entered into the cell and caused the damage of dna the damage of aspergillus spore cell structures after monochloramine disinfection was in the following order culturability of fungal spores dna damage cellular stress response intracellular ros cell membrane damage visual damage cell structures sem the results indicated that monochloramine inactivated mainly by penetrating into cell and damaging dna which was consistent with our previous study cao et al 2022 the damage of fungal spore cell structures after chlorine dioxide disinfection was in the following order cellular stress response intracellular ros culturability of fungal spores cell membrane damage visual damage to cell structure dna damage the mechanism of chlorine dioxide disinfection could be summarized as follow firstly the strong oxidation of chlorine dioxide caused the strong oxidative stress response and caused quick rise of the intracellular ros then chlorine dioxide and ros attacked the cell wall and cell membrane and caused serious damage of cell membrane and finally entered into the cell to cause dna damage in conclusion three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants showed different inactivation mechanisms of fungal spores fig s11 chlorine and chlorine dioxide inactivated fungal spores mainly by causing the damage of cell membranes changes in cell morphology and increase of membrane permeability and intracellular redox homeostasis intracellular ros monochloramine inactivated fungal spores mainly by penetrating into cell and damaging intracellular dna and protein 3 4 the reactivity of melanin with chlorine based disinfectants and protection mechanisms of melanin in order to explore the protective mechanism of melanin on aspergillus spores against chlorine based disinfectants the consumption of disinfectants after the addition of melanin was accessed as shown in fig 6 the addition of melanin accelerated the consumption of chlorine and chlorine dioxide while its effect on the attenuation of monochloramine could be negligible for example the concentration of chlorine decreased from 4 0 to 1 71 mg l during the inactivation of a niger at 60 min while it decreased to 0 42 with addition of 0 14 mg l melanin the chlorine was completely consumed within 10 and 2 min with addition of 0 20 and 0 32 mg l melanin the chlorine dioxide decreased from 4 0 to 0 95 mg l at 30 min without addition of melanin while it decreased to 0 mg l after 15 min with addition of 0 14 mg l melanin the chlorine dioxide was completely consumed within 7 min and 5 min with addition of 0 20 and 0 32 mg l melanin during the inactivation process the concentration of monochloramine ranged from 4 0 to 3 80 mg l during the inactivation of a niger before and after the addition of melanin for the inactivation of a flavus the changes of chlorine based disinfectants concentration followed the same trend the results indicated that the consumption of chlorine and chlorine dioxide in the reaction of disinfectants with melanin decreased the available disinfectants acted on the inactivation of fungal spores thus protecting the spores against further damage and inhibiting the disinfection efficiency the reactivity between fungal melanin and chlorine based disinfectant were evaluated by measuring the changes of melanin concentration during the reaction with chlorine based disinfectants the od295 and od od0 was used to present the concentration of melanin and changes of melanin concentration as shown in fig 7 the concentration of a niger and a flavus melanin decreased quickly when it reacted with chlorine and chlorine dioxide the concentration of a niger and a flavus melanin kept stable during it reacted with monochloramine the od295 of a niger melanin decreased quickly when it reacted with chlorine and chlorine dioxide within 3 min and kept stable after 5 min the change of od295 of a niger melanin could be negligible when it reacted with monochloramine the od295 of a flavus melanin decreased by 28 33 and 39 34 when it reacted with chlorine and chlorine dioxide at 5 min the concentration of a niger melanin reduced by 34 88 and 39 51 when it reacted with chlorine and chlorine dioxide at 5 min however the changes of two kinds of melanin concentration during reaction with monochloramine only ranged from 0 to 4 62 the reaction kinetic rates between disinfectants with melanin were calculated with eq 3 as showed in fig 7 c the reaction rate constants of three chlorine based disinfectants with fungal melanin were in the following order chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine the reaction rate constant of chlorine dioxide with a niger and a flavus melanin were 0 238 and 0 176 s 1 which was 1 62 and 2 84 times higher than that of chlorine the reaction rate constants of monochloramine with a niger and a flavus melanin were 0 the results indicated that chlorine and chlorine dioxide showed higher reactivity with melanin than monochloramine the chlorine dioxide exhibited higher reaction rate with melanin than chlorine while the reaction rate of monochloramine with melanin could be negligible the three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants showed different reactivity with melanin due the different oxidation potential in addition chlorine and chlorine dioxide was non selective oxidants while monochloramine interacted with proteins faster than polysaccharides han et al 2017 aguilar et al studied the stability of fungal pigments after treatment with ozone the first order kinetic model was used to describe the degradation of pigments during ozonation and reaction rate constants ranged from 0 127 to 0 206 s 1 in the buffer aguilar et al 2018 although the structure of melanin was unsolved the two synthesis pathways dhn and dopa of melanin have been elucidated the precursors of melanin contained phenolic hydroxyl group in two synthesis pathways eisenman and casadevall 2012 the ftir spectrum of a niger and a flavus melanin also confirmed that melanin contained hydroxyl group fig s4 previous study has reported that chlorine dioxide could react with electron rich moieties such as phenols k app 103 109 m 1s 1 gan et al 2020 the reaction between chlorine with phenol is carried out by a stepwise substitution of the 2 4 and 6 positions attributed to the activating ortho para directing hydroxyl group deborde and gunten 2008 the chlorine and chlorine dioxide all showed high reactivity with phenolic hydroxyl group so the chlorine and chlorine dioxide would react with the phenolic hydroxyl group in melanin in addition to the phenolic hydroxyl group the ftir of two kinds of melanin showed that there existed unsaturated bonds in the a niger and a flavus melanin fig s4 the unsaturated bond in melanin structures could facilitate the interaction with chlorine and chlorine dioxide resulting in color degradation the reactivity of chlorine dioxide tends to favor organic compounds with π electrons gan et al 2020 the melanin contained two fused double ring systems rich in π electrons which made it easier to react with chlorine dioxide previous studies have reported that melanin was an antioxidant and showed strong antioxidant properties goncalves et al 2005 found that melanin from a nidulans was a potential hocl scavenger goncalves and pombeiro sponchiado 2005 in conclusion the antioxidant properties of melanin hydroxyl group π electron and unsaturated bond made it easier to react with chlorine and chlorine dioxide fig 8 summarizes the potential reactions between chlorine and chlorine dioxide with melanin according to the discussions above the protective mechanisms of the melanin on a niger and a flavus spores against the three chlorine based disinfectants could be summarized from the above results as shown in fig 9 chlorine and chlorine dioxide acted on the cell wall and cell membrane during the inactivation of a niger and a flavus spores and the melanin located in the cell wall would react with chlorine and chlorine dioxide and protect the spores from further damage to cell membrane the melanin would consume disinfectants and limit the access to reactive sites on cell membrane the monochloramine inactivated fungal spores mainly by penetrating into cell and damaging dna the low reactivity of monochloramine with melanin and strong penetrability made it penetrate into cell and damaging dna without effect of melanin the different protection mechanisms of melanin against the three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants could explain why chlorine based disinfectants showed different inactivation efficiency under different spore concentrations when the spore concentration was 1 2 104 and 1 2 105 cfu ml chlorine dioxide could break through the barrier of melanin and showed high inactivation efficiency but the melanin inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine significantly which made it less effective than monochloramine when the spore concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml the concentration of melanin increased with the higher spore concentration and the higher concentration of melanin inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide the available disinfectant that aced on single spore decreased with the increase of spore concentration which led to the disability for chlorine and chlorine dioxide to break through the barrier of melanin the extracted melanin showed negligible effect on the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine and the increase of spore concentration hardly affected the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine the protection of fungal melanin against disinfectants would increase its resistance to disinfection which leads to the increase of fungi pollution risk in the drinking water supply system consequently the pollution of fungi in certain water related indoor environments would be enhanced due to the presence of fungi in drinking water supply system fungi enrichment in interior spaces can harm human health in two ways directly through inhalation of aerosols touch or drinking and indirectly through exposure to contaminated surfaces dishes or clothing the present study found that melanin protected fungi against chlorine and chlorine dioxide while its effect on the disinfection efficiency of monochloramine was negligible which indicated that monochloramine might be the best choice for the control of melanized fungi species among the chlorine based disinfectants 4 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are as following the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores by chlorine based disinfectants showed different trend with different concentrations of fungal spores the order of inactivation efficiency was as follows chlorine dioxide monochloramine chlorine when the spore concentration was 1 2 104 and 1 2 105 cfu ml the inactivation efficiency was in the following order monochloramine chlorine dioxide chlorine when spores concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml the chlorine based disinfectants showed different inactivation mechanisms of fungal spores the chlorine and chlorine dioxide inactivated spores by damaging the cell wall and cell membrane leading to leakage of intracellular materials and death of cell the monochloramine inactivated the spores by penetrating into the cell and damaging the dna of spores the addition of melanin inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide while its effect on the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine was negligible the results indicated that melanin played a protective role of fungal spores against chlorine and chlorine dioxide disinfection while it didn t affect the disinfection efficiency of monochloramine the addition of melanin accelerated the consumption of chlorine and chlorine dioxide but the attenuation of monochloramine was the same after addition of melanin chlorine and chlorine dioxide showed high reactivity with melanin while monochloramine exhibited very low reactivity with melanin the combined results indicated that melanin acted as a disinfectant consumer and limiting access to reactive sites on cell membrane for protection of fungal spores against chlorine and chlorine dioxide disinfection the monochloramine could penetrate into cell and damage dna without the effect of melanin due to its strong penetration and low reactivity with melanin

15612,melanin is a critical component of fungal cell wall which protect fungi from adverse environmental tress however the role of melanin for fungi during the disinfection with chlorine based disinfectants has not been elucidated the results showed that the inactivation rate constants of aspergillus niger with chlorine and chlorine dioxide decreased from 0 08 to 2 10 min 1 to 0 after addition of 0 32 mg l melanin the results indicated addition of extracted fungal melanin inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide in contrast the k of aspergillus niger after inactivation with monochloramine ranged from 1 50 to 1 78 min 1 after addition of melanin which indicated effect of melanin on the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine was negligible in addition the extracted fungal melanin exhibited high reactivity with chlorine and chlorine dioxide but very low reactivity with monochloramine the different inactivation mechanisms of chlorine based disinfectants and different reactivity of melanin with chlorine based disinfectants led to the different protective mechanism of melanin for a niger and a flavus spores against disinfection with chlorine based disinfectants the chlorine and chlorine dioxide appeared to react with functional groups of melanin in cell wall of spores so sacrificial reactions between melanin and disinfectants decreased the available disinfectants and limited the diffusion of disinfectants to the reactive site on cell membrane which led to the decrease of the disinfection efficiency for chlorine and chlorine dioxide the monochloramine could penetrate into cell and damage dna without the effect of melanin due to its strong penetration and low reactivity with melanin our results systematically demonstrate the protective roles of melanin on the fungal spores against chlorine based disinfectants and the underlying mechanisms in resisting the environmental stress caused by chlorine based disinfectants which provides important implications for the control of fungi especially for fungi producing melanin graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fungi melanin protective role mechanism chlorine based disinfectants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fungi are ubiquitous heterotrophic organisms exist in different water resource including surface water groundwater and drinking water even in bottled water hageskal et al 2007 pereira et al 2009 more than 400 different fungal species separated from groundwater surface water and drinking water in europe over the last 30 years novak babic et al 2018 the secondary metabolite produced by fungi in drinking water would cause the deterioration of water quality mainly including taste and odor problems pipeline blockage and interfering with the chlorination process paterson and lima 2005 some secondary metabolites are toxic to animals even pose a risk for human health such as allergies opportunistic infections and intoxications hageskal et al 2009 not only secondary metabolite components of the fungus load and cell wall may be harmful to humans causing allergies and other opportunistic diseases particularly in immunocompromised people anaissie et al 2002 despite the fact that fungi are becoming recognized as pathogenic microorganisms in water they are often ignored in water treatment babič et al 2017 it is essential to develop effective disinfection methods for controlling the pollution of fungi during the drinking water treatment the pollution of fungi has attracted more and more attention which led to many studies about inactivation of fungi in water in recent years the commonly used disinfection methods such as chlorine monochloramine chlorine dioxide ozonation and uv have been studied in inactivating fungi the fungi were reported to be resistant to chlorine disinfection in addition fungi showed much higher chlorine resistance than bacteria and virus pereira et al 2013 ma and bibby 2017 reported the inactivation kinetic of aspergillus and penicillium by chlorine and monochloramine ma and bibby 2017 in previous studies chlorine dioxide and ozone showed high efficiency for the inactivation of fungi wen et al 2020c wen et al 2017a the lpuv and uv led have been used for the inactivation of fungi in water nourmoradi et al 2012 oliveira et al 2020 and uv leds showed better performance than lpuv in the inactivation of fungal spores wan et al 2020a except for traditional disinfection methods advanced oxidation processes have also been studied for inactivating fungi in water the uv peroxymonosulfate pms system caused more severe damage of the cell structure of fungal spores than the individual treatment wen et al 2017b the pipe corrosion products have been used to activating pms for the inactivation of fungi in water wen et al 2020b the tio2 mediated activated visible light showed high performance for the disinfection of a niger huang et al 2019 the combination of uv and chlorine has been proved to be a promising method for inactivation of fungi in water al gabr et al 2013 wan et al 2020b significant synergistic effects were observed for the inactivation of fungi with the combined use of uv and peracetic acid paa xu et al 2022 although many different disinfection methods have been reported to be effective for the inactivation of fungi chlorine based disinfectants are the most widely used in the water treatment around the world ngwenya et al 2013 the inactivation of fungi by chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide have been reported respectively but the comparison of inactivation efficiency and mechanism of fungal spores between three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants have not been reported systematically the fungi showed high chlorine resistance but the mechanism of high chlorine resistance for fungi has not been reported systematically the high chlorine resistance of fungi could be attributed to the following factors firstly the production of pigments such as melanin may protect the fungi against adverse environment including uv radiation and oxidants esbelin et al 2013 then enzymes like catalases that reduce the reactive oxidation species formed during disinfection was another important mechanism that increase the chlorine resistance azevedo et al 2007 finally the existence of a thick cell wall containing chitin mannan glucan and various lipids protect fungi against disinfection oliveira et al 2020 filamentous fungi have been reported to produce different kinds of pigments including carotenoids melanins flavins phenazines and quinones dufosse et al 2014 melanin a common pigment is a hydrophobic polymer with negative charge synthesized by phenols or indole compounds cordero and casadevall 2017 melanin in fungi protect themselves against environmental challenges such as uv light oxidants and ionizing radiation it makes fungi more capable of surviving in harsh environments eisenman and casadevall 2012 the protective role of aspergillus fumigatus melanin against uv has been reported in previous study allam and abd el zaher 2012 the melanin confer resistance to uv light by absorbing a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum and preventing photoinduced damage allam and abd el zaher 2012 melanin could efficiently scavenge reactive oxygen species ros generated by uva irradiation in solution geng et al 2008 zotti et al 2008 found that ozonation induced pigments bleaching in fungal colonies during the inactivation of aspergillus spp by ozone treatment zotti et al 2008 the color of the fungi colonies exhibited the change from green to white after treatment with ozone due to the oxidation of pigments de alencar et al 2012 the stability of fungal pigment under treatment of ozone has been evaluated and fungal pigment was found to show higher stability than other natural pigments previously reported zotti et al 2008 ambrico et al 2020 found that the conidia of a carbonarius and a alternaria with more pigment were more resistant to the plasma treatment compared with b cinerea and m fructicola conidia with less pigment and thinner cell wall they assumed that melanin played the protective action of aspergillus species against plasma treatment ambrico et al 2020 melanized conidia of s schenckii were more resistant to ionizing irradiation and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species than melanin deficient mutants of s schenckii romero martinez et al 2000 the fungi showed higher resistance to chlorine than bacteria and virus the protective role of melanin might be one of defense mechanism of fungi against chlorine disinfection ma and bibby 2017 although previous researches have illustrated the role of melanin in protecting fungi against oxidant agustinho and nosanchuk 2017 the role of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants and its protective mechanism remains to be investigated currently there is no systematic study that has illustrated the role of melanin in protecting fungi against disinfection with chlorine based disinfectants in addition the protective mechanism of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants was unclear therefore we aim to elucidate the role of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants in the present work specifically the aims of this study were to 1 compare the inactivation efficiency and mechanism of fungal spores between three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants 2 explore the protective role of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants for the inactivation of fungal spores 3 explore the underlying protective mechanism of melanin against disinfection of chlorine based disinfectants 2 materials and method 2 1 microorganisms a niger and a flavus are potential pathogenic fungi species and they have been reported to produce melanin chang et al 2019 pal et al 2014 therefore they were chosen as indicator to study the inactivation of fungal spore by the chlorine based disinfectants oliveira et al 2020 the preparation of fungal spore suspension has been described previously wen et al 2017a 2 2 the extraction and purification of melanin the procedure for the extraction of melanin are as follows firstly 5 ml of spore suspension was added into centrifuge tube contained 5 ml naoh 1 mol l and autoclaved for 20 min at 121 c then the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 rpm the precipitate was abandoned and hcl 2 mol l was added to adjust the ph at 2 5 at last precipitate was collected after centrifugation and then washed for three times with ultrapure water suwannarach et al 2019 2 3 characterization of fungal melanin the melanin that has been dissolved in koh 1 mol l was scanned using a uv visible spectrophotometer u 3900 hitachi japan with the wavelength range of 200 750 nm goncalves et al 2012 the extracted melanin was ground with ir grade kbr and recorded at 4000 400 cm 1 using a ft ir spectrophotometer nicole is50 thermo scientific america 2 4 preparation and determination of chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide the purchased 10 sodium hypochlorite solution was used as chlorine stock solution to prepare the monochloramine stock solution free chlorine and ammonium chloride solution was mixed as the ratio of cl2 n weight ratio of 4 1 at ph 8 lee et al 2011 the concentration of free chlorine and monochloramine stock solution was determined by the dpd titration method federation and association 2005 the production of chlorine dioxide was described in previous study huber et al 2005 spectrophotometry was used to determine the concentration of chlorine dioxide stock solution huber et al 2005 2 5 inactivation procedure the conical flask 150 ml contained fungal spores 104 105 and 106 cfu ml was used to conduct the inactivation experiments the free chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide stock solution were added at the target concentration to start the reaction at preset contact times one milliliter of sample was aspirated into a centrifuge tube sodium thiosulfate solution 0 1 m was used to quench the leftover disinfectant then the sample was diluted with ten fold dilutions and 0 1 ml of the sample after diluted was plated on drbc agar in triplicate the plates were transformed to constant temperature incubator at 28 c the number of fungi colonies cfu ml was recorded using the average number of colonies after incubation 2 3 days 2 6 analytic method the membrane integrity of fungal spores was determined by flow cytometry fcm combined with pi sg dye dihydroethidium dhe sigma merck usa was applied to determine the intracellular ros level of the two kinds of aspergillus spores before and after inactivation the detailed procedure for dying was described in supporting information wen et al 2020a a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa was used to perform measurements cao et al 2021 the cell morphology of fungal spores before and after inactivation was observed by scanning electron microscope sem the procedures for pretreatment and measurements of samples were described in supporting information wen et al 2017a 2 7 data analysis the inactivation rate constants k were calculated using the geeraerd and van impe inactivation model fitting tool ginafit geeraerd et al 2005 the models of log linear regression and log linear regression plus shoulder were used the specific formulas of log linear regression eq 1 and log linear regression plus shoulder model eq 2 are described as follows 1 n n 0 e k max t 2 n n 0 e k max t e k max sl 1 e k max sl 1 e k max t where n0 and n represent the number of colonies cfu ml before and after inactivation k max is the maximum inactivation rate constant min 1 and sl is the shoulder length min the degradation of pigment with chlorine based disinfectants was fitted to a first order kinetic model as following eq 3 3 o d o d 0 k t where od is the optical density at time t od 0 is the initial value and k is the degradation rate constant aguilar et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 the comparison of the inactivation efficiency between chlorine based disinfectants the inactivation curves of different concentration aspergillus spores by chlorine based disinfectants are shown in fig s1 the ginafit was used to calculate the inactivation rate constant of a niger and a flavus the inactivation of two kinds of aspergillus spores by monochloramine fitted well with the log linear plus shoulder model while the log linear model was more suitable for chlorine and chlorine dioxide the k of different spore concentration by chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide are presented in fig 1 the results showed that the k of chlorine and chlorine dioxide decreased with increase of spore concentration the change of k of monochloramine could be negligible with the increase of spore concentration as shown in fig 1 chlorine dioxide was the most effective for the inactivation of two kinds of aspergillus spores when spore concentration was 1 2 104 and 1 2 105 cfu ml however the monochloramine was the most effective when the spore concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml and the monochloramine was more effective than chlorine in all conditions specifically the k of a niger and a flavus for monochloramine was 5 18 and 4 70 times bigger than it for chlorine with 1 2 104 cfu ml spores the k of monochloramine for a niger and a flavus was 14 25 and 11 75 times greater than it for chlorine when the spore suspension was 1 2 105 cfu ml the k of a niger and a flavus with chlorine and chlorine dioxide were all almost 0 when the spore concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml while it was 0 53 and 0 41 min 1 for monochloramine the results indicated that monochloramine was more effective than chlorine for the inactivation of two kinds of aspergillus spores it even more effective than chlorine dioxide when the spore concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml however the chlorine showed higher efficiency than monochloramine for the inactivation of bacteria and virus and chlorine dioxide was more effective than chlorine for the inactivation of microorganism in previous studies buse et al 2019 lim et al 2010 wen et al 2017a the oxidation potential of chlorine chlorine dioxide and monochloramine is in the following order chlorine dioxide 1 51 v chlorine 1 36 v monochloramine 1 13 v li et al 2011 wen et al 2017a generally the higher oxidation ability will lead to more stronger disinfection efficiency the increase of spore concentration inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide significantly while its effect on monochloramine could be negligible the reasons for increase of fungi spore concentration decreased the disinfection efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide could be attributed two following factors firstly the concentration of melanin would increase with the increase of spore concentration the higher concentration of melanin might decrease the disinfection efficiency then the increase of spore concentration would decrease the available disinfectants that acted on every single spore thus decrease the disinfection efficiency as showed in fig 1 the k of a niger after inactivation with chlorine based disinfectants was higher than that of a flavus which indicated that a flavus spores showed higher resistance to the disinfection by three kinds of chlorine based disinfectant the results were in agreement with our previous study which found that a flavus showed higher resistance to paa inactivation than a niger zuo et al 2022 the presence of melanin may be the important factor that led to the different resistance of two kinds of aspergillus species the a flavus melanin showed relative lower reactivity with chlorine based disinfectants in section 3 5 the more resistant melanin in a flavus made it more resistant to disinfection by chlorine based disinfectants the spores size was another factor that affect the resistance of fungal spores the diameter a flavus was 3 33 0 1 μm which was bigger than that of a niger 2 50 0 1 μm the bigger size of spore would lead to the higher resistance wen et al 2017 the comparison of the inactivation of bacteria by chlorine and monochloramine was also conducted in this study as shown in fig s2 the k of e coli by chlorine was 1 39 times bigger than monochloramine which indicated that chlorine showed higher performance than monochloramine for the inactivation of e coli the results were different from the inactivation of aspergillus spores which found that the monochloramine was more effective than chlorine the changes of spore suspension color were observed during the inactivation of a niger and a flavus spores with chlorine and chlorine dioxide melanin in the fungal spores was assumed as the important factor that affect the disinfection efficiency of two kinds of aspergillus spores with chlorine based disinfectants experiments were conducted to prove the speculation and results were presented in the following section 3 2 the characteristics of melanin and its effect on the inactivation efficiency previous review articles have concluded that pigment could protect fungi from adverse environment including radiation oxidants and heavy mental which could enhance the survival of fungal spores cordero and casadevall 2017 however the role of melanin on the inactivation efficiency of fungi by chlorine based disinfectants has not been reported fig s3 presents the pictures of a niger and a flavus on drbc and two kinds of melanin in water the melanin has been extracted from a niger and a flavus spores and then it was characterized by full wavelength scanning and ftir fig s4 the full wavelength scanning indicated that the two kinds of melanin all showed absorption peak at 295 nm the ftir spectra of the extracted melanin from aspergillus spores showed some strong absorption peaks and broad bands in the 3400 3200 cm 1 region which are related to oh and nh2 stretching as showed in fig s4 b the two kinds of melanin have similar ftir spectra the two kinds of melanin exhibited an absorption in 2930 2860 cm 1 region assigned to ch2 and ch3 stretching the spectra of a niger and a flavus melanin exhibited a strong absorption at 1650 1620 cm 1 due to stretching vibrations of aromatic cc or co groups goncalves et al 2012 the same functional group of a niger and a flavus melanin including oh groups aromatic cc or co groups have been reported previously pal et al 2014 in order to explore the role of melanin against chlorine based disinfectants different concentration of extracted melanin was added into the reaction system during the inactivation of aspergillus spores by three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants as shown in figs 2 and s5 the addition of melanin significantly inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide while the effect of melanin on the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine could be negligible as shown in fig 2 the k of a niger after inactivation with chlorine decreased from 0 17 to 0 08 0 0 min 1 with added melanin increased from 0 to 0 14 0 20 and 0 32 mg l for chlorine dioxide the k of a niger were 2 10 to 1 61 1 40 0 min 1 with addition melanin of 0 to 0 14 0 20 and 0 32 mg l but the k of a niger by monochloramine ranged from 1 50 to 1 78 min 1 without significant difference p 0 05 with addition of different concentration melanin the k for inactivation of a flavus with chlorine based disinfectants with addition of melanin showed the same trend with the inactivation of a niger the results showed that the extracted melanin acted a protective role of aspergillus spores against chlorine and chlorine dioxide while its effect on inactivation efficiency of aspergillus spores by monochloramine could negligible the protection of melanin against oxidant and antifungal drugs has been reported in previous studies jacobson et al 1995 studied the antioxidant function of melanin in black fungi and found that compared with albino strains melanized strains could withstood higher concentrations of permanganate and hypochlorite it required more 1000 fold higher concentrations of h2o2 to kill melanized strains jacobson et al 1995 goncalves et al reported that the melanin from a nidulans is a potential hocl scavenger goncalves and pombeiro sponchiado 2005 melanized c neoformans cells are more resistant than nonmelanized cells to the treatment of chemically generated nitrogen and oxygen derived oxidants wang and casadevall 1994 a fumigatus mutant strain white with less pigment was isolated and mutant conidia were more susceptible to killing by oxidants in vitro jahn et al 1997 baltazar et al 2015 found that melanin serves as a nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species scavenger defending the fungus cell from antifungal medications baltazar et al 2015 3 3 the comparison of inactivation mechanisms of chlorine based disinfectants the changes of membrane permeability of aspergillus spores after inactivation with three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants were measured by flow cytometry combined with sg pi dye as shown in figs 3 s6 and s7 the membrane intact cell decreased significantly after treated with chlorine and chlorine dioxide while the change of membrane integrity cell after inactivation by monochloramine was negligible the membrane integrity cell of a flavus and a niger reduced from 99 0 and 96 4 to 3 9 and 0 2 after treated by chlorine dioxide with 10 min the membrane integrity cell of a flavus and a niger dropped from 91 2 and 94 8 to 9 2 and 30 4 after inactivation with chlorine for 30 min the membrane integrity cell of a flavus and a niger ranged from 88 4 to 94 0 and 89 0 to 97 3 after treatment with monochloramine within 30 min the damage of cell membrane integrity of aspergillus spores caused by chlorine based was in the following order chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine the results of membrane integrity of a niger and a flavus spores after treatment with chlorine based disinfectants showed that chlorine and chlorine dioxide caused serious damage of cell membrane while the damage of cell membrane caused by monochloramine was negligible which indicated that the three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants showed different mechanism of fungal spores previous studies have reported that chlorine and chlorine dioxide inactivated bacteria by destroying the cell wall and cell membrane while monochloramine penetrated into cell without damage of cell membrane cho et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 mogoa et al 2011 found that monochloramine showed different mode of action for the inactivation of amoeba acanthamoeba castellanii compared to chlorine and chlorine dioxide the change of cell morphology and cell membrane permeabilization after monochloramine treatment was negligible while chlorine and chlorine dioxide induced serious cell shrinking and permeabilization mogoa et al 2011 monochloramine inactivated bacteria by penetrating into the cell and damaging the dna and protein which was different from chlorine and chlorine dioxide coburn et al 2016 holder et al 2013 the present study found that chlorine and chlorine dioxide caused serious damage of fungal spores while monochloramine treatment hardly affect the membrane integrity of two kinds of aspergillus spores when microorganism was under stress the quantity of intracellular ros commonly increased and higher ros concentration would destroy cellular components and activities gessler et al 2007 microbial cells produce antioxidants such as catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod to maintain a balance between ros production and elimination dukan et al 1999 the changes of intracellular ros level were determined by fcm combined with dhe dye as shown in figs 4 s8 and s9 high ros cell increased after inactivation by chlorine monochloramine and chlorine dioxide the high ros cell of a niger and a flavus after inactivation by chlorine dioxide increased quickly from 4 9 and 1 2 to 97 7 and 97 2 within 5 min then it kept stable at high level the high ros cell of a niger and a flavus increased from 5 6 and 5 5 to 18 7 and 32 3 after inactivation by chlorine at 30 min the high ros level of a niger and a flavus ranged from 11 0 and 4 4 to 1 2 and 13 2 after inactivation by chlorine and monochloramine at 30 min the results indicated that the three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants could cause stress response of fungal spores and the increase of high ros level the change of ros after inactivation with chlorine based disinfectants was in the following order chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine the high ros cell increased most quickly after being treated with chlorine dioxide due to its high oxidation potential fig 5 presents the sem photos of aspergillus spores cell morphology after inactivated by three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants as shown in fig 5 a niger and a flavus spores before inactivation were full and smooth the surface of spores became rough after treatment with monochloramine while the structure of spores was seriously damaged after treatment with chlorine dioxide the a niger and a flavus spores after treatment with chlorine was only slightly deformed the chlorine dioxide caused most serious damage of fungal spores chlorine was the second while monochloramine caused the least structure damage of fungal spores the results confirmed the results of cell membrane integrity which indicated that chlorine dioxide induced most serious damage of cell membrane integrity chlorine was the next and monochloramine hardly affected the cell membrane integrity of two kinds of aspergillus spores as shown in fig s10 the damage of different cell structures by chlorine disinfection follows the following order culturability of fungal spores cellular stress response level of intracellular ros cell membrane damage visual structural damage of cells sem dna damage the mechanism for the inactivation fungal spores with chlorine could be concluded from the above results firstly the chlorine first attacked the cell wall and cell membrane of fungal spores and destroyed the cell membrane then caused oxidative stress response and increase of intracellular ros finally the cell membrane was damaged and disinfectants entered into the cell and caused the damage of dna the damage of aspergillus spore cell structures after monochloramine disinfection was in the following order culturability of fungal spores dna damage cellular stress response intracellular ros cell membrane damage visual damage cell structures sem the results indicated that monochloramine inactivated mainly by penetrating into cell and damaging dna which was consistent with our previous study cao et al 2022 the damage of fungal spore cell structures after chlorine dioxide disinfection was in the following order cellular stress response intracellular ros culturability of fungal spores cell membrane damage visual damage to cell structure dna damage the mechanism of chlorine dioxide disinfection could be summarized as follow firstly the strong oxidation of chlorine dioxide caused the strong oxidative stress response and caused quick rise of the intracellular ros then chlorine dioxide and ros attacked the cell wall and cell membrane and caused serious damage of cell membrane and finally entered into the cell to cause dna damage in conclusion three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants showed different inactivation mechanisms of fungal spores fig s11 chlorine and chlorine dioxide inactivated fungal spores mainly by causing the damage of cell membranes changes in cell morphology and increase of membrane permeability and intracellular redox homeostasis intracellular ros monochloramine inactivated fungal spores mainly by penetrating into cell and damaging intracellular dna and protein 3 4 the reactivity of melanin with chlorine based disinfectants and protection mechanisms of melanin in order to explore the protective mechanism of melanin on aspergillus spores against chlorine based disinfectants the consumption of disinfectants after the addition of melanin was accessed as shown in fig 6 the addition of melanin accelerated the consumption of chlorine and chlorine dioxide while its effect on the attenuation of monochloramine could be negligible for example the concentration of chlorine decreased from 4 0 to 1 71 mg l during the inactivation of a niger at 60 min while it decreased to 0 42 with addition of 0 14 mg l melanin the chlorine was completely consumed within 10 and 2 min with addition of 0 20 and 0 32 mg l melanin the chlorine dioxide decreased from 4 0 to 0 95 mg l at 30 min without addition of melanin while it decreased to 0 mg l after 15 min with addition of 0 14 mg l melanin the chlorine dioxide was completely consumed within 7 min and 5 min with addition of 0 20 and 0 32 mg l melanin during the inactivation process the concentration of monochloramine ranged from 4 0 to 3 80 mg l during the inactivation of a niger before and after the addition of melanin for the inactivation of a flavus the changes of chlorine based disinfectants concentration followed the same trend the results indicated that the consumption of chlorine and chlorine dioxide in the reaction of disinfectants with melanin decreased the available disinfectants acted on the inactivation of fungal spores thus protecting the spores against further damage and inhibiting the disinfection efficiency the reactivity between fungal melanin and chlorine based disinfectant were evaluated by measuring the changes of melanin concentration during the reaction with chlorine based disinfectants the od295 and od od0 was used to present the concentration of melanin and changes of melanin concentration as shown in fig 7 the concentration of a niger and a flavus melanin decreased quickly when it reacted with chlorine and chlorine dioxide the concentration of a niger and a flavus melanin kept stable during it reacted with monochloramine the od295 of a niger melanin decreased quickly when it reacted with chlorine and chlorine dioxide within 3 min and kept stable after 5 min the change of od295 of a niger melanin could be negligible when it reacted with monochloramine the od295 of a flavus melanin decreased by 28 33 and 39 34 when it reacted with chlorine and chlorine dioxide at 5 min the concentration of a niger melanin reduced by 34 88 and 39 51 when it reacted with chlorine and chlorine dioxide at 5 min however the changes of two kinds of melanin concentration during reaction with monochloramine only ranged from 0 to 4 62 the reaction kinetic rates between disinfectants with melanin were calculated with eq 3 as showed in fig 7 c the reaction rate constants of three chlorine based disinfectants with fungal melanin were in the following order chlorine dioxide chlorine monochloramine the reaction rate constant of chlorine dioxide with a niger and a flavus melanin were 0 238 and 0 176 s 1 which was 1 62 and 2 84 times higher than that of chlorine the reaction rate constants of monochloramine with a niger and a flavus melanin were 0 the results indicated that chlorine and chlorine dioxide showed higher reactivity with melanin than monochloramine the chlorine dioxide exhibited higher reaction rate with melanin than chlorine while the reaction rate of monochloramine with melanin could be negligible the three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants showed different reactivity with melanin due the different oxidation potential in addition chlorine and chlorine dioxide was non selective oxidants while monochloramine interacted with proteins faster than polysaccharides han et al 2017 aguilar et al studied the stability of fungal pigments after treatment with ozone the first order kinetic model was used to describe the degradation of pigments during ozonation and reaction rate constants ranged from 0 127 to 0 206 s 1 in the buffer aguilar et al 2018 although the structure of melanin was unsolved the two synthesis pathways dhn and dopa of melanin have been elucidated the precursors of melanin contained phenolic hydroxyl group in two synthesis pathways eisenman and casadevall 2012 the ftir spectrum of a niger and a flavus melanin also confirmed that melanin contained hydroxyl group fig s4 previous study has reported that chlorine dioxide could react with electron rich moieties such as phenols k app 103 109 m 1s 1 gan et al 2020 the reaction between chlorine with phenol is carried out by a stepwise substitution of the 2 4 and 6 positions attributed to the activating ortho para directing hydroxyl group deborde and gunten 2008 the chlorine and chlorine dioxide all showed high reactivity with phenolic hydroxyl group so the chlorine and chlorine dioxide would react with the phenolic hydroxyl group in melanin in addition to the phenolic hydroxyl group the ftir of two kinds of melanin showed that there existed unsaturated bonds in the a niger and a flavus melanin fig s4 the unsaturated bond in melanin structures could facilitate the interaction with chlorine and chlorine dioxide resulting in color degradation the reactivity of chlorine dioxide tends to favor organic compounds with π electrons gan et al 2020 the melanin contained two fused double ring systems rich in π electrons which made it easier to react with chlorine dioxide previous studies have reported that melanin was an antioxidant and showed strong antioxidant properties goncalves et al 2005 found that melanin from a nidulans was a potential hocl scavenger goncalves and pombeiro sponchiado 2005 in conclusion the antioxidant properties of melanin hydroxyl group π electron and unsaturated bond made it easier to react with chlorine and chlorine dioxide fig 8 summarizes the potential reactions between chlorine and chlorine dioxide with melanin according to the discussions above the protective mechanisms of the melanin on a niger and a flavus spores against the three chlorine based disinfectants could be summarized from the above results as shown in fig 9 chlorine and chlorine dioxide acted on the cell wall and cell membrane during the inactivation of a niger and a flavus spores and the melanin located in the cell wall would react with chlorine and chlorine dioxide and protect the spores from further damage to cell membrane the melanin would consume disinfectants and limit the access to reactive sites on cell membrane the monochloramine inactivated fungal spores mainly by penetrating into cell and damaging dna the low reactivity of monochloramine with melanin and strong penetrability made it penetrate into cell and damaging dna without effect of melanin the different protection mechanisms of melanin against the three kinds of chlorine based disinfectants could explain why chlorine based disinfectants showed different inactivation efficiency under different spore concentrations when the spore concentration was 1 2 104 and 1 2 105 cfu ml chlorine dioxide could break through the barrier of melanin and showed high inactivation efficiency but the melanin inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine significantly which made it less effective than monochloramine when the spore concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml the concentration of melanin increased with the higher spore concentration and the higher concentration of melanin inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide the available disinfectant that aced on single spore decreased with the increase of spore concentration which led to the disability for chlorine and chlorine dioxide to break through the barrier of melanin the extracted melanin showed negligible effect on the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine and the increase of spore concentration hardly affected the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine the protection of fungal melanin against disinfectants would increase its resistance to disinfection which leads to the increase of fungi pollution risk in the drinking water supply system consequently the pollution of fungi in certain water related indoor environments would be enhanced due to the presence of fungi in drinking water supply system fungi enrichment in interior spaces can harm human health in two ways directly through inhalation of aerosols touch or drinking and indirectly through exposure to contaminated surfaces dishes or clothing the present study found that melanin protected fungi against chlorine and chlorine dioxide while its effect on the disinfection efficiency of monochloramine was negligible which indicated that monochloramine might be the best choice for the control of melanized fungi species among the chlorine based disinfectants 4 conclusions the main conclusions of this study are as following the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores by chlorine based disinfectants showed different trend with different concentrations of fungal spores the order of inactivation efficiency was as follows chlorine dioxide monochloramine chlorine when the spore concentration was 1 2 104 and 1 2 105 cfu ml the inactivation efficiency was in the following order monochloramine chlorine dioxide chlorine when spores concentration was 1 2 106 cfu ml the chlorine based disinfectants showed different inactivation mechanisms of fungal spores the chlorine and chlorine dioxide inactivated spores by damaging the cell wall and cell membrane leading to leakage of intracellular materials and death of cell the monochloramine inactivated the spores by penetrating into the cell and damaging the dna of spores the addition of melanin inhibited the inactivation efficiency of chlorine and chlorine dioxide while its effect on the inactivation efficiency of monochloramine was negligible the results indicated that melanin played a protective role of fungal spores against chlorine and chlorine dioxide disinfection while it didn t affect the disinfection efficiency of monochloramine the addition of melanin accelerated the consumption of chlorine and chlorine dioxide but the attenuation of monochloramine was the same after addition of melanin chlorine and chlorine dioxide showed high reactivity with melanin while monochloramine exhibited very low reactivity with melanin the combined results indicated that melanin acted as a disinfectant consumer and limiting access to reactive sites on cell membrane for protection of fungal spores against chlorine and chlorine dioxide disinfection the monochloramine could penetrate into cell and damage dna without the effect of melanin due to its strong penetration and low reactivity with melanin

15613,the environmental transformation of nanomaterials will have a significant impact on their ecotoxicity sulfidation process is one of the most important transformation processes in the aquatic environment although the sulfidation of zno nanoparticles zno nps has been previously reported the transformation characteristics and the relationship between the transformation process and toxicity mechanism to aquatic organisms especially microalgae require further study therefore we systematically investigated the transformation properties of zno nps in sulfur containing water and its impact on the toxicity to microalgae the results showed that the transformation products of zno nps mainly contained zns nanoparticles and their contents increased with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio in the aqueous solution after the first week of treatment the sulfidized zno nps showed less toxicity to microalgae than the pristine zno nps and interestingly they exhibited higher toxicity over time the zinc ions and transformation products played a major role in different treatment periods resulting in different toxicity the results of photosynthetic pigments photosynthetic efficiency and the relative electron transport rates indicated that the sulfidation process of zno nps had a remarkable influence on algal photosynthesis these newly acquired results will help us explore the transformation characteristics of zno nps and reasonably assess their potential risks in the aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zno nanoparticles transformation

environmental remediation drug delivery cosmetics and personal care products ahamed et al 2021 ghaffari et al 2019 xu et al 2020 among these enms zinc oxide nanoparticles zno nps is one of the most productive nanoparticles due to its unique photocatalytic properties and uv scattering ability it is widely used in the cosmetics industry and many other fields qian et al 2020 the extensive usage of zno nps increases the potential for the environmental release after entering the aquatic environment zno nps may inevitably undergo significant physicochemical transformation or biotransformation which profoundly effects on its fate and toxicity liu and xia 2020 zhang et al 2018 to properly assess the aquatic ecological security of zno nps the potential transformation characteristics in the real world environment and the relationship between its transformation and toxicity need to be clarified zhang et al 2020 2016 previous studies have confirmed that zno nps undergoes the complex transformations in the environment including the ability to dissolve zinc ions changes in microstructures and surface chemistry phosphorylation sulfidation and carbonation lv et al 2012 ma et al 2013 as an example in phosphate containing water the zinc ion concentration is lower than that of zno nps in ultrapure water and the transformed products mainly consist of porous amorphous zinc phosphate and crystalline zinc phosphate feng et al 2016 lv et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 zno nps readily transforms into smaller zinc sulfide nanoparticles zns nps approximately 2 5 to 5 nm when exposed to sulfide ma et al 2013 in natural waters zno nps can also be converted into zinc sulfide and zinc phosphate during the anaerobic fermentation process of sewage treatment lombi et al 2012 in carbonate rich water zinc ions dissolved from zno nps combine with carbonate and hydroxide to produce basic zinc carbonate and zinc carbonate sivry et al 2014 zno nps undergoes intricate environmental transformations resulting in significant changes in its toxicity liu and xia 2020 one research group documented that the antibacterial activity and bioavailability of zno nps gradually decreased owing to their chemical transformations in human sweat qian et al 2021 antibacterial efficacy was also influenced when zno nps interacted with the protein in simulated tear fluid li et al 2021 our previous studies quantified the aged process of zno nps in aqueous solution using spectroscopic tools wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the contribution of neoformations to its toxicity on the microalgae was distinguished zhang et al 2016 differences in the toxicity of pristine and aged zno nps to mammalian cells were also investigated wang et al 2019 2015 and the relationship between the toxicity and the aging process has been established zhang et al 2016 another study showed that zno nps was partially converted into zinc phosphate in phosphate containing water and the toxicity changed drastically after transforming in different phosphorous concentrations the potential toxic mechanisms particularly those involving the algal photosynthetic efficiency have deeply studied zhang et al 2020 among these environmental transformations the sulfidation process is one of the most vital transformations of nanomaterials in the aquatic environment zno nps can be rapidly transformed into zns during sewage treatment ma et al 2014 ma et al 2013 and dissolved zinc species react with reducing sulfur to form zns nanocrystals by chemical precipitation or with the aid of sulfur bacteria formentini et al 2017 several studies have demonstrated the significant changes in toxicity after treatment with sulfidized zno nps on zebrafish embryos lee et al 2021 epibenthic amphipods hyalella azteca poynton et al 2019 escherichia coli qian et al 2020 and earthworm eisenia fetida bao et al 2020 another study has suggested that the bacterial community composition of soils showed obvious changes after the treatment with the pristine and sulfidized zno nps which affected the carbon and nitrogen cycling processes in soil chen et al 2021 although numerous investigators have detected the toxicity of sulfidized zno nps to different life forms the effects of the morphological structure and material composition transformations of zno nps on its toxicity and the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated especially in sulfur containing water in fact the toxicity of zno nps is highly dependent on the environmental transformation process liu and xia 2020 xu et al 2020 except the types and quantities of neoformations the sensitivity of the tested species also has a significant impact on its toxicity microalgae as the most basic component of the aquatic food chain play a vital role in the nutrient cycle of aquatic ecosystems they are the main source of the chemical energy and organic matter in the waters and are more sensitive to pollutants than fish and invertebrates chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 furthermore microalgae are also key test organisms for assessing the impact of pollutants on aquatic ecosystems samei et al 2019 as far as we know there are few studies on the effects of sulfidation process on toxicity of zno nps to microalgae therefore a microalgae chlorella sorokiniana c sorokiniana was selected as a model system for evaluating the ecological impact of zno nps during its sulfidation process in this study a series of tools including x ray diffraction xrd the scanning electron microscopy sem the high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem

method that can distinguish zno and zns nps in the mixture was applied qian et al 2020 in brief 10 ml suspension containing 100 μmol zno nps or partially sulfidized zno nps was centrifuged 8928 g for 20 min and 1 0 ml acetic acid solution 20 mm which can selectively dissolve the remaining zno nps in partially sulfidized zno nps was added to the precipitates then sonicated for 5 min and stirred for

were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 zhang et al 2016 1 μ i j ln μ j ln μ i t j t i 2 growth inhibition efficiency 1 a t a c 100 where μij represents the specific growth rate from time i to j μi and μj are the absorbance at 680 nm at times i and j respectively ac and at indicate the absorbance at 680 nm of the control group and the treated groups respectively the morphological changes of zno nps pristine or sulfidation at sulfur zinc molar ratio of 2 algal cell surface and the interaction mode between zno nps and algae cells were observed and analyzed by sem according our previous report zhang et al 2020 in brief after four days of treatment the algal cells were collected by centrifugation fixed gradient dehydrated dried and sprayed with gold for sem observation to confirm whether the nanoparticles entered the algal cells the ultrathin sections were made the interaction of algal cells and nanoparticles was observed using tem and the elemental composition and distribution were analyzed using the eds spectrum and elemental mapping according our pervious study zhang et al 2020 the relative intracellular reactive oxygen species ros contents of c sorokiniana treated with the pristine and transformed zno nps for different times were detected using flow cytometry by h2dcfda fluorescence staining zhang et al 2020 2014 2 5 content of algal photosynthetic pigments and response of photosynthetic activity chlorophyll a is one of the most critical photosynthetic pigments in green algae and plays a crucial role in algal photosynthesis in this study chlorophyll a was extracted by 95 ethanol and determined using a spectrophotometer wintermans and de mots 1965 zhang et al 2020 2014 the chlorophyll a concentration was calculated by the absorbance values according to eq 3 3 chlorophyll a mg l 13 7 a 665 5 76 a 649 to assess the effects of zno nps before and after transformation on the physiological status of microalgae c sorokiniana parameters related to photosynthetic efficiency such as the maximal quantum yield of psii fv fm and the relative electron transport rates retr were quantified in intact algal cells using a pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer water pam heinz walz gmbh germany before measurement the algal cells were kept in darkness and adapted for 20 min fv fm values were calculated according to eq 4 4 f v f m f m f 0 f m where f0 means the background fluorescence which can be measured when the reaction center of ps ii is fully open fm is the maximal fluorescence and fv denotes the variable fluorescence the data of rapid light curves rlc were analyzed to obtain the relative electron transport rates retr and other parameters according to our previous reports li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of zno nps transformed in sulfur containing water to collect the reliable evidence of surface and microstructure changes of zno nps in sulfur containing water zno nps samples were treated with three sulfur zinc molar ratios 0 5 1 and 2 for 20 days and were analyzed through tem fig 1 tem images observed at low resolution were shown in fig 1a c e and g whereas the hr tem images to recognize lattice fringe spacing for the pristine and transformed zno nps were shown in fig 1b d f and h respectively both morphology and lattice spacing changed with an increasing sulfur zinc molar ratio were observed from these tem images fig 1 as can be seen in fig 1a and b the pristine zno nps agglomerated together to form larger particles with sharp edges and well aligned lattice fringes but the addition of sulfur sulfur zinc molar ratio at 0 5 led to their edge blurring and the lattice fringes became blurred and the alignment direction was inconsistent fig 1c and d as the sulfur zinc molar ratio was further increased they transformed into a core shell structure and the lattice fringes had different directions fig e and f when the molar ratio of sulfur to zinc reached 2 the aggregates were composed of a rough core shell structure which may be due to the reaction of zinc ions in the solution with sulfur and this significant sphalerite particles were precipitated on the surface and the lattice fringes became disordered but relatively clear fig 1g and h the crystal phase structures of the transformation products were further characterized on the hr tem images through fast fourier transform fft analysis technique fig 1b d f and h from the calculated results the d spacings of 0 29 nm 0 25 nm and 0 19 nm were in agreement with the lattice spacings along 100 002 and 102 directions of zincite respectively lv et al 2017 in the samples transformed in sulfur zinc molar ratio of 0 5 fig 1d the calculated results of the d spacings were 0 32 nm and 0 25 nm 0 32 nm agreed well with 111 of the sphalerite structure two d spacings of 0 19 nm and 0 32 nm were found in zno nps treated with sulfur zinc molar ratios of 1 and 2 fig 1f and h and the d spacing of 0 19 nm agreed with 220 of the sphalerite structure and 102 of the zincite yang et al 2010 these findings obtained from the observation and analysis of tem graphs indicated that zno nps were partially converted to zinc sulfur nanoparticles zns nps attached to the surface of zno nps and formed a core shell structure eds combined with tem is a reliable quantitative technique for analyzing the content of elements in nanoparticles while eds mapping can analyze the elemental distribution in the microstructure of the pristine or transformed zno nps qian et al 2020 qian et al 2021 the eds spectra and elemental mappings of the pristine zno nps were shown in fig 2 a zinc and oxygen elements were found which were uniformly distributed the eds of the sulfidized zno nps had peaks in consistent with sulfur zinc and oxygen elements fig 2b indicating that these samples contained sulfur elements through high angle annular dark field haadf imaging and merged elemental mapping it was found that the sulfur elements were mainly distributed on the shell of the core shell structure transformed from pristine zno nps qian et al 2021 as the sulfur zinc molar ratio increased from 0 5 to 2 the shell layer thickness increased and the sulfur element gradually penetrated into the core shell structure of the transformed zno nps the weight percentage of sulfur in the transformed samples increased from 9 36 to 13 64 and 18 60 respectively fig 2b c and d these observations suggested that the zno nps literally underwent a transformation during the sulfidation process and generated zns nps and their contents increased with the sulfur zinc molar ratio the mean particle size and zeta potential of the pristine and transformed zno nps were detected by dynamic light scattering dls the hydrodynamic size of the pristine zno nps was 1781 nm after transformation in different sulfur zinc molar ratios 0 5 1 and 2 the mean sizes reduced to 420 366 and 356 nm respectively the size of zno nps after transformation in the algal medium bg11 also reduced to 1362 nm table s2 the hydrodynamic size of zno nps was consistent with our previous reports wang et al 2015 after the sulfidation no 3 8 nm peaks were observed it was indicated that newly generated zns nps were readily attached to the zno np forming core shell structure and this finding was consistent with the tem images ma et al 2013 fig 1 the zeta potential of the zno nps was 30 7v the values were changed to 28 6 36 3 40 1v for transformed zno nps s zn 0 5 1 and 2 and 24 1 v for zno nps transformed in algal medium table s2 it was reported that the increase of the absolute value of zeta potential enhanced stability marsalek 2014 our results suggest that the suspension of sulfidized zno nps s zn 0 5 was less stable and readily agglomerated compared to the pristine zno nps when the increase in the sulfur zinc ratio the absolute value of the zeta potential increased which indicated that zno nps transformed in higher sulfur zinc ratios 1 and 2 can enhance the stability of suspensions the lower absolute value of zeta potential was found in zno nps transformed in algal medium which may be attributed to the increase in the ionic strength the xrd patterns of zno nps before and after transformation in sulfur containing water were detected fig 3 a the observed typical diffraction peaks in original zno nps were located at 31 8 34 6 36 4 47 6 56 7 62 9 68 1 and 69 2 which were in accordance with the zincite phase zno jcpds card no 36 1451 zhang et al 2016 the peaks in the transformed samples at 28 9 and 33 1 were corresponding to zns jcpds card no 79 0043 and peaks at 47 6 56 7 and 69 5 coincided with those of zinc oxide the shifting in the main xrd peaks of zno crystals and the crystallite size before and after the transformation were analyzed according to the scherrer s equation lv et al 2017 as shown in the table s3 with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio the main diffraction peaks of zns nps shifted slightly and the crystallite size gradually increased with the decrease of the full width at half maximum fwhm of 111 this result indicated that the zno nps was transformed in sulfur containing water and the transformed products contained zns nps which was consistent with the surface roughness caused by the adhesion of zns nps to the surface of zno nps observed by sem fig s1 the transformed neoformations of zno nps in surfur containing water were also identified though ftir spectroscopy from fig 3b the typical peaks at 1114 998 and 623 cm 1 were ascribed to zn s vibration and these peaks agreed well with the previous reports iranmanesh et al 2015 kuppayee et al 2011 the peak of zn o stretching vibrations was around 480 cm 1 which distorted and shifted to around 490 cm 1 suggesting that the crystal structure of zno nps changed after the sulfidation onkani et al 2020 this result showed the consistency of the xrd spectrum analysis the uv vis absorption of zno nps before and after the transformation were also detected and the bandgap values were obtained by extrapolating the linear zone to the energy axis fig s2 the pristine zno nps exhibited a strong absorption peak at 340 nm a shift was observed after the transformation at sulfur zinc molar ratio of 0 5 which was coincided with the bulk zns 335nm fig s2a with the sulfur zinc molar ratio increased the peaks showed shift due to the improvement of the crystallinity of the zns nps aga et al 2022 the bandgap values of the transformed zno nps calculated according to the tauc plots were 3 19 3 12 and 3 11 ev respectively fig s2b the enhancement of disordered arrangement of lattice stripes may be the reason for variation of bandgap values dutta et al 2009 the results of uv vis absorption and bandgap values reconfirmed the neoformations mainly contained zns nps 3 2 quantitative analysis of the transformed neoformation the above results have confirmed that zno nps were partially transformed into zns nps in sulfur containing water and the transformation products were mainly composed of zns nps and zno nps our previous systematic investigations have confirmed that the aging process of zno nps has a significant effect on the toxicity to mammalian cells and microalgae wang et al 2019 2015 zhang et al 2016 and it is also found that the zno nps transformed in phosphorus containing water showed less toxicity to c sorokiniana and preliminarily explored its mechanism from affecting the algal photosynthesis zhang et al 2020 quantitative analysis of the neoformations of zno nps during the transformation process is crucial for evaluating the influence of their bioavailability and toxicity in the natural aquatic environment zhang et al 2018 so it is necessary to quantitative the newly transformation products during the sulfidation process of zno nps here therefore we employed a method with selective dissolution of zno nps in a transformed zno nps suspension to quantify the transformation products zns nps in sulfur containing water qian et al 2020 as shown in fig 4 the amount of zns nps converted from zno nps accounted for approximately 29 24 50 67 and 60 80 after 20 days of transformation with sulfur zinc ratios at 0 5 1 and 2 respectively the amount of sulfur ions s2 in solution usually affects the degree of sulfidation of metal based nanoparticles including ag nps cuo nps and so on ma et al 2013 qian et al 2020 according to the element ratios in the zno and zns molecules theoretically when the molar amounts of sulfur element and oxygen element in zno nps are equal zno nps should be completely transformed into zns nps however zns nps only accounted for 50 67 of the transformed products in this study despite increasing the sulfur zinc molar ratio to 2 the amount of zns nps can only reach 60 8 far below 100 this result may be due to the oxidation of dissolved sulfur ions in the aerobic experimental environment additionally with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio the sulfidation of zno nps increased as evidenced by tem eds measurements fig 2 the concentrations of zinc ions dissolved from zno nps in ultrapure water and sulfur containing water in different sulfur zinc molar ratios 0 5 1 and 2 with time were shown in fig 5 the concentration of zinc ions dissolved from zno nps in ultrapure water reached 0 039 mm after 96 h this value was lower than previous report of 0 059 mm zinc ions from 24 nm zno nps after 80 h ma et al 2013 previous study has found that the dissolution of zno nps decreased with the increase of particle size mudunkotuwa et al 2012 the lower zinc ion concentration in this study may be attributed to the larger average size 54 2 21 63 nm of zno nps measured by the sem images fig s1 it was also reported that the dissolution of zno nps were affected by various factors such as the presence of an organic surface coating can drastically decreased the dissolution rate of zno nps compared to the uncoating nanoparticles gelabert et al 2014 when the solution ph value exceeded the range of 8 12 the dissolution of zno nps was increased with the increase of acidity and alkalinity bian et al 2011 the presence of citric acid enhanced the zno nps dissolution mudunkotuwa et al 2012 and the presence of electrolytes salinity inhibited the release of zinc ion yung et al 2015 the dissolutions of zno nps in algal medium bg11 water from a lake and the real wastewater containing sulfur obtained from a local pharmaceutical factory sulfide 9 08 mg l were also investigated and showed in the supplementary information fig s3 generally sulfidation can reduce the dissolution rate and content of zinc ions dissolved from the zno nps because the solubility product constant of the pristine zno nps ksp 2 6 10 17 mol3 l3 for 24 nm mudunkotuwa et al 2012 is approximately hundreds of millions of times higher than that of sulfidized zno nps ksp 2 10 25 mol3 l3 for sphalerite moreau et al 2004 at 25 c the concentrations of dissolved zinc decreased from 1 85 mg l to 0 16 0 17 mg l before and after sulfidation for 20 days in this study fig 5 inset this result confirmed that the presence of sulfur in the aqueous solution indeed mitigated the amount of zinc ions dissolved from zno nps which was in agreement with the findings of other studies ma et al 2013 qian et al 2020 3 3 toxicity of zno nps before and after transformation to microalgae c sorokiniana in view of the importance of microalgae in the aquatic ecological environment the toxicity of zno nps before and after sulfidation on the green alga c sorokiniana and its mechanism was deeply studied to provide a basis for scientifically and rationally evaluating the ecological risk of zno nps the effects of pristine and transformed zno nps with different sulfur zinc molar ratios 0 5 1 and 2 on c sorokiniana after treatment for different days were investigated by detecting the absorbance of algal cells at 680 nm the specific growth rates μ values of c sorokiniana were obtained according to eq 1 as shown in fig 6 the μ value of the control group was 0 242 day after the culture for 7 days while those in the pristine zno nps group s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group were 0 160 0 213 0 178 and 0 170 per day respectively compared with the control group the μ values of these four treated groups showed the different degrees of reduction suggesting that both pristine and sulfidized zno nps could decrease the specific growth rate of algal cells the minimum μ value of 0 160 per day was found in the pristine zno nps group after the treatment for 7 days the higher μ values of transformed zno nps groups s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group compared with that of the pristine zno nps group were mostly ascribed to the lower concentrations of zinc ions below 220 μg l released from transformed zno nps as shown in fig 5 this result agreed with previous studies showing that sulfidation drastically reduced the toxicity of zno nps to bacteria escherichia coli oleszczuk et al 2019 qian et al 2020 the μ value in the s zn 0 5 group was the highest among the three different sulfur zinc molar ratios other two groups s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group decreased with an increase in sulfur zinc molar ratio after the 7 day treatment this variation trend of μ values might be mainly attributed to the stimulation of algal growth by low concentrations of zinc ions derived from the zno nps without sulfidation which are located inside the core shell structure a previous study has been found that the growth inhibition of bacteria slightly decreased with increasing the size of zno nps which was mainly ascribed to the dissolution of zinc affected by the particle size ie the smaller particle size of zno nps the higher concentration of zinc ions dissolved from zno nps mudunkotuwa et al 2012 in this study the dissolution of zinc mainly originated from zno nps wrapped by zns nps when the treatment period was extended to 14 days the μ values of the transformed zno nps groups s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group were changed to 0 133 0 142 and 0 135 per day respectively these μ values were all lower than that of the zno nps group 0 155 per day which was different from the 7 day treatments fig 6a these results might be mainly due to the direct contact with algal cells through trapping and light shielding effect after the following treatment of transformed zno nps section 3 4 a previous study has shown that sulfidation of zno nps at low sulfur zinc molar ratio had greater toxicity to zebrafish embryos than at high sulfur zinc molar ratio lee et al 2021 it has been reported that the toxicity of zno nps to microalgae is mainly due to their dissolved zinc ions franklin et al 2007 studies have also shown that zno nps cause direct physical damage by trapping algal cells ji et al 2011 and some researchers have confirmed that both zinc ions and new formations can be attributed to the algal toxicity of zno nps samei et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2014 in this study sulfur ions reacted with zinc ions in suspensions to form zns nps that precipitated and adhered to the surface of zno nps preventing further dissolution of zinc ions in internal zno nps in the first 7 days of treatment the low content of zinc ions released from the transformed zno nps promoted the growth of algal cells with the prolongation of treatment time the zinc ions were exhausted and the shading effect of nanoparticles played a major role in the algal toxicity of these zno nps after 7 day treatment the growth inhibition efficiencies of algal cells in the treated groups the zno nps group s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group calculated according to eq 2 were 50 14 38 89 37 89 and 35 33 respectively fig 6b the growth inhibition efficiencies of the transformed zno nps groups reduced gradually from 38 89 to 35 33 with increasing the sulfur zinc molar ratios which was mainly ascribed to the higher μ values of the transformed groups compared with the pristine zno nps group the lower μ values of transformed zno nps groups increased in their growth inhibition efficiencies and these values changed to 68 38 61 10 and 60 81 after 14 day treatments these results confirmed that sulfur containing water can induce a series of physicochemical transformations in zno nps which lead to remarkable changes in their toxicity on c sorokiniana additionally it was reported that a concentration dependent increase in the relative intracellular ros contents was observed in green microalgal cells after the interaction with zno nps gunasekaran et al 2020 the intracellular ros contents of c sorokiniana after the treatments with the pristine and transformed zno nps were shown in supplementary information fig s4 the higher ros content was found after the treatment of pristine zno nps for 7 days compared to those of the transformed zno nps while after the treatment for 14 days the ros contents in the pristine zno nps group and sulfur zinc ratio at 0 5 group were decreased and those in the transformed zno nps treatments s zn 1 and s zn 2 were increased oxidative stress of algal cells via production of ros can lead to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane and reduce its specific growth rate zhang et al 2014 these results indicated that intracellular ros were involved in the toxicity of algal cells treated with the pristine and transformed zno nps the potential toxicity mechanism related to ros content needs to be further studied 3 4 morphological changes in algal cells in order to further study the inhibition of algal growth induced by the pristine and sulfidized zno nps the interaction between zno nps and algal cells and the changes in the surface microstructure of algal cells after treatments were observed using sem technique fig 7 sem micrographs of the pristine zno nps showed that most of them were nearly spherical and short rod shaped fig 7a and the average size was calculated by measuring at least 200 particles in the high magnification images which was 54 2 21 6 nm fig s1a after transformation at the sulfur zinc molar ratio of 0 5 surfaces of zno nps melt and stick together to form larger particles averaged size was 63 2 28 0 nm fig s1b when increased the sulfur zinc ratio to 2 the surface structure of zno nps changed drastically and many small particles were found on the surface of zno nps fig 7b the average size of these small particles was about 3 8 nm which formed a rough surface and led to reduce the mean particle size of this sample by measurement fig s1c and d as observed by sem at higher magnification tem eds results have confirmed that these small particles were zns nps fig 2 it may be that the zinc ions in solution react with sulfur to precipitate these very small sphalerite particles on the surface which was consistent with the newly formed zns nps smaller than 5 nm in previous literature ma et al 2013 some cavities around 20 50 nm were found after the core shell structure was disrupted and indicated by green arrows fig 7b and f in the early stage of sulfidation the high concentration of sulfur ions in the solution reacted with zinc ions to form small zinc sulfide particles which were attached to the zno nps and gradually formed a dense shell on the surface when the zinc ions in the solution were completely reacted the sulfide ions can only react with zinc ions released from the parts faces that were not completely encapsulated and the zno nps in this part was continuously dissolved and formed voids here neveux et al 2012 fig s1 from fig 7c after 4 day treatment with pristine zno nps the algal surfaces were covered by many nanoparticles some algal cells were almost completely coated with nanoparticles some of them were deformed some cellular contents leaked causing the cells to shrink presumably owing to the damage to the cellular membranes of algal cells high magnification sem images of the surface of algal cells showed that many nanoparticles whose surfaces were smooth the covered algal surface may hinder the exchange of water and nutrients between algal cells and the culture medium fig 7e compared with the interaction between the pristine zno nps and algal cells fig 7d depicted the surface of algal cells in the s zn 2 group treated for the same time the rough surface of the transformed zno nps with 3 8 nm zns nps might increase their ability to adhere on algal cells with the help of some cavity structures around 20 50 nm in these transformed zno nps fig 7f the nutrients in the microenvironment on the surface of algae cells could be enriched to promote the growth of algal cells in the treated group s zn 2 group as studies reported previously the algal toxic effect of the zno nps was closely related to algal cell surface interactions which can induce cell membrane potential depolarization and damage chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the interaction of nanoparticles and algal cells was also observed using tem as shown in the tem images particles appeared at the periphery surface of the algal cells and several black particles were found inside the algal cells treated with pristine and transformed zno nps fig s5 a and b by elemental mappings the particles around on the algal cells were identified as zno nps fig s5c shown with orange arrows and zns nps fig s5d shown with purple arrows respectively the eds spectrum of the black particles in the algal cells fig s5a spectrum 11 does not have the energy spectrum of zinc and the black part may be dyes or fixatives as previously reported zhang et al 2020 this result indicated that few particles entered into algal cells after treatment with the pristine or transformed zno nps combined with our results of zinc ion concentration and nutrient enrichment in the microenvironment of the microalgae cells we can further explain the lower toxicity of the transformed zno nps to microalgae than the pristine zno nps after the initial 7 days treatments 3 5 changes in algal photosynthetic efficiency to further investigate the mechanism of the sulfidation process on the algal toxic effect of zno nps it is necessary to detect and analyze the photosynthetic pigments content photosynthetic efficiency and relative electron transfer rate because these are the keys to explain the variation of algal toxic effects induced by zno nps before and after transformation zhang et al 2020 the photosynthetic pigments content chlorophyll a of the control group rose steadily during the treatment period fig 8 a while those in the four treated groups continued to increase until 14 days and then decreased the chlorophyll a content of the treated groups was markedly lower than that of the control group during the treatment period the chlorophyll a contents of the transformed zno nps groups s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group were higher compared with the zno nps group after 7 day treatment indicating that the sulfidized zno nps had less toxic to algal cells fig 8a and its insert and after 14 day treatment this trend changed the chlorophyll a contents of the transformed zno nps groups were lower than that of the pristine zno nps group moreover these values in the three transformed zno nps groups increased with the increase in the sulfur zinc molar ratio from 0 5 to 2 the measurement results of sem images showed that the average particle sizes of these transformed zno nps reduced from 63 2 to 58 9 and 37 5 nm with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio fig s1 the reduction in chlorophyll a contents of the three groups were mainly attributed to the average particle size because large particles could enhance the shading effect and inhibit the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments this result indicated that the size effect of nanomaterials played a leading role in the inhibition of the algal photosynthetic pigment synthesis at this stage which agreed with the results of the algal growth inhibition efficiency the fv fm value is usually used as a reliable indicator of the photosynthesis of microalgae li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 here the fv fm values of the c sorokiniana in the treated groups were obtained according to eq 4 as shown in fig 8b the fv fm values of c sorokiniana were 0 764 0 772 and 0 766 after the 7 day treatment with transformed zno nps s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group respectively while those of the algal cells in the control group and the pristine zno np groups were 0 779 and 0 733 the lowest fv fm value was found in the group treated with transformed zno nps s zn 2 for 14 days the fv fm values of s zn 0 5 and s zn 1 groups were decreased to 0 559 and 0 575 and that of the pristine zno nps group decreased to 0 603 after the 14 day treatment fig 8b since chlorophyll a content in the transformed group s zn 0 5 was lower the algal cells would increase their photosynthetic efficiency to survive the rough surface of the transformed zno np s zn 2 may cause physical damage to algal cells induce ros production fig s4 cause oxidative stress and inhibit the photosynthetic efficiency the retr of c sorokiniana algal cells in the treated groups after 7 day treatment were lower than that of the control group while these values were not significantly different between any two groups of the four treated groups fig 8c when the treatment time was prolongated to 14 days the retr of the treated groups were still lower than that of the control group but these values reduced with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio and showed significant differences from each fig 8d the result of the retr indicated that the algal photosynthesis was impaired by disrupting the photosynthetic electron transport chain and the energy metabolism which in turn affected the photosynthetic efficiency of c sorokiniana these results confirmed that in sulfur containing water the size and morphology of zno nanoparticles were changed and these transformations altered algal photosynthetic efficiency which affected their toxicity to c sorokiniana 4 conclusions in summary the sulfidation process of zno nps in sulfur containing water was comprehensively investigated in this study we found that zno nps in sulfur containing water significantly changed the crystal structures of the nanoparticles forming a core shell structure the main transformation products were identified as zns nanoparticles and their contents increased with the increase in the sulfur zinc molar ratio sulfidation process of zno nps could indeed change their toxicity to microalgae c sorokiniana after the first week of treatment on the microalgae the transformed zno nps showed less toxic effect than the pristine zno nps whereas with the prolongation of treatment time interestingly the transformed zno nps had higher toxicity than the pristine zno nps through quantitative evaluation of the transformation products we found that the toxicity to microalgae after 7 days mainly stemmed from zinc ions released from the original and transformed zno nps and the newly formed nanoparticles played a major role after the 14 day treatment direct contact with algal cells through the capture and shading of neoformations resulted in increased overall toxicity to microalgae furthermore our results indicated that changes of algal photosynthetic pigments content photosynthetic efficiency and relative electron transfer rate involved in photosynthesis are the major reasons for the toxicity of zno nps this work will provide an experimental basis for the scientific and reasonable evaluation of the ecological safety of nanomaterials in the aquatic environment photosynthetic electron transfer in the thylakoid lumen is a possible target for the algal toxicity of zno nps before and after transformation therefore the gene expression associated with the changes in algal photosynthesis induced by zno nps before and after

15613,the environmental transformation of nanomaterials will have a significant impact on their ecotoxicity sulfidation process is one of the most important transformation processes in the aquatic environment although the sulfidation of zno nanoparticles zno nps has been previously reported the transformation characteristics and the relationship between the transformation process and toxicity mechanism to aquatic organisms especially microalgae require further study therefore we systematically investigated the transformation properties of zno nps in sulfur containing water and its impact on the toxicity to microalgae the results showed that the transformation products of zno nps mainly contained zns nanoparticles and their contents increased with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio in the aqueous solution after the first week of treatment the sulfidized zno nps showed less toxicity to microalgae than the pristine zno nps and interestingly they exhibited higher toxicity over time the zinc ions and transformation products played a major role in different treatment periods resulting in different toxicity the results of photosynthetic pigments photosynthetic efficiency and the relative electron transport rates indicated that the sulfidation process of zno nps had a remarkable influence on algal photosynthesis these newly acquired results will help us explore the transformation characteristics of zno nps and reasonably assess their potential risks in the aquatic environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zno nanoparticles transformation

which profoundly effects on its fate and toxicity liu and xia 2020 zhang et al 2018 to properly assess the aquatic ecological security of zno nps the potential transformation characteristics in the real world environment and the relationship between its transformation and toxicity need to be clarified zhang et al 2020 2016 previous studies have confirmed that zno nps undergoes the complex transformations in the environment including the ability to dissolve zinc ions changes in microstructures and surface chemistry phosphorylation sulfidation and carbonation lv et al 2012 ma et al 2013 as an example in phosphate containing water the zinc ion concentration is lower than that of zno nps in ultrapure water and the transformed products mainly consist of porous amorphous zinc phosphate and crystalline zinc phosphate feng et al 2016 lv et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 zno nps readily transforms into smaller zinc sulfide nanoparticles zns nps approximately 2 5 to 5 nm when exposed to sulfide ma et al 2013 in natural waters zno nps can also be converted into zinc sulfide and zinc phosphate during the anaerobic fermentation process of sewage treatment lombi et al 2012 in carbonate rich water zinc ions dissolved from zno nps combine with carbonate and hydroxide to produce basic zinc carbonate and zinc carbonate sivry et al 2014 zno nps undergoes intricate environmental transformations resulting in significant changes in its toxicity liu and xia 2020 one research group documented that the antibacterial activity and bioavailability of zno nps gradually decreased owing to their chemical transformations in human sweat qian et al 2021 antibacterial efficacy was also influenced when zno nps interacted with the protein in simulated tear fluid li et al 2021 our previous studies quantified the aged process of zno nps in aqueous solution using spectroscopic tools wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 the contribution of neoformations to its toxicity on the microalgae was distinguished zhang et al 2016 differences in the toxicity of pristine and aged zno nps to mammalian cells were also investigated wang et al 2019 2015 and the relationship between the toxicity and the aging process has been established zhang et al 2016 another study showed that zno nps was partially converted into zinc phosphate in phosphate containing water and the toxicity changed drastically after transforming in different phosphorous concentrations the potential toxic mechanisms particularly those involving the algal photosynthetic efficiency have deeply studied zhang et al 2020 among these environmental transformations the sulfidation process is one of the most vital transformations of nanomaterials in the aquatic environment zno nps can be rapidly transformed into zns during sewage treatment ma et al 2014 ma et al 2013 and dissolved zinc species react with reducing sulfur to form zns nanocrystals by chemical precipitation or with the aid of sulfur bacteria formentini et al 2017 several studies have demonstrated the significant changes in toxicity after treatment with sulfidized zno nps on zebrafish embryos lee et al 2021 epibenthic amphipods hyalella azteca poynton et al 2019 escherichia coli qian et al 2020 and earthworm eisenia fetida bao et al 2020 another study has suggested that the bacterial community composition of soils showed obvious changes after the treatment with the pristine and sulfidized zno nps which affected the carbon and nitrogen cycling processes in soil chen et al 2021 although numerous investigators have detected the toxicity of sulfidized zno nps to different life forms the effects of the morphological structure and material composition transformations of zno nps on its toxicity and the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated especially in sulfur containing water in fact the toxicity of zno nps is highly dependent on the environmental transformation process liu and xia 2020 xu et al 2020 except the types and quantities of neoformations the sensitivity of the tested species also has a significant impact on its toxicity microalgae as the most basic component of the aquatic food chain play a vital role in the nutrient cycle of aquatic ecosystems they are the main source of the chemical energy and organic matter in the waters and are more sensitive to pollutants than fish and invertebrates chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 furthermore microalgae are also key test organisms for assessing the impact of pollutants on aquatic ecosystems samei et al 2019 as far as we know there are few studies on the effects of sulfidation process on toxicity of zno nps to microalgae therefore a microalgae chlorella sorokiniana c sorokiniana was selected as a model system for evaluating the ecological impact of zno nps during its sulfidation process in this study a series of tools including x ray diffraction xrd the scanning electron microscopy sem the high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy were employed to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the transformed products of zno nps during the sulfidation process an analytical method that can distinguish zno and zns nps in suspensions was applied to study the sulfidation process at different sulfur zinc molar ratios the toxicity of the zno nps before and after sulfidation was distinguished and the contribution of the transformation products zns nps and zinc ions to the toxic effects of c sorokiniana was confirmed additionally the damage to the algal photosynthetic system of the zno nps before and after sulfidation was systematically investigated based on a series of effects on the contents of photosynthetic pigments and photosynthetic efficiency in algal cells their toxicity mechanisms were discussed and clarified 2 materials and methods 2 1 engineered nanomaterials and reagents zno nps nano powder is approximately spherical the purity is 99 and was bought from nanostructured and amorphous materials inc katy texas usa sodium sulfide na2s 9h2o acetic acid glacial nano3 and all other reagents and chemicals were bought from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china to prevent zinc ion residue and algae contamination in the culture process the glassware used in the experiments were soaked in an acid solution washed thoroughly and sterilized before use 2 2 the reaction of zno nps with sulfide in aqueous solution suspensions of zno nps with 10 mm nano3 electrolyte were blended with a specified amount of sulfide na2s 9h2o to obtain three sulfur zinc molar ratios at 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 respectively the ph values of the mixed suspensions were adjusted to 7 0 0 2 by dropping 0 1 m sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide without further ph adjustment before adding sulfide zno nps suspensions were sonicated 300 w 20min kq 600e kunshan china to fully disperse the zno nps the mixed suspensions 100 ml were continuously shaken for 20 days 25 0 2 c 200 rpm a certain amount of suspension was collected at determined intervals for the characterization or cultivation with microalgae in the following

electron microscope sem gemini sem zeiss germany and hr tem on talos f200x microscope talos f200x fei eds attached to hr tem was used to study the elemental composition and distribution carbon coated copper grids were used to prepare and transfer the samples to a vacuum chamber of hr tem ma et al 2013 qian et al 2020 the average hydrodynamic sizes and zeta potentials of zno nps before and after transformation were measured by dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments malvern uk marsalek 2014 wang et al 2015 briefly the pristine and transformed zno nps 10 mm ph 7 transformation for 20 days were collected by centrifugation 8928 g 20 min and resuspended in an equal volume of ultrapure water or algal medium sample after transformation in algal medium for 20 days before the measurement the samples were sonicated for 10 min the average hydrodynamic sizes were expressed as intensity based average hydrodynamic diameters the zeta potentials were determined from the electrophoretic mobility according to the smoluchowski equation the crystal plane structure characteristics of zno nps before and after transformation sulfidation for 20 days were identified through xrd ttr iii cu kα radiation japan diffraction patterns were obtained with an angular step of 0 04 2θ and an integral time of 1s in the range of 20 to 70 2θ zhang et al 2020 the crystalline phases of the pristine and transformed samples were identified through comparison with jcpds standard cards rathnayake et al 2014 ftir spectroscopy alpha t bruker was applied to identify the chemical composition of these zno nps pristine or sulfidation for 20 days by the potassium bromide pellet technique zhang et al 2020 2016 the uv vis absorption spectra of the zno nps pristine or sulfidation for 20 days were measured using uv vis spectrometer uv3600 shimadzu japan at room temperature in the range of 300 to 800 nm zinc ion concentrations in suspensions during the sulfidation process were detected by icp oes optima 7300dv perkin elmer corporation usa briefly 4 0 ml samples were collected after the determined treatment time 20 min 40 min 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h 1d 2d 3d 4d 5d 6d 8d 10d 12d 15d and 20d from zno nps suspensions with different sulfur zinc molar ratios 0 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 the samples were centrifuged 8928 g 20 min to separate particles and ions using amicon filters amicon ultra4 3 kda millipore usa and the concentrations of zinc ion in the supernatants were determined to quantify transformed neoformations of zno nps in sulfur containing aqueous solution with time a method that can distinguish zno and zns nps in the mixture was applied qian et al 2020 in brief 10 ml suspension containing 100 μmol zno nps or partially sulfidized zno nps was centrifuged 8928 g for 20 min and 1 0 ml acetic acid solution 20 mm which can selectively dissolve the remaining zno nps in partially sulfidized zno nps was added to the precipitates then sonicated for 5 min and stirred for another 10 min afterward samples were centrifugated 8928 g 20 min to separate particles and ions using amicon filters amicon ultra4 3 kda millipore usa zinc ion concentrations in the supernatants were analyzed by icp oes and the contents of zns nps were calculated according to the contents of zinc in the insoluble precipitate and the molecular weight of zns 2 4 toxicity of pristine and sulfidized zno nps to microalgae c sorokiniana the microalgae c sorokiniana fachb 275 were purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences wuhan china the microalgae were incubated in bg11 medium table s1 at 25 1 c in a light incubator set to 16 8 h light dark cycle with the light intensity of about 60μem 2 s 1 zhang et al 2020 2016 2014 to investigate the effect of the sulfidation process of zno nps on the toxicity to microalgae we treated c sorokiniana cultured in bg11 medium with a certain amount of zno nps before and after transformation and divided them into four treated groups including the pristine zno nps group algal cells treated with the pristine zno nps s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group algal cells treated with zno nps after 20 days of transformation at three sulfur zinc molar ratios of 0 5 1 and 2 section 2 2 the logarithmic growth algal cells with initial absorbance of about 0 3 were transferred into 100 ml flasks the pristine or sulfidized zno nps were added and mixed with bg11 medium final concentrations of 1 mm and continued culturing for 21 days normal cultured microalgae without any treatment were used as the control group three parallel samples were set for each group and each sample was determined thrice to verify the reproducibility of the data the maximal absorbance of c sorokiniana suspensions is at 680 nm so the algal growth can be monitored using a spectrophotometer uv 2700i shimadzu japan in the algal toxicity experiments the specific growth rate μ and growth inhibition efficiencies of algal cells during exposure were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 zhang et al 2016 1 μ i j ln μ j ln μ i t j t i 2 growth inhibition efficiency 1 a t a c 100 where μij represents the specific growth rate from time i to j μi and μj are the absorbance at 680 nm at times i and j respectively ac and at indicate the absorbance at 680 nm of the control group and the treated groups respectively the morphological changes of zno nps pristine or sulfidation at sulfur zinc molar ratio of 2 algal cell surface and the interaction mode between zno nps and algae cells were observed and analyzed by sem according our previous report zhang et al 2020 in brief after four days of treatment the algal cells were collected by centrifugation fixed gradient dehydrated dried and sprayed with gold for sem observation to confirm whether the nanoparticles entered the algal cells the ultrathin sections were made the interaction of algal cells and nanoparticles was observed using tem and the elemental composition and distribution were analyzed using the eds spectrum and elemental mapping according our pervious study zhang et al 2020 the relative intracellular reactive oxygen species ros contents of c sorokiniana treated with the pristine and transformed zno nps for different times were detected using flow cytometry by h2dcfda fluorescence staining zhang et al 2020 2014 2 5 content of algal photosynthetic pigments and response of photosynthetic activity chlorophyll a is one of the most critical photosynthetic pigments in green algae and plays a crucial role in algal photosynthesis in this study chlorophyll a was extracted by 95 ethanol and determined using a spectrophotometer wintermans and de mots 1965 zhang et al 2020 2014 the chlorophyll a concentration was calculated by the absorbance values according to eq 3 3 chlorophyll a mg l 13 7 a 665 5 76 a 649 to assess the effects of zno nps before and after transformation on the physiological status of microalgae c sorokiniana parameters related to photosynthetic efficiency such as the maximal quantum yield of psii fv fm and the relative electron transport rates retr were quantified in intact algal cells using a pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer water pam heinz walz gmbh germany before measurement the algal cells were kept in darkness and adapted for 20 min fv fm values were calculated according to eq 4 4 f v f m f m f 0 f m where f0 means the background fluorescence which can be measured when the reaction center of ps ii is fully open fm is the maximal fluorescence and fv denotes the variable fluorescence the data of rapid light curves rlc were analyzed to obtain the relative electron transport rates retr and other parameters according to our previous reports li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of zno nps transformed in sulfur containing water to collect the reliable evidence of surface and microstructure changes of zno nps in sulfur containing water zno nps samples were treated with three sulfur zinc molar ratios 0 5 1 and 2 for 20 days and were analyzed through tem fig 1 tem images observed at low resolution were shown in fig 1a c e and g whereas the hr tem images to recognize lattice fringe spacing for the pristine and transformed zno nps were shown in fig 1b d f and h respectively both morphology and lattice spacing changed with an increasing sulfur zinc molar ratio were observed from these tem images fig 1 as can be seen in fig 1a and b the pristine zno nps agglomerated together to form larger particles with sharp edges and well aligned lattice fringes but the addition of sulfur sulfur zinc molar ratio at 0 5 led to their edge blurring and the lattice fringes became blurred and the alignment direction was inconsistent fig 1c and d as the sulfur zinc molar ratio was further increased they transformed into a core shell structure and the lattice fringes had different directions fig e and f when the molar ratio of sulfur to zinc reached 2 the aggregates were composed of a rough core shell structure which may be due to the reaction of zinc ions in the solution with sulfur and this significant sphalerite particles were precipitated on the surface and the lattice fringes became disordered but relatively clear fig 1g and h the crystal phase structures of the transformation products were further characterized on the hr tem images through fast fourier transform fft analysis technique fig 1b d f and h from the calculated results the d spacings of 0 29 nm 0 25 nm and 0 19 nm were in agreement with the lattice spacings along 100 002 and 102 directions of zincite respectively lv et al 2017 in the samples transformed in sulfur zinc molar ratio of 0 5 fig 1d the calculated results of the d spacings were 0 32 nm and 0 25 nm 0 32 nm agreed well with 111 of the sphalerite structure two d spacings of 0 19 nm and 0 32 nm were found in zno nps treated with sulfur zinc molar ratios of 1 and 2 fig 1f and h and the d spacing of 0 19 nm agreed with 220 of the sphalerite structure and 102 of the zincite yang et al 2010 these findings obtained from the observation and analysis of tem graphs indicated that zno nps were partially converted to zinc sulfur nanoparticles zns nps attached to the surface of zno nps and formed a core shell structure eds combined with tem is a reliable quantitative technique for analyzing the content of elements in nanoparticles while eds mapping can analyze the elemental distribution in the microstructure of the pristine or transformed zno nps qian et al 2020 qian et al 2021 the eds spectra and elemental mappings of the pristine zno nps were shown in fig 2 a zinc and oxygen elements were found which were uniformly distributed the eds of the sulfidized zno nps had peaks in consistent with sulfur zinc and oxygen elements fig 2b indicating that these samples contained sulfur elements through high angle annular dark field haadf imaging and merged elemental mapping it was found that the sulfur elements were mainly distributed on the shell of the core shell structure transformed from pristine zno nps qian et al 2021 as the sulfur zinc molar ratio increased from 0 5 to 2 the shell layer thickness increased and the sulfur element gradually penetrated into the core shell structure of the transformed zno nps the weight percentage of sulfur in the transformed samples increased from 9 36 to 13 64 and 18 60 respectively fig 2b c and d these observations suggested that the zno nps literally underwent a transformation during the sulfidation process and generated zns nps and their contents increased with the sulfur zinc molar ratio the mean particle size and zeta potential of the pristine and transformed zno nps were detected by dynamic light scattering dls the hydrodynamic size of the pristine zno nps was 1781 nm after transformation in different sulfur zinc molar ratios 0 5 1 and 2 the mean sizes reduced to 420 366 and 356 nm respectively the size of zno nps after transformation in the algal medium bg11 also reduced to 1362 nm table s2 the hydrodynamic size of zno nps was consistent with our previous reports wang et al 2015 after the sulfidation no 3 8 nm peaks were observed it was indicated that newly generated zns nps were readily attached to the zno np forming core shell structure and this finding was consistent with the tem images ma et al 2013 fig 1 the zeta potential of the zno nps was 30 7v the values were changed to 28 6 36 3 40 1v for transformed zno nps s zn 0 5 1 and 2 and 24 1 v for zno nps transformed in algal medium table s2 it was reported that the increase of the absolute value of zeta potential enhanced stability marsalek 2014 our results suggest that the suspension of sulfidized zno nps s zn 0 5 was less stable and readily agglomerated compared to the pristine zno nps when the increase in the sulfur zinc ratio the absolute value of the zeta potential increased which indicated that zno nps transformed in higher sulfur zinc ratios 1 and 2 can enhance the stability of suspensions the lower absolute value of zeta potential was found in zno nps transformed in algal medium which may be attributed to the increase in the ionic strength the xrd patterns of zno nps before and after transformation in sulfur containing water were detected fig 3 a the observed typical diffraction peaks in original zno nps were located at 31 8 34 6 36 4 47 6 56 7 62 9 68 1 and 69 2 which were in accordance with the zincite phase zno jcpds card no 36 1451 zhang et al 2016 the peaks in the transformed samples at 28 9 and 33 1 were corresponding to zns jcpds card no 79 0043 and peaks at 47 6 56 7 and 69 5 coincided with those of zinc oxide the shifting in the main xrd peaks of zno crystals and the crystallite size before and after the transformation were analyzed according to the scherrer s equation lv et al 2017 as shown in the table s3 with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio the main diffraction peaks of zns nps shifted slightly and the crystallite size gradually increased with the decrease of the full width at half maximum fwhm of 111 this result indicated that the zno nps was transformed in sulfur containing water and the transformed products contained zns nps which was consistent with the surface roughness caused by the adhesion of zns nps to the surface of zno nps observed by sem fig s1 the transformed neoformations of zno nps in surfur containing water were also identified though ftir spectroscopy from fig 3b the typical peaks at 1114 998 and 623 cm 1 were ascribed to zn s vibration and these peaks agreed well with the previous reports iranmanesh et al 2015 kuppayee et al 2011 the peak of zn o stretching vibrations was around 480 cm 1 which distorted and shifted to around 490 cm 1 suggesting that the crystal structure of zno nps changed after the sulfidation onkani et al 2020 this result showed the consistency of the xrd spectrum analysis the uv vis absorption of zno nps before and after the transformation were also detected and the bandgap values were obtained by extrapolating the linear zone to the energy axis fig s2 the pristine zno nps exhibited a strong absorption peak at 340 nm a shift was observed after the transformation at sulfur zinc molar ratio of 0 5 which was coincided with the bulk zns 335nm fig s2a with the sulfur zinc molar ratio increased the peaks showed shift due to the improvement of the crystallinity of the zns nps aga et al 2022 the bandgap values of the transformed zno nps calculated according to the tauc plots were 3 19 3 12 and 3 11 ev respectively fig s2b the enhancement of disordered arrangement of lattice stripes may be the reason for variation of bandgap values dutta et al 2009 the results of uv vis absorption and bandgap values reconfirmed the neoformations mainly contained zns nps 3 2 quantitative analysis of the transformed neoformation the above results have confirmed that zno nps were partially transformed into zns nps in sulfur containing water and the transformation products were mainly composed of zns nps and zno nps our previous systematic investigations have confirmed that the aging process of zno nps has a significant effect on the toxicity to mammalian cells and microalgae wang et al 2019 2015 zhang et al 2016 and it is also found that the zno nps transformed in phosphorus containing water showed less toxicity to c sorokiniana and preliminarily explored its mechanism from affecting the algal photosynthesis zhang et al 2020 quantitative analysis of the neoformations of zno nps during the transformation process is crucial for evaluating the influence of their bioavailability and toxicity in the natural aquatic environment zhang et al 2018 so it is necessary to quantitative the newly transformation products during the sulfidation process of zno nps here therefore we employed a method with selective dissolution of zno nps in a transformed zno nps suspension to quantify the transformation products zns nps in sulfur containing water qian et al 2020 as shown in fig 4 the amount of zns nps converted from zno nps accounted for approximately 29 24 50 67 and 60 80 after 20 days of transformation with sulfur zinc ratios at 0 5 1 and 2 respectively the amount of sulfur ions s2 in solution usually affects the degree of sulfidation of metal based nanoparticles including ag nps cuo nps and so on ma et al 2013 qian et al 2020 according to the element ratios in the zno and zns molecules theoretically when the molar amounts of sulfur element and oxygen element in zno nps are equal zno nps should be completely transformed into zns nps however zns nps only accounted for 50 67 of the transformed products in this study despite increasing the sulfur zinc molar ratio to 2 the amount of zns nps can only reach 60 8 far below 100 this result may be due to the oxidation of dissolved sulfur ions in the aerobic experimental environment additionally with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio the sulfidation of zno nps increased as evidenced by tem eds measurements fig 2 the concentrations of zinc ions dissolved from zno nps in ultrapure water and sulfur containing water in different sulfur zinc molar ratios 0 5 1 and 2 with time were shown in fig 5 the concentration of zinc ions dissolved from zno nps in ultrapure water reached 0 039 mm after 96 h this value was lower than previous report of 0 059 mm zinc ions from 24 nm zno nps after 80 h ma et al 2013 previous study has found that the dissolution of zno nps decreased with the increase of particle size mudunkotuwa et al 2012 the lower zinc ion concentration in this study may be attributed to the larger average size 54 2 21 63 nm of zno nps measured by the sem images fig s1 it was also reported that the dissolution of zno nps were affected by various factors such as the presence of an organic surface coating can drastically decreased the dissolution rate of zno nps compared to the uncoating nanoparticles gelabert et al 2014 when the solution ph value exceeded the range of 8 12 the dissolution of zno nps was increased with the increase of acidity and alkalinity bian et al 2011 the presence of citric acid enhanced the zno nps dissolution mudunkotuwa et al 2012 and the presence of electrolytes salinity inhibited the release of zinc ion yung et al 2015 the dissolutions of zno nps in algal medium bg11 water from a lake and the real wastewater containing sulfur obtained from a local pharmaceutical factory sulfide 9 08 mg l were also investigated and showed in the supplementary information fig s3 generally sulfidation can reduce the dissolution rate and content of zinc ions dissolved from the zno nps because the solubility product constant of the pristine zno nps ksp 2 6 10 17 mol3 l3 for 24 nm mudunkotuwa et al 2012 is approximately hundreds of millions of times higher than that of sulfidized zno nps ksp 2 10 25 mol3 l3 for sphalerite moreau et al 2004 at 25 c the concentrations of dissolved zinc decreased from 1 85 mg l to 0 16 0 17 mg l before and after sulfidation for 20 days in this study fig 5 inset this result confirmed that the presence of sulfur in the aqueous solution indeed mitigated the amount of zinc ions dissolved from zno nps which was in agreement with the findings of other studies ma et al 2013 qian et al 2020 3 3 toxicity of zno nps before and after transformation to microalgae c sorokiniana in view of the importance of microalgae in the aquatic ecological environment the toxicity of zno nps before and after sulfidation on the green alga c sorokiniana and its mechanism was deeply studied to provide a basis for scientifically and rationally evaluating the ecological risk of zno nps the effects of pristine and transformed zno nps with different sulfur zinc molar ratios 0 5 1 and 2 on c sorokiniana after treatment for different days were investigated by detecting the absorbance of algal cells at 680 nm the specific growth rates μ values of c sorokiniana were obtained according to eq 1 as shown in fig 6 the μ value of the control group was 0 242 day after the culture for 7 days while those in the pristine zno nps group s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group were 0 160 0 213 0 178 and 0 170 per day respectively compared with the control group the μ values of these four treated groups showed the different degrees of reduction suggesting that both pristine and sulfidized zno nps could decrease the specific growth rate of algal cells the minimum μ value of 0 160 per day was found in the pristine zno nps group after the treatment for 7 days the higher μ values of transformed zno nps groups s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group compared with that of the pristine zno nps group were mostly ascribed to the lower concentrations of zinc ions below 220 μg l released from transformed zno nps as shown in fig 5 this result agreed with previous studies showing that sulfidation drastically reduced the toxicity of zno nps to bacteria escherichia coli oleszczuk et al 2019 qian et al 2020 the μ value in the s zn 0 5 group was the highest among the three different sulfur zinc molar ratios other two groups s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group decreased with an increase in sulfur zinc molar ratio after the 7 day treatment this variation trend of μ values might be mainly attributed to the stimulation of algal growth by low concentrations of zinc ions derived from the zno nps without sulfidation which are located inside the core shell structure a previous study has been found that the growth inhibition of bacteria slightly decreased with increasing the size of zno nps which was mainly ascribed to the dissolution of zinc affected by the particle size ie the smaller particle size of zno nps the higher concentration of zinc ions dissolved from zno nps mudunkotuwa et al 2012 in this study the dissolution of zinc mainly originated from zno nps wrapped by zns nps when the treatment period was extended to 14 days the μ values of the transformed zno nps groups s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group were changed to 0 133 0 142 and 0 135 per day respectively these μ values were all lower than that of the zno nps group 0 155 per day which was different from the 7 day treatments fig 6a these results might be mainly due to the direct contact with algal cells through trapping and light shielding effect after the following treatment of transformed zno nps section 3 4 a previous study has shown that sulfidation of zno nps at low sulfur zinc molar ratio had greater toxicity to zebrafish embryos than at high sulfur zinc molar ratio lee et al 2021 it has been reported that the toxicity of zno nps to microalgae is mainly due to their dissolved zinc ions franklin et al 2007 studies have also shown that zno nps cause direct physical damage by trapping algal cells ji et al 2011 and some researchers have confirmed that both zinc ions and new formations can be attributed to the algal toxicity of zno nps samei et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 zhou et al 2014 in this study sulfur ions reacted with zinc ions in suspensions to form zns nps that precipitated and adhered to the surface of zno nps preventing further dissolution of zinc ions in internal zno nps in the first 7 days of treatment the low content of zinc ions released from the transformed zno nps promoted the growth of algal cells with the prolongation of treatment time the zinc ions were exhausted and the shading effect of nanoparticles played a major role in the algal toxicity of these zno nps after 7 day treatment the growth inhibition efficiencies of algal cells in the treated groups the zno nps group s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group calculated according to eq 2 were 50 14 38 89 37 89 and 35 33 respectively fig 6b the growth inhibition efficiencies of the transformed zno nps groups reduced gradually from 38 89 to 35 33 with increasing the sulfur zinc molar ratios which was mainly ascribed to the higher μ values of the transformed groups compared with the pristine zno nps group the lower μ values of transformed zno nps groups increased in their growth inhibition efficiencies and these values changed to 68 38 61 10 and 60 81 after 14 day treatments these results confirmed that sulfur containing water can induce a series of physicochemical transformations in zno nps which lead to remarkable changes in their toxicity on c sorokiniana additionally it was reported that a concentration dependent increase in the relative intracellular ros contents was observed in green microalgal cells after the interaction with zno nps gunasekaran et al 2020 the intracellular ros contents of c sorokiniana after the treatments with the pristine and transformed zno nps were shown in supplementary information fig s4 the higher ros content was found after the treatment of pristine zno nps for 7 days compared to those of the transformed zno nps while after the treatment for 14 days the ros contents in the pristine zno nps group and sulfur zinc ratio at 0 5 group were decreased and those in the transformed zno nps treatments s zn 1 and s zn 2 were increased oxidative stress of algal cells via production of ros can lead to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane and reduce its specific growth rate zhang et al 2014 these results indicated that intracellular ros were involved in the toxicity of algal cells treated with the pristine and transformed zno nps the potential toxicity mechanism related to ros content needs to be further studied 3 4 morphological changes in algal cells in order to further study the inhibition of algal growth induced by the pristine and sulfidized zno nps the interaction between zno nps and algal cells and the changes in the surface microstructure of algal cells after treatments were observed using sem technique fig 7 sem micrographs of the pristine zno nps showed that most of them were nearly spherical and short rod shaped fig 7a and the average size was calculated by measuring at least 200 particles in the high magnification images which was 54 2 21 6 nm fig s1a after transformation at the sulfur zinc molar ratio of 0 5 surfaces of zno nps melt and stick together to form larger particles averaged size was 63 2 28 0 nm fig s1b when increased the sulfur zinc ratio to 2 the surface structure of zno nps changed drastically and many small particles were found on the surface of zno nps fig 7b the average size of these small particles was about 3 8 nm which formed a rough surface and led to reduce the mean particle size of this sample by measurement fig s1c and d as observed by sem at higher magnification tem eds results have confirmed that these small particles were zns nps fig 2 it may be that the zinc ions in solution react with sulfur to precipitate these very small sphalerite particles on the surface which was consistent with the newly formed zns nps smaller than 5 nm in previous literature ma et al 2013 some cavities around 20 50 nm were found after the core shell structure was disrupted and indicated by green arrows fig 7b and f in the early stage of sulfidation the high concentration of sulfur ions in the solution reacted with zinc ions to form small zinc sulfide particles which were attached to the zno nps and gradually formed a dense shell on the surface when the zinc ions in the solution were completely reacted the sulfide ions can only react with zinc ions released from the parts faces that were not completely encapsulated and the zno nps in this part was continuously dissolved and formed voids here neveux et al 2012 fig s1 from fig 7c after 4 day treatment with pristine zno nps the algal surfaces were covered by many nanoparticles some algal cells were almost completely coated with nanoparticles some of them were deformed some cellular contents leaked causing the cells to shrink presumably owing to the damage to the cellular membranes of algal cells high magnification sem images of the surface of algal cells showed that many nanoparticles whose surfaces were smooth the covered algal surface may hinder the exchange of water and nutrients between algal cells and the culture medium fig 7e compared with the interaction between the pristine zno nps and algal cells fig 7d depicted the surface of algal cells in the s zn 2 group treated for the same time the rough surface of the transformed zno nps with 3 8 nm zns nps might increase their ability to adhere on algal cells with the help of some cavity structures around 20 50 nm in these transformed zno nps fig 7f the nutrients in the microenvironment on the surface of algae cells could be enriched to promote the growth of algal cells in the treated group s zn 2 group as studies reported previously the algal toxic effect of the zno nps was closely related to algal cell surface interactions which can induce cell membrane potential depolarization and damage chen et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the interaction of nanoparticles and algal cells was also observed using tem as shown in the tem images particles appeared at the periphery surface of the algal cells and several black particles were found inside the algal cells treated with pristine and transformed zno nps fig s5 a and b by elemental mappings the particles around on the algal cells were identified as zno nps fig s5c shown with orange arrows and zns nps fig s5d shown with purple arrows respectively the eds spectrum of the black particles in the algal cells fig s5a spectrum 11 does not have the energy spectrum of zinc and the black part may be dyes or fixatives as previously reported zhang et al 2020 this result indicated that few particles entered into algal cells after treatment with the pristine or transformed zno nps combined with our results of zinc ion concentration and nutrient enrichment in the microenvironment of the microalgae cells we can further explain the lower toxicity of the transformed zno nps to microalgae than the pristine zno nps after the initial 7 days treatments 3 5 changes in algal photosynthetic efficiency to further investigate the mechanism of the sulfidation process on the algal toxic effect of zno nps it is necessary to detect and analyze the photosynthetic pigments content photosynthetic efficiency and relative electron transfer rate because these are the keys to explain the variation of algal toxic effects induced by zno nps before and after transformation zhang et al 2020 the photosynthetic pigments content chlorophyll a of the control group rose steadily during the treatment period fig 8 a while those in the four treated groups continued to increase until 14 days and then decreased the chlorophyll a content of the treated groups was markedly lower than that of the control group during the treatment period the chlorophyll a contents of the transformed zno nps groups s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group were higher compared with the zno nps group after 7 day treatment indicating that the sulfidized zno nps had less toxic to algal cells fig 8a and its insert and after 14 day treatment this trend changed the chlorophyll a contents of the transformed zno nps groups were lower than that of the pristine zno nps group moreover these values in the three transformed zno nps groups increased with the increase in the sulfur zinc molar ratio from 0 5 to 2 the measurement results of sem images showed that the average particle sizes of these transformed zno nps reduced from 63 2 to 58 9 and 37 5 nm with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio fig s1 the reduction in chlorophyll a contents of the three groups were mainly attributed to the average particle size because large particles could enhance the shading effect and inhibit the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments this result indicated that the size effect of nanomaterials played a leading role in the inhibition of the algal photosynthetic pigment synthesis at this stage which agreed with the results of the algal growth inhibition efficiency the fv fm value is usually used as a reliable indicator of the photosynthesis of microalgae li et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 here the fv fm values of the c sorokiniana in the treated groups were obtained according to eq 4 as shown in fig 8b the fv fm values of c sorokiniana were 0 764 0 772 and 0 766 after the 7 day treatment with transformed zno nps s zn 0 5 group s zn 1 group and s zn 2 group respectively while those of the algal cells in the control group and the pristine zno np groups were 0 779 and 0 733 the lowest fv fm value was found in the group treated with transformed zno nps s zn 2 for 14 days the fv fm values of s zn 0 5 and s zn 1 groups were decreased to 0 559 and 0 575 and that of the pristine zno nps group decreased to 0 603 after the 14 day treatment fig 8b since chlorophyll a content in the transformed group s zn 0 5 was lower the algal cells would increase their photosynthetic efficiency to survive the rough surface of the transformed zno np s zn 2 may cause physical damage to algal cells induce ros production fig s4 cause oxidative stress and inhibit the photosynthetic efficiency the retr of c sorokiniana algal cells in the treated groups after 7 day treatment were lower than that of the control group while these values were not significantly different between any two groups of the four treated groups fig 8c when the treatment time was prolongated to 14 days the retr of the treated groups were still lower than that of the control group but these values reduced with the increase of sulfur zinc molar ratio and showed significant differences from each fig 8d the result of the retr indicated that the algal photosynthesis was impaired by disrupting the photosynthetic electron transport chain and the energy metabolism which in turn affected the photosynthetic efficiency of c sorokiniana these results confirmed that in sulfur containing water the size and morphology of zno nanoparticles were changed and these transformations altered algal photosynthetic efficiency which affected their toxicity to c sorokiniana 4 conclusions in summary the sulfidation process of zno nps in sulfur containing water was comprehensively investigated in this study we found that zno nps in sulfur containing water significantly changed the crystal structures of the nanoparticles forming a core shell structure the main transformation products were identified as zns nanoparticles and their contents increased with the increase in the sulfur zinc molar ratio sulfidation process of zno nps could indeed change their toxicity to microalgae c sorokiniana after the first week of treatment on the microalgae the transformed zno nps showed less toxic effect than the pristine zno nps whereas with the prolongation of treatment time interestingly the transformed zno nps had higher toxicity than the pristine zno nps through quantitative evaluation of the transformation products we found that the toxicity to microalgae after 7 days mainly stemmed from zinc ions released from the original and transformed zno nps and the newly formed nanoparticles played a major role after the 14 day treatment direct contact with algal cells through the capture and shading of neoformations resulted in increased overall toxicity to microalgae furthermore our results indicated that changes of algal photosynthetic pigments content photosynthetic efficiency and relative electron transfer rate involved in photosynthesis are the major reasons for the toxicity of zno nps this work will provide an experimental basis for the scientific and reasonable evaluation of the ecological safety of nanomaterials in the aquatic environment photosynthetic electron transfer in the thylakoid lumen is a possible target for the algal toxicity of zno nps before and after transformation therefore the gene expression associated with the changes in algal photosynthesis induced by zno nps before and after transformation in the aquatic environment needs to be further investigated in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

15614,treatment technologies based on microalgal biofilms have an enormous potential for dealing with water pollution because they can efficiently redirect nutrients from wastewater to renewable biomass feedstock however poor light transmittance is caused by the high turbidity of wastewater which hinders the commercial application of microalgal biofilm based wastewater treatment here a bifunctional substrate with lighting and biofilm support functions was constructed using a light guide plate in a biofilm photobioreactor bpbr with a bifunctional lighting supporting substrate bl s substrate light can directly irradiate the biofilm to avoid attenuation by the turbid wastewater direct irradiation of light onto the biofilm led to a 93 0 enhancement of microalgal photoconversion efficiency when compared to that of a supporting substrate without lighting so substrate meanwhile the maximum growth rate of the microalgal biofilm on the bl s substrate was 8 7 g m 2 d 1 which was increased by 60 3 the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n from the digested wastewater contributed by the microalgal biofilm reached 22 6 mg l 1 d 1 which was higher than the previously reported that of nh4 n from turbid digested wastewater by the biofilms furthermore the bl s substrate can facilitate the secretion of abundant extracellular polymeric substrates which results in the stable adhesion of the biofilm onto the bl s substrate the optical density of the microalgae cells at the outlet of the bpbr with bl s substrate was below 0 1 which was 94 lower than that of the bpbr with the so substrate the results indicated the bl s substrate may avoid the loss of microalgal biomass and almost all biomass could be easily harvested from the biofilm for algae based biomass resources consequently this study can offer a promising alternative with efficient treatment technologies for wastewater with high turbidity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bifunctional lighting supporting substrate microalgal photosynthetic biofilm co adhesion strength algae water separation high turbidity wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction by 2030 the world will face a 40 water shortage which is a huge challenge for ecological equilibrium and social development larsen et al 2016 water pollution caused by population expansion and human social production activities is one of the most important reasons for the water shortage biological treatment technologies have been studied for wastewater purification because of their advantages of strong sustainability and easy handling ji and liu 2022 however traditional biological technologies such as aerobic activated sludge and nitrification denitrification face challenges such as low treatment efficiency long processing times and carbon emissions in treating agricultural wastewater especially digested wastewater li et al 2019a this is due to poor biodegradability of contaminants caused by the high concentration of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and the low content of organic matter in the digested wastewater xia and murphy 2016 the emerging partial nitrification coupled with anammox pn a process also suffers from the problem that anammox bacteria are easily inhibited by dissolved oxygen and nitrate accumulation causing its stability of nitrogen removal to be unsatisfactory lackner et al 2014 microalgae are extremely adaptable microorganisms that can proliferate under photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions li et al 2019b microalgal biomass is a promising feedstock for the production of biofuel and high value chemicals due to its abundant content of lipid protein and carbohydrate hoh et al 2016 thus the cultivation of microalgae can provide a sustainable pathway to convert nutrients from digested wastewater into valuable feedstock sutherland and ralph 2019 evidence showed that microalgal cells can utilize inorganic nutrients from wastewater for photosynthetic growth which converts the nutrients into microalgal biomass 0 9 g l 1 and the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and phosphorus were 85 6 and 96 8 respectively da fontoura et al 2017 however the biomass recovery from suspended microalgae cultured in wastewater is difficult this is because the algae water separation of planktonic microalgae cultivated in suspension requires high energy input owing to the microalgae with tiny size 1 10 μm and low biomass concentration 0 5 3 g l 1 less than 1 japar et al 2017 microalgal biofilm is a porous community in which many microalgal cells encase themselves in self produced extracellular polymeric substance eps zhuang et al 2018 the cultivation of microalgal biofilm has received increasing attention because of its high biomass concentration 8 16 easy harvesting by scraping rather than centrifugal etc and low energy consumption energy requirement for dewatering decreased by 99 7 than suspension cultivation wang et al 2017 meanwhile microalgal biofilm can tolerate a higher pollutant load due to the protection of the eps to cells within the biofilm zhuang et al 2020 the performance of sewage treatment for microalgal biofilm depends on the growth of the microalgal biofilm boelee et al 2011 cultivation conditions including light conditions co2 supplementation nutrients concentration temperature and ph influence the growth of the biofilms zhuang et al 2018 biofilm structure can directly affect the mass transfer of light nutrients and gases thereby playing an important role in the growth of microalgal biofilms yuan et al 2021 among the conditions light which is the energy source for autotrophic microorganisms plays a fundamental role in the photosynthetic growth of microalgal cells ma et al 2022 only when the light penetrates the wastewater to reach the surface of the microalgal biofilm can the contaminants nitrogen and phosphorus be converted by the microalgal photosynthesis however the high turbidity of the wastewater prevents light penetration which means that the microalgal photosynthesis is drastically limited hoh et al 2016 although pretreatment technologies for digested wastewater such as filtration and centrifugation can reduce turbidity to an extent they result in excessive energy consumption and resource input li et al 2019a overall an energy saving way to eliminate light attenuation in turbid wastewater during the cultivation of microalgal biofilm has yet to be developed when considering the availability of light bringing the light to photo limited areas via light guiding materials such as optical fibers and light guide plates can be considered an efficient method sun et al 2021 typically fu et al 2017 in their study constructed a biofilm photobioreactor bpbr using a light guide plate as the support material and light guide medium the results showed that a 2 6 fold improvement in the luminous intensity on the light guide plate over the traditional flat resulted in a 61 8 improvement in hydrogen production rate overall the light guide plate can not only be regarded as a supporting substrate for the microalgal biofilm but can directly provide photons for the attached biofilm however research on the treatment of pollutants using microalgal biofilms based on light guide plates is still in its infancy more importantly a deeper understanding of the role of the light guide plate in microalgal biofilms during the entire growth period and its underlying mechanism is still lacking in this study a bifunctional lighting supporting substrate bl s substrate constructed using the light guide plate was replaced at the bottom of a bpbr the influence of the bl s substrate on the growth of microalgal biofilm and the underlying mechanism were investigated the response of the microalgal biofilm to direct light radiation was studied in terms of photoconversion efficiency photosynthesis bubbles biofilm microstructure eps content and distribution and co adhesion strength the characteristics of purification for actual digested wastewater in the bpbr were comprehensively evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 design

bottom material of the bpbr was replaced by a light guide plate furthermore two led light bars were mounted on the two side surfaces of the light guide plate 80 30 mm2 to provide incident light fig 1a the light emitting surface was chosen as one of the larger side surfaces of the light guide plate in contact with the biofilm and the other three side surfaces were coated with the light reflecting film for the bpbr with a supporting only substrate so substrate the led illumination on the top of the bpbr was used as the light source for the biofilm identical microalgal suspensions were deposited into the bpbrs for 12 h to form the biofilms with a biomass concentration of 6 g m 2 co2 10 v v and the bg11 media were pre mixed completely in a flask controlled by the mass flow meters fl 802d flowmethod shenzhen china subsequently these media were injected into the bpbrs using the peristaltic pumps bt100 1l longer china at a flow rate 5 ml min 1 meanwhile the flow rate of duplicate bpbrs was nearly equal to 5 ml min 1 fig 1c finally the media at the outlet in the bpbrs flowed back into the flask volume of 1 5 l the average output light intensity of the light emitting surface of the bl s substrate was maintained at 67 μmol m 2 s 1 in addition the light intensity of the middle part of the paralleled bl s substrates in the bpbrs was close to 50 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 1b indicating that duplicate bpbrs had a similar optical property an artificial climate chamber was used to maintain the temperature and humidity of the entire system at 25 0 5 c and 60 5 respectively 2 2 determining the growth parameters and co adhesion capacity of biofilms 2 2 1 determination of microalgal growth parameters before the microalgal biomass was collected the liquid in the bpbr was removed and then sterile deionized di water was used to repeatedly flush the biofilm in order to separate it from the supporting substrate we then resuspended it to form a specific volume v ml of microalgal suspension 8 ml of the suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min using a centrifuge gl 21 m xiangyi centrifuge instrument co ltd china after centrifugation the harvested microalgal sludge was dried at 105 c for 24 hours until it reached a constant weight and weighed sw g on a balance 0 01 mg of accuracy sartorius bp114 germany the biomass concentration w g m 2 and growth rate p g m 2 d 1 of microalgal biofilm were determined using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 w s w 8 v 0 0024 s w v 0 0192 2 p w t w t 1 t t t 1 where 0 0024 m2 is the footprint area of the bottom of a single bpbr w t and w t 1 represent the biomass concentration at cultivation times t days and t 1 days respectively the micromorphology information of the biofilms was revealed using a scanning electron microscope quattro s thermo fisher and american janjaroen et al 2013 from the sem images the porosities of the biofilms were obtained using the digital image processing program imagej nih usa marti et al 2014 the photosynthetic activity of microalgae can be determined by measuring the potential maximum quantum efficiency f v f m of photosynthetic system ii psii li et al 2021 measurement was performed in a cuvette of 4 ml using a chlorophyll fluorimeter aquapen c ap c 100 czech republic f v f m was calculated using eq 3 3 f v f m f m f 0 f m where fm and f0 represent the maximum and minimum fluorescence values respectively by flushing with di water the biofilm was separated from the supporting substrate and then diluted to an appropriate concentration 1 g l 1 to form the suspension sample prior to the measurements each sample 3 ml was acclimated for 15 min in the dark the thickness of the biofilm was measured using a digital microscope am7515mt4a dino lite taiwan at three different points on the cross section of the biofilm the diameter and number of bubbles were obtained from the photographs obtained using a digital microscope am7515mztl dino lite taiwan the dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph of the culture were measured using a portable do instrument seven2go pro mettler toledo switzerland and a ph instrument fg2 mettler toledo switzerland respectively 2 2 2 the extraction and analysis of eps centrifugal and heating methods were used to extract different eps fractions from the microalgal biofilm xu et al 2013 first the biofilm was resuspended in 0 05 nacl solution and centrifuged at 2500 g for 5 min to wash the biofilm the collected microalgal cells were dispersed in 0 05 nacl and then centrifuged at 5000 g for 15 min then suspension was collected as loosely bound eps lb eps second remaining microalgal cells were resuspended in 0 05 nacl and then heated at 60 c for 30 min followed by centrifuging at 15000 g for 15 min with the supernatant as the tightly bound eps tb eps all of the eps samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and the filtered eps fractions were analyzed the amount of protein and carbohydrates in the eps were determined using the lowry method frolund et al 1995 with the standard of bovine serum albumin at an absorbance of 595 nm and phenol sulfuric acid with glucose as the standard at an absorbance of 485 nm felz et al 2019 respectively 2 2 3 co adhesion strength of the mature biofilm the co adhesion strength of biofilms reflects their ability to protect against adverse external conditions especially hydrodynamic shear forces for mature biofilms after 12 days of cultivation the medium in the nutrient feed system was replaced with sterile di water and then the biofilms were flushed thoroughly with di water at a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 the optical density of microalgal cells od680 in outlet of bpbr was periodically measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer t6 beijing persee technologies china 2 2 4 co

spectral and light distribution properties the light emitted from the bl s substrate and the light emitted from the led light beads were measured with a spectrometer qe65000 ocean optics america aiming to measure the intensity distribution of the output light on the surface of the bl s substrate three lines on the guide light plate were selected these were referred to as lines a b and c for each line the distance to the led light beads was increased at an intervals of 11 mm and the output light intensities on the surface of the bl s substrate were recorded with a light quantum meter sy hyx shijiazhuang 2 3 2 light intensity at the biofilm interface during microalgal growth the light intensity at the biofilm top biofilm bottom and air liquid interface was measured with details being

the growth of microalgal biofilm the biomass concentration of c sorokiniana biofilm on the bl s substrate was 59 1 g m 2 after 12 days which was 26 higher than that on the so substrate fig 2a on the 8th day the highest growth rate of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was 8 7 g m 2 d 1 which was 60 3 greater than that on the so substrate fig 2b similarly the thinness of the mature biofilm on the bl s reached 48 4 μm which was thicker than that on the so substrate after 12 days fig 2c this result was similar to a previous study which reported the thinness of scenedesmus obliquus biofilms on polytetrafluoroethylene treated surfaces was 33 8 μm zheng et al 2017 besides the photosynthetic efficiency of ps ii f v f m of the biofilms on the so substrate was lower than those on the bl s substrate after 4 days fig 2d this means that the growth of the biofilm on the so substrate could be limited due to a lack of some conditions e g light nutrients and co2 interestingly the growth performance biomass concentration growth rate and thickness of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was weaker than those on the so substrate in the first four days of cultivation fig 2 this illustrated the bl s substrate may produce some particular circumstances for the growth of the biofilm in the early stages 3 2 light distribution and photoconversion in the bpbr 3 2 1 optical property of the bl s substrate the spectral structure of the light emitted by the bl s substrate was identical to that of the light emitted by the led light beads fig 3 a indicating that the bl s substrate did not alter the spectral properties of the light entering itself in addition the intensity distribution of the output light on surfaces of the bl s substrate was relatively uniform except for the position near the led light fig 3b this was because these sites were near the light reflecting films and led light beads where the reflected light boosted the intensity of output light 3 2 2 light intensity and photoconversion efficiency by introducing the bl s substrate the incident light was guided to change direction and directly irradiate the microalgal biofilm rather than being attenuated in liquid fig 3c the light intensity obtained by the biofilm top on the so substrate decreased from 67 μmol m 2 s 1 0 d to 22 μmol m 2 s 1 12 d fig 3 fig 3 d this can be attributed to the absorption effect of the liquid during the light transmission process penta et al 2008 simultaneously microalgal cells separated from the biofilm continued to grow resulting in a sharp attenuation of light in the suspension fig 3d the sharp attenuation of light intensity was caused by the adsorption and scattering of photons by pigments in the microalgal cells ma et al 2022 comparatively the average light intensity received by the microalgal biofilm biofilm bottom on the bl s substrate could remained stable at 67 μmol m 2 s 1 throughout the cultivation cycle fig 3e moreover there was a clear decline of the light intensity which was decreased from 46 μmol m 2 s 1 0 d to 0 μmol m 2 s 1 12 d at biofilm top on the bl s substrate with the growth of microalgal biofilm fig 3e this result indicates that few photons penetrated the biofilm on the bl s substrate resulting in a lack of sufficient photosynthetic drive for the suspended algal cells in the medium consequently there were almost no microalgal cells in the culture medium of the bpbr with bl s substrate on the 12th day fig 3e the photoconversion efficiency pce of the microalgal biofilm was calculated to evaluate the utilization efficiency of the light energy by biofilms in the bpbr dillschneider et al 2013 specifically the pces of the biofilms on the bl s substrate were 10 6 9 6 and 8 2 corresponding to the cultivation times on days 8th 10th and 12th days which were 87 5 106 5 and 93 0 higher than that of the biofilms on the so substrate respectively fig 3f moreover the electric power consumption of led for the bl s substrate was 1465 w m 2 which was 25 lower than that for the so substrate fig 3f in short the bl s substrate can reduce the light energy input and increase the pce of the biofilm in bpbr according to the light intensity of different interfaces in the bpbr table s2 the light intensity assigned to the liquid biofilm and loss was calculated table s3 the proportions of incident light corresponding to various parts liquid biofilm and loss is shown in fig 3g for the so substrate the percentage of light intensity assigned to the biofilm decreased from 33 0 d to 10 12 d meanwhile the proportion of light intensity assigned to liquid increased from 32 0 d to 79 12 d comparatively the percentage of light intensity assigned to the the biofilm on the bl s substrate improved from 32 0 d to 100 12 d these results indicated the significantly decreased loss of incident light with the introduction of the bl s substrate into bpbr during the cultivation of microalgal biofilm 3 3 influence of bubbles introduced into biofilm by bl s substrate on the biofilm structure after 12 h of cultivation a number of bubbles adhered to the microalgal biofilm at the bottom of the bpbr previous studies have confirmed that the oxygen generated by photosynthesis of microalgae usually adheres to the supporting substrate in the form of bubbles ranglova et al 2019 zheng et al 2017 the growth process of a single bubble on the surface of the supporting substrates is illustrated in fig 4a for the so substrate the generated site of a bubble was close to the biofilm top and the growth before it left the bottom lasted for more than 2 h fig 4a when the buoyancy of the bubble was greater than surface tension the bubble separated from the biofilm ranglova et al 2019 for the bl s substrate the formation site of a bubble was close to the biofilm bottom and its faster separation from the bottom of the bpbr broke through the thin layer of the biofilm fig 4a the dynamic behavior diameter and number of the bubbles play critical roles in affecting the mass transfer within the biofilm and biofilm structure huang et al 2018 the distribution of the bubbles diameters over the entire bottom area of the bpbr was close to a log normal distribution in particular the number of bubbles on the bl s substrate fig 4c was higher than that on the so substrate fig 4b besides the average diameter of the bubbles on the bl s substrate fig 4c 0 965 mm was slightly larger than that of the bubbles on the so substrate fig 4b 0 946 mm in terms of the mass transfer abundant oxygen bubbles increased the mass transfer resistance of nutrients such as nh4 n no3 n and po4 3 p to the biofilm near the culture medium similar conclusions have been reported by a previous study which showed the bubbles on the grooves limited mass transport of culture medium to s obliquus huang et al 2018 this explains why the growth of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was weaker than that on the so substrate during the initial stage of cultivation in terms of biofilm structure bubbles carrying may contribute to the emergence of a porous structure within the biofilm this also explains why there were more white areas in the bl s substrate than in the so substrate after 1 d of cultivation under the influence of the bubble carrying fig 4d the microstructure of the biofilms was investigated using sem imaging fig 4d on the 4th day the microstructure of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was looser and more dispersed than that on the so substrate fig 4d specifically the porosity of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was 50 which was 63 higher than that on the so substrate on the 4th day fig 4e this proved that the bubbles that were produced by photosynthesis might carry microalgal cells into the culture medium and even damage the biofilm thus affecting its structure after that the porosity of the biofilm decreased with the extension of cultivation time owing to the continuous division of microalgae cells and the accumulation of eps fig 4e after 12 d the porosity of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was only 12 which was still 43 higher than it was the so substrate fig 4e the high porosity of the biofilms could increase the efficiency of nutrient transfer to the biofilm similarly jana et al 2014 reported that the biofilm exhibited higher charge transport diffusion coefficients owing to the increased biofilm porosity of ion transport in microbial electrochemical cells thus the increased biomass concentration on the bl s substrate also benefited from the improvement in the nutrient transfer capacity under the high large porosity conditions the behaviors of the bubbles growth rising and separation can interrupt the culture medium and facilitate the diffusion of dissolved oxygen do zheng et al 2017 during the initial period the direct light radiation at the biofilm bottom was found to accelerate the production of large amounts of oxygen bubbles therefore the do concentration in the culture medium on the bl s substrate was higher than that on the so substrate in the first 12 h fig s1a the do concentration in the culture media gradually decreased after 1 day this result could be ascribed to the supporting substrate being tightly covered by the biofilms resulting in a sharp reduction in the bubble generation sites after four days the suspended microalgal cells increased noticeably leading to an increase in the do concentration of the culture medium of so substrate fig s1a similarly the ph of the culture medium for the so substrate was higher than that for the bl s substrate fig s1b it also supports that the suspended microalgal cells consumed co2 that was present in the culture medium resulting in a relatively high concentration of h in the culture medium valdes et al 2012 3 4 influence of bl s substrate on co adhesion strength of mature biofilm the co adhesion strength of the mature biofilm which is the biofilms after 12 days of cultivation was investigated in terms of flushing on the biofilm via di water circularly after six days of flushing the optical density of microalgal cells od680 of the bl s substrate was 0 03 which was 48 lower than that of the so substrate fig 5 a a lower od680 at the outlet of bpbr indicated fewer cells were separated under hydrodynamic forces resulting in a stronger co adhesion strength of the biofilm thus the co adhesion strength of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was greater than that on the so substrate this may be because the mature biofilm on the bl s substrate produced more abundant eps fig 5b tb eps was considered to be a major factor in biological adhesion cheah and chan 2021 the protein in tb eps built a cross linked network to maintain internal structure of biofilms and facilitate biosynthesis of carbohydrate which can further enhance biofilm adhesion wang et al 2020b accurately the carbohydrate content of the tp eps of microalgal biofilm on the bl s substrate was 88 mg g 1 dry weight which was 114 higher than that on the so substrate fig 5c a similar result was observed that long term light exposure can increase the eps of chlorella vulgaris which may be due to the external stress of persistent photons on microalgal cells xiao and zheng 2016 the co adhesion strength of the biofilms was also evaluated using the co adhesion energy g co adh a higher negative g co adh indicated that there was stronger cell cell interactions within the biofilm zhang et al 2015 table s5 shows the surface free energy sef components calculated from contact angle data of the biofilms table s4 according to the sef components the g co adh of microalgal biofilm can be obtained using thermodynamic theory shown in fig 5d after 12 days g co adh of the biofilm on the bl s substrate reached 55 3 mj m 2 which is 34 1 higher than that of the so substrate fig 5d consequently the biofilm on the bl s substrate exhibited excellent co adhesion strength to protect against hydraulic shear forces in biofilm systems of wastewater treatment the superior co adhesion strength of the allowed more microalgal cells to be retained on the supporting substrate without being washed out with the liquid resulting in increased pollutant removal efficiency zhuang et al 2020 the distribution of the eps was used to reveal the adhesion of the entire biofilm on the supporting substrate a layer of eps was wrapped around numerous microalgal cells that were present at the bottom of the biofilm on the bl s substrate that is on the side of the biofilm closest to the direct radiation light source fig 5e this indicates the bl s substrate can promote the synthesis of eps especially in the interfacial between the biofilm and the bl s substrate leading to the stable adhesion of the biofilm as a whole onto the substrate 3 5 pollutants removal in the bpbr 3 5 1 influence of the bl s substrate on pollutants removal in the bpbr based on the benefits of strengthened photoconversion efficiency and co adhesion strength the bl s substrate was applied to purify digested wastewater with high turbidity to assess its practical application potential for the so substrate the od680 of the effluent increased significantly after four days and reached 1 74 after seven days fig 6 a comparatively the od680 of the effluent of the bl s substrate was always below 0 1 which was at least 94 lower than that of the so substrate fig 6a this suggests that the bl s substrate can improve the adhesion within biofilms thereby eliminating valuable biomass loss caused by abundant suspended cells fig 6b shows the turbidity of the effluent treated with the microalgal biofilm the turbidity of the effluent was caused by the tiny particles in the wastewater and the microalgae could adsorb these particles under the lifshitz van der waals interaction and electrostatic interaction and the biofilm structure which would also have had a filtering effect on the particles chomiak et al 2014 the turbidity of the effluent decreased rapidly after one day after which this trend slowed this is because the absorption of the biofilm by the particles gradually reached saturation resulting in a weakening of the turbidity removal ability after 7 days the turbidity of the effluent of the bl s substrate was 109 ftu which was slightly lower by an amount of 7 compared with the so substrate this was probably because the biomass concentration of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was higher than that on the so substrate resulting in stronger adsorption to the particles indeed the final biomass concentration and f v f m of the biofilm on the bl s substrate were 46 61 2 93 g m 2 and 0 637 0 03 which were 33 5 and 36 2 higher than those on the so substrate respectively fig 6f this can be attributed to the fact that the biofilm on the bl s substrate was always exposed to sufficient light to avoid weakening the reception of photons by the biofilm due to turbid wastewater fig 6e after 7 days the residual concentration of nh4 n original concentration 195 0 mg l 1 decreased to 0 and 36 6 mg l 1 corresponding to the so substrate and the bl s substrate respectively and their removal efficiencies were 100 and 81 2 respectively fig 6c similarly the residual concentration of tp original concentration 43 2 mg l 1 dropped to 12 2 mg l 1 and 16 3 mg l 1 corresponding to the so substrate and the bl s substrate respectively and their removal efficiencies were 71 8 and 63 0 respectively fig 6d in short the pollutant removal efficiency of the bl s substrate was slightly lower than that of the so substrate this may be due to the removal of pollutants by the abundant suspended microalgae cells in the wastewater fig 6a besides the increasing suspended microalgae in the bpbr with the so substrate was evidenced by the increasing do concentration and ph of the digested wastewater fig s2b and s2c the total removal amount of nh4 n contributed by the biofilm on the bl s substrate reached 158 4 mg l 1 which was 12 8 higher than that of the so substrate fig 6g meanwhile the removal rate of nh4 n by the biofilm on the bl s substrate reached 22 6 mg l 1 d 1 fig 6h which was superior to that on other supporting substrates such as pvc fillers wei et al 2008 alginate wang et al 2019 cellulose acetate membranes cheng et al 2020 and pine sawdust zhang et al 2020b it should be noted that cheng et al 2020 in their study used microalgal biofilms cultured on cellulose acetate membranes to treat the digested wastewater the results showed that the removal rate of nh4 n by the biofilm reached 15 1 mg l 1 d 1 when cultured in a 5 fold dilution of wastewater owing to the alleviation of the impediment to light transmission by sludge turbidity however dilution increased extra water consumption and this caused an increase in the total volume of the wastewater hence bl s substrate can become a promising alternative to eliminate the dilution of high turbidity wastewater for efficient bioremediation via microalgal biofilm moreover the residual concentrations of cod were reduced to 391 5 mg l 1 so substrate and 610 mg l 1 bl s substrate after 7 days respectively fig s2a this is because the photons received by the biofilm on the so substrate were weakened resulting in the enhanced heterotrophic consumption of the biofilm on organic matter a previous study showed that the heterotrophic growth of microalgae can reduce cod from wastewater montano san agustin et al 2022 3 5 2 comparison of the microbial community in the biofilms the microbial community in biofilms is a crucial factor that affects the growth of microalgae and the removal of pollutants the alpha diversity index chao 1 and evenness shannon and simpson used to estimate bacterial richness are shown in table s6 the observed species and chao 1 in the bl s substrate were lower than those in the so substrate the shannon and simpson of the biofilm in the bl s were greater than those on the so substrate these results indicate the bl s substrate greatly influence the microbial community the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level is shown in fig 7 a bacteroidota 65 8 and proteobacteria 32 1 were the major bacteria on the bl s substrate the dominant bacteria in the so substrate were cyanobacteria 19 7 bacteroidota 60 3 and proteobacteria 18 9 cyanobacteria which can photosynthesize to release oxygen may facilitate an increase in do concentration in the bpbr see fig s2b bacteria in the genera of sediminibacterium flavobacterium hydrogenophaga and sphingobacterium were remarkably different for the bl s substrate and the so substrate fig 7b the relative abundance of sediminibacterium on the so substrate was 29 0 which was higher than on the bl s substrate 22 8 sediminibacterium is usually aerobic which may contribute to cod removal wu et al 2019 the relative abundance of sphingobacterium hydrogenophaga and flavobacterium on bl s substrates were 2 5 10 4 and 14 2 respectively which were significantly higher those of sphingobacterium 0 03 hydrogenophaga 1 6 and flavobacterium 0 7 on the so substrate fig 7b sphingobacterium is an active member of the algal bacteria system which may be beneficial for the growth of microalgae wang et al 2020a hydrogenophaga can remove nh4 n via the synergistic effects of digestion and denitrification jiang et al 2018 flavobacterium has been reported as a genus with the ability to promote eps production and biofilm formation zhang et al 2020a indeed from the sem images of the biofilm at the end of wastewater treatment it can be seen in the bottom of the biofilm on the bl s substrate where lamellar eps was wrapped around the microalgae fig s3 notably the dominant biological species in the biofilms was still the spherical microalgae fig s3 this indicates that the bacterial community on the bl s substrate primarily promotes the growth of microalgae and eps secretion thereby enhancing the removal rate of pollutants and the adhesion within the biofilm 4 conclusions in this study the light was directly irradiated onto the microalgal biofilms via the incorporation of the bl s substrate into a bpbr rather than having it be attenuated in turbid liquid the final biomass concentration of the microalgal biofilm on the bl s substrate was improved by 26 when compared to that on the so substrate because of the excellent light conditions and biofilm porosity caused by photosynthetic bubbles the co adhesion energy of the biofilm cultivated on the bl s substrate was improved by 34 1 when compared with the so substrate this meant that the bl s substrate can increase the co adhesion strength of the biofilm resisting hydrodynamic shear forces when the bl s substrate was tested for the treatment of the digested wastewater the removal rates of nh4 n and tp contributed by microalgal biofilm reached 22 6 mg l 1 d 1 and 3 8 mg l 1 d 1 respectively aiming to achieve continuous and more efficient wastewater purification further research is needed to optimize the operating parameters

15614,treatment technologies based on microalgal biofilms have an enormous potential for dealing with water pollution because they can efficiently redirect nutrients from wastewater to renewable biomass feedstock however poor light transmittance is caused by the high turbidity of wastewater which hinders the commercial application of microalgal biofilm based wastewater treatment here a bifunctional substrate with lighting and biofilm support functions was constructed using a light guide plate in a biofilm photobioreactor bpbr with a bifunctional lighting supporting substrate bl s substrate light can directly irradiate the biofilm to avoid attenuation by the turbid wastewater direct irradiation of light onto the biofilm led to a 93 0 enhancement of microalgal photoconversion efficiency when compared to that of a supporting substrate without lighting so substrate meanwhile the maximum growth rate of the microalgal biofilm on the bl s substrate was 8 7 g m 2 d 1 which was increased by 60 3 the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n from the digested wastewater contributed by the microalgal biofilm reached 22 6 mg l 1 d 1 which was higher than the previously reported that of nh4 n from turbid digested wastewater by the biofilms furthermore the bl s substrate can facilitate the secretion of abundant extracellular polymeric substrates which results in the stable adhesion of the biofilm onto the bl s substrate the optical density of the microalgae cells at the outlet of the bpbr with bl s substrate was below 0 1 which was 94 lower than that of the bpbr with the so substrate the results indicated the bl s substrate may avoid the loss of microalgal biomass and almost all biomass could be easily harvested from the biofilm for algae based biomass resources consequently this study can offer a promising alternative with efficient treatment technologies for wastewater with high turbidity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords bifunctional lighting supporting substrate microalgal photosynthetic biofilm co adhesion strength algae water separation high turbidity wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction by 2030 the world will face a 40 water shortage which is a huge challenge for ecological equilibrium and social development larsen et al 2016 water pollution caused by population expansion and human social production activities is one of the most important reasons for the water shortage biological treatment technologies have been studied for wastewater purification because of their advantages of strong sustainability and easy handling ji and liu 2022 however traditional biological technologies such as aerobic activated sludge and nitrification denitrification face challenges such as low treatment efficiency long processing times and carbon emissions in treating agricultural wastewater especially digested wastewater li et al 2019a this is due to poor biodegradability of contaminants caused by the high concentration of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and the low content of organic matter in the digested wastewater xia and murphy 2016 the emerging partial nitrification coupled with anammox pn a process also suffers from the problem that anammox bacteria are easily inhibited by dissolved oxygen and nitrate accumulation causing its stability of nitrogen removal to be unsatisfactory lackner et al 2014 microalgae are extremely adaptable microorganisms that can proliferate under photoautotrophic heterotrophic and mixotrophic conditions li et al 2019b microalgal biomass is a promising feedstock for the production of biofuel and high value chemicals due to its abundant content of lipid protein and carbohydrate hoh et al 2016 thus the cultivation of microalgae can provide a sustainable pathway to convert nutrients from digested wastewater into valuable feedstock sutherland and ralph 2019 evidence showed that microalgal cells can utilize inorganic nutrients from wastewater for photosynthetic growth which converts the nutrients into microalgal biomass 0 9 g l 1 and the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and phosphorus were 85 6 and 96 8 respectively da fontoura et al 2017 however the biomass recovery from suspended microalgae cultured in wastewater is difficult this is because the algae water separation of planktonic microalgae cultivated in suspension requires high energy input owing to the microalgae with tiny size 1 10 μm and low biomass concentration 0 5 3 g l 1 less than 1 japar et al 2017 microalgal biofilm is a porous community in which many microalgal cells encase themselves in self produced extracellular polymeric substance eps zhuang et al 2018 the cultivation of microalgal biofilm has received increasing attention because of its high biomass concentration 8 16 easy harvesting by scraping rather than centrifugal etc and low energy consumption energy requirement for dewatering decreased by 99 7 than suspension cultivation wang et al 2017 meanwhile microalgal biofilm can tolerate a higher pollutant load due to the protection of the eps to cells within the biofilm zhuang et al 2020 the performance of sewage treatment for microalgal biofilm depends on the growth of the microalgal biofilm boelee et al 2011 cultivation conditions including light conditions co2 supplementation nutrients concentration temperature and ph influence the growth of the biofilms zhuang et al 2018 biofilm structure can directly affect the mass transfer of light nutrients and gases thereby playing an important role in the growth of microalgal biofilms yuan et al 2021 among the conditions light which is the energy source for autotrophic microorganisms plays a fundamental role in the photosynthetic growth of microalgal cells ma et al 2022 only when the light penetrates the wastewater to reach the surface of the microalgal biofilm can the contaminants nitrogen and phosphorus be converted by the microalgal photosynthesis however the high turbidity of the wastewater prevents light penetration which means that the microalgal photosynthesis is drastically limited hoh et al 2016 although pretreatment technologies for digested wastewater such as filtration and centrifugation can reduce turbidity to an extent they result in excessive energy consumption and resource input li et al 2019a overall an energy saving way to eliminate light attenuation in turbid wastewater during the cultivation of microalgal biofilm has yet to be developed when considering the availability of light bringing the light to photo limited areas via light guiding materials such as optical fibers and light guide plates can be considered an efficient method sun et al 2021 typically fu et al 2017 in their study constructed a biofilm photobioreactor bpbr using a light guide plate as the support material and light guide medium the results showed that a 2 6 fold improvement in the luminous intensity on the light guide plate over the traditional flat resulted in a 61 8 improvement in hydrogen production rate overall the light guide plate can not only be regarded as a supporting substrate for the microalgal biofilm but can directly provide photons for the attached biofilm however research on the treatment of pollutants using microalgal biofilms based on light guide plates is still in its infancy more importantly a deeper understanding of the role of the light guide plate in microalgal biofilms during the entire growth period and its underlying mechanism is still lacking in this study a bifunctional lighting supporting substrate bl s substrate constructed using the light guide plate was replaced at the bottom of a bpbr the influence of the bl s substrate on the growth of microalgal biofilm and the underlying mechanism were investigated the response of the microalgal biofilm to direct light radiation was studied in terms of photoconversion efficiency photosynthesis bubbles biofilm microstructure eps content and distribution and co adhesion strength the characteristics of purification for actual digested wastewater in the bpbr were comprehensively evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 design

taiwan c sorokiniana was pre cultured in blue green medium bg11 zheng et al 2016 with 10 co2 v v bubbling and 90 μmol m 2 s 1 continuous illumination for 7 d and then stored in an artificial incubator mgz 120 l 3 binlin shanghai 2 1 2 biofilm photobioreactor configuration and its operation a schematic diagram of the experimental device used for biofilm cultivation is shown in fig 1 the cultivation system consisted of a nutrient feed section and the bpbrs section a bpbr was created using a poly methyl methacrylate pmma with dimensions of 80 30 45 mm3 l w h for the bpbr with bl s substrate the bottom material of the bpbr was replaced by a light guide plate furthermore two led light bars were mounted on the two side surfaces of the light guide plate 80 30 mm2 to provide incident light fig 1a the light emitting surface was chosen as one of the larger side surfaces of the light guide plate in contact with the biofilm and the other three side surfaces were coated with the light reflecting film for the bpbr with a supporting only substrate so substrate the led illumination on the top of the bpbr was used as the light source for the biofilm identical microalgal suspensions were deposited into the bpbrs for 12 h to form the biofilms with a biomass concentration of 6 g m 2 co2 10 v v and the bg11 media were pre mixed completely in a flask controlled by the mass flow meters fl 802d flowmethod shenzhen china subsequently these media were injected into the bpbrs using the peristaltic pumps bt100 1l longer china at a flow rate 5 ml min 1 meanwhile the flow rate of duplicate bpbrs was nearly equal to 5 ml min 1 fig 1c finally the media at the outlet in the bpbrs flowed back into the flask volume of 1 5 l the average output light intensity of the light emitting surface of the bl s substrate was maintained at 67 μmol m 2 s 1 in addition the light intensity of the middle part of the paralleled bl s substrates in the bpbrs was close to 50 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 1b indicating that duplicate bpbrs had a similar optical property an artificial climate chamber was used to maintain the temperature and humidity of the entire system at 25 0 5 c and 60 5 respectively 2 2 determining the growth parameters and co adhesion capacity of biofilms 2 2 1 determination of microalgal growth parameters before the microalgal biomass was collected the liquid in the bpbr was removed and then sterile deionized di water was used to repeatedly flush the biofilm in order to separate it from the supporting substrate we then resuspended it to form a specific volume v ml of microalgal suspension 8 ml of the suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min using a centrifuge gl 21 m xiangyi centrifuge instrument co ltd china after centrifugation the harvested microalgal sludge was dried at 105 c for 24 hours until it reached a constant weight and weighed sw g on a balance 0 01 mg of accuracy sartorius bp114 germany the biomass concentration w g m 2 and growth rate p g m 2 d 1 of microalgal biofilm were determined using eqs 1 and 2 respectively 1 w s w 8 v 0 0024 s w v 0 0192 2 p w t w t 1 t t t 1 where 0 0024 m2 is the footprint area of the bottom of a single bpbr w t and w t 1 represent the biomass concentration at cultivation times t days and t 1 days respectively the micromorphology information of the biofilms was revealed using a scanning electron microscope quattro s thermo fisher and american janjaroen et al 2013 from the sem images the porosities of the biofilms were obtained using the digital image processing program imagej nih usa marti et al 2014 the photosynthetic activity of microalgae can be determined by measuring the potential maximum quantum efficiency f v f m of photosynthetic system ii psii li et al 2021 measurement was performed in a cuvette of 4 ml using a chlorophyll fluorimeter aquapen c ap c 100 czech republic f v f m was calculated using eq 3 3 f v f m f m f 0 f m where fm and f0 represent the maximum and minimum fluorescence values respectively by flushing with di water the biofilm was separated from the supporting substrate and then diluted to an appropriate concentration 1 g l 1 to form the suspension sample prior to the measurements each sample 3 ml was acclimated for 15 min in the dark the thickness of the biofilm was measured using a digital microscope am7515mt4a dino lite taiwan at three different points on the cross section of the biofilm the diameter and number of bubbles were obtained from the photographs obtained using a digital microscope am7515mztl dino lite taiwan the dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph of the culture were measured using a portable do instrument seven2go pro mettler toledo switzerland and a ph instrument fg2 mettler toledo switzerland respectively 2 2 2 the extraction and analysis of eps centrifugal and heating methods were used to extract different eps fractions from the microalgal biofilm xu et al 2013 first the biofilm was resuspended in 0 05 nacl solution and centrifuged at 2500 g for 5 min to wash the biofilm the collected microalgal cells were dispersed in 0 05 nacl and then centrifuged at 5000 g for 15 min then suspension was collected as loosely bound eps lb eps second remaining microalgal cells were resuspended in 0 05 nacl and then heated at 60 c for 30 min followed by centrifuging at 15000 g for 15 min with the supernatant as the tightly bound eps tb eps all of the eps samples were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and the filtered eps fractions were analyzed the amount of protein and carbohydrates in the eps were determined using the lowry method frolund et al 1995 with the standard of bovine serum albumin at an absorbance of 595 nm and phenol sulfuric acid with glucose as the standard at an absorbance of 485 nm felz et al 2019 respectively 2 2 3 co adhesion strength of the mature biofilm the co adhesion strength of biofilms reflects their ability to protect against adverse external conditions especially hydrodynamic shear forces for mature biofilms after 12 days of cultivation the medium in the nutrient feed system was replaced with sterile di water and then the biofilms were flushed thoroughly with di water at a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 the optical density of microalgal cells od680 in outlet of bpbr was periodically measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer t6 beijing persee technologies china 2 2 4 co adhesion energy of cell cell within microalgal biofilm the co adhesion energy g co adh represents the change in free energy before and after cell cell interactions within the biofilm the g co adh were calculated using the thermodynamic theory based on contact angle method with details being presented in the supporting information si text s1 2 3 luminescence characteristics 2 3 1 assessment of spectral and light distribution properties the light emitted from the bl s substrate and the light emitted from the led light beads were measured with a spectrometer qe65000 ocean optics america aiming to measure the intensity distribution of the output light on the surface of the bl s substrate three lines on the guide light plate were selected these were referred to as lines a b and c for each line the distance to the led light beads was increased at an intervals of 11 mm and the output light intensities on the surface of the bl s substrate were recorded with a light quantum meter sy hyx shijiazhuang 2 3 2 light intensity at the biofilm interface during microalgal growth the light intensity at the biofilm top biofilm bottom and air liquid interface was measured with details being presented in the si text s2 2 3 3 photoconversion efficiency and electric power of led light the photoconversion efficiency pce of the microalgal biofilm was calculated as the enthalpy of combustion

the growth of microalgal biofilm the biomass concentration of c sorokiniana biofilm on the bl s substrate was 59 1 g m 2 after 12 days which was 26 higher than that on the so substrate fig 2a on the 8th day the highest growth rate of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was 8 7 g m 2 d 1 which was 60 3 greater than that on the so substrate fig 2b similarly the thinness of the mature biofilm on the bl s reached 48 4 μm which was thicker than that on the so substrate after 12 days fig 2c this result was similar to a previous study which reported the thinness of scenedesmus obliquus biofilms on polytetrafluoroethylene treated surfaces was 33 8 μm zheng et al 2017 besides the photosynthetic efficiency of ps ii f v f m of the biofilms on the so substrate was lower than those on the bl s substrate after 4 days fig 2d this means that the growth of the biofilm on the so substrate could be limited due to a lack of some conditions e g light nutrients and co2 interestingly the growth performance biomass concentration growth rate and thickness of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was weaker than those on the so substrate in the first four days of cultivation fig 2 this illustrated the bl s substrate may produce some particular circumstances for the growth of the biofilm in the early stages 3 2 light distribution and photoconversion in the bpbr 3 2 1 optical property of the bl s substrate the spectral structure of the light emitted by the bl s substrate was identical to that of the light emitted by the led light beads fig 3 a indicating that the bl s substrate did not alter the spectral properties of the light entering itself in addition the intensity distribution of the output light on surfaces of the bl s substrate was relatively uniform except for the position near the led light fig 3b this was because these sites were near the light reflecting films and led light beads where the reflected light boosted the intensity of output light 3 2 2 light intensity and photoconversion efficiency by introducing the bl s substrate the incident light was guided to change direction and directly irradiate the microalgal biofilm rather than being attenuated in liquid fig 3c the light intensity obtained by the biofilm top on the so substrate decreased from 67 μmol m 2 s 1 0 d to 22 μmol m 2 s 1 12 d fig 3 fig 3 d this can be attributed to the absorption effect of the liquid during the light transmission process penta et al 2008 simultaneously microalgal cells separated from the biofilm continued to grow resulting in a sharp attenuation of light in the suspension fig 3d the sharp attenuation of light intensity was caused by the adsorption and scattering of photons by pigments in the microalgal cells ma et al 2022 comparatively the average light intensity received by the microalgal biofilm biofilm bottom on the bl s substrate could remained stable at 67 μmol m 2 s 1 throughout the cultivation cycle fig 3e moreover there was a clear decline of the light intensity which was decreased from 46 μmol m 2 s 1 0 d to 0 μmol m 2 s 1 12 d at biofilm top on the bl s substrate with the growth of microalgal biofilm fig 3e this result indicates that few photons penetrated the biofilm on the bl s substrate resulting in a lack of sufficient photosynthetic drive for the suspended algal cells in the medium consequently there were almost no microalgal cells in the culture medium of the bpbr with bl s substrate on the 12th day fig 3e the photoconversion efficiency pce of the microalgal biofilm was calculated to evaluate the utilization efficiency of the light energy by biofilms in the bpbr dillschneider et al 2013 specifically the pces of the biofilms on the bl s substrate were 10 6 9 6 and 8 2 corresponding to the cultivation times on days 8th 10th and 12th days which were 87 5 106 5 and 93 0 higher than that of the biofilms on the so substrate respectively fig 3f moreover the electric power consumption of led for the bl s substrate was 1465 w m 2 which was 25 lower than that for the so substrate fig 3f in short the bl s substrate can reduce the light energy input and increase the pce of the biofilm in bpbr according to the light intensity of different interfaces in the bpbr table s2 the light intensity assigned to the liquid biofilm and loss was calculated table s3 the proportions of incident light corresponding to various parts liquid biofilm and loss is shown in fig 3g for the so substrate the percentage of light intensity assigned to the biofilm decreased from 33 0 d to 10 12 d meanwhile the proportion of light intensity assigned to liquid increased from 32 0 d to 79 12 d comparatively the percentage of light intensity assigned to the the biofilm on the bl s substrate improved from 32 0 d to 100 12 d these results indicated the significantly decreased loss of incident light with the introduction of the bl s substrate into bpbr during the cultivation of microalgal biofilm 3 3 influence of bubbles introduced into biofilm by bl s substrate on the biofilm structure after 12 h of cultivation a number of bubbles adhered to the microalgal biofilm at the bottom of the bpbr previous studies have confirmed that the oxygen generated by photosynthesis of microalgae usually adheres to the supporting substrate in the form of bubbles ranglova et al 2019 zheng et al 2017 the growth process of a single bubble on the surface of the supporting substrates is illustrated in fig 4a for the so substrate the generated site of a bubble was close to the biofilm top and the growth before it left the bottom lasted for more than 2 h fig 4a when the buoyancy of the bubble was greater than surface tension the bubble separated from the biofilm ranglova et al 2019 for the bl s substrate the formation site of a bubble was close to the biofilm bottom and its faster separation from the bottom of the bpbr broke through the thin layer of the biofilm fig 4a the dynamic behavior diameter and number of the bubbles play critical roles in affecting the mass transfer within the biofilm and biofilm structure huang et al 2018 the distribution of the bubbles diameters over the entire bottom area of the bpbr was close to a log normal distribution in particular the number of bubbles on the bl s substrate fig 4c was higher than that on the so substrate fig 4b besides the average diameter of the bubbles on the bl s substrate fig 4c 0 965 mm was slightly larger than that of the bubbles on the so substrate fig 4b 0 946 mm in terms of the mass transfer abundant oxygen bubbles increased the mass transfer resistance of nutrients such as nh4 n no3 n and po4 3 p to the biofilm near the culture medium similar conclusions have been reported by a previous study which showed the bubbles on the grooves limited mass transport of culture medium to s obliquus huang et al 2018 this explains why the growth of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was weaker than that on the so substrate during the initial stage of cultivation in terms of biofilm structure bubbles carrying may contribute to the emergence of a porous structure within the biofilm this also explains why there were more white areas in the bl s substrate than in the so substrate after 1 d of cultivation under the influence of the bubble carrying fig 4d the microstructure of the biofilms was investigated using sem imaging fig 4d on the 4th day the microstructure of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was looser and more dispersed than that on the so substrate fig 4d specifically the porosity of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was 50 which was 63 higher than that on the so substrate on the 4th day fig 4e this proved that the bubbles that were produced by photosynthesis might carry microalgal cells into the culture medium and even damage the biofilm thus affecting its structure after that the porosity of the biofilm decreased with the extension of cultivation time owing to the continuous division of microalgae cells and the accumulation of eps fig 4e after 12 d the porosity of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was only 12 which was still 43 higher than it was the so substrate fig 4e the high porosity of the biofilms could increase the efficiency of nutrient transfer to the biofilm similarly jana et al 2014 reported that the biofilm exhibited higher charge transport diffusion coefficients owing to the increased biofilm porosity of ion transport in microbial electrochemical cells thus the increased biomass concentration on the bl s substrate also benefited from the improvement in the nutrient transfer capacity under the high large porosity conditions the behaviors of the bubbles growth rising and separation can interrupt the culture medium and facilitate the diffusion of dissolved oxygen do zheng et al 2017 during the initial period the direct light radiation at the biofilm bottom was found to accelerate the production of large amounts of oxygen bubbles therefore the do concentration in the culture medium on the bl s substrate was higher than that on the so substrate in the first 12 h fig s1a the do concentration in the culture media gradually decreased after 1 day this result could be ascribed to the supporting substrate being tightly covered by the biofilms resulting in a sharp reduction in the bubble generation sites after four days the suspended microalgal cells increased noticeably leading to an increase in the do concentration of the culture medium of so substrate fig s1a similarly the ph of the culture medium for the so substrate was higher than that for the bl s substrate fig s1b it also supports that the suspended microalgal cells consumed co2 that was present in the culture medium resulting in a relatively high concentration of h in the culture medium valdes et al 2012 3 4 influence of bl s substrate on co adhesion strength of mature biofilm the co adhesion strength of the mature biofilm which is the biofilms after 12 days of cultivation was investigated in terms of flushing on the biofilm via di water circularly after six days of flushing the optical density of microalgal cells od680 of the bl s substrate was 0 03 which was 48 lower than that of the so substrate fig 5 a a lower od680 at the outlet of bpbr indicated fewer cells were separated under hydrodynamic forces resulting in a stronger co adhesion strength of the biofilm thus the co adhesion strength of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was greater than that on the so substrate this may be because the mature biofilm on the bl s substrate produced more abundant eps fig 5b tb eps was considered to be a major factor in biological adhesion cheah and chan 2021 the protein in tb eps built a cross linked network to maintain internal structure of biofilms and facilitate biosynthesis of carbohydrate which can further enhance biofilm adhesion wang et al 2020b accurately the carbohydrate content of the tp eps of microalgal biofilm on the bl s substrate was 88 mg g 1 dry weight which was 114 higher than that on the so substrate fig 5c a similar result was observed that long term light exposure can increase the eps of chlorella vulgaris which may be due to the external stress of persistent photons on microalgal cells xiao and zheng 2016 the co adhesion strength of the biofilms was also evaluated using the co adhesion energy g co adh a higher negative g co adh indicated that there was stronger cell cell interactions within the biofilm zhang et al 2015 table s5 shows the surface free energy sef components calculated from contact angle data of the biofilms table s4 according to the sef components the g co adh of microalgal biofilm can be obtained using thermodynamic theory shown in fig 5d after 12 days g co adh of the biofilm on the bl s substrate reached 55 3 mj m 2 which is 34 1 higher than that of the so substrate fig 5d consequently the biofilm on the bl s substrate exhibited excellent co adhesion strength to protect against hydraulic shear forces in biofilm systems of wastewater treatment the superior co adhesion strength of the allowed more microalgal cells to be retained on the supporting substrate without being washed out with the liquid resulting in increased pollutant removal efficiency zhuang et al 2020 the distribution of the eps was used to reveal the adhesion of the entire biofilm on the supporting substrate a layer of eps was wrapped around numerous microalgal cells that were present at the bottom of the biofilm on the bl s substrate that is on the side of the biofilm closest to the direct radiation light source fig 5e this indicates the bl s substrate can promote the synthesis of eps especially in the interfacial between the biofilm and the bl s substrate leading to the stable adhesion of the biofilm as a whole onto the substrate 3 5 pollutants removal in the bpbr 3 5 1 influence of the bl s substrate on pollutants removal in the bpbr based on the benefits of strengthened photoconversion efficiency and co adhesion strength the bl s substrate was applied to purify digested wastewater with high turbidity to assess its practical application potential for the so substrate the od680 of the effluent increased significantly after four days and reached 1 74 after seven days fig 6 a comparatively the od680 of the effluent of the bl s substrate was always below 0 1 which was at least 94 lower than that of the so substrate fig 6a this suggests that the bl s substrate can improve the adhesion within biofilms thereby eliminating valuable biomass loss caused by abundant suspended cells fig 6b shows the turbidity of the effluent treated with the microalgal biofilm the turbidity of the effluent was caused by the tiny particles in the wastewater and the microalgae could adsorb these particles under the lifshitz van der waals interaction and electrostatic interaction and the biofilm structure which would also have had a filtering effect on the particles chomiak et al 2014 the turbidity of the effluent decreased rapidly after one day after which this trend slowed this is because the absorption of the biofilm by the particles gradually reached saturation resulting in a weakening of the turbidity removal ability after 7 days the turbidity of the effluent of the bl s substrate was 109 ftu which was slightly lower by an amount of 7 compared with the so substrate this was probably because the biomass concentration of the biofilm on the bl s substrate was higher than that on the so substrate resulting in stronger adsorption to the particles indeed the final biomass concentration and f v f m of the biofilm on the bl s substrate were 46 61 2 93 g m 2 and 0 637 0 03 which were 33 5 and 36 2 higher than those on the so substrate respectively fig 6f this can be attributed to the fact that the biofilm on the bl s substrate was always exposed to sufficient light to avoid weakening the reception of photons by the biofilm due to turbid wastewater fig 6e after 7 days the residual concentration of nh4 n original concentration 195 0 mg l 1 decreased to 0 and 36 6 mg l 1 corresponding to the so substrate and the bl s substrate respectively and their removal efficiencies were 100 and 81 2 respectively fig 6c similarly the residual concentration of tp original concentration 43 2 mg l 1 dropped to 12 2 mg l 1 and 16 3 mg l 1 corresponding to the so substrate and the bl s substrate respectively and their removal efficiencies were 71 8 and 63 0 respectively fig 6d in short the pollutant removal efficiency of the bl s substrate was slightly lower than that of the so substrate this may be due to the removal of pollutants by the abundant suspended microalgae cells in the wastewater fig 6a besides the increasing suspended microalgae in the bpbr with the so substrate was evidenced by the increasing do concentration and ph of the digested wastewater fig s2b and s2c the total removal amount of nh4 n contributed by the biofilm on the bl s substrate reached 158 4 mg l 1 which was 12 8 higher than that of the so substrate fig 6g meanwhile the removal rate of nh4 n by the biofilm on the bl s substrate reached 22 6 mg l 1 d 1 fig 6h which was superior to that on other supporting substrates such as pvc fillers wei et al 2008 alginate wang et al 2019 cellulose acetate membranes cheng et al 2020 and pine sawdust zhang et al 2020b it should be noted that cheng et al 2020 in their study used microalgal biofilms cultured on cellulose acetate membranes to treat the digested wastewater the results showed that the removal rate of nh4 n by the biofilm reached 15 1 mg l 1 d 1 when cultured in a 5 fold dilution of wastewater owing to the alleviation of the impediment to light transmission by sludge turbidity however dilution increased extra water consumption and this caused an increase in the total volume of the wastewater hence bl s substrate can become a promising alternative to eliminate the dilution of high turbidity wastewater for efficient bioremediation via microalgal biofilm moreover the residual concentrations of cod were reduced to 391 5 mg l 1 so substrate and 610 mg l 1 bl s substrate after 7 days respectively fig s2a this is because the photons received by the biofilm on the so substrate were weakened resulting in the enhanced heterotrophic consumption of the biofilm on organic matter a previous study showed that the heterotrophic growth of microalgae can reduce cod from wastewater montano san agustin et al 2022 3 5 2 comparison of the microbial community in the biofilms the microbial community in biofilms is a crucial factor that affects the growth of microalgae and the removal of pollutants the alpha diversity index chao 1 and evenness shannon and simpson used to estimate bacterial richness are shown in table s6 the observed species and chao 1 in the bl s substrate were lower than those in the so substrate the shannon and simpson of the biofilm in the bl s were greater than those on the so substrate these results indicate the bl s substrate greatly influence the microbial community the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level is shown in fig 7 a bacteroidota 65 8 and proteobacteria 32 1 were the major bacteria on the bl s substrate the dominant bacteria in the so substrate were cyanobacteria 19 7 bacteroidota 60 3 and proteobacteria 18 9 cyanobacteria which can photosynthesize to release oxygen may facilitate an increase in do concentration in the bpbr see fig s2b bacteria in the genera of sediminibacterium flavobacterium hydrogenophaga and sphingobacterium were remarkably different for the bl s substrate and the so substrate fig 7b the relative abundance of sediminibacterium on the so substrate was 29 0 which was higher than on the bl s substrate 22 8 sediminibacterium is usually aerobic which may contribute to cod removal wu et al 2019 the relative abundance of sphingobacterium hydrogenophaga and flavobacterium on bl s substrates were 2 5 10 4 and 14 2 respectively which were significantly higher those of sphingobacterium 0 03 hydrogenophaga 1 6 and flavobacterium 0 7 on the so substrate fig 7b sphingobacterium is an active member of the algal bacteria system which may be beneficial for the growth of microalgae wang et al 2020a hydrogenophaga can remove nh4 n via the synergistic effects of digestion and denitrification jiang et al 2018 flavobacterium has been reported as a genus with the ability to promote eps production and biofilm formation zhang et al 2020a indeed from the sem images of the biofilm at the end of wastewater treatment it can be seen in the bottom of the biofilm on the bl s substrate where lamellar eps was wrapped around the microalgae fig s3 notably the dominant biological species in the biofilms was still the spherical microalgae fig s3 this indicates that the bacterial community on the bl s substrate primarily promotes the growth of microalgae and eps secretion thereby enhancing the removal rate of pollutants and the adhesion within the biofilm 4 conclusions in this study the light was directly irradiated onto the microalgal biofilms via the incorporation of the bl s substrate into a bpbr rather than having it be attenuated in turbid liquid the final biomass concentration of the microalgal biofilm on the bl s substrate was improved by 26 when compared to that on the so substrate because of the excellent light conditions and biofilm porosity caused by photosynthetic bubbles the co adhesion energy of the biofilm cultivated on the bl s substrate was improved by 34 1 when compared with the so substrate this meant that the bl s substrate can increase the co adhesion strength of the biofilm resisting hydrodynamic shear forces when the bl s substrate was tested for the treatment of the digested wastewater the removal rates of nh4 n and tp contributed by microalgal biofilm reached 22 6 mg l 1 d 1 and 3 8 mg l 1 d 1 respectively aiming to achieve continuous and more efficient wastewater purification further research is needed to optimize the operating parameters
