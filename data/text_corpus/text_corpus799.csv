3995,as the second largest lake in africa the extent of lake chad has over 50 seasonal variations with large parts of water under aquatic vegetation although a great area shrinkage since the 1960s divided the lake into two parts namely the northern and southern basins it still feeds millions of people from four countries around it given sparse in situ measurements remote sensing with seamless spatial coverage has served for acquiring the long term area series of lake chad this study retrieves the open unvegetated surface water area series of lake chad and the total inundation area including open water and water under macrophytes combining multiple remote sensing data from around 1980 to 2020 with satellite based water level and in situ observations at the bol gauge as validation and auxiliary results show that the total inundation area continuously recovered at a rate of 145 km2 year from 1982 to 2020 with large annual fluctuations approximately two to three month time lags between the open surface water and the total inundation area reveal the hydrological asynchrony of lake chad which can be attributed by the large area of rooted macrophytes the overspill of the southern surface water flowing over the great barrier into the northern lake also has a one month lag with the open surface water of the southern lake the google earth engine based online application can be easily shared for use and data downloaded by the general public and the open code can be adjusted for any other lakes worldwide keywords lake chad long term analysis open surface water total inundation area google earth engine 1 introduction lake chad one of the largest lakes globally is located on the southern edge of the sahara desert it was as large as nearly 25 000 km2 in the 1960s and has shrunk to around 2 000 km2 recently shaofeng et al 2017 the lake serves millions of people in four countries namely chad niger nigeria and cameron vivekananda et al 2019 through domestic usage fishing and recession farming birkett 2000 sarch and birkett 2000 grazing and irrigation mahmood and jia 2019 as shown in fig 1 lake chad is mainly replenished by runoff more than 90 of the water in the lake flows from the chari logone river to the southern basin and less than 10 comes from the other rivers mainly contributing to the northern basin gao et al 2011 with a mean depth 2 m bader et al 2011 it experiences significant seasonal variations and interannual changes the lake has been divided by a grassy ridge known as the great barrier into northern and southern lakes since the 1970s due to the sharp shrinkage of the lake making the southern lake the only permanent part olivry et al 1996 birkett 2000 gao et al 2011 in the meantime there is a one month lag for the southern water area to respond to the peak streamflow of chari logone river zhu et al 2017 understanding the variations and hydrological asynchrony of the lake can facilitate future water area predictions such as guiding agricultural decisions policelli et al 2019 two area conceptions have been considered the open surface water area which can be clearly seen by visual bands of remote sensing satellites pham duc et al 2020 and the total surface water area or total inundation area which includes open surface water and water area covered by aquatic vegetation which should be inferred from thermal remote sensing products leblanc et al 2011 policelli et al 2019 open surface water can be measured indirectly by inferring the areas from empirical depth area curves based on satellite altimetry or hydrological models sarch and birkett 2000 gao et al 2011 or directly with visible or near infrared remote sensing observations that are suitable for large scale monitoring policelli et al 2019 pham duc et al 2020 considering the large area of lake chad water covered by vegetation cannot be observed directly by visible sensors thermal remote sensing satellites such as meteosat and modis have been used to derive the total inundation water area based on the thermal inertia difference between inundated areas and dry land birkett 2000 frederick et al 2018 however due to the indistinguishability between soil moisture and surface water and due to the high cloud coverage the total surface water cannot be observed well using near infrared sensors during wet seasons june to october by determining the average monthly total surface water areas from 1992 to 2017 in the dry seasons the peak water elevation was found to occur in november while a gentle peak in the total inundation area was observed around march with a temporal lag of several months policelli et al 2019 although current studies on area series of lake chad are very abundant they concentrated on either a part of the lake zhu et al 2017 or on open surface water pham duc et al 2020 and total inundation area frederick et al 2018 separately asynchrony exists between rainfall runoff and lake water area replenished by rivers there is a time lag of about two months for the chari logone river streamflow peak in october november sarch and birkett 2000 to respond to precipitation peak in august in the southern basin of lake chad a study concentrating on the logone catchment which is a part of chari logone river basin also shows 3 months lag of streamflow response to the precipitation in upstream catchment nkiaka et al 2017 the peak water level occurs in november december with about a one month lag behind the peak streamflow zhu et al 2017 the pace of the open surface water series is similar to that of the water level measurements with little time lag peak total inundation area has about 3 months lag behind the peak water elevation policelli et al 2019 however due to a lack of a comprehensive area dataset based on remote sensing the general inspection conducted in previous studies did not reveal further details about the hydrological asynchrony between the open water and total inundation areas of lake chad the relationship between the northern and southern parts also remains unclear given its high efficiency google earth engine gee provides robust parallel computing power to extract information from a huge number of multisource remote sensing images gorelick et al 2017 this platform is broadly used for global studies such as forest change analyses hansen et al 2013 global surface water extractions pekel et al 2016 and large scale image preprocessing and composites li et al 2019 the codes can be easily shared with a link or packaged as application websites although elevation area relationship sarch and birkett 2000 and hydrological models gao et al 2011 can also be used to simulate water extents this study retrieves both the long term open surface water and total inundation area of lake chad only from multiple satellite observations then the trends are inspected and the hydrological asynchrony between the open water areas and total inundation areas in the southern and northern parts of the lake are explored finally leveraging the power of gee the developed code is shared and an online application with downloadable data is provided for non experts and the general public who focus on this internationally sensitive area 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake chad the catchment boundary of lake chad was produced using the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation version 4 data at a resolution of 90 m fig 2 jarvis et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 the north south division line represents the great barrier consisting of shoals covered by dense vegetation occasionally the water from the south basin overflows into the north when the water level is high fig 2 b depicts the elevation profile of 20 sample points shown in fig 2 a showing the water surface of the southern lake 280 m the great barrier with an average top height of 282 283 m and the lower north lake 275 m from the southern basin to the northern basin an elevation threshold of 288 m was selected to delineate the catchment area 27200 km2 under the consideration that the area generated with this threshold is as close as possible to the published value of 25000 km2 carmouze and lemoalle 1983 fews 1997 and that the boundary should be sufficiently large to include the flooded water body of lake chad then a binary image produced using the threshold on the srtm image was vectorized to obtain the primary boundary of lake chad to maintain consistency and achieve an accurate analysis small holes within the boundary were filled manually to obtain the ultimate lake chad boundary blue polygon in fig 2 a 2 2 satellite datasets and in situ measurements the datasets used in this study include datasets applied to derive the open surface water area and total inundation area a dataset containing the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values for the vegetation inspection analysis and the validation data as shown in table 1 the extent of the open surface water area which can be detected by optical sensors can be retrieved using visible band data recorded by modis since 2000 with a high temporal resolution and validated with landsat 8 data recorded since 2013 which have a higher spatial resolution than the modis data the thermal satellite derived lst products used to acquire the total inundation area include avhrr october 1982 to december 1985 meteosat 1986 2000 and modis 2000 current water level products derived with topex poseidon and jason 1 2 3 from hydroweb crétaux et al 2011 and measured at the bol gauge were used for validation the gee was leveraged for the extraction of the area of lake chad from avhrr landsat and modis images 1 modis two modis datasets were used to extract the open surface water and total inundation areas each dataset was integrated into monthly median composites to obtain a clear composite and avoid the influences of sensor noise clouds or cloud shadows a combination of visual and shortwave infrared bands was applied with the method proposed by ji et al 2018 to perform an optical based monthly open water area extraction the mod09a1 006 terra surface reflectance 8 day global 500 m vermote 2015 data were used in this study a pixel was classified as water if it satisfied any one of the following two conditions condition 1 h i g h r e f l e c t a n c e w a t e r m a x v i s t

a x s w i r otherwise the wi was 1 moreover ndvi band 4 b a n d 3 band 4 b a n d 3 given the absence of mountains in the study area and because the monthly mosaic images are cloud free object based post classification was not performed water that is easily misrecognized as clouds and ice snow flags could be extracted with an accuracy of over 93 ji gong et al 2018 the total inundation area was extracted with an unsupervised two value classification of mod11a2 v6 8 day lst modis t images wan et al 2015 within the boundary of lake chad which was similar to that used by frederick et al 2018 given that precipitation will cool the land surface and make the differentiation between the land and inundated area difficult only dry months november to may were selected for the lst based inundation area derivation 2 avhrr the global 4 km daytime surface temperature data collated by noaa avhrr pathfinder version 5 3 baker yeboah and kilpatrick 2016 were used to extract the lake surface area the thermal inertia of land is higher than that of open water due to the unlimited supply of water for evaporation leblanc et al 2011 followed by that of an archipelago under marshy conditions fig 3 illustrates the daily temperatures of water land and archipelago from october 1981 to december 1982 these temperatures were averaged for each surface type in the training regions fig 4 despite some noise in the avhrr derived temperature data the results revealed that water had the lowest temperature among the three surface types all year and the temperature of the land was always higher than those of the other two surface types therefore the water body could be extracted based on land surface temperature products a supervised classification method namely the support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel burges 1998 was used to derive the open water archipelago with a large area of water under vegetation and land area as the sample classification results in 2013 fig 4 fig 4a shows a landsat 7 etm image overlain with training samples and fig 4b shows the avhrr lst yearly median mosaic fig 4c shows the three type classification results the sum of the areas of the open water and archipelago was considered the total inundation area fig 4d is the open surface water classification based on modis as a reference since the avhrr data may have issues with large and inconsistent geometric and geolocation errors emery et al 1989 khlopenkov et al 2009 which lead to huge fluctuations of monthly total inundation area derived from avhrr the yearly mean area was computed in this study to compensate the low data quality of avhrr the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is often used as an indicator for estimating the growth status of vegetation with higher values showing denser vegetation avhrr based ndvi products tucker et al 2005 have been used to inspect the monthly vegetation variations in lake chad 3 meteosat although long term avhrr observations are available only the yearly total inundation area was used in this study due to the high fluctuations in the avhrr based monthly area therefore to compensate for the disadvantages of avhrr meteosat thermal maximum composite derived monthly total inundation area estimates of lake chad during the dry seasons from 1986 to 2001 leblanc et al 2011 were used to extend the time span of the dataset used in this study 4 landsat archived since 1972 landsat images provide the most prolonged land surface information and can be used for various applications wulder et al 2019 in this study the monthly open water area recorded before 1984 was extracted based on landsat multispectral scanner mss monthly composite images filtered with cloud cover less than 5 in the catchment boundary the modified normalized different water index mndwi xu 2006 was used in this study mndwi b a n d 4 b a n d 7 b a n d 4 b a n d 7 for the mss images otsu histogram binarization otsu 1979 within the catchment boundary of lake chad was then adopted to binarize the mndwi images and acquire the water areas from 1984 to 2019 the water areas were computed based on the monthly data of the global surface water dataset available on the gee pekel et al 2016 in which no data percentage larger than 5 was filtered out the water area from 2020 to date was computed using the landsat 8 surface reflectance product with the same method as that used for the landsat mss images where mndwi b a n d 3 b a n d 6 b a n d 3 b a n d 6 since complete and cloud free observations of the entirety of lake chad by landsat are rather sparse landsat derived open surface water areas were only used as supplemental data before 2000 and higher resolution validation data 30 m for modis derived open surface water after 2013 5 water level the water level data were obtained from two sources namely altimeter satellites and in situ measurements these data were used as auxiliary and validation data the monthly mean elevation change data from hydroweb crétaux et al 2011 were derived from topex poseidon and jason 1 2 3 and covered from 1992 to 2019 the original target height variation was derived from the satellite altimetry reference pass mean level m the egm2008 geoid at 281 25 m was selected to shift the height variation data from the satellite product datum to the mean sea level datum the hydroweb measurement point for lake chad was at 14 17 e 13 33 n see fig 2 the in situ water level measurements obtained at the bol gauge 14 71e 13 46 n from 1986 to 2012 were used lemoalle et al 2012 observations have been recorded daily at the bol gauge in the archipelago from 1956 to 2012 except from february 1979 to october 1984 since the water level was low on some occasions there are no readings below 277 87 m ngt chad s national reference system that is water levels below this height were recorded as null by the gauge 2 3 validation and intercomparison of water areas since it is impossible to obtain in situ area measurements for lake chad first the water level can be used as validation data based on the positive correlation between water depth and area i e the higher the water level is the larger the water area is for the time series x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n where n is the number of timestamps this relationship can be evaluated with the pearson s r values computed with eq 1 in which c o v x y stands for the covariance of x and y σ x a n d x stand for the standard deviation and mean of x respectively while σ y a n d y stand for the standard deviation and mean of y respectively the water level data measured at the bol gauge and by hydroweb satellite products were used for the open surface water area validation 1 r c o v x y σ x σ y x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 2 mre 100 n x i y i y i second an intercomparison among different data sources can be used to measure the coincidence for which both pearson s r and the mean relative difference mre were used as criteria eq 2 in this study the intercomparison of the open surface water area included the modis visible and landsat datasets while that of the total inundation area comprised the meteosat avhrr and modis thermal datasets 2 4 combining different data sources the open water and total inundation areas obtained from different data sources were combined to form a dataset covering nearly 40 years the open surface water area series consisted of modis derived areas after 2000 and landsat derived areas before 2000 the total inundation area series consisted of data derived from avhrr 1982 1985 meteosat 1986 2000 and modis 2000 2020 2 5 metric of hydrologic asynchrony a time lag of approximately 2 months between rainfall and river discharge was found by comparing peak value months in the whole chari logone river basin zhu yan et al 2017 while 3 months lag of streamflow outlet response to the upstream precipitation was found in the logone catchment with the correlation analysis of standardized indicators nkiaka nawaz et al 2017 in this study the time lag measured with months m 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 is defined as the metric of the hydrologic asynchrony between two hydrological variables specifically for the time series of open surface water area o o 1 o 2 o n and total inundation area t t 1 t 2 t n we can obtain m when r m in eq 3 is the maximized i e the number of months considered in this study clearly m 0 means there is no time lag while m 3 means there is a 3 month time lag between the two variables 3 r m n m 1 n m o i t i m 1 n m o i 1 n m t i m n m 1 n m o i 2 1 n m o i 2 n m 1 n m t i m 2 1 n m t i m 2 3 results within a maximum boundary generated by the srtm instead of a rough hand drawn boundary of lake chad the long term water area variations in lake chad were inspected and validated followed by an exhibition of the time lag between the open surface water and total inundation area then a user interface based on gee is shown and introduced 3 1 long term water area variations fig 5 illustrates the long term monthly inundation information of lake chad derived from different data sources the monthly inundation information shows great seasonal fluctuation cycles and annual variations it can be seen that good consistencies exist between datasets of the same type for example the satellite altimeter measurements of the south lake derived from hydroweb have a consistent fluctuation with the water level data obtained from the in situ measurements at the bol gauge the open surface water area mainly contributed by the south lake derived from the visible bands of the modis modo satellite and landsat since 2013 and the total inundation area retrieved using modis thermal products modt meteosat and avhrr lst yearly measurements are also compliant with each other the monthly changes in the lst derived total water area of the avhrr 1981 2000 meteosat 1986 2001 and modis 2000 2018 datasets and the open surface water area obtained by modis thermal bands 2000 2018 are presented in fig 6 a the monthly area differences among the three total inundation data sources do not exceed 20 of the total area despite some slight differences the monthly changes in the satellite derived total water areas agree well with each other that a gentle peak of total water area appears around march the altimetry satellite based hydroweb elevation changes and in situ measurements recorded at the bol gauge shown in fig 6 b indicate that the highest water level occurred during november and december whereas the lowest levels were observed during june and august the two water level datasets have a correlation coefficient value of 0 82 with a bias of 0 74 m given the 1 2 m difference between the lowest and highest water levels the amplitude of the open water area derived from modis can increase from 1483 km2 to 3470 km2 demonstrating enlargement of approximately 2 3 times fig 7 shows a comparison of the annual changes in the total inundation areas combined by the avhrr meteosat and modis thermal bands in dry seasons as well as the yearly open surface water area derived from modis data as previously mentioned lake chad has been separated into northern and southern parts i e small lake chad since 1973 lemoalle bader et al 2012 followed by a severe drought that occurred in 1987 richard et al 2001 this drought can be observed as the sharp drop in fig 7 leading to a depletion of the northern lake gao et al 2011 then a rapid recovery was observed in 1989 this recovery can also be seen in the in situ measurements fig 5 since 1991 the total inundation area continuously increased until 2000 followed by a decrease over a decade until approximately 2010 then the commencement of an increase once again the result of the linear regression suggests that the total inundation area of lake chad is generally increasing at a rate of 145 km2 year with several local fluctuations this trend is also very similar to the 143 km2 year increase rate observed during 1988 2017 by frederick alfred et al 2018 a peak area of 12662 km2 was observed in 1989 followed by a huge increasing area 732 km2 year from 1991 to 2000 r 0 89 which is consistent with the findings of policelli et al 2019 the correlation coefficient between the total inundation and open surface water area coinciding since 2000 was 0 64 the yearly open water area continuously decreased from approximately 2700 km2 to nearly 1800 km2 from 2000 to 2010 which is consistent with the findings of pham duc et al 2020 the correlation coefficient between the merged yearly total inundation area and annual mean water level measured at the bol gauge in the dry season was 0 73 indicating the reliability of the data detailed validation will be described in section 3 3 3 2 validation and intercomparison 3 2 1 open surface water area the open surface water area is highly correlated with the water level especially for shallow water bodies therefore the open surface water area can be validated through a linear correlation with water level measurements as computed with eq 1 for the period from 2001 to 2020 the correlation coefficients of the whole open surface water area and water level from the hydroweb and bol gauge data were 0 63 and 0 83 respectively for the south lake these values were 0 77 and 0 72 and for the north lake they were 0 45 and 0 81 respectively another method used to validate open surface water area data is based on the fact that an area derived from a lower resolution image can be estimated with an area derived from a higher resolution image the monthly open surface water area data derived from modis optical bands during 2013 2018 can thus be validated with the area data derived from landsat since the data became richer in temporal resolution when landsat 8 was launched in 2013 see fig 5 the monthly correlation coefficient of the whole lake between the two datasets was 0 79 r2 0 62 with an mre of 22 3 2 2 total inundation area although it is challenging to validate the total inundation area without in situ measurements it was shown that thermal image derived total inundation areas are reliable by a survey conducted in june 1996 by leblanc et al 2011 this study performed intercomparisons of the total inundation areas derived from avhrr meteosat and modis products the correlation coefficients among the total inundation areas were under an acceptable range for example that between the meteosat and modis derived monthly areas was 0 85 with an mre of 7 during their overlapping two years 2000 and 2001 and the correlation between the annual avhrr and meteosat data was 0 71 mre of 15 from 1986 to 2000 yearly correlations with in situ measurements in dry seasons can also support the reliability of an area dataset a comparison between the modis derived annual total water areas and the in situ measurements recorded at the bol gauge is illustrated in fig 8 the two datasets have good accordance with a correlation coefficient of 0 83 the correlation coefficient between the combined long term yearly total inundation area in dry seasons and the water level recorded at the bol gauge was 0 73 during 1986 and 2020 the correlation coefficients between the combined monthly total inundation area series and water level data derived from hydroweb and the bol gauge were 0 51 and 0 81 respectively with corresponding lag periods of four and two months the time lags are described in section 3 4 3 3 temporal lags the temporal relationships among the water level measured at the bol gauge the open surface water area and the total inundated water area were inspected using the correlation coefficients with different lag months as computed with eq 3 and shown in table 2 the total inundation areas derived with modis and meteosat thermal data lagged behind the water levels measured using in situ sensors and altimeter satellites by approximately two to three months similarly the optical satellite based open surface water areas obtained with modis and landsat optical bands were three months ahead of the total inundated water areas correlation coefficients were also computed for different time lags with eq 3 between the water level measured at the bol gauge the open surface water area and the total inundation area for the southern and northern parts derived with modis data from january 2000 to december 2012 table 3 the water level measurements at bol are at the same pace as the open surface water area in the south lake os while the open surface water area in the north lake on lags one month behind a one month lag can also be observed between os and on this lag is due to the replenishment of the south lake by water mainly sourced from the chari logone river water starts to flow into the north lake when the south lake reaches its maximum water area below the great barrier 278 3 m leading to a one month lag there was a three month lag in the total inundation area of the north lake relative to the water level measured at the bol gauge r 0 84 the open surface water areas and total inundation areas of the north lake demonstrated a one month lag r 0 70 during dry seasons there were no obvious correlations between the open surface water areas and total inundation areas of the south lake or between the total inundation areas of the south and north lakes 3 4 user interface based on google earth engine to better support government management and attract the attention of the general public the dataset has been packaged and designed as an interactive application fig 9 based on google earth engine gee with a webpage link https lihuan users earthengine app view lakechad the application consists of two panels landsat mosaic images obtained around january in specific years and yearly or monthly area variations shown by line charts and dynamic figures the online application can benefit nonexperts or the general public in several ways first the obvious changes in the water area in specific years can be interactively inspected through panning or zooming in out with 30 m 60 m landsat images such as the extents of the relatively large lake chad in 1973 the very small lake chad that existed in 1987 due to a severe drought the gradually recovered lake chad at the end of the 20th century and the more recent lake chad second the total inundation area the yearly mean during 1982 2020 in dry seasons and the open surface water area monthly 2000 2020 were visualized and can be downloaded by clicking the arrow at the top right of each figure and saved as tables or figures for scientific studies or exhibitions then by selecting a given year the monthly open surface water area variations can be shown as line charts and dynamic figures can be seen for the selected year moreover the area dataset will be updated once new remote sensing images are absorbed into gee 4 discussions 4 1 data gaps among different sources the water level measured with satellite altimetry was approximately 0 7 m higher than that measured by in situ observations fig 6 the open surface water area also had a higher correlation r 0 83 with in situ water level measurements than with the satellite altimetry data r 0 63 section 3 2 1 it may be caused by the accuracy of radar altimetry over a large water surface area 3 cm crétaux jelinski et al 2011 the footprint sizes of satellite radar altimetry that span several kilometers and the 60 km distance between the hydroweb measurement point and the bol gauge see fig 2 however the two datasets both catch the seasonal variations of the shallow lake chad well nevertheless in situ measurements are preferred due to their higher correlation with the surface water area although there was a considerable correlation coefficient r 0 79 between the modis visible bands and the landsat based open surface water area the mre was 22 showing a gap between the two datasets this gap was mainly caused by the different pixel sizes between the modis 500 m and landsat 30 m images an obvious example can be seen in fig 10 that the main difference with the mre reaches 48 comes from the widespread archipelago area in the north southwest and southeast which contains a lot of narrow waterways out of the modis resolution 500 m however modis captured the hydrological variations well due to the large area fluctuations of lake chad regarding the total inundation area meteosat and modis had better conformity r 0 85 mre 8 than meteosat and avhrr r 0 71 mre 17 this difference was caused by the spatial resolution temporal span or frequency of satellites of each product for example modis has the highest spatial resolution and avhrr had retrospective data with the longest time series to 1981 see table 1 while meteosat obtains 48 measurements per day for a given location thus providing a better thermal product göttsche and olesen 2003 therefore the three datasets were combined in this study as shown in section 2 4 4 2 growth cycle impact of aquatic vegetation usually seasonal variations in the water volume of a lake influence the distribution of aquatic vegetation and the growth cycle of plants also impacts the detected total inundation and open surface water areas however this may not be the situation for lake chad in fact hydrophytic plants dominate the inundated area of lake chad mainly rooted reeds including papyrus typha and phragmites with stands of helophytes in open waters lemoalle 2004 leblanc et al 2011 the main vegetation on the islands of lake chad archipelago results from phragmites with floating plants at the base of the reeds around the archipelago islands iltis and lemoalle 1983 generally from january to june the ndvi of lake chad is the lowest it then starts to increase to a peak around august and september followed by another sharp drop until january as shown in fig 11 however the ndvi value is always over 0 3 indicating perennial vegetation coverage due to the tropical climate of the lake chad region therefore the real impacts remain to be further investigated with in situ observations or ultrahigh resolution aerial photography 4 3 hydrological asynchrony process there were two kinds of hydrological asynchrony observed for the open water and total inundation areas of lake chad one type of hydrological asynchrony involved the total inundation area lagging behind the open surface water area by approximately three months as shown in table 2 table 3 also exhibits a 1 and 2 month lag in the total inundation area behind the open surface water area for the southern and northern parts respectively since the open water area is typically assumed to be the deepest part of the lake with the lowest altitude of the lake bottom in both the northern and southern basins this area is covered first by water when this area is covered by water the water level in the vegetated part of the lake rises this water level rise occurs after the open water area has been covered most of the macrophytes in the lake are rooted and developed on temporarily exposed sediments when the water level was very low only a portion of the vegetation is free floating the second type of hydrological asynchrony is the one month lag of the northern open water area to that of the southern basin and the three month lag between the total inundation area of the northern basin to the water level and total inundation area of the southern basin when the south lake reaches its peak open water area as measured using satellite altimeters and in situ measurements e g in years of moderate northern basin inundation the northern basin remains a marsh with a small clearly visible open water area since 1973 the annual chari flood first filled the southern basin due to the hydrologic functioning of the small lake when the southern basin is filled around the end of december the water level slightly increases before water flows into the large marsh between the two basins i e the great barrier and into the northern basin the water spreads out for over 150 km which is the length from the great barrier to the northern basin thereby inundating the almost dry sediments and progressing northwards this process takes time and the open surface water area of the northern basin reaches a peak around january while the inundation limit of the northern basin is reached by approximately february or march except for the analysis above soulsby et al 2006 found that small and mountainous catchments have short and steep flow paths thus with a fast hydrological response the large and flat catchment of lake chad makes it relatively slow moreover the infiltration of surface water into the groundwater aquifer in the great wetland region also contributes to the asynchronous pace of the hydrological process penna et al 2011 therefore as also discussed by nkiaka et al 2017 the temporal lags observed among the multiple hydrological measurements for the lake chad basin including catchment precipitation streamflow at the outlet open surface water and total inundation are generally caused by the flat terrain the large catchment size and the widespread wetland area with much rooted macrophytes 5 conclusions in this study the long term open surface water and total inundation areas of lake chad as well as its northern and southern basins were derived from different data sources at annual and monthly scales in situ measurements and intercomparison correlation coefficient computations were used to validate the good consistency calculated among multiple satellite derived water areas and in situ measurements this consistency was the basis for merging different data sources and forming a long term water area series the trend analysis shows that the total inundation area of lake chad has a sharp yearly oscillation despite the generally increasing trend of 145 km2 year from 1982 to 2020 two to three month temporal lags are presented between the open surface water area and total inundation area of the whole lake and a one to two month lag also exists for the southern and northern basins separately which can be attributed to the large area of macrophytes in the region the inundation of the northern basin lags behind that of the southern basin by one month due to the main river replenishment to the south the great barrier and the long distance between the northern and southern basins these lags can be further inspected at finer temporal scales and explored through hydrological models the lake area series dataset established in this study was produced from satellite observations without leveraging any hydrological models and thus can be used as an input or validation source for hydrological models and to obtain key parameters for lake volume derivations the yearly and monthly variations in the area of lake chad were also visualized and shared with a user interactive application based on gee this application is user friendly for non experts and the

3995,as the second largest lake in africa the extent of lake chad has over 50 seasonal variations with large parts of water under aquatic vegetation although a great area shrinkage since the 1960s divided the lake into two parts namely the northern and southern basins it still feeds millions of people from four countries around it given sparse in situ measurements remote sensing with seamless spatial coverage has served for acquiring the long term area series of lake chad this study retrieves the open unvegetated surface water area series of lake chad and the total inundation area including open water and water under macrophytes combining multiple remote sensing data from around 1980 to 2020 with satellite based water level and in situ observations at the bol gauge as validation and auxiliary results show that the total inundation area continuously recovered at a rate of 145 km2 year from 1982 to 2020 with large annual fluctuations approximately two to three month time lags between the open surface water and the total inundation area reveal the hydrological asynchrony of lake chad which can be attributed by the large area of rooted macrophytes the overspill of the southern surface water flowing over the great barrier into the northern lake also has a one month lag with the open surface water of the southern lake the google earth engine based online application can be easily shared for use and data downloaded by the general public and the open code can be adjusted for any other lakes worldwide keywords lake chad long term analysis open surface water total inundation area google earth engine 1 introduction lake chad one of the largest lakes globally is located on the southern edge of the sahara desert it was as large as nearly 25 000 km2 in the 1960s and has shrunk to around 2 000 km2 recently shaofeng et al 2017 the lake serves millions of people in four countries namely chad niger nigeria and cameron vivekananda et al 2019 through domestic usage fishing and recession farming birkett 2000 sarch and birkett 2000 grazing and irrigation mahmood and jia 2019 as shown in fig 1 lake chad is mainly replenished by runoff more than 90 of the water in the lake flows from the chari logone river to the southern basin and less than 10 comes from the other rivers mainly contributing to the northern basin gao et al 2011 with a mean depth 2 m bader et al 2011 it experiences significant seasonal variations and interannual changes the lake has been divided by a grassy ridge known as the great barrier into northern and southern lakes since the 1970s due to the sharp shrinkage of the lake making the southern lake the only permanent part olivry et al 1996 birkett 2000 gao et al 2011 in the meantime there is a one month lag for the southern water area to respond to the peak streamflow of chari logone river zhu et al 2017 understanding the variations and hydrological asynchrony of the lake can facilitate future water area predictions such as guiding agricultural decisions policelli et al 2019 two area conceptions have been considered the open surface water area which can be clearly seen by visual bands of remote sensing satellites pham duc et al 2020 and the total surface water area or total inundation area which includes open surface water and water area covered by aquatic vegetation which should be inferred from thermal remote sensing products leblanc et al 2011 policelli et al 2019 open surface water can be measured indirectly by inferring the areas from empirical depth area curves based on satellite altimetry or hydrological models sarch and birkett 2000 gao et al 2011 or directly with visible or near infrared remote sensing observations that are suitable for large scale monitoring policelli et al 2019 pham duc et al 2020 considering the large area of lake chad water covered by vegetation cannot be observed directly by visible sensors thermal remote sensing satellites such as meteosat and modis have been used to derive the total inundation water area based on the thermal inertia difference between inundated areas and dry land birkett 2000 frederick et al 2018 however due to the indistinguishability between soil moisture and surface water and due to the high cloud coverage the total surface water cannot be observed well using near infrared sensors during wet seasons june to october by determining the average monthly total surface water areas from 1992 to 2017 in the dry seasons the peak water elevation was found to occur in november while a gentle peak in the total inundation area was observed around march with a temporal lag of several months policelli et al 2019 although current studies on area series of lake chad are very abundant they concentrated on either a part of the lake zhu et al 2017 or on open surface water pham duc et al 2020 and total inundation area frederick et al 2018 separately asynchrony exists between rainfall runoff and lake water area replenished by rivers there is a time lag of about two months for the chari logone river streamflow peak in october november sarch and birkett 2000 to respond to precipitation peak in august in the southern basin of lake chad a study concentrating on the logone catchment which is a part of chari logone river basin also shows 3 months lag of streamflow response to the precipitation in upstream catchment nkiaka et al 2017 the peak water level occurs in november december with about a one month lag behind the peak streamflow zhu et al 2017 the pace of the open surface water series is similar to that of the water level measurements with little time lag peak total inundation area has about 3 months lag behind the peak water elevation policelli et al 2019 however due to a lack of a comprehensive area dataset based on remote sensing the general inspection conducted in previous studies did not reveal further details about the hydrological asynchrony between the open water and total inundation areas of lake chad the relationship between the northern and southern parts also remains unclear given its high efficiency google earth engine gee provides robust parallel computing power to extract information from a huge number of multisource remote sensing images gorelick et al 2017 this platform is broadly used for global studies such as forest change analyses hansen et al 2013 global surface water extractions pekel et al 2016 and large scale image preprocessing and composites li et al 2019 the codes can be easily shared with a link or packaged as application websites although elevation area relationship sarch and birkett 2000 and hydrological models gao et al 2011 can also be used to simulate water extents this study retrieves both the long term open surface water and total inundation area of lake chad only from multiple satellite observations then the trends are inspected and the hydrological asynchrony between the open water areas and total inundation areas in the southern and northern parts of the lake are explored finally leveraging the power of gee the developed code is shared and an online application with downloadable data is provided for non experts and the general public who focus on this internationally sensitive area 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake chad the catchment boundary of lake chad was produced using the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation version 4 data at a resolution of 90 m fig 2 jarvis et al 2008 as shown in fig 2 the north south division line represents the great barrier consisting of shoals covered by dense vegetation occasionally the water from the south basin overflows into the north when the water level is high fig 2 b depicts the elevation profile of 20 sample points shown in fig 2 a showing the water surface of the southern lake 280 m the great barrier with an average top height of 282 283 m and the lower north lake 275 m from the southern basin to the northern basin an elevation threshold of 288 m was selected to delineate the catchment area 27200 km2 under the consideration that the area generated with this threshold is as close as possible to the published value of 25000 km2 carmouze and lemoalle 1983 fews 1997 and that the boundary should be sufficiently large to include the flooded water body of lake chad then a binary image produced using the threshold on the srtm image was vectorized to obtain the primary boundary of lake chad to maintain consistency and achieve an accurate analysis small holes within the boundary were filled manually to obtain the ultimate lake chad boundary blue polygon in fig 2 a 2 2 satellite datasets and in situ measurements the datasets used in this study include datasets applied to derive the open surface water area and total inundation area a dataset containing the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values for the vegetation inspection analysis and the validation data as shown in table 1 the extent of the open surface water area which can be detected by optical sensors can be retrieved using visible band data recorded by modis since 2000 with a high temporal resolution and validated with landsat 8 data recorded since 2013 which have a higher spatial resolution than the modis data the thermal satellite derived lst products used to acquire the total inundation area include avhrr october 1982 to december 1985 meteosat 1986 2000 and modis 2000 current water level products derived with topex poseidon and jason 1 2 3 from hydroweb crétaux et al 2011 and measured at the bol gauge were used for validation the gee was leveraged for the extraction of the area of lake chad from avhrr landsat and modis images 1 modis two modis datasets were used to extract the open surface water and total inundation areas each dataset was integrated into monthly median composites to obtain a clear composite and avoid the influences of sensor noise clouds or cloud shadows a combination of visual and shortwave infrared bands was applied with the method proposed by ji et al 2018 to perform an optical based monthly open water area extraction the mod09a1 006 terra surface reflectance 8 day global 500 m vermote 2015 data were used in this study a pixel was classified as water if it satisfied any one of the following two conditions condition 1 h i g h r e f l e c t a n c e w a t e r m a x v i s t

a x s w i r otherwise the wi was 1 moreover ndvi band 4 b a n d 3 band 4 b a n d 3 given the absence of mountains in the study area and because the monthly mosaic images are cloud free object based post classification was not performed water that is easily misrecognized as clouds and ice snow flags could be extracted with an accuracy of over 93 ji gong et al 2018 the total inundation area was extracted with an unsupervised two value classification of mod11a2 v6 8 day lst modis t images wan et al 2015 within the boundary of lake chad which was similar to that used by frederick et al 2018 given that precipitation will cool the land surface and make the differentiation between the land and inundated area difficult only dry months november to may were selected for the lst based inundation area derivation 2 avhrr the global 4 km daytime surface temperature data collated by noaa avhrr pathfinder version 5 3 baker yeboah and kilpatrick 2016 were used to extract the lake surface area the thermal inertia of land is higher than that of open water due to the unlimited supply of water for evaporation leblanc et al 2011 followed by that of an archipelago under marshy conditions fig 3 illustrates the daily temperatures of water land and archipelago from october 1981 to december 1982 these temperatures were averaged for each surface type in the training regions fig 4 despite some noise in the avhrr derived temperature data the results revealed that water had the lowest temperature among the three surface types all year and the temperature of the land was always higher than those of the other two surface types therefore the water body could be extracted based on land surface temperature products a supervised classification method namely the support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel burges 1998 was used to derive the open water archipelago with a large area of water under vegetation and land area as the sample classification results in 2013 fig 4 fig 4a shows a landsat 7 etm image overlain with training samples and fig 4b shows the avhrr lst yearly median mosaic fig 4c shows the three type classification results the sum of the areas of the open water and archipelago was considered the total inundation area fig 4d is the open surface water classification based on modis as a reference since the avhrr data may have issues with large and inconsistent geometric and geolocation errors emery et al 1989 khlopenkov et al 2009 which lead to huge fluctuations of monthly total inundation area derived from avhrr the yearly mean area was computed in this study to compensate the low data quality of avhrr the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is often used as an indicator for estimating the growth status of vegetation with higher values showing denser vegetation avhrr based ndvi products tucker et al 2005 have been used to inspect the monthly vegetation variations in lake chad 3 meteosat although long term avhrr observations are available only the yearly total inundation area was used in this study due to the high fluctuations in the avhrr based monthly area therefore to compensate for the disadvantages of avhrr meteosat thermal maximum composite derived monthly total inundation area estimates of lake chad during the dry seasons from 1986 to 2001 leblanc et al 2011 were used to extend the time span of the dataset used in this study 4 landsat archived since 1972 landsat images provide the most prolonged land surface information and can be used for various applications wulder et al 2019 in this study the monthly open water area recorded before 1984 was extracted based on landsat multispectral scanner mss monthly composite images filtered with cloud cover less than 5 in the catchment boundary the modified normalized different water index mndwi xu 2006 was used in this study mndwi b a n d 4 b a n d 7 b a n d 4 b a n d 7 for the mss images otsu histogram binarization otsu 1979 within the catchment boundary of lake chad was then adopted to binarize the mndwi images and acquire the water areas from 1984 to 2019 the water areas were computed based on the monthly data of the global surface water dataset available on the gee pekel et al 2016 in which no data percentage larger than 5 was filtered out the water area from 2020 to date was computed using the landsat 8 surface reflectance product with the same method as that used for the landsat mss images where mndwi b a n d 3 b a n d 6 b a n d 3 b a n d 6 since complete and cloud free observations of the entirety of lake chad by landsat are rather sparse landsat derived open surface water areas were only used as supplemental data before 2000 and higher resolution validation data 30 m for modis derived open surface water after 2013 5 water level the water level data were obtained from two sources namely altimeter satellites and in situ measurements these data were used as auxiliary and validation data the monthly mean elevation change data from hydroweb crétaux et al 2011 were derived from topex poseidon and jason 1 2 3 and covered from 1992 to 2019 the original target height variation was derived from the satellite altimetry reference pass mean level m the egm2008 geoid at 281 25 m was selected to shift the height variation data from the satellite product datum to the mean sea level datum the hydroweb measurement point for lake chad was at 14 17 e 13 33 n see fig 2 the in situ water level measurements obtained at the bol gauge 14 71e 13 46 n from 1986 to 2012 were used lemoalle et al 2012 observations have been recorded daily at the bol gauge in the archipelago from 1956 to 2012 except from february 1979 to october 1984 since the water level was low on some occasions there are no readings below 277 87 m ngt chad s national reference system that is water levels below this height were recorded as null by the gauge 2 3 validation and intercomparison of water areas since it is impossible to obtain in situ area measurements for lake chad first the water level can be used as validation data based on the positive correlation between water depth and area i e the higher the water level is the larger the water area is for the time series x x 1 x 2 x n and y y 1 y 2 y n where n is the number of timestamps this relationship can be evaluated with the pearson s r values computed with eq 1 in which c o v x y stands for the covariance of x and y σ x a n d x stand for the standard deviation and mean of x respectively while σ y a n d y stand for the standard deviation and mean of y respectively the water level data measured at the bol gauge and by hydroweb satellite products were used for the open surface water area validation 1 r c o v x y σ x σ y x i x y i y x i x 2 y i y 2 2 mre 100 n x i y i y i second an intercomparison among different data sources can be used to measure the coincidence for which both pearson s r and the mean relative difference mre were used as criteria eq 2 in this study the intercomparison of the open surface water area included the modis visible and landsat datasets while that of the total inundation area comprised the meteosat avhrr and modis thermal datasets 2 4 combining different data sources the open water and total inundation areas obtained from different data sources were combined to form a dataset covering nearly 40 years the open surface water area series consisted of modis derived areas after 2000 and landsat derived areas before 2000 the total inundation area series consisted of data derived from avhrr 1982 1985 meteosat 1986 2000 and modis 2000 2020 2 5 metric of hydrologic asynchrony a time lag of approximately 2 months between rainfall and river discharge was found by comparing peak value months in the whole chari logone river basin zhu yan et al 2017 while 3 months lag of streamflow outlet response to the upstream precipitation was found in the logone catchment with the correlation analysis of standardized indicators nkiaka nawaz et al 2017 in this study the time lag measured with months m 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 is defined as the metric of the hydrologic asynchrony between two hydrological variables specifically for the time series of open surface water area o o 1 o 2 o n and total inundation area t t 1 t 2 t n we can obtain m when r m in eq 3 is the maximized i e the number of months considered in this study clearly m 0 means there is no time lag while m 3 means there is a 3 month time lag between the two variables 3 r m n m 1 n m o i t i m 1 n m o i 1 n m t i m n m 1 n m o i 2 1 n m o i 2 n m 1 n m t i m 2 1 n m t i m 2 3 results within a maximum boundary generated by the srtm instead of a rough hand drawn boundary of lake chad the long term water area variations in lake chad were inspected and validated followed by an exhibition of the time lag between the open surface water and total inundation area then a user interface based on gee is shown and introduced 3 1 long term water area variations fig 5 illustrates the long term monthly inundation information of lake chad derived from different data sources the monthly inundation information shows great seasonal fluctuation cycles and annual variations it can be seen that good consistencies exist between datasets of the same type for example the satellite altimeter measurements of the south lake derived from hydroweb have a consistent fluctuation with the water level data obtained from the in situ measurements at the bol gauge the open surface water area mainly contributed by the south lake derived from the visible bands of the modis modo satellite and landsat since 2013 and the total inundation area retrieved using modis thermal products modt meteosat and avhrr lst yearly measurements are also compliant with each other the monthly changes in the lst derived total water area of the avhrr 1981 2000 meteosat 1986 2001 and modis 2000 2018 datasets and the open surface water area obtained by modis thermal bands 2000 2018 are presented in fig 6 a the monthly area differences among the three total inundation data sources do not exceed 20 of the total area despite some slight differences the monthly changes in the satellite derived total water areas agree well with each other that a gentle peak of total water area appears around march the altimetry satellite based hydroweb elevation changes and in situ measurements recorded at the bol gauge shown in fig 6 b indicate that the highest water level occurred during november and december whereas the lowest levels were observed during june and august the two water level datasets have a correlation coefficient value of 0 82 with a bias of 0 74 m given the 1 2 m difference between the lowest and highest water levels the amplitude of the open water area derived from modis can increase from 1483 km2 to 3470 km2 demonstrating enlargement of approximately 2 3 times fig 7 shows a comparison of the annual changes in the total inundation areas combined by the avhrr meteosat and modis thermal bands in dry seasons as well as the yearly open surface water area derived from modis data as previously mentioned lake chad has been separated into northern and southern parts i e small lake chad since 1973 lemoalle bader et al 2012 followed by a severe drought that occurred in 1987 richard et al 2001 this drought can be observed as the sharp drop in fig 7 leading to a depletion of the northern lake gao et al 2011 then a rapid recovery was observed in 1989 this recovery can also be seen in the in situ measurements fig 5 since 1991 the total inundation area continuously increased until 2000 followed by a decrease over a decade until approximately 2010 then the commencement of an increase once again the result of the linear regression suggests that the total inundation area of lake chad is generally increasing at a rate of 145 km2 year with several local fluctuations this trend is also very similar to the 143 km2 year increase rate observed during 1988 2017 by frederick alfred et al 2018 a peak area of 12662 km2 was observed in 1989 followed by a huge increasing area 732 km2 year from 1991 to 2000 r 0 89 which is consistent with the findings of policelli et al 2019 the correlation coefficient between the total inundation and open surface water area coinciding since 2000 was 0 64 the yearly open water area continuously decreased from approximately 2700 km2 to nearly 1800 km2 from 2000 to 2010 which is consistent with the findings of pham duc et al 2020 the correlation coefficient between the merged yearly total inundation area and annual mean water level measured at the bol gauge in the dry season was 0 73 indicating the reliability of the data detailed validation will be described in section 3 3 3 2 validation and intercomparison 3 2 1 open surface water area the open surface water area is highly correlated with the water level especially for shallow water bodies therefore the open surface water area can be validated through a linear correlation with water level measurements as computed with eq 1 for the period from 2001 to 2020 the correlation coefficients of the whole open surface water area and water level from the hydroweb and bol gauge data were 0 63 and 0 83 respectively for the south lake these values were 0 77 and 0 72 and for the north lake they were 0 45 and 0 81 respectively another method used to validate open surface water area data is based on the fact that an area derived from a lower resolution image can be estimated with an area derived from a higher resolution image the monthly open surface water area data derived from modis optical bands during 2013 2018 can thus be validated with the area data derived from landsat since the data became richer in temporal resolution when landsat 8 was launched in 2013 see fig 5 the monthly correlation coefficient of the whole lake between the two datasets was 0 79 r2 0 62 with an mre of 22 3 2 2 total inundation area although it is challenging to validate the total inundation area without in situ measurements it was shown that thermal image derived total inundation areas are reliable by a survey conducted in june 1996 by leblanc et al 2011 this study performed intercomparisons of the total inundation areas derived from avhrr meteosat and modis products the correlation coefficients among the total inundation areas were under an acceptable range for example that between the meteosat and modis derived monthly areas was 0 85 with an mre of 7 during their overlapping two years 2000 and 2001 and the correlation between the annual avhrr and meteosat data was 0 71 mre of 15 from 1986 to 2000 yearly correlations with in situ measurements in dry seasons can also support the reliability of an area dataset a comparison between the modis derived annual total water areas and the in situ measurements recorded at the bol gauge is illustrated in fig 8 the two datasets have good accordance with a correlation coefficient of 0 83 the correlation coefficient between the combined long term yearly total inundation area in dry seasons and the water level recorded at the bol gauge was 0 73 during 1986 and 2020 the correlation coefficients between the combined monthly total inundation area series and water level data derived from hydroweb and the bol gauge were 0 51 and 0 81 respectively with corresponding lag periods of four and two months the time lags are described in section 3 4 3 3 temporal lags the temporal relationships among the water level measured at the bol gauge the open surface water area and the total inundated water area were inspected using the correlation coefficients with different lag months as computed with eq 3 and shown in table 2 the total inundation areas derived with modis and meteosat thermal data lagged behind the water levels measured using in situ sensors and altimeter satellites by approximately two to three months similarly the optical satellite based open surface water areas obtained with modis and landsat optical bands were three months ahead of the total inundated water areas correlation coefficients were also computed for different time lags with eq 3 between the water level measured at the bol gauge the open surface water area and the total inundation area for the southern and northern parts derived with modis data from january 2000 to december 2012 table 3 the water level measurements at bol are at the same pace as the open surface water area in the south lake os while the open surface water area in the north lake on lags one month behind a one month lag can also be observed between os and on this lag is due to the replenishment of the south lake by water mainly sourced from the chari logone river water starts to flow into the north lake when the south lake reaches its maximum water area below the great barrier 278 3 m leading to a one month lag there was a three month lag in the total inundation area of the north lake relative to the water level measured at the bol gauge r 0 84 the open surface water areas and total inundation areas of the north lake demonstrated a one month lag r 0 70 during dry seasons there were no obvious correlations between the open surface water areas and total inundation areas of the south lake or between the total inundation areas of the south and north lakes 3 4 user interface based on google earth engine to better support government management and attract the attention of the general public the dataset has been packaged and designed as an interactive application fig 9 based on google earth engine gee with a webpage link https lihuan users earthengine app view lakechad the application consists of two panels landsat mosaic images obtained around january in specific years and yearly or monthly area variations shown by line charts and dynamic figures the online application can benefit nonexperts or the general public in several ways first the obvious changes in the water area in specific years can be interactively inspected through panning or zooming in out with 30 m 60 m landsat images such as the extents of the relatively large lake chad in 1973 the very small lake chad that existed in 1987 due to a severe drought the gradually recovered lake chad at the end of the 20th century and the more recent lake chad second the total inundation area the yearly mean during 1982 2020 in dry seasons and the open surface water area monthly 2000 2020 were visualized and can be downloaded by clicking the arrow at the top right of each figure and saved as tables or figures for scientific studies or exhibitions then by selecting a given year the monthly open surface water area variations can be shown as line charts and dynamic figures can be seen for the selected year moreover the area dataset will be updated once new remote sensing images are absorbed into gee 4 discussions 4 1 data gaps among different sources the water level measured with satellite altimetry was approximately 0 7 m higher than that measured by in situ observations fig 6 the open surface water area also had a higher correlation r 0 83 with in situ water level measurements than with the satellite altimetry data r 0 63 section 3 2 1 it may be caused by the accuracy of radar altimetry over a large water surface area 3 cm crétaux jelinski et al 2011 the footprint sizes of satellite radar altimetry that span several kilometers and the 60 km distance between the hydroweb measurement point and the bol gauge see fig 2 however the two datasets both catch the seasonal variations of the shallow lake chad well nevertheless in situ measurements are preferred due to their higher correlation with the surface water area although there was a considerable correlation coefficient r 0 79 between the modis visible bands and the landsat based open surface water area the mre was 22 showing a gap between the two datasets this gap was mainly caused by the different pixel sizes between the modis 500 m and landsat 30 m images an obvious example can be seen in fig 10 that the main difference with the mre reaches 48 comes from the widespread archipelago area in the north southwest and southeast which contains a lot of narrow waterways out of the modis resolution 500 m however modis captured the hydrological variations well due to the large area fluctuations of lake chad regarding the total inundation area meteosat and modis had better conformity r 0 85 mre 8 than meteosat and avhrr r 0 71 mre 17 this difference was caused by the spatial resolution temporal span or frequency of satellites of each product for example modis has the highest spatial resolution and avhrr had retrospective data with the longest time series to 1981 see table 1 while meteosat obtains 48 measurements per day for a given location thus providing a better thermal product göttsche and olesen 2003 therefore the three datasets were combined in this study as shown in section 2 4 4 2 growth cycle impact of aquatic vegetation usually seasonal variations in the water volume of a lake influence the distribution of aquatic vegetation and the growth cycle of plants also impacts the detected total inundation and open surface water areas however this may not be the situation for lake chad in fact hydrophytic plants dominate the inundated area of lake chad mainly rooted reeds including papyrus typha and phragmites with stands of helophytes in open waters lemoalle 2004 leblanc et al 2011 the main vegetation on the islands of lake chad archipelago results from phragmites with floating plants at the base of the reeds around the archipelago islands iltis and lemoalle 1983 generally from january to june the ndvi of lake chad is the lowest it then starts to increase to a peak around august and september followed by another sharp drop until january as shown in fig 11 however the ndvi value is always over 0 3 indicating perennial vegetation coverage due to the tropical climate of the lake chad region therefore the real impacts remain to be further investigated with in situ observations or ultrahigh resolution aerial photography 4 3 hydrological asynchrony process there were two kinds of hydrological asynchrony observed for the open water and total inundation areas of lake chad one type of hydrological asynchrony involved the total inundation area lagging behind the open surface water area by approximately three months as shown in table 2 table 3 also exhibits a 1 and 2 month lag in the total inundation area behind the open surface water area for the southern and northern parts respectively since the open water area is typically assumed to be the deepest part of the lake with the lowest altitude of the lake bottom in both the northern and southern basins this area is covered first by water when this area is covered by water the water level in the vegetated part of the lake rises this water level rise occurs after the open water area has been covered most of the macrophytes in the lake are rooted and developed on temporarily exposed sediments when the water level was very low only a portion of the vegetation is free floating the second type of hydrological asynchrony is the one month lag of the northern open water area to that of the southern basin and the three month lag between the total inundation area of the northern basin to the water level and total inundation area of the southern basin when the south lake reaches its peak open water area as measured using satellite altimeters and in situ measurements e g in years of moderate northern basin inundation the northern basin remains a marsh with a small clearly visible open water area since 1973 the annual chari flood first filled the southern basin due to the hydrologic functioning of the small lake when the southern basin is filled around the end of december the water level slightly increases before water flows into the large marsh between the two basins i e the great barrier and into the northern basin the water spreads out for over 150 km which is the length from the great barrier to the northern basin thereby inundating the almost dry sediments and progressing northwards this process takes time and the open surface water area of the northern basin reaches a peak around january while the inundation limit of the northern basin is reached by approximately february or march except for the analysis above soulsby et al 2006 found that small and mountainous catchments have short and steep flow paths thus with a fast hydrological response the large and flat catchment of lake chad makes it relatively slow moreover the infiltration of surface water into the groundwater aquifer in the great wetland region also contributes to the asynchronous pace of the hydrological process penna et al 2011 therefore as also discussed by nkiaka et al 2017 the temporal lags observed among the multiple hydrological measurements for the lake chad basin including catchment precipitation streamflow at the outlet open surface water and total inundation are generally caused by the flat terrain the large catchment size and the widespread wetland area with much rooted macrophytes 5 conclusions in this study the long term open surface water and total inundation areas of lake chad as well as its northern and southern basins were derived from different data sources at annual and monthly scales in situ measurements and intercomparison correlation coefficient computations were used to validate the good consistency calculated among multiple satellite derived water areas and in situ measurements this consistency was the basis for merging different data sources and forming a long term water area series the trend analysis shows that the total inundation area of lake chad has a sharp yearly oscillation despite the generally increasing trend of 145 km2 year from 1982 to 2020 two to three month temporal lags are presented between the open surface water area and total inundation area of the whole lake and a one to two month lag also exists for the southern and northern basins separately which can be attributed to the large area of macrophytes in the region the inundation of the northern basin lags behind that of the southern basin by one month due to the main river replenishment to the south the great barrier and the long distance between the northern and southern basins these lags can be further inspected at finer temporal scales and explored through hydrological models the lake area series dataset established in this study was produced from satellite observations without leveraging any hydrological models and thus can be used as an input or validation source for hydrological models and to obtain key parameters for lake volume derivations the yearly and monthly variations in the area of lake chad were also visualized and shared with a user interactive application based on gee this application is user friendly for non experts and the

3996,despite dissolved carbon c exports from continents being crucial in the connection between terrestrial atmospheric and oceanic c pools the relative contribution and process controls on dissolved organic doc and inorganic dic fluxes within river basins are not fully understood this paper presents an analysis of data from 843 sites worldwide from 45 web of science sci expanded ex isi indexed papers that report both the doc and dic contents and fluxes in conjunction with chemical elements such as si na and 13c abundance to investigate the likely origin pathways and fate of the dissolved c the reviewed papers also report on selected environmental factors e g map and mat mean annual precipitation and temperature respectively climate lu land use a basin surface area regarding dissolved c fluxes rivers transported on average 8 4 gt c yr 1 of dissolved c with 7 7 gt c yr 1 92 being dic and remaining 8 doc asia has the highest within river dissolved c transport 5 8 gt c yr 1 followed by europe 2 0 gt c yr 1 america 0 4 gt c yr 1 and africa 0 1 gt c yr 1 the dissolved c fluxes tend to increase with river water fluxes and contribution of interflow as seen in the tropical climate which results in the export of relatively fresh doc with low aromaticity in contrast the lower river water fluxes in sub tropical and temperate climates corresponds to high concentration of comparatively more decomposed doc which pointed to a high proportion of groundwater contribution to the water fluxes the results also imply that surface area and morphology of the river basins as well as land use has insignificant impact on dissolved c dynamics such quantitative results including on the important role of climate on the dynamics of dissolved c in river basins are helpful in improving predictions on the impact of climate change on the global c cycle new and innovative multidisciplinary research on the subject is called for keywords c erosion dissolved c global c cycle river water fluxes 1 introduction rivers transport enormous amounts of carbon c from the land to the ocean they are thus a key element in the connectivity between the terrestrial atmospheric and oceanic c pools of the global c cycle with important consequences on the regulation of climate soil and water quality and the overall ecological functioning despite that the amount quality and spatial patterns of riverine c fluxes are not very well understood land c can be exported in particulate such as particulate organic c poc and inorganic c pic and or dissolved forms such as dissolved organic c doc and inorganic c dic poc and doc originate from organic matter om eroded from soils or from aquatic plants the doc is a result of the decomposition of om while dic is derived from rock weathering the exported c varies chemically from easily decomposable to more stable compounds depending on sources and pathways lloret et al 2016 virtually all natural water contains some form of doc ranging from highly reactive freshly produced doc to low reactive recalcitrant doc that escaped remineralization for upwards of 6000 years druffel and williams 1992 therefore a thorough understanding of the riverine c fluxes and their controls is needed particularly to assess their responses to current and future climatic change and influence of anthropogenic activities previous studies have shown that approximately 1 pg c is exported each year from the land to the ocean with 65 of it being dissolved and 35 particulate sixty percent 60 of the dissolved c export is inorganic while 40 is organic probst et al 1994 these data correspond to 0 22 pg c yr 1 doc and 0 18 pg c yr 1 poc export while 0 43 and 0 17 pg c yr 1 are dic and pic export respectively nevertheless existing literature indicated the existence of large flux variations of these forms of riverine c meybeck 1982 ludwig et al 1996 huang et al 2012 regnier et al 2013 resulting in different impacts on climate aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems humid tropical and subtropical regions of the world are characterized by large c exports galy et al 2015 hilton 2017 with their rivers lying between 30 n and s latitudes transporting 62 of the global doc export to the ocean dai et al 2012 their estimated export rates of 2 1 and 3 3 t c km 2 yr 1 for doc and dic respectively are far above the respective global export averages of 1 4 and 2 6 t c km 2 yr 1 huang et al 2012 yet the controls of their exports and ratios between them are scarcely investigated worldwide results from the project named transport of carbon and minerals in major world rivers scope unep revealed that poc fluxes are a function of total suspended sediments while doc fluxes are linked to drainage intensity basin slope amount of soil c and c n ratio ludwig et al 1996 li et al 2017 indicated that while doc fluxes were primarily related to discharge r2 0 93 and soil organic c content r2 0 60 dic fluxes correlated to co2 consumption by rock weathering r2 0 66 and river discharge r2 0 63 while several studies estimated the types of c exported by rivers little is known about the global variations of the sources of the c specifically dissolved c the major sources of riverine organic c are either autochthonous doc produced by riverine biological activities or allochthonous c from detrital input aitkenhead peterson et al 2003 in the case of allochthonous sources the main driver of the organic c input into river systems is soil erosion during erosive rainfall events soil organic c is either intensively leached or eroded and transferred to aquatic ecosystems in dissolved and particulate forms during low water stages the doc input can also be completed by soil water infiltration the soil organic c soc pool which contains 1400 1500 gt of c is one of the major reservoirs of c schlesinger 1977 storing twice the quantity of c in vegetation therefore any change in soc abundance and composition has important effect on the global c cycle as well as soil ecosystems soc is essentially regulated by biological production and decay rate of organic compounds tian et al 2016 plant litter falling onto the soil surface is gradually decomposed through physical fragmentation faunal interactions mineralization and humus formation baudin et al 2007 overall these processes induce variations in concentration and isotopic composition of total soc in the soil profile the decomposition of litter and som induces a differential decrease of soc and nitrogen content in the soils carbon and nitrogen are not recycled at the same rate hence the c n ratios also vary throughout the soil profile the c n ratios are typically higher in the litter fall and lower in som due to humification yang et al 2010 selective degradation changes the stable c isotope ratios surface litter is more depleted in 13c than som lichtfouse et al 1995 which is progressively enriched with soil depth balesdent and mariotti 1996 amiotte suchet et al 1999 amiotte suchet et al 2007 therefore highlighting the variations of concentrations and isotopic compositions of soil c in solid and solute fractions could help to track the origin of organic c in rivers with respect to their hydrological stages in their study of a tropical river using c isotopes lloret et al 2016 indicated that doc derived essentially from both the lixiviation of the soil surface layers during floods and groundwater flow during low water levels furthermore doc is extensively reworked within rivers through biotic processes such as bacterial degradation as well as abiotic processes such as photo oxidation and co precipitate alongside inorganic minerals and salts albéric et al 2018 further indicated that doc transported in the amazon basin exhibited higher d13c doc values with a lower range in the upper than downstream reaches 28 0 to 34 6 which they attributed to increased proportion of fresh doc from floodplains and open lakes these authors also reported higher d13c doc values during low flows which they could not fully understood despite numerous studies on the c fluxes and the different forms from continents to the ocean little is known globally about the sources of this c its pathways and fate and the main associated controls several questions including the following largely remain unanswered does riverine doc originate from top soils deep soil horizons or from within stream production what are the likely dominant pathways from overland flow to the river systems is it groundwater flow or interflow how do sources and pathways vary from one climate to the other from one continent to the other several studies reported disparities in doc and dic exports under different climates topographic conditions land uses and water regimes hence there is no consensus yet on the impact of these factors although c transformations and interactions between different chemical and size fractions are important in influencing the chemistry and cycling of c in aquatic environments most studies focused on single c species preventing a comprehensive understanding of the c dynamics and export fluxes determining how the c dynamics vary as flowing water increases in volume from first order springs until they seep into the great rivers of the world is a central problem in riverine ecology moreover an improved understanding of the pathways of the exported c may allow a better understanding of the origin and overall dynamics of the exported c the existence of many studies across the world that reported data on doc and dic and on several water chemicals provides opportunities for comprehensive analyses of doc and dic fluxes and their pathways to draw a general understanding of the main controls of these dissolved c dynamics therefore the objective of the current study is to compile and analyze available studies on river doc and dic and associated chemicals to assess and quantify their dynamics at river basin level the information on δ13c together with water chemistry might allow to decipher the c dynamics in pursuit of these objectives the study compiled data from 843 sampling locations around the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study setup the study is based on data collected from available literature that reported on dissolved c exports to the ocean through major rivers around the world the literature search targeted to identify and collect c exports with specific focus on the dissolved forms and associated data on isotope 13c and water chemistry to inform on the sources pathways and quality of dissolved c from peer reviewed scientific articles published in web of science sci expanded ex isi indexed journals besides a number of topic related key words and terms such as soil carbon exports from river basins exports of carbon by river systems and dissolved carbon losses from landscapes were used to search for journal papers in google google scholar science direct springer link scopus and scifinder in order to be accepted for inclusion in the analysis the key criterion was that a paper had to report on the c content and the fluxes of the water exported by a river tied to a time scale the river name and location had to be stated as well the search yielded 48 research papers with 843 data points worldwide fig 1 most of the observations n 223 were in north america as reported by 14 papers this was followed by 169 observation points 10 papers in south america 148 14 papers in europe 136 4 papers in oceania 84 9 papers in africa and lastly 81 7 in asia nevertheless data from oceania were not considered in the analysis because 81 of the 84 observations came from papua new guinea data from the 48 papers were captured and used to build a database with information such as paper author s and year when paper was published title of paper locational details of river studied i e country continent latitude longitude and altitude characteristics of the river i e length river basin size average slope water temperature discharge and content in selected chemicals namely si silicate na sodium and 13c isotope environmental characteristics climatic data map and mat and major land uses and c discharge discharge rates of the different forms of c such as doc dic poc and pic 2 2 definitions of environmental factors and variables mean annual temperature mat c and precipitation map mm yr 1 are the long term 30 year average values for the basins of the studied rivers and they are captured mat and map as presented in the source papers the longitude long latitude lat and altitude z are for the observation points in the event mat and map are missing from source papers data are retrieved either using other research papers in the area or global databases see mutema et al 2015 length l km refers to the estimated length of the river from its source to the observation point i e outlet to the ocean or to another major river and q m3 s 1 its annual average discharge at the observation point both are as reported in the source papers the other factors such as river water temperature tw c and ph are also specific to the observation points used and as reported in the source papers the variables of interest are dissolved organic docc mg c l 1 and inorganic c dicc mg c l 1 and particulate organic c pocc mg c l 1 content within rivers docc and dicc are dissolved organic and inorganic carbon concentrations mg c l 1 respectively of water samples from specific observation points as reported in the source papers pocc is the corresponding concentration of particulate organic carbon mg c l 1 in the water samples therefore total organic c tocc mg c l 1 is computed as a sum of docc and pocc while total c tcc mg c l 1 includes dicc si na is ratio of silicon to sodium concentration as reported for the water samples analysed within river fluxes were computed as follow 1 do c f do c c q a 2 di c f di c c q a where docf and dicf g c s 1 km 2 are dissolved organic and inorganic carbon fluxes respectively docc and dicc g l 1 are the corresponding average dissolved organic and inorganic carbon concentrations q l s 1 is the average discharge of the river at the observation point and a km2 is the area discharge of the catchment draining at the observation point docf and dicf were finally expressed for main world regions in giga tons gt c yr 1 by extrapolating the data to the surface area of each region several land use types were considered and the major ones were forests natural and or tree plantations grasslands include natural veld and planted grasses and open savannahs wetlands mostly natural but also included cultivated wetlands such as paddy fields urban and croplands the most dominant land use in terms of fractional area covered was assigned to a river basin the climatic regions used in the current study polar temperate sub tropical and tropical were inspired by mutema et al 2015 and do not necessarily adhere to the köppen 1936 classification system these climatic regions are defined in table 2 where the polar to tropical region transition represents a general increase in air temperature and precipitation 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 estimation of the sources and pathways of dissolved c stable water and c isotopes have been used to determine the origin pathways and fate of organic substances in river systems mayorga et al 2007 trumbore and druffe 1995 isotopic tracers of hydrogen and oxygen are the most frequently used for estimating the sources of river waters lambs 2004 however the limited information on them in conjunction with river water c content calls for alternatives easy to access hydrochemical parameters such as anions and cations make it possible to compare the contributions of groundwater versus surface water in river basins si and na can reasonably be considered as conservative elements and show large concentration differences between water compartments mutema and chaplot 2018 chaplot and ribolzi 2014 gomi et al 2010 ladouche et al 2001 for example water derived from melted snow and ice and or overland flow which had low contact with soils and rocks exhibits low si and na concentrations as the duration of contact with rocks increases the chemical content of the water increases this explains groundwater enrichment in most cases in ca and na as a result of the alteration of plagioclase and interflow being si enriched the present study analysed the si and na content of the river waters as proxy for identifying the origin of the water transporting dissolved c in addition available data on 13c content of the dissolved c were considered to account the level of organic matter om aromaticity and thus its potential source and fate in general fresh om is depleted in 13c while the older and decomposed om is enriched due to selective preservation of plant lignin and lipids lichtfouse et al 1995 another important variation of 13c abundance in dissolved c depends on the type of plant where it originated from c3 vs c4 photosynthetic pathway which informs on the source of doc data for each sampling data point were confronted to types of climate such as for fig 7 and to 13c data fig 8 2 3 2 correlations between dissolved c content fluxes and main controls units for similar factors of control and variables of interest differed from paper to paper sometimes the units depicted the spatio temporal scales at which studies reported in the papers were carried out therefore the first step in the data analysis process was to normalize the data for each factor and or variable to the same unit the second step was an analysis for descriptive statistics such as mean median minimum maximum standard deviation and standard error of mean coefficient of variation kurtosis and skewness skewness and kurtosis were used to test normality of dataset distribution the mean values were tested for significance of differences using the t test the third step was an exploratory analysis of the main factors controlling the exports of dissolved c using correlation and principal component analysis pca correlation analyses tested strengths of one on one relationships between factors and variables the correlations were tested for statistical significance at p 0 05 the pca was used to evaluate multiple relationships between docc dicc q and si na on one hand and factors of control map mat z altitude and a river basin area on the other in general a pca converts factors and variables into their linear combinations jambu 1991 the last step was a more in depth analysis of the impacts of selected control factors on the variables using box plots each box plot shows the quartiles for the non outlier range data for each sampling data point were considered for computed the continental mean values displayed in table 3 or the worldwide mean values table 4 3 results 3 1 environmental setting table 1 introduces summary statistics for the selected studies worldwide the mean annual temperatures mat

corresponding mean annual precipitation map varied from 224 pakistan arain 1987 to 4341 mm yr 1 costa rica genereux et al 2013 with a mean of 1456 mm yr 1 cv 71 information on the river characteristics such as river length discharge water temperature and ph was generally scanty nevertheless the available data showed large variations in the case of river length cv 139 with smallest length being 4 for horonai river in japan shibata et al 2001 and longest 6290 km for the amazon peru colombia and brazil in south america river discharge varied even more cv 355 but water temperature 37 had low variation the doc content docc averaged 5 30 mg c l 1 with values from average 0 7 for some observations in puerto rico bhatt and mcdowell 2007 to 19 7 mg c l 1 in venezuela paolini et al 1987 the dic content dicc average was 14 85 mg c l 1 which was three times greater than docc poc content pocc varied from 0 5 mg c l 1 in japan shibata et al 2001 to 24 2 mg c l 1 in france némery et al 2013 with an average of 5 0 mg c l 1 the corresponding total organic c content tocc averaged 11 0 mg c l 1 the dicc varied between 0 6 for observations in the uk neal and hill 1994 and 64 4 mg c l

fluxes 3 2 1 differences between global regions fig 2 shows the variability of docc dicc and the respective docc dicc ratios across global regions asian rivers show the highest within river docc fig 2a with an average of 8 7 1 4 mg c l 1 table 3 the other regionsdo not appear to differ that much among themselves the european rivers are the second highest with a significantly lower average value of 4 63 1 10 mg c l 1 which is not significantly different from africa 4 2 1 1 mg c l 1 north 4 0 1 1 mg c l 1 and south america 3 9 1 3 mg c l 1 dicc shows a different trend fig 2b with european rivers showing the highest average value of 24 1 0 8 mg c l 1 table 3 which is not significantly different from the asian rivers 23 9 1 1 mg c l 1 the north american rivers have significantly lower dicc 14 0 1 1 mg c l 1 than the asian rivers but significantly higher than the south american rivers 12 0 0 9 mg c l 1 the african rivers have the least significant dic 8 8 1 0 mg c l 1 the corresponding docc dicc ratios are depicted in fig 2c table 3 also show that doc fluxes docf descended in the following order europe 0 5 g c s 1 km 2 asia 0 3 g c s 1 km 2 south america 0 1 g c s 1 km 2 north america 0 1 g c s 1 km 2 africa 0 04 g c s 1 km 2 dic fluxes dicf show a similar trend but with higher values than docf at 5 7 3 9 0 4 0 1 and 0 08 g c s 1 km 2 for europe asia south and north america respectively in terms of doc doce and dic exports dice asia has the highest values at 0 4 and 5 4 gt c yr 1 respectively followed by europe at much lower values 0 2 and 1 8 gt c yr 1 respectively the other continents have similar doce 0 04 0 05 and 0 06 gt c yr 1 for africa north and south america respectively however south america show much higher dice 0 2 gt c yr 1 than both north america 0 1 gt c yr 1 and africa 0 08 gt c yr 1 3 2 2 differences due to climate a comparison of docc and dicc in different climatic regions shows that docc tends to decrease from the cold polar region to the hot and wet tropical area fig 3 however docc does not differ significantly among the climatic regions at 5 3 1 1 4 3 1 4 4 8 1 1 and 3 6 1 5 mg c l 1 for polar temperate subtropical and tropical region respectively fig 3a dicc behaves differently with a general increase from the polar to temperate region followed by a decrease to the tropical through the subtropical region fig 3b the temperate region rivers show the most significant dicc 26 3 0 8 mg c l 1 followed by the subtropical 17 4 0 7 mg c l 1 polar 14 0 0 9 mg c l 1 and tropical region 10 7 1 2 mg c l 1 all the dicc regional average values are significantly different from each other the corresponding docc dicc ratios show a tendency to be higher in the polar region than the other regions the average ratios decrease in the order polar 1 5 subtropical 1 0 tropical 0 9 temperate region 0 3 3 2 3 land use land cover urban rivers appear to have the highest docc however wetlands show the highest variation of docc fig 4 a the two land uses are not significantly different with average values of 6 6 0 7 and 5 7 1 4 mg c l 1 for urban and wetlands respectively cropland rivers docc 4 3 1 7 mg c l 1 does not differ significantly from urban and wetlands but forest rivers are significantly lower 4 1 1 2 mg c l 1 nevertheless cropland and forest river docc are not significantly different it is also interesting to observe that grassland 3 6 0 9 mg c l 1 and savannah 3 7 0 7 mg c l 1 do not differ significantly with forest rivers but the savannah rivers show greater variation urban 22 5 0 5 mg c l 1 and cropland rivers 26 7 0 9 mg c l1 show much greater dicc than the other land uses with cropland being significantly greater fig 4b grassland rivers 19 9 1 0 mg c l 1 are significantly lower than urban areas but significantly greater than forest 11 0 0 8 mg c l 1 and savannah 11 6 0 7 mg c l 1 which is not significantly different wetlands had the least significant dicc 7 8 1 0 mg c l 1 the corresponding docc dicc ratios fig 4c show considerably higher values in wetlands 1 7 forests 1 2 and also grasslands 0 9 urban and savannah are similar 0 6 while croplands have the least average ratio 0 3 however wetlands and savannah show high variability in the ratios 3 2 4 basin area docc show a general tendency to increase with river basin area fig 5 a the docc increase from basin areas 1ess than 1 103 km2 3 2 1 4 mg c l 1 to 1 103 1 104 km2 3 9 0 9 mg c l 1 before declining slightly to 1 104 1 105 km2 3 0 1 1 mg c l 1 however these three are not significantly different basin areas 1 105 1 106 km2 6 3 1 4 mg c l 1 and 1 106 km2 5 8 1 4 mg c l 1 show significantly higher docc but are not significantly different between themselves dicc exhibits a different trend it tends to increase with basin area up to 1 104 1 105 km2 followed by a general decrease fig 5a the river dicc on the rising side are all significantly different at 12 3 1 1 16 7 0 8 and 18 6 0 7 mg c l 1 for 1 103 1 103 1 104 and 1 104 1 105 km2 respectively the other two basin sizes are not significantly different at 14 1 1 2 and 13 7 1 4 mg c l 1 for 1 105 1 106 and 1 106 km2 respectively which are not also not significantly different from basin area 1 103 km2 it is important to observe that dicc on the rising side are characterized by greater variability in comparison to the falling side the corresponding doc dic ratios exhibit a general decrease followed by a rise fig 5c the 1 105 1 106 km2 basin area show higher doc dic ratio variability than the rest of the basin sizes 3 2 5 other important factors that control within river doc and dic fluxes although many factors were initially considered a general lack of quantitative data meant many of them could not be accepted for the current analysis table 4 shows the correlations between the accepted factors and c related variables docc correlates positively with latitude and longitude r 0 27 and negatively with both mat 0 41 and map 0 29 on the other hand dicc correlates positively with latitude 0 39 and na 0 60 only and negatively with river basin area 0 25 map 0 34 q 0 43 sio2 0 33 and si na 0 71 the corresponding docc dicc correlates positively with basin area 0 32 map 0 31 q 0 28 and si na 0 50 but negatively with na 0 34 pocc tocc and tcc correlate positively with longitude and na however tcc also correlates negatively with map 0 29 q 0 33 and si na 0 42 docf and dicf correlate positively with map and q nevertheless docf correlates negatively with na 0 35 while dicf also correlates negatively with sio2 0 35 multiple correlations depicted by the pca fig 6 suggest that docc and dicc tend to simultaneously increase with a combination of mat and latitude and to decrease with increasing map in contrast q and si na tend to increase with map but tend to decrease with increasing mat and latitude the combined influence of river basin area and altitude on docc dicc q and si na appears to be very weak 3 3 potential sources of river dissolved carbon the si and na for rivers of the different climatic zones i e polar temperate sub tropical and tropical region are plotted on a simple si na plane fig 7 in order to help in identifying the potential sources of the river waters the data points from the polar region exhibit a low si and na content which is indicative of diluted waters pradeep et al 2016 the temperate region points are scattered over the si na plane however they are in two distinct groups one high in na and low in si and the other one low in na and high in si content the sub tropical region points are scattered over the whole si na plane while those for the tropical region are enriched in si compared to na analysis of the relationship between si na and δdoc shows that δdoc tends to decrease with increasing si na ratios from 27 9 at si na 50 to 31 8 at si na 200 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 dissolved c fluxes within rivers organic versus inorganic our current analysis revealed that riverine dissolved c fluxes are 8 4 gt c yr 1 this amount is about 76 of annual ges anthropogenic emissions which is considerable past data from a study by probst et al 1994 on the transport of c and minerals in major world rivers showed that approximately 0 65 gt c yr 1 of dissolved c were exported by world rivers from landscapes to the ocean other authors reported dissolved c fluxes ranging from 0 58 gt c yr 1 cai 2011 li et al 2017 0 60 gt c yr 1 meybeck 1982 to 0 9 gt c yr 1 degens et al 1991 therefore the current analysis estimated dissolved c fluxes within rivers are almost 12 times higher than estimated dissolved c exports to oceans one possible explanation for the big difference between current and past dissolved c fluxes is that much less dissolved c reaches the ocean than what the same rivers transport from upstream to downstream zones some of the dissolved organic matter decomposes and or adsorb to some chemical elements compounds and precipitate out of the within stream transport system e g chaplot and ribolzi 2014 these processes can cause significant losses of dissolved c between the upstream and downstream zones of a river system another possible explanation could be the enhanced impact of i elevated atmospheric co2 on rock weathering in the present study dic fluxes are 18 times higher than exports reported by probst et al 1994 and ii increased temperature and urbanisation on doc fluxes indeed the intensification of human activities which has contributed to increased atmospheric co2 and climate change have likely accelerated doc and dic exports through organic matter decomposition and rock weathering in recent decades our data also show that 92 of the 8 4 gt c yr 1 dissolved c fluxes estimated in the current analysis is inorganic c 7 7 gt c yr 1 while only and 8 is organic c 0 7 gt c yr 1 both estimates are significantly higher than 0 24 gt c yr 1 reported for doc ludwig et al 1996 and 0 41 huang et al 2012 and 0 38 gt c yr 1 meybeck 1982 for dic one possible explanation for the huge differences might be due to the different methodological approaches used to estimate the fluxes for instance meybeck 1982 estimated global dic fluxes 0 38 gt c yr 1 based on discharge data at exit of 60 i e 63 of global rivers the estimations were not based on data derived from river water samples they used average water temperature to obtain information regarding the dissolved c concentrations which they used together with discharge data to estimate the dissolved c fluxes ludwig et al 1996 used a similar methodology to estimate the global doc export of 0 21 gt c yr 1 on the basis of 29 major rivers the current study used data from 249 rivers worldwide with most of them not discharging directly into the ocean therefore most of the rivers used in the current study are tributaries and this might have affected the ratios between organic and inorganic c in general headwaters are likely to show greater dic concentration from rock weathering than fresh waters exiting continents which are generally characterised by low pco2 and thus dic carrying capacity 4 2 sources and quality of dissolved c the present study points to high concentration in si and low concentration in na in rivers from tropical climates which is indicative of the predominance of interflow water i e water moving laterally in soils within hillslopes in rivers tropical regions are characterised by high rainfalls through the whole year hence interflow into the rivers is always high which correlates with low proportion of inorganic c and fresh and low aromaticity dissolved organic matter albéric et al 2018 who used c isotopes in a tropical humid basin of the amazon suggested that although doc might have originated from soils there were strong chances that it also came from flooded forests and plankton in flooded lakes due to its depletion in 13c a study in a tropical river from the french west indies indicated that dic concentration was higher dry spells when water level was low lloret et al 2011 the dic concentration was lower during rainy seasons due to partial dilution by rainwater the same study suggested two possible sources of river dic the first one is respiration of plant roots and decay of soil organic matter som characterised by low δ13c while the other one characterised by high δ13c is atmospheric co2 input in contrast doc during low flows might be autochthonous to the rivers and derived from algal development because groundwater is generally depleted in doc therefore high doc concentrations during floods might come from mineral desorption and or solubilisation of som and its transfer into rivers via surface runoff and interflow results from the current study also point to relatively low docc in tropical rivers which suggests that these river flows are dominated by interflow interflow is characterised by depletion in doc as large amounts of the doc are adsorbed by clays and or sesquioxides within soils adsorption is a more efficient process of doc depletion than decomposition jardine et al 1989 polar region river water shows low si and na concentration which is indicative of an overland flow origin pradeep et al 2016 a study in chena river alaska revealed that most of the doc fluxes occurred during spring peak flows due to ice and snowmelt which drove high runoff from c rich soils cai et al 2008 the study also reported dic enrichment of winter water due to higher groundwater contribution groundwater contribution might explain the higher na content in polar than tropical region river observed in the current study pradeep et al 2016 high docc dicc ratios in polar regions might come from peatlands from boreal forest as shown for instance by elder et al 2000 the doc from polar rivers exhibits the lowest δ13c among the climates under study which is indicative of fresh organic matter dijkstra et al 2006 such organic matter originates not only from snowmelt events that flush elevated doc from surface soils but also from riverine primary production e g algal blooms in rivers during summer dijkstra et al 2006 the present study also points to significant impact of water fluxes dominant land use and river basin surface area on doc for example doc increases by 2 5 fold from river basin areas 1 million km2 to those 4 million km2 in a study of 109 rivers across the world li et al 2017 reported a significant increase of dissolved c fluxes as water fluxes increased which the present study confirms but with much lower correlation coefficients of 0 55 and 0 48 for docf and dicf respectively as compared to respectively 0 97 and 084 while li et al 2017 did not present data on dissolved c content the current study show that as water fluxes in river basins increase docc and dicc decrease which is indicative of a dilution effect as elaborated above drainage intensity slope sediment loads soil c content and c n ratio which are not considered in the current study also have significant impacts on riverine dissolved c fluxes li et al 2017 the impact of land use especially vegetation cover on dissolved c fluxes is intuitive for organic c for instance mchunu and chaplot 2012 showed that a decrease in grass basal cover in the process of grassland degradation increased doc in surface runoff from 3 8 to 7 2 g l 1 other studies reported higher doc contents under forest and tilled soils than no tilled croplands e g mchunu et al 2011 furthermore the anthropological impact on riverine dissolved c has been recognized for example raymond et al 2008 reported that dic has dramatically increased in the mississippi river during the last 70 years in response to the intensification of agriculture while rivers crossing urbanized areas have notoriously high docc the enormous amount of dissolved c transported by asian rivers as compared to other continental rivers is most probably a result of a combination of factors including high content of soc urbanisation and intensification of agriculture in the face of climate change 5 conclusions three main conclusions are drawn from this study involving 843 data points of dissolved c content and fluxes from 249 rivers worldwide the first conclusion is that most of the dissolved c transported by world rivers is inorganic 92 or 7 7 gt c yr 1 the organic form is a much smaller fraction 8 or 0 67 gt c yr 1 the asian rivers transport the highest amount 5 8 gt c yr 1 of dissolved c followed by europe 2 0 gt c yr 1 america 0 4 gt c yr 1 and africa 0 1 gt c yr 1 the second conclusion is that most of the tropical river water originates from interflow because the dissolved c in the rivers of this region is mostly young and of low aromaticity semi arid region river water is dominated by groundwater contribution because the dissolved c is more stable while the polar region rivers show a dominance of both groundwater and surface runoff the third conclusion is the tendency for dissolved organic c fluxes to dramatically increase with increase in river basin surface area supporting the notion that within stream c production by algae lixiviation of flooded soils and urbanised areas could be the most significant sources of dissolved organic and inorganic c fluxes the results of the study also suggest that areas that are getting warmer and wetter due to climate change are more likely to experience increased dissolved organic and inorganic c exports due to increased organic matter decomposition and rock weathering as already seen in the polar region where massive amounts of doc are released from peatlands in contrast drying areas will likely experience increased export of old and decomposed organic matter from the water table which is more likely to be stable during riverine transportation to the ocean more studies are still needed to confirm the trends observed by the study and their potential impact on the global c cycle and their retroactions to climate change there is finally a need for studies on c fluxes

3996,despite dissolved carbon c exports from continents being crucial in the connection between terrestrial atmospheric and oceanic c pools the relative contribution and process controls on dissolved organic doc and inorganic dic fluxes within river basins are not fully understood this paper presents an analysis of data from 843 sites worldwide from 45 web of science sci expanded ex isi indexed papers that report both the doc and dic contents and fluxes in conjunction with chemical elements such as si na and 13c abundance to investigate the likely origin pathways and fate of the dissolved c the reviewed papers also report on selected environmental factors e g map and mat mean annual precipitation and temperature respectively climate lu land use a basin surface area regarding dissolved c fluxes rivers transported on average 8 4 gt c yr 1 of dissolved c with 7 7 gt c yr 1 92 being dic and remaining 8 doc asia has the highest within river dissolved c transport 5 8 gt c yr 1 followed by europe 2 0 gt c yr 1 america 0 4 gt c yr 1 and africa 0 1 gt c yr 1 the dissolved c fluxes tend to increase with river water fluxes and contribution of interflow as seen in the tropical climate which results in the export of relatively fresh doc with low aromaticity in contrast the lower river water fluxes in sub tropical and temperate climates corresponds to high concentration of comparatively more decomposed doc which pointed to a high proportion of groundwater contribution to the water fluxes the results also imply that surface area and morphology of the river basins as well as land use has insignificant impact on dissolved c dynamics such quantitative results including on the important role of climate on the dynamics of dissolved c in river basins are helpful in improving predictions on the impact of climate change on the global c cycle new and innovative multidisciplinary research on the subject is called for keywords c erosion dissolved c global c cycle river water fluxes 1 introduction rivers transport enormous amounts of carbon c from the land to the ocean they are thus a key element in the connectivity between the terrestrial atmospheric and oceanic c pools of the global c cycle with important consequences on the regulation of climate soil and water quality and the overall ecological functioning despite that the amount quality and spatial patterns of riverine c fluxes are not very well understood land c can be exported in particulate such as particulate organic c poc and inorganic c pic and or dissolved forms such as dissolved organic c doc and inorganic c dic poc and doc originate from organic matter om eroded from soils or from aquatic plants the doc is a result of the decomposition of om while dic is derived from rock weathering the exported c varies chemically from easily decomposable to more stable compounds depending on sources and pathways lloret et al 2016 virtually all natural water contains some form of doc ranging from highly reactive freshly produced doc to low reactive recalcitrant doc that escaped remineralization for upwards of 6000 years druffel and williams 1992 therefore a thorough understanding of the riverine c fluxes and their controls is needed particularly to assess their responses to current and future climatic change and influence of anthropogenic activities previous studies have shown that approximately 1 pg c is exported each year from the land to the ocean with 65 of it being dissolved and 35 particulate sixty percent 60 of the dissolved c export is inorganic while 40 is organic probst et al 1994 these data correspond to 0 22 pg c yr 1 doc and 0 18 pg c yr 1 poc export while 0 43 and 0 17 pg c yr 1 are dic and pic export respectively nevertheless existing literature indicated the existence of large flux variations of these forms of riverine c meybeck 1982 ludwig et al 1996 huang et al 2012 regnier et al 2013 resulting in different impacts on climate aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems humid tropical and subtropical regions of the world are characterized by large c exports galy et al 2015 hilton 2017 with their rivers lying between 30 n and s latitudes transporting 62 of the global doc export to the ocean dai et al 2012 their estimated export rates of 2 1 and 3 3 t c km 2 yr 1 for doc and dic respectively are far above the respective global export averages of 1 4 and 2 6 t c km 2 yr 1 huang et al 2012 yet the controls of their exports and ratios between them are scarcely investigated worldwide results from the project named transport of carbon and minerals in major world rivers scope unep revealed that poc fluxes are a function of total suspended sediments while doc fluxes are linked to drainage intensity basin slope amount of soil c and c n ratio ludwig et al 1996 li et al 2017 indicated that while doc fluxes were primarily related to discharge r2 0 93 and soil organic c content r2 0 60 dic fluxes correlated to co2 consumption by rock weathering r2 0 66 and river discharge r2 0 63 while several studies estimated the types of c exported by rivers little is known about the global variations of the sources of the c specifically dissolved c the major sources of riverine organic c are either autochthonous doc produced by riverine biological activities or allochthonous c from detrital input aitkenhead peterson et al 2003 in the case of allochthonous sources the main driver of the organic c input into river systems is soil erosion during erosive rainfall events soil organic c is either intensively leached or eroded and transferred to aquatic ecosystems in dissolved and particulate forms during low water stages the doc input can also be completed by soil water infiltration the soil organic c soc pool which contains 1400 1500 gt of c is one of the major reservoirs of c schlesinger 1977 storing twice the quantity of c in vegetation therefore any change in soc abundance and composition has important effect on the global c cycle as well as soil ecosystems soc is essentially regulated by biological production and decay rate of organic compounds tian et al 2016 plant litter falling onto the soil surface is gradually decomposed through physical fragmentation faunal interactions mineralization and humus formation baudin et al 2007 overall these processes induce variations in concentration and isotopic composition of total soc in the soil profile the decomposition of litter and som induces a differential decrease of soc and nitrogen content in the soils carbon and nitrogen are not recycled at the same rate hence the c n ratios also vary throughout the soil profile the c n ratios are typically higher in the litter fall and lower in som due to humification yang et al 2010 selective degradation changes the stable c isotope ratios surface litter is more depleted in 13c than som lichtfouse et al 1995 which is progressively enriched with soil depth balesdent and mariotti 1996 amiotte suchet et al 1999 amiotte suchet et al 2007 therefore highlighting the variations of concentrations and isotopic compositions of soil c in solid and solute fractions could help to track the origin of organic c in rivers with respect to their hydrological stages in their study of a tropical river using c isotopes lloret et al 2016 indicated that doc derived essentially from both the lixiviation of the soil surface layers during floods and groundwater flow during low water levels furthermore doc is extensively reworked within rivers through biotic processes such as bacterial degradation as well as abiotic processes such as photo oxidation and co precipitate alongside inorganic minerals and salts albéric et al 2018 further indicated that doc transported in the amazon basin exhibited higher d13c doc values with a lower range in the upper than downstream reaches 28 0 to 34 6 which they attributed to increased proportion of fresh doc from floodplains and open lakes these authors also reported higher d13c doc values during low flows which they could not fully understood despite numerous studies on the c fluxes and the different forms from continents to the ocean little is known globally about the sources of this c its pathways and fate and the main associated controls several questions including the following largely remain unanswered does riverine doc originate from top soils deep soil horizons or from within stream production what are the likely dominant pathways from overland flow to the river systems is it groundwater flow or interflow how do sources and pathways vary from one climate to the other from one continent to the other several studies reported disparities in doc and dic exports under different climates topographic conditions land uses and water regimes hence there is no consensus yet on the impact of these factors although c transformations and interactions between different chemical and size fractions are important in influencing the chemistry and cycling of c in aquatic environments most studies focused on single c species preventing a comprehensive understanding of the c dynamics and export fluxes determining how the c dynamics vary as flowing water increases in volume from first order springs until they seep into the great rivers of the world is a central problem in riverine ecology moreover an improved understanding of the pathways of the exported c may allow a better understanding of the origin and overall dynamics of the exported c the existence of many studies across the world that reported data on doc and dic and on several water chemicals provides opportunities for comprehensive analyses of doc and dic fluxes and their pathways to draw a general understanding of the main controls of these dissolved c dynamics therefore the objective of the current study is to compile and analyze available studies on river doc and dic and associated chemicals to assess and quantify their dynamics at river basin level the information on δ13c together with water chemistry might allow to decipher the c dynamics in pursuit of these objectives the study compiled data from 843 sampling locations around the world 2 materials and methods 2 1 study setup the study is based on data collected from available literature that reported on dissolved c exports to the ocean through major rivers around the world the literature search targeted to identify and collect c exports with specific focus on the dissolved forms and associated data on isotope 13c and water chemistry to inform on the sources pathways and quality of dissolved c from peer reviewed scientific articles published in web of science sci expanded ex isi indexed journals besides a number of topic related key words and terms such as soil carbon exports from river basins exports of carbon by river systems and dissolved carbon losses from landscapes were used to search for journal papers in google google scholar science direct springer link scopus and scifinder in order to be accepted for inclusion in the analysis the key criterion was that a paper had to report on the c content and the fluxes of the water exported by a river tied to a time scale the river name and location had to be stated as well the search yielded 48 research papers with 843 data points worldwide fig 1 most of the observations n 223 were in north america as reported by 14 papers this was followed by 169 observation points 10 papers in south america 148 14 papers in europe 136 4 papers in oceania 84 9 papers in africa and lastly 81 7 in asia nevertheless data from oceania were not considered in the analysis because 81 of the 84 observations came from papua new guinea data from the 48 papers were captured and used to build a database with information such as paper author s and year when paper was published title of paper locational details of river studied i e country continent latitude longitude and altitude characteristics of the river i e length river basin size average slope water temperature discharge and content in selected chemicals namely si silicate na sodium and 13c isotope environmental characteristics climatic data map and mat and major land uses and c

the long term 30 year average values for the basins of the studied rivers and they are captured mat and map as presented in the source papers the longitude long latitude lat and altitude z are for the observation points in the event mat and map are missing from source papers data are retrieved either using other research papers in the area or global databases see mutema et al 2015 length l km refers to the estimated length of the river from its source to the observation point i e outlet to the ocean or to another major river and q m3 s 1 its annual average discharge at the observation point both are as reported in the source papers the other factors such as river water temperature tw c and ph are also specific to the observation points used and as reported in the source papers the variables of interest are dissolved organic docc mg c l 1 and inorganic c dicc mg c l 1 and particulate organic c pocc mg c l 1 content within rivers docc and dicc are dissolved organic and inorganic carbon concentrations mg c l 1 respectively of water samples from specific observation points as reported in the source papers pocc is the corresponding concentration of particulate organic carbon mg c l 1 in the water samples therefore total organic c tocc mg c l 1 is computed as a sum of docc and pocc while total c tcc mg c l 1 includes dicc si na is ratio of silicon to sodium concentration as reported for the water samples analysed within river fluxes were computed as follow 1 do c f do c c q a 2 di c f di c c q a where docf and dicf g c s 1 km 2 are dissolved organic and inorganic carbon fluxes respectively docc and dicc g l 1 are the corresponding average dissolved organic and inorganic carbon concentrations q l s 1 is the average discharge of the river at the observation point and a km2 is the area discharge of the catchment draining at the observation point docf and dicf were finally expressed for main world regions in giga tons gt c yr 1 by extrapolating the data to the surface area of each region several land use types were considered and the major ones were forests natural and or tree plantations grasslands include natural veld and planted grasses and open savannahs wetlands mostly natural but also included cultivated wetlands such as paddy fields urban and croplands the most dominant land use in terms of fractional area covered was assigned to a river basin the climatic regions used in the current study polar temperate sub tropical and tropical were inspired by mutema et al 2015 and do not necessarily adhere to the köppen 1936 classification system these climatic regions are defined in table 2 where the polar to tropical region transition represents a general increase in air temperature and precipitation 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 estimation of the sources and pathways of dissolved c stable water and c isotopes have been used to determine the origin pathways and fate of organic substances in river systems mayorga et al 2007 trumbore and druffe 1995 isotopic tracers of hydrogen and oxygen are the most frequently used for estimating the sources of river waters lambs 2004 however the limited information on them in conjunction with river water c content calls for alternatives easy to access hydrochemical parameters such as anions and cations make it possible to compare the contributions of groundwater versus surface water in river basins si and na can reasonably be considered as conservative elements and show large concentration differences between water compartments mutema and chaplot 2018 chaplot and ribolzi 2014 gomi et al 2010 ladouche et al 2001 for example water derived from melted snow and ice and or overland flow which had low contact with soils and rocks exhibits low si and na concentrations as the duration of contact with rocks increases the chemical content of the water increases this explains groundwater enrichment in most cases in ca and na as a result of the alteration of plagioclase and interflow being si enriched the present study analysed the si and na content of the river waters as proxy for identifying the origin of the water transporting dissolved c in addition available data on 13c content of the dissolved c were considered to account the level of organic matter om aromaticity and thus its potential source and fate in general fresh om is depleted in 13c while the older and decomposed om is enriched due to selective preservation of plant lignin and lipids lichtfouse et al 1995 another important variation of 13c abundance in dissolved c depends on the type of plant where it originated from c3 vs c4 photosynthetic pathway which informs on the source of doc data for each sampling data point were confronted to types of climate such as for fig 7 and to 13c data fig 8 2 3 2 correlations between dissolved c content fluxes and main controls units for similar factors of control and variables of interest differed from paper to paper sometimes the units depicted the spatio temporal scales at which studies reported in the papers were carried out therefore the first step in the data analysis process was to normalize the data for each factor and or variable to the same unit the second step was an analysis for descriptive statistics such as mean median minimum maximum standard deviation and standard error of mean coefficient of variation kurtosis and skewness skewness and kurtosis were used to test normality of dataset distribution the mean values were tested for significance of differences using the t test the third step was an exploratory analysis of the main factors controlling the exports of dissolved c using correlation and principal component analysis pca correlation analyses tested strengths of one on one relationships between factors and variables the correlations were tested for statistical significance at p 0 05 the pca was used to evaluate multiple relationships between docc dicc q and si na on one hand and factors of control map mat z altitude and a river basin area on the other in general a pca converts factors and variables into their linear combinations jambu 1991 the last step was a more in depth analysis of the impacts of selected control factors on the variables using box plots each box plot shows the quartiles for the non outlier range data for each sampling data point were considered for computed the continental mean values displayed in table 3 or the worldwide mean values table 4 3 results 3 1 environmental setting table 1 introduces summary statistics for the selected studies worldwide the mean annual temperatures mat

characteristics such as river length discharge water temperature and ph was generally scanty nevertheless the available data showed large variations in the case of river length cv 139 with smallest

differ significantly from urban and wetlands but forest rivers are significantly lower 4 1 1 2 mg c l 1 nevertheless cropland and forest river docc are not significantly different it is also interesting to observe that grassland 3 6 0 9 mg c l 1 and savannah 3 7 0 7 mg c l 1 do not differ significantly with forest rivers but the savannah rivers show greater variation urban 22 5 0 5 mg c l

urban areas but significantly greater than forest 11 0 0 8 mg c l 1 and savannah 11 6 0 7 mg c l 1 which is not significantly different wetlands had the least significant dicc 7 8 1 0 mg c l 1 the corresponding docc dicc ratios fig 4c show considerably higher values in wetlands 1 7 forests 1 2 and also grasslands 0 9 urban and savannah are similar 0 6 while croplands have the least average ratio 0 3 however wetlands and savannah show high variability in the ratios 3 2 4 basin area docc show a general tendency to increase with river basin area fig 5 a the docc increase from basin areas 1ess than 1 103 km2 3 2 1 4 mg c l 1 to 1 103 1 104 km2 3 9 0 9 mg c l 1 before declining slightly to 1 104 1 105 km2 3 0 1 1 mg c l 1 however these three are not significantly different basin areas 1 105 1 106 km2 6 3 1 4 mg c l 1 and 1 106 km2 5 8 1 4 mg c l 1 show significantly higher docc but are not significantly different between themselves dicc exhibits a different trend it tends to increase with basin area up to 1 104 1 105 km2 followed by a general decrease fig 5a the river dicc on the rising side are all significantly different at 12 3 1 1 16 7 0 8 and 18 6 0 7 mg c l 1 for 1 103 1 103 1 104 and 1 104 1 105 km2 respectively the other two basin sizes are not significantly different at 14 1 1 2 and 13 7 1 4 mg c l 1 for 1 105 1 106 and 1 106 km2 respectively which are not also not significantly different from basin area 1 103 km2 it is important to observe that dicc on the rising side are characterized by greater variability in comparison to the falling side the corresponding doc dic ratios exhibit a general decrease followed by a rise fig 5c the 1 105 1 106 km2 basin area show higher doc dic ratio variability than the rest of the basin sizes 3 2 5 other important factors that control within river doc and dic fluxes although many factors were initially considered a general lack of quantitative data meant many of them could not be accepted for the current analysis table 4 shows the correlations between the accepted factors and c related variables docc correlates positively with latitude and longitude r 0 27 and negatively with both mat 0 41 and map 0 29 on the other hand dicc correlates positively with latitude 0 39 and na 0 60 only and negatively with river basin area 0 25 map 0 34 q 0 43 sio2 0 33 and si na 0 71 the corresponding docc dicc correlates positively with basin area 0 32 map 0 31 q 0 28 and si na 0 50 but negatively with na 0 34 pocc tocc and tcc correlate positively with longitude and na however tcc also correlates negatively with map 0 29 q 0 33 and si na 0 42 docf and dicf correlate positively with map and q nevertheless docf correlates negatively with na 0 35 while dicf also correlates negatively with sio2 0 35 multiple correlations depicted by the pca fig 6 suggest that docc and dicc tend to simultaneously increase with a combination of mat and latitude and to decrease with increasing map in contrast q and si na tend to increase with map but tend to decrease with increasing mat and latitude the combined influence of river basin area and altitude on docc dicc q and si na appears to be very weak 3 3 potential sources of river dissolved carbon the si and na for rivers of the different climatic zones i e polar temperate sub tropical and tropical region are plotted on a simple si na plane fig 7 in order to help in identifying the potential sources of the river waters the data points from the polar region exhibit a low si and na content which is indicative of diluted waters pradeep et al 2016 the temperate region points are scattered over the si na plane however they are in two distinct groups one high in na and low in si and the other one low in na and high in si content the sub tropical region points are scattered over the whole si na plane while those for the tropical region are enriched in si compared to na analysis of the relationship between si na and δdoc shows that δdoc tends to decrease with increasing si na ratios from 27 9 at si na 50 to 31 8 at si na 200 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 dissolved c fluxes within rivers organic versus inorganic our current analysis revealed that riverine dissolved c fluxes are 8 4 gt c yr 1 this amount is about 76 of annual ges anthropogenic emissions which is considerable past data from a study by probst et al 1994 on the transport of c and minerals in major world rivers showed that approximately 0 65 gt c yr 1 of dissolved c were exported by world rivers from landscapes to the ocean other authors reported dissolved c fluxes ranging from 0 58 gt c yr 1 cai 2011 li et al 2017 0 60 gt c yr 1 meybeck 1982 to 0 9 gt c yr 1 degens et al 1991 therefore the current analysis estimated dissolved c fluxes within rivers are almost 12 times higher than estimated dissolved c exports to oceans one possible explanation for the big difference between current and past dissolved c fluxes is that much less dissolved c reaches the ocean than what the same rivers transport from upstream to downstream zones some of the dissolved organic matter decomposes and or adsorb to some chemical elements compounds and precipitate out of the within stream transport system e g chaplot and ribolzi 2014 these processes can cause significant losses of dissolved c between the upstream and downstream zones of a river system another possible explanation could be the enhanced impact of i elevated atmospheric co2 on rock weathering in the present study dic fluxes are 18 times higher than exports reported by probst et al 1994 and ii increased temperature and urbanisation on doc fluxes indeed the intensification of human activities which has contributed to increased atmospheric co2 and climate change have likely accelerated doc and dic exports through organic matter decomposition and rock weathering in recent decades our data also show that 92 of the 8 4 gt c yr 1 dissolved c fluxes estimated in the current analysis is inorganic c 7 7 gt c yr 1 while only and 8 is organic c 0 7 gt c yr 1 both estimates are significantly higher than 0 24 gt c yr 1 reported for doc ludwig et al 1996 and 0 41 huang et al 2012 and 0 38 gt c yr 1 meybeck 1982 for dic one possible explanation for the huge differences might be due to the different methodological approaches used to estimate the fluxes for instance meybeck 1982 estimated global dic fluxes 0 38 gt c yr 1 based on discharge data at exit of 60 i e 63 of global rivers the estimations were not based on data derived from river water samples they used average water temperature to obtain information regarding the dissolved c concentrations which they used together with discharge data to estimate the dissolved c fluxes ludwig et al 1996 used a similar methodology to estimate the global doc export of 0 21 gt c yr 1 on the basis of 29 major rivers the current study used data from 249 rivers worldwide with most of them not discharging directly into the ocean therefore most of the rivers used in the current study are tributaries and this might have affected the ratios between organic and inorganic c in general headwaters are likely to show greater dic concentration from rock weathering than fresh waters exiting continents which are generally characterised by low pco2 and thus dic carrying capacity 4 2 sources and quality of dissolved c the present study points to high concentration in si and low concentration in na in rivers from tropical climates which is indicative of the predominance of interflow water i e water moving laterally in soils within hillslopes in rivers tropical regions are characterised by high rainfalls through the whole year hence interflow into the rivers is always high which correlates with low proportion of inorganic c and fresh and low aromaticity dissolved organic matter albéric et al 2018 who used c isotopes in a tropical humid basin of the amazon suggested that although doc might have originated from soils there were strong chances that it also came from flooded forests and plankton in flooded lakes due to its depletion in 13c a study in a tropical river from the french west indies indicated that dic concentration was higher dry spells when water level was low lloret et al 2011 the dic concentration was lower during rainy seasons due to partial dilution by rainwater the same study suggested two possible sources of river dic the first one is respiration of plant roots and decay of soil organic matter som characterised by low δ13c while the other one characterised by high δ13c is atmospheric co2 input in contrast doc during low flows might be autochthonous to the rivers and derived from algal development because groundwater is generally depleted in doc therefore high doc concentrations during floods might come from mineral desorption and or solubilisation of som and its transfer into rivers via surface runoff and interflow results from the current study also point to relatively low docc in tropical rivers which suggests that these river flows are dominated by interflow interflow is characterised by depletion in doc as large amounts of the doc are adsorbed by clays and or sesquioxides within soils adsorption is a more efficient process of doc depletion than decomposition jardine et al 1989 polar region river water shows low si and na concentration which is indicative of an overland flow origin pradeep et al 2016 a study in chena river alaska revealed that most of the doc fluxes occurred during spring peak flows due to ice and snowmelt which drove high runoff from c rich soils cai et al 2008 the study also reported dic enrichment of winter water due to higher groundwater contribution groundwater contribution might explain the higher na content in polar than tropical region river observed in the current study pradeep et al 2016 high docc dicc ratios in polar regions might come from peatlands from boreal forest as shown for instance by elder et al 2000 the doc from polar rivers exhibits the lowest δ13c among the climates under study which is indicative of fresh organic matter dijkstra et al 2006 such organic matter originates not only from snowmelt events that flush elevated doc from surface soils but also from riverine primary production e g algal blooms in rivers during summer dijkstra et al 2006 the present study also points to significant impact of water fluxes dominant land use and river basin surface area on doc for example doc increases by 2 5 fold from river basin areas 1 million km2 to those 4 million km2 in a study of 109 rivers across the world li et al 2017 reported a significant increase of dissolved c fluxes as water fluxes increased which the present study confirms but with much lower correlation coefficients of 0 55 and 0 48 for docf and dicf respectively as compared to respectively 0 97 and 084 while li et al 2017 did not present data on dissolved c content the current study show that as water fluxes in river basins increase docc and dicc decrease which is indicative of a dilution effect as elaborated above drainage intensity slope sediment loads soil c content and c n ratio which are not considered in the current study also have significant impacts on riverine dissolved c fluxes li et al 2017 the impact of land use especially vegetation cover on dissolved c fluxes is intuitive for organic c for instance mchunu and chaplot 2012 showed that a decrease in grass basal cover in the process of grassland degradation increased doc in surface runoff from 3 8 to 7 2 g l 1 other studies reported higher doc contents under forest and tilled soils than no tilled croplands e g mchunu et al 2011 furthermore the anthropological impact on riverine dissolved c has been recognized for example raymond et al 2008 reported that dic has dramatically increased in the mississippi river during the last 70 years in response to the intensification of agriculture while rivers crossing urbanized areas have notoriously high docc the enormous amount of dissolved c transported by asian rivers as compared to other continental rivers is most probably a result of a combination of factors including high content of soc urbanisation and intensification of agriculture in the face of climate change 5 conclusions three main conclusions are drawn from this study involving 843 data points of dissolved c content and fluxes from 249 rivers worldwide the first conclusion is that most of the dissolved c transported by world rivers is inorganic 92 or 7 7 gt c yr 1 the organic form is a much smaller fraction 8 or 0 67 gt c yr 1 the asian rivers transport the highest amount 5 8 gt c yr 1 of dissolved c followed by europe 2 0 gt c yr 1 america 0 4 gt c yr 1 and africa 0 1 gt c yr 1 the second conclusion is that most of the tropical river water originates from interflow because the dissolved c in the rivers of this region is mostly young and of low aromaticity semi arid region river water is dominated by groundwater contribution because the dissolved c is more stable while the polar region rivers show a dominance of both groundwater and surface runoff the third conclusion is the tendency for dissolved organic c fluxes to dramatically increase with increase in river basin surface area supporting the notion that within stream c production by algae lixiviation of flooded soils and urbanised areas could be the most significant sources of dissolved organic and inorganic c fluxes the results of the study also suggest that areas that are getting warmer and wetter due to climate change are more likely to experience increased dissolved organic and inorganic c exports due to increased organic matter decomposition and rock weathering as already seen in the polar region where massive amounts of doc are released from peatlands in contrast drying areas will likely experience increased export of old and decomposed organic matter from the water table which is more likely to be stable during riverine transportation to the ocean more studies are still needed to confirm the trends observed by the study and their potential impact on the global c cycle and their retroactions to climate change there is finally a need for studies on c fluxes

3997,spatial downscaling has recently become a crucial process in the regional application of coarse resolution passive microwave surface soil moisture ssm products extensive gaps in auxiliary optical thermal infrared observation data mainly caused by cloud cover and gaps in coarse resolution passive microwave ssm data lead to spatiotemporal discontinuity in downscaled ssm maps thereby limiting their applications an improved downscaling method for the 25 km european space agency esa climate change initiative cci ssm product was proposed to obtain daily seamless downscaled ssm series at a 1 km scale the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra daily land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi products were used as auxiliary data for the downscaling process prior to the spatial downscaling an annual temperature cycle model was applied to the 1 km daily daytime lst data to fill the data gaps caused by cloud cover and to derive the spatial seamless lst gap filled subsequently the gap filled esa cci ssm was generated at the original resolution based on the relationships among the ssm lst and ndvi finally these were utilized to obtain a seamless downscaled series ssm at 1 km spatial resolution with a value consistent downscaling method the proposed method was applied to data obtained for the iberian peninsula from january 1 2016 to december 31 2018 based on the comparison with the precipitation dataset the downscaled ssm exhibited strong temporal correlation with rainfall events evaluation using the in situ ssm from the remedhus network highlighted the good performance of the downscaled ssm at network level with a correlation coefficient r of 0 820 the root mean square error unbiased root mean square error ubrmse and bias were 0 091 0 033 and 0 085 m3 m3 respectively a comparison with an alternative downscaled ssm product produced by the barcelona expert center one of the soil moisture and ocean salinity mission smos downscaled ssm datasets also indicated that the downscaled ssm has better spatiotemporal coverage and performance in terms of r and ubrmse with reference to the remedhus network these results confirmed that the proposed method is an efficient and convenient downscaling process that can be used to generate high resolution ssm data without spatiotemporal gaps the downscaled ssm data improves the accuracy of the original passive microwave ssm product in describing regional ssm variations and shows good potential for related applications at regional scale keywords surface soil moisture spatial downscaling annual temperature cycle esa cci modis 1 introduction surface soil moisture ssm at a depth of 0 5 cm plays an essential role in controlling the surface energy and water balances between the land surface and atmosphere piles et al 2016 sun et al 2019 under the background of climate change haile et al 2020 tabari 2020 yang and huang 2021 spatiotemporally continuous ssm data with a high spatial resolution 1 km are required to meet their increasing demand in regional applications such as the monitoring of extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods dai et al 2004

al 1997 scipal et al 2008 yeh et al 1984 and construction of land atmosphere models dirmeyer et al 2016 lievens et al 2016 owing to their good soil penetration ability and all day all weather operations microwave based observations from the sensors such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission microwave imager trmm owe et al 2008 advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003 amsr 2 parinussa et al 2015 soil moisture and ocean salinity mission smos kerr et al 2016 and soil moisture active passive mission smap entekhabi et al 2010a are widely used to generate global ssm maps for example the trmm amsr e and amsr 2 ssm products have a spatial resolution of 0 25 25 km and their temporal coverages are different at 1997 2015 2002 2011 and 2012 present respectively the amsr e provides ssm data in both the c band 6 9 ghz and x band 10 7 ghz whereas amsr 2 supplements the amsr e with an additional c band 7 3 ghz the smos and smap ssm products are derived from microwave observations in the l band 1 4 ghz with spatial resolutions of 25 and 36 km respectively although the l3 smos ssm is radio frequency interference rfi filtered al bitar et al 2017 rfis remain in the filtered ssm products stefan et al 2020 currently smos ssm and smap ssm are two of the most promising microwave ssm products although their data were first acquired in 2010 and 2015 respectively in conclusion these five microwave ssm products vary a lot in terms of temporal coverage in addition current ssm maps contain several orbital gaps as the revisit periods of these microwave sensors are usually 2 3 days consequently a single product cannot provide full spatial coverage at daily scale which is key for practical applications along with the products from individual sensors the european space agency esa has developed the climate change initiative cci ssm product at a depth of 1 10 cm by integrating active passive and combined microwave sensor observations the esa cci ssm product is a harmonized satellite observation based ssm product with a relatively good global coverage dorigo et al 2017 and spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 and one day respectively compared with the above mentioned five passive microwave ssm datasets the esa cci ssm exhibits the greatest potential in long term ssm records and provides the best spatial coverage dorigo et al 2017 dorigo et al 2015 however its poor spatial resolution limits its application at regional and local scales and hence spatial downscaling has attracted wide attention as a method to effectively improve the spatial resolution of coarse resolution microwave ssm products alemohammad et al 2018 montzka et al 2018 piles et al 2011 generally the downscaling methods would be classified into wen et al 2020 1 empirical model based methods 2 physical model based methods 3 data assimilation methods 4 spatial interpolation methods and 5 machine learning methods among the various downscaling methods land surface temperature lst and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are widely used because of their strong connections with ssm piles et al 2011 portal et al 2018a ray et al 2010 however both variables can be easily contaminated by cloud cover resulting in gaps in daily observations especially in lst maps the relatively low variability of ndvi enables the generation of composite cloud free images from the observations of a certain period in contrast because of its high temporal variability associated with the rapid changes in the surface thermal properties and atmospheric forcing environment the lst observations obtained on different days within a relatively short period do not accurately reflect the thermal conditions of the land surface for a specific day consequently the poor spatiotemporal continuity of daily lst data results in gaps in the downscaling results thereby hindering the regional application of high resolution ssm data obtained from the downscaling process based on optical lst data to obtain high resolution ssm products that are not affected by cloud cover there are increasing downscaling studies using spatiotemporally seamless auxiliary data long et al 2019 proposed a machine learning based downscaling method for generating spatially complete and daily continuous ssm data using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis esa cci and china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas data which yielded good results the estarfm model was used to fill the gaps in the modis lst product using the cldas lst data however the reconstruction was not successful when a large portion was covered by clouds greater than15 as the reconstruction is not independent and relies on the cldas lst data based on above framework abowarda et al 2021 tried to get spatiotemporally continuous ssm at 30 m 30 m by integrating multisource data song et al 2019 also proposed a downscaling scheme for cloud covered regions based on geographically weighted regression gwr and indicated that the use of a spatial interpolation method for the generation of reference cloud free lst data and the existence of invalid retrievals partly affect the accuracy and spatial continuity of the downscaling results meanwhile many lst reconstruction methods have been developed to fill cloud contaminated pixels in daily lst maps the spatiotemporal interpolation method is commonly used because of its ability to characterize spatial and or temporal variations of the lst kilibarda et al 2014 metz et al 2017 militino et al 2019 yang et al 2019 this method uses available lst values to determine the mechanism of lst variation at different temporal and spatial scales subsequently this mechanism is applied to predict the lst values under cloudy conditions the annual temperature cycle atc is a common model that is used to describe the temporal variation in the lst at the annual scale bechtel 2015 this model expresses temporal variations of lst as a series of harmonic functions and it has been applied in many research fields such as urban heat islands fu and weng 2018 huang et al 2016 climatology bechtel 2015 ding and elmore 2015 and soil temperature monitoring huang et al 2014 zhan et al 2014 because of its ability to capture annual temperature variations compared with other lst reconstruction methods based on data fusion models such as the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 spatial temporal adaptive algorithm for mapping reflectance change staarch hilker et al 2009 enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm long et al 2020 zhu et al 2010 reanalysis data and thermal infrared remote sensing data merging rtm method zhang et al 2021b and machine learning model zhao and duan 2020 gap free lst results can be easily and quickly obtained with a reliable accuracy using the spatiotemporal interpolation method based on the implementation of these lst reconstruction methods seamless lst maps can be generated which are essential for the downscaling process to derive fine resolution ssm products with spatiotemporal continuity in addition to the impacts from the auxiliary data missing data in the coarse resolution passive microwave ssm due to different causes such as the rfi or vegetation topography effects further worsen the spatial continuity of the downscaled ssm maps hence it is essential to develop an effective method to retrieve spatiotemporally continuous downscaled ssm data without the influence from cloud cover in downscaling auxiliary data and data gaps in original passive microwave ssm product therefore the objective of this study was to propose and evaluate an approach to generate a fine resolution ssm product without spatiotemporal gaps the atc model was first applied to generate seamless lst based on the daily modis lst product then the daily seamless lst and 16 day modis ndvi were used as auxiliary data to generate a 25 km seamless ssm by eliminating empty areas in the esa cci ssm maps combined product finally the 25 km seamless esa cci ssm was downscaled with the daily seamless lst and 16 day modis ndvi data to the 1 km scale using a value consistent downscaling scheme the performance of the downscaled results was evaluated using a meteorological dataset from the european climate assessment dataset eca d project and in situ ssm observations available from the soil moisture measurement stations network of the university of salamanca remedhus in spain additionally an intercomparison analysis was conducted with the 1 km ssm product of the smos barcelona expert center portal et al 2018b to assess the reliability of the downscaled ssm 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the iberian peninsula light gray rectangle in fig 1 a region characterized by multiple climatic and topographic conditions the study area covers 8 5 13 5 latitude 35

and the european continent pyrenees mountains to the northeast the landforms in the study area are diverse including plateaus mountains and lowlands primarily in the western and southwestern parts the peninsula is influenced by the cold temperature prevailing over the atlantic ocean and warm temperatures over the mediterranean sea and sahara desert fonseca et al 2016 the southeast of this area has a semi arid climate the central part has a mediterranean continental climate and the northwest part is relatively humid because it is mainly located in a maritime climate zone parinussa et al 2014 built up areas are mainly distributed in the central and coastal regions most of the iberian peninsula is covered by crops grass and shrubland forest cover is widespread in the north and west of the iberian peninsula that is in areas with heavy rainfall with respect to the soil types https www isric org the northern part is mostly covered by cambisols whereas luvisols are distributed in the

the soil moisture cci project is a part of esa s program on global monitoring of essential climate variables ecv which was initiated in 2010 and produces an updated ssm product annually since 1978 dorigo et al 2017 the esa cci ssm product has contributed to many hydrological and climatological studies worldwide ikonen et al 2018 kim et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the esa cci ssm series contains three separate ssm datasets which are derived from active and passive microwave remote missions as well as a combination of both the esa cci ssm product version 04 7 gruber et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 integrates observations derived from 11 microwave sensors including active sensors such as european remote sensing satellite 1 2 ers 1 2 and advanced scatterometer a b ascat a b and passive sensors such as scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i trmm microwave imager tmi amsr e windsat smos and amsr2 these products have a spatial resolution of 0 25 25 km and a temporal resolution of one day the ssm datasets are available in different observation spaces because of their different observation frequencies observation principles and retrieval techniques the daily esa cci ssm was rescaled to a common climatology scanlon et al 2020 as follows 1 rescaling of all passive microwave ssm observations except for amsr 2 to the climatology of amsr e 2 rescaling of all active microwave ssm observations to the climatology of ascat and 3 separate rescaling of all active and passive microwave datasets to the climatology of gldas noah noah land surface model of the global land data assimilation system version 2 1 which is available since 2000 the eidgenössische technische hochschule zürich eth provided an independent validation service to the esa cci ssm and indicated that the esa cci sm products have stronger correlation with in situ measurements within the depth of 0 to 5 cm than with those corresponding to a depth of 10 cm https www esa soilmoisture cci org validation in this study the combined esa cci ssm product version 04 7 was used as the coarse resolution passive microwave ssm dataset because of its better spatial coverage than that of the active or passive dataset taken separately hereafter the term the esa cci ssm refers to the combined esa cci ssm product for the study area a total of 1096 esa cci ssm images were available for the study period of january 1 2016 to december 31 2018 during this period the data coverage for the northwestern coastal area was 90 whereas for the eastern areas was only approximately 50 overall the data coverage of the study area during the study period was 60 in addition for some areas within the study region the esa cci ssm values were unavailable for some days because of snow coverage temperatures below 273 k dense vegetation or failed ssm estimates that were removed based on quality flags therefore the development of a convenient and effective methodology to estimate high resolution ssm data without spatiotemporal gaps is important and productive 2 2 2 modis land surface data modis products provide improved tools for moderate resolution land surface monitoring justice et al 1998 modis products with spatial resolutions of 250 m 500 m and 1 km are widely applied for long term global observations in land ocean and atmosphere research hu et al 2010 im et al 2016 vermote et al 2002 zhang et al 2003 we selected the daily modis lst mod11a1 daytime version 6 and 16 day modis ndvi mod13a2 version 6 both with a 1 km spatial resolution as auxiliary data for the proposed downscaling scheme considering their good connections with the ssm based on the lst vi triangle space theory carlson 2007 mallick et al 2009 sandholt et al 2002 zhao et al 2017 wen et al 2020 showed that the daytime lst mod11a2 and 16 day modis ndvi performed well in downscaling the 36 km smap ssm the pixel temperature value of the mod11a1 product was derived from the mod11 l2 swath product the mod11 l2 lst product was obtained using the generalized split window lst algorithm wan and dozier 1996 the 16 day modis ndvi product was a composite product that was highly close to being cloud free by integrating the best available pixel value low clouds low view angle and highest ndvi value from 16 different acquisitions therefore this product was appropriate for ssm downscaling considering its marginal temporal variation in terms of vegetation within a 16 day period in contrast the multi day composite product cannot fully represent regional thermal and water conditions at the daily level because of the strong daily variability of lst therefore the mod11a1 daily lst product was selected for this study although it is greatly affected by cloud cover especially in the rainy season both the mod11a1 and mod13a2 are freely accessible via the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earthdata search website https search earthdata nasa gov

dorigo et al 2013 moreover because the esa cci ssm data include multiple data from different remote sensors the daily product is not based on a single observation time therefore the daily average of the in situ ssm was calculated from the hourly measurements hereafter in situ ssm refers to daily average ssm of remedhus stations in addition to the remarkable seasonal variations in ssm at most stations the moisture conditions of these stations also show big spatial variations the high variabilities in the in situ measurements of this network pose a big challenge while downscaling the coarse resolution esa cci ssm product to represent the sub pixel ssm changes therefore this network is an ideal choice for assessing the efficiency of the proposed downscaling method 2 2 4 eca daily precipitation dataset the variations in ssm correlate with the precipitation events the daily precipitation dataset from the eca d project https www ecad eu which contains a series of daily observations obtained at meteorological stations throughout europe and the mediterranean countries was used to evaluate the downscaled ssm the considered eca d dataset comprised 195 daily precipitation series observed at meteorological stations in europe and the middle east klein tank et al 2002 for this study we selected 12 stations spread across the study area with various land cover types according to the modis land cover product and elevations the detailed description of these 12 stations is listed in table 1 including the station codes used in this work station name from the metadata of eca d latitude longitude elevation and land cover type the locations of these 12 stations are shown in fig 1 green triangles as shown in table 1 there are two forest stations tg and th five cropland stations tc tf ti tk and tl two herbaceous vegetation stations ta and tb two shrubland stations te and tj and one urban station td the elevations of the stations range from 7 to 2451 m 2 2 5 1 km smos bec ssm to better assess the performance of the downscaled ssm the daily 1 km smos barcelona expert center bec ssm of the regional level 4 ssm version 5 0 produced by the smos bec was also collected for comparison the 1 km smos bec ssm was downscaled from the 25 km smos ssm based on the synergetic use of the esa smos l1c brightness temperature lst and ndvi pablos et al 2017 piles et al 2011 piles et al 2014 portal et al 2018a the 1 km smos bec ssm product includes two datasets corresponding to ascending and descending orbits more information about this product can be found at http bec icm csic es land datasets according to the evaluation study conducted by pablos et al 2020 at different in situ measurements the ssm dataset of the ascending orbit performs slightly better than that of the descending orbit in terms of correlation coefficient and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse therefore the daily 1 km smos bec ssm acquired on the ascending orbit was selected for the comparison 3 methodology 3 1 flowchart of the downscaling process the downscaling process consists of three steps fig 2 the atc model was first applied to the modis daily lst product to obtain a seamless lst product without cloud cover pixels then the gaps in the 25 km esa cci ssm maps were filled using neighboring information local linear regression finally the ssm downscaling method was used to downscale the 25 km filled esa cci ssm seamless esa cci ssm to 1 km spatial resolution using the daily seamless lst and ndvi data 3 2 seamless lst reconstruction usually lst exhibits a strong annual seasonality which can be described by a series of harmonic functions bechtel 2015 the atc model is an example of such a function due to its ability to capture annual temperature variations and it can be expressed as follows 1 lst atc d a 0 i 1 n b i sin 2 π d 365 2 i 1 c i where d is the day of the year doy d 1 2 365 366 a 0 is the annual mean lst and bi and ci are the amplitude and phase shift of the ith sine function i 1 2 n respectively generally n is the key parameter of the atc model which partly determines the accuracy of the atc model to capture the time dependent characteristics of lst the parameters a 0 bi and c i can be fitted using eq 1 based on the modis lsts in one year lstmod d and the specific n value subsequently the lst value on a cloudy day lstatc d can be generated with the fitted model and then used to generate the seamless lst image for this day with clear sky observations this process can be achieved in four steps step 1 determination of parameter n in eq 1 let n be 1 2 3 4 or 5 then fit the model coefficients a0 bi and ci with the available modis lsts that is lstmod d d 1 2 365 366 the days with null values caused by cloud cover or high uncertainty estimation error larger than 2 k were not entered into the fitting process subsequently lstatc d was estimated according to the fitted model the correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse between lstmod d and lstatc d were determined the r value is minimal and rmse is maximal when n equals 1 when n equals 2 r and rmse increase and decrease respectively whereas r and rmse only slightly change when n is greater than 2 n 3 4 or 5 therefore to establish a tradeoff between calculation accuracy and efficiency the n value was set to 2 step 2 calculation of lstatc d based on the parameter n obtained in step 1 the model coefficients a0 b1 c1 b2 and c2 and lstatc d were estimated using lstmod d however when the number of days for lstmod d without cloud cover in one year is 100 the calculation of lstatc d stops to avoid a weak atc fitting step 3 elimination of lstmod d outliers when the fitting rmse between lstmod d and lstatc d was lower than 2 k we considered the lstatc d to be reliable and the atc model fitting was stopped the lst values for the days with lst marked as null value were filled with the estimated lstatc d when the fitting accuracy rmse did not meet the requirements rmse 2 k the outlier was identified first according to residual lstatc d lstmod d when rmse greater than 2 k it was excluded from the fitting process this filtering rule is based on the assumption that the outlier was considered as the day with extremely low temperature compared to adjacent days which was highly affected by the thin cloud cover surrounding the cloud pixels step 4 calculation of the lstatc d using an iterative process when the atc model fitting did not stop in step 3 steps 2 3 and 4 were repeated the maximum iteration number was set to ten to achieve a balance between the calculation efficiency and the accuracy of the lstatc d when the atc model did not stop in step 3 in the tenth iteration the lst values for the days on which lstmod d equaled the null value were filled with lstatc d and the atc model fitting was stopped as shown in fig 3 the spatial filling percentage lstatc filled pixels number all pixels number 100 in the seamless lst maps significantly changed with the time scale a higher percentage was mainly observed in winter greater influence of cloud cover the average percentage for the study period is 43 54 indicating that the cloud cover has a significant effect on optical remote sensing data which supports the need for the atc based reconstruction conducted in this study the clear sky lst pixels from the original modis lst maps are preserved in the final filled lst maps seamless lst maps only the empty pixels primarily caused by cloud cover or poor quality were filled with the atc model fitted lst values lstatc in addition the fitting results for 2016 show that the r values range from 0 9 to 1 with an average of 0 98 and the rmse values range from 1 2 to 2 0 k with an average of 1 78 k therefore the fitting accuracy of the atc model is acceptable based on this method the annual variations in the lst can be accurately depicted and thus the clear sky lst on cloudy days can be predicted 3 3 seamless esa cci ssm generation before downscaling the esa cci ssm data were reconstructed to obtain seamless coarse ssm maps for the esa cci cells with empty ssm values an estimation model based on local linear regression was established linking the surrounding esa cci cells with available values and independent variables the upscaled seamless lst and upscaled modis ndvi at a coarse resolution the calibrated regression model was then used for the upscaled seamless lst and upscaled modis ndvi to predict ssm values for the empty esa cci ssm pixels the regression model can be expressed as follows 2 s s m l a b l l c n l re where subscript l indicates low spatial resolution 25 km and ssm l l l n l and re are the esa cci ssm upscaled seamless lst upscaled modis ndvi and regression residual in the local window respectively the parameters a b and c are regression coefficients a self adaptive window was applied to determine the best window size based on the performance of the regression model the self adaptive window consists of four neighborhoods with different radii from four to seven pixels for each local window size eq 2 was implemented and the average value of the residuals in the window was calculated when the average residual reached the minimum value the corresponding local regression coefficients a b and c were determined and the estimated value was used as a surrogate of the empty value however in some cases the central cell had many empty cells around it and therefore the self adaptive regression could not be conducted in such cases a global regression was applied using all the cells in the study area to fit eq 2 and get the global regression coefficients then these coefficients were used to estimate the ssm value of this empty cell 3 4 seamless esa cci ssm downscaling based on the self adaptive window the selected downscaling approach has been successfully tested with a 36 km smap ssm product in previous research wen et al 2020 similarly the downscaling approach was applied here to derive the 1 km downscaled ssm pixels from the 25 km esa cci ssm cell this downscaling approach includes two procedures 1 estimation of the 1 km regression ssm ssm hr and coarse resolution residual re l with geographically weighted regression gwr and 2 downscaling of the coarse resolution residual to 1 km spatial resolution re h with the area to point kriging atpk method therefore the final downscaled ssm ssm h can be expressed as follows 3 ss m h s s m hr r e h where the subscript h represents the high spatial resolution 1 km and the subscript hr represents the 1 km result from gwr the ssm h ssm hr and re h are the final downscaled ssm 1 km 1 km regression ssm after gwr implementation and downscaled regression residuals from atpk respectively the gwr and atpk methods ensure the value consistency between the esa cci ssm value from a 25 km cell and the average value of all downscaled 1 km pixels within the 25 km cell in addition the self adaptive window strategy is utilized for the above two procedures so that consistency can be more easily achieved and the uncertainty in the downscaling process is minimized 3 4 1 seamless esa cci ssm downscaling with gwr the gwr was constructed using a 25 km spatial scale and the regression coefficients and the 1 km lst and 1 km ndvi were used to predict the ssm hr the gwr is expressed as follows 4 ss m l i a i b i l l i c i n l i r e l i where the subscripts l and i indicate a low spatial resolution 25 km and the ith 25 km esa cci cell respectively the ssmi l li l ni l and rei l are the ssm value upscaled seamless lst upscaled modis ndvi and regression residual for the ith 25 km esa cci cell the parameters ai bi and ci are the regression coefficients estimated from eq 5 using a self adaptive window as follows 5 β i x t w i x 1 x t w i y w ij 1 d ij λ 2 2 where the superscript i indicates the ith 25 km esa cci cell cell i and superscript ij represents the jth esa cci cell in the self adaptive window of cell i the parameter βi is the regression coefficient matrix ai bi and ci and x t and y are the independent variable matrix seamless lst and modis ndvi and dependent variable matrix seamless esa cci ssm values in the self adaptive window respectively the parameter w i is the weighting matrix composed of wij indicating the weight of the esa cci cells within the self adaptive window and λ is the window radius which changes from four to seven pixels the weight wij is partly determined by the euclidean distance dij between each cell j and the central cell i the window size was automatically determined according to the regression performance of eq 4 where rei c is minimized for 1 km pixel m with in the coarse resolution grid i its soil moisture ss m hr m can be estimated as below 6 ss m hr m a i b i l h m c i n h m where lm h and nm h represent lst and ndvi of this pixel respectively 3 4 2 residual correction with atpk the regression residual rei l was downscaled with atpk as follows 7 r e h m j 1 n α ij r e l ij s t j 1 n α ij 1 where superscript ij represents the jth esa cci cell in the self adaptive window of cell i superscript m represents the mth 1 km subpixel located in cell i and n is the number of cells in the self adaptive window of cell i the self adaptive window contains a weight value αij for each cell representing its contribution to the rem h calculation the parameter αij was extracted using the following equation 8 γ ll 1 1 γ ll 1 n 1 γ ll g j γ ll n 1 γ ll n n 1 1 1 0 α i 1 α ij α in θ γ hl m 1 γ hl m j γ hl m n 1 where γll g j is the semivariance of the gth and jth cells in the self adaptive window γhl m j is the semivariance between the mth 1 km subpixel located in cell i in the esa cci map and jth cell in the self adaptive window and θ is the lagrange multiplier the parameter γ is a function of the distance between two locations which can be simulated based on the residual re l map of the 25 km regression wang et al 2016 3 5 evaluation strategy the precipitation dataset from meteorological stations and the in situ ssm measurements from remedhus were used to evaluate the performance of the downscaled ssm qualitatively and quantitatively the temporal series of the downscaled ssm and precipitation data from the 12 selected meteorological stations table 2 were analyzed the downscaled ssm was compared with the in situ ssm in the evaluation area as shown in fig 1 at the network and station levels moreover the downscaled ssm was also compared with the 1 km smos bec ssm with respect to their descriptions of the spatial and temporal patterns of ssm over the study area a cumulative distribution function cdf matching method was also applied for comparison and for the reduction of the effects of systematic bias between the two 1 km ssm products 3 5 1 evaluation metrics and level several commonly used metrics were adopted entekhabi et al 2010b oozeer et al 2020 including r eq 9 rmse eq 10 ubrmse eq 11 and mean difference bias eq 12 to assess the accuracy of the downscaled ssm as follows 9 r cov ssm h ssm i v a r ssm h v a r ssm i 10 rmse e ssm h ssm i 2 11 u b rmse e ssm h e ssm h ssm i e ssm i 2 12 bias e ssm h e ssm i where ssm h and ssm i represent the 1 km downscaled ssm and in situ ssm respectively cov and var are the covariance and variance respectively and e is the average the evaluation was performed at both the network and station levels in the evaluation area as shown in fig 1 to reflect the footprint differences between satellite observations downscaled ssm and point observations in situ ssm at network level the average value of all remedhus stations was used as the regional value and it was compared with the averages of the downscaled ssm and esa cci ssm in the same region evaluation area at station level the ssm of each individual remedhus station were compared with the downscaled ssm and esa cci ssm values extracted for each location at each evaluation level the downscaled ssm temporal series was classified into two groups one for the days when all ssm values were available and another for days when there were gaps moreover to further assess the downscaled ssm its network validation results were compared with the performance of the 1 km smos bec ssm during the study period the detailed validation strategy is listed in table 2 3 5 2 cdf matching method the direct comparison between the ssm grid and in situ ssm at different spatial scales would bring misleading uncertainties including biases or systematic differences to the evaluation results due to spatial scale differences brocca et al 2011 to reduce this impact the cdf matching method which has been widely used in ssm evaluation researches dorigo et al 2015 gumuzzio et al 2016 kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 wang et al 2018 was utilized to minimize the influences from the biases and systematic differences of the downscaled 1 km ssm product and the 1 km smos bec ssm product as regard of the in situ ssm in this study the cdf matching method made the cumulative distribution of the downscaled ssm product to match that of esa cci ssm product thus the systematic bias caused by the original coarse resolution product can be largely eliminated the cdf is defined for a continuous function as follows the sum of all the values is less than or equal to a and the probability of occurrence is f a p x a where p indicates the probability function in this study the downscaled ssm was fitted to the in situ ssm using the cdf matching method the downscaled ssm corrected by cdf matching downscaled ssm cdf is denoted as ssm h cdf as follows 13 f i ssm h c d f f h ssm h where f i and f h are the cdfs for the in situ and downscaled ssm respectively which is fitted using a polynomial with a degree of 5 and ssm h is the original downscaled ssm value 4 results 4 1 visual interpretation of the seamless downscaled ssm to make a contrast fig 4 a shows the coarse resolution series of the daily esa cci ssm maps at 25 km resolution and fig 4b shows the generated downscaled ssm maps at 1 km resolution for the period from october 17 to 31 2016 15 days in order to highlight the contrast effect between the esa cci ssm and the downscaled ssm we set the color of the gap pixels nodata pixels to white in fig 4a and b light blue for open sea from the visual inspection the spatial distributions of the downscaled ssm are consistent with those of the esa cci ssm this visual effect undoubtedly shows that our proposed method achieved the innovation of the research for its seamless downscaling the original ssm spatial pattern was also preserved after the downscaling the differences between the downscaled ssm aggregated to the 25 km cells and the original esa cci ssm were approximately 0 m3 m3 in most cells not only the spatial information was improved but the temporal variability of the original coarse resolution ssm maps was also preserved as shown in fig 4 c and d the downscaled ssm values at station tl present a rapid change in ssm associated with rainfall events before the occurrences of rainfall on oct 21 23 ssm shows a decreasing trend however a rapid increase happens after these rainfall events then the moisture condition generally becomes drier when there is no further rainfall although fig 4d only shows the temporal change in ssm and precipitation at one single 1 km cell the corresponding 25 km cell containing the station shown in fig 4c also presents a similar pattern this variation pattern confirmed well the reliability of the downscaled ssm in depicting the influence from rainfall on ssm 4 2 evaluation using in situ measurements at network level 4 2 1 network level evaluation on days with original esa cci ssm values the in situ ssm downscaled ssm and original esa cci ssm during the study period were assessed according to the validation strategy shown in table 2 table 3 details the resulting statistical metrics of the esa cci ssm and downscaled ssm compared to the in situ ssm at network level the statistical metrics of both ssm products were similar the rmse values of the esa cci and the downscaled ssm was 0 095 and 0 093 m3 m3 respectively after removing the bias the calculated ubrmses were 0 029 and 0 030 m3 m3 respectively indicating that both the downscaled ssm and original esa cci ssm correlate well with the in situ ssm similarly strong correlations can be observed for the downscaled ssm r 0 852 and esa cci ssm r 0 853 wet biases can also be observed for the downscaled ssm bias 0 088 m3 m3 which were inherited from the original esa cci ssm bias 0 091 m3 m3 fig 5 this overestimation was also reported by gonzález zamora et al 2019 to present the temporal changes of three ssm datasets at network level fig 5 shows the time series of the extracted esa cci ssm downscaled ssm and station average in situ ssm the downscaled ssm and the esa cci ssm exhibited the same temporal trend which is consistent with that of the in situ ssm in winter and spring the moisture condition is generally wetter whereas soil wetness is relatively dry in summer and autumn however the downscaled ssm has a systematic wet bias same overestimation as observed for the esa cci ssm 4 2 2 network level evaluation on days without esa cci ssm data similarly the downscaled ssm values acquired from days with data gaps in the esa cci cells were compared with the station average in situ ssm values at network level in the study area for the study period fig 1 gaps were observed on 196 days as shown in table 3 the r value between the downscaled and in situ ssms was 0 720 whereas the rmse ubrmse and bias were 0 088 m3 m3 0 039 m3 m3 and 0 078 m3 m3 respectively the r was slightly worse than that for days with the esa cci ssm values 0 852 m3 m3 this is because that the original esa cci ssm data is not available on these days at the evaluation area and the downscaled ssm mainly depend on the contribution of neighboring pixels meanwhile too many missing areas without esa cci ssm data resulted in poor accuracy of the seamless esa cci ssm and the downscaled ssm comparatively the bias value was slightly better than that for days with the esa cci ssm values however there was still overestimated in the downscaled results although the rmse value decreased due to the decrease of bias while the ubrmse was larger than the downscaled results with esa cci ssm data despite the relatively poor performance under the condition without esa cci ssm the downscaled ssm shows an acceptable accuracy and presents significant correlation with in situ observations 4 3 evaluation using field observations at station level 4 3 1 station level evaluation for days with esa cci ssm data as shown in table 4 the averages of the statistical metrics show that the performance of the evaluation at station level is similar to that at network level but slightly weaker the average statistical metrics for the downscaled ssm were 0 733 r 0 118 m3 m3 rmse 0 047 m3 m3 ubrmse and 0 088 m3 m3 bias whereas those of the esa cci ssm were 0 739 r 0 118 m3 m3 rmse 0 046 m3 m3 ubrmse and 0 091 m3 m3 bias the slight differences may be neglected at this level and indicated that both the downscaled ssm and the original ssm capture well the temporal dynamics of ssm measured by in situ measurements during the three years the r values of all stations were higher than 0 6 except for stations k13 and l3 both for the downscaled ssm and the esa cci ssm similarly the ubrmse of the downscaled ssm was 0 05 m3 m3 in 17 out of the 20 stations which was similar to that of the esa cci ssm the statistical metrics of station k13 were the worst because this station is located in an irrigated plot leading to higher and fluctuating ssm values however the correlations at all stations for both the downscaled ssm and esa cci ssm were significant at the 99 confident level positive biases were detected for most stations for both the downscaled ssm and esa cci ssm in 17 out of the 20 stations because the original esa cci ssm overestimates the ground values 4 3 2 station level evaluation on days without esa cci ssm data the downscaled ssm on days when the esa cci ssm was unavailable were compared with the in situ ssm table 5 displays the comparison results at the station scale from january 1 2016 to december 31 2018 in average the r rmse ubrmse and bias were 0 604 0 115 0 054 and 0 077 m3 m3 respectively only two stations had r values below 0 5 compared with the evaluation on days with esa cci ssm values at station level the general performance of the downscaled ssm was slightly worse but the downscaled ssm still showed significant correlations with the in situ measurements 4 4 comparison with the 1 km smos bec ssm product 4 4 1 comparison on spatial basis the 1 km smos bec ssm product was used together with the in situ observations to evaluate the downscaled results as shown in fig 6 the ssm maps of the downscaled ssm and 1 km smos bec ssm on january 22 april 22 july 22 and october 22 2016 were selected to represent winter spring summer and autumn respectively compared to the 1 km smos bec ssm fig 6e h for each date the downscaled ssm fig 6a d exhibited better spatial coverage the gaps in the 1 km smos bec ssm maps are primarily due to the orbital gaps of the smos satellite on the contrary the integration from the observation from different sensors of the esa cci ssm product results advantageous for the spatial coverage together with the enhancement of the spatial coverage after the seamless downscaling 4 4 2 comparison on temporal basis to further demonstrate the advantage of the spatial coverage in the downscaled maps fig 7 a shows the time series of the downscaled ssm 1 km smos bec ssm and in situ ssm during the study period the differences in fig 7a confirmed the overestimation of the downscaled ssm and the underestimation of the 1 km smos bec ssm however the temporal variations of both the downscaled ssm and 1 km smos bec ssm were consistent with that of the in situ ssm compared with the downscaled ssm and in situ ssm the 1 km smos bec ssm yielded systematically lower ssm values reaching extremely low values in the summer season to better visualize the differences between the time series of the three datasets the downscaled ssm and 1 km smos ssm were both scaled up by applying cdf matching based on the in situ ssm at network level in fig 7b the time series of the downscaled ssm and 1 km smos ssm after cdf matching denoted as downscaled ssm cdf and 1 km smos ssm cdf are plotted against the in situ ssm fig 7b shows that the downscaled ssm cdf and 1 km smos ssm cdf are closer to the curve of the in situ ssm compared with fig 7a hence both 1 km ssm products captured the variations in the ssm when the systematic biases primarily due to original flaws of the coarse resolution ssm were largely eliminated comparatively the downscaled ssm cdf had fewer values with high underestimation than the 1 km smos ssm cdf as it was remarkable in 2016 fig 7b therefore this comparison further confirms the reliability of the downscaling method proposed in this study 4 4 3 validated by in situ ssm measurements for further comparison the two 1 km ssm data were validated with the in situ ssm measurements from the remedhus network at network level as illustrated in table 6 the correlation between the downscaled ssm with the averaged in situ measurements is stronger r 0 820 than that of the 1 km smos bec ssm r 0 786 although the absolute bias and rmse of the downscaled ssm are higher than those of the smos bec ssm data the ubrmse of the downscaled ssm is lower than that of the 1 km smos bec ssm with a difference of 0 016 m3 m3 5 discussion in this study a spatial downscaling method is proposed to produce a seamless ssm series with a high spatial resolution of 1 km first the atc model was used to fill gaps caused by cloud cover in the modis daily lst terra daytime and to derive seamless lst images then the esa cci ssm was filled and downscaled to obtain the seamless esa cci ssm and seamless downscaled ssm respectively the downscaled results were evaluated by the in situ measurements from the remedhus network at different spatial scales and the evaluation confirmed the relatively good performance of the downscaling approach meanwhile a comparison with another downscaled ssm product smos bec ssm in the study area with a similar spatial resolution also proved that the seamless downscaled ssm can be used to characterize the spatiotemporal variations in the iberian peninsula based on the downscaled daily values fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the annual average downscaled ssm for years 2016 to 2018 the spatial distribution pattern of each annual average map for the three years were consistent the spatial pattern of the ssm in the iberian peninsula is primarily driven by the continental climate therefore the ssm is low in the central part of the study area and is high in the northern and northwestern parts atlantic climate zone such spatial variations in the ssm in the iberian peninsula have also been reported in previous studies montzka et al 2018 piles et al 2019 portal et al 2018a sánchez et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in addition the annual average of 2017 is lower than that of the other two years this result agrees with the serious drought occurred in 2017 considered as the second driest year and the warmest one since 1965 according the spanish meteorological agency http www aemet es es noticias 2018 01 resumen climatico 2017 to highlight the temporal patterns the downscaled ssm series obtained at 12 meteorological stations were extracted for the study period and made comparison with the precipitation recorded by each station fig 9 shows the time series of ssm at each station together with the corresponding precipitation in the iberian peninsula the low ssm values were generally observed in dry season from july to september whereas the rainy season from november to january usually has high ssm condition de luis et al 2010 except for stations ta and tb the ssm values of all stations exhibited significant seasonal variations as indicated by brocca et al 2014 ssm shares an obvious and strong physical connection with rainfall and the temporal variation of the downscaled ssm also presented good temporal consistency with the occurrence of rainfall events therefore it is obvious that high precipitation usually led to good moisture condition in winter whereas low precipitation corresponded with dry condition in summer in most stations meanwhile this temporal change pattern also follows the rule for exact rainfall event that ssm shows a sudden increase followed by a smooth recession limb driven by evapotranspiration and drainage after a rainfall pulse ciabatta et al 2018 crow et al 2011 porporato et al 2004 the framed period within the red rectangle in fig 9 clearly indicate this pattern similar as the study conducted by zhao et al 2018 and long et al 2019 the comparison of the downscaled ssm with precipitation observed at different stations with different elevations and land cover types revealed a good temporal representation of the downscaled ssm in different regions in addition to the abovementioned aspects fig 10 a and b show the esa cci sm and the downscaled ssm in remedhus obtained on the fifth of each month in 2016 to figure out the advantage of the spatial downscaling in presenting the spatial variability within the coarse resolution cell obviously the intention of most downscaling methods is to generate high resolution ssm data to represent the real sub pixel spatial variability merlin et al 2015 peng et al 2017 to present this effect fig 10c shows the maximum and minimum values of the esa cci ssm and the downscaled ssm in the network from january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 the downscaled ssm greatly enlarged the regional differences in ssm and provided more detailed soil moisture information than the esa cci ssm because of the increase of the spatial heterogeneity the downscaled ssm presented high variability than the coarse resolution esa cci ssm data although the two data capture well the temporal variability the smoothing effect of the esa cci ssm slightly increase its average performance when compared with the in situ measurements at station level as shown in table 4 although the downscaling method proposed herein yields a seamless downscaled ssm series with high accuracy there are still some shortcomings should be considered further the first issue should be connected with the generation of seamless lst data as indicated by zhao et al 2019 lst is jointly affected by a variety of factors such as land cover type vegetation coverage ssm soil texture topographic factors and meteorological conditions only two downscaling factors were used during the downscaling process lst and ndvi and hence their interpretation for ssm is particularly important therefore the performance of downscaling is highly dependent on the accuracy of lst in this study the cloud covered lst values were reconstructed with the atc model to represent the clear sky lst according to the feature of the atc model although we have integrated two sine components in this model to consider the variability of lst at semiannual time scale the daily temperature variations caused by synoptic conditions cannot be quantitatively depicted in current level the enhanced atc model proposed by zou et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 increased its ability to describe the daily lst fluctuations and it would be helpful to provide more accurate lst values in addition some lst reconstruction methods proposed in recent years also provided alternatives to generate lst reconstructions with lower uncertainty long et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b zhao and duan 2020 and there is a successful application in estimating daily evapotranspiration with spatial completeness zhang et al 2021a another issue should be referred to the validation as indicated by colliander et al 2017 the lack of in situ data is a common problem in the evaluation of remote sensing ssm products previous studies have tried a lot to effectively evaluate remote sensed ssm gonzalez zamora et al 2016 jackson et al 2012 portal et al 2020 sanchez et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a in this study due to the lack of dense in situ observation network with different land cover conditions the remedhus network was the only choice to perform direct validation in this study however this network covers only a small part of the iberian peninsula with the key land cover type of cropland consequently the specific topographic climatic and land cover conditions in this network cannot represents the study area with different land conditions a more solid validation with the use of observations from stations with different land cover properties would be helpful to enhance the assessment of the proposed method moreover the evaluation study conducted in this work was mainly focus on the comparisons of the temporal variabilities of different ssm data at different scales the spatial heterogeneity of the downscaled ssm at a certain time was not evaluated because of the inherent scarcity of high resolution ssm datasets from in situ measurements some upscaling studies provided good alternatives to get high spatiotemporal resolution soil moisture data kang et al 2021 van der velde et al 2021 6 conclusions a new downscaling approach for the derivation of spatiotemporally seamless and high resolution 1 km downscaled ssm at a daily scale was presented in this study first the influence of the cloud cover in daily modis lst maps was eliminated using the atc model the daily seamless lst clear sky lst was estimated yielding a mean r and rmse of 0 98 and 1 78 k respectively based on the daily lst and 16 day modis ndvi the coarse resolution esa cci ssm was used to generate seamless esa cci ssm maps different from most previous downscaling research this study used seamless downscaling factors the daily lst and 16 day modis ndvi finally the seamless esa cci ssm maps were downscaled to 1 km using a downscaling model and combining the downscaling factors which has not been paid attention to in previous studies a systematic evaluation of the downscaled ssm data was conducted using in situ observations from the remedhus network at network level the evaluation of the downscaled ssm on days with esa cci ssm values yielded r rmse ubrmse and bias values of 0 852 0 093 m3 m3 0 030 m3 m3 and 0 088 m3 m3 respectively the remarkable wet bias in the downscaled ssm is primarily due to the original esa cci ssm bias 0 091 m3 m3 as reported in previous studies the evaluation results on days with data ssm gaps indicated that the accuracy of the downscaled ssm is acceptable with r rmse ubrmse and bias values of 0 720 0 088 m3 m3 0 039 m3 m3 and 0 078 m3 m3 respectively meanwhile a similar evaluation was conducted at station level the downscaled ssm data also showed good correlation with the in situ ssm measurements at each station on days with valid ssm values in the esa cells with average r rmse ubrmse and bias values of 0 711 0 118 m3 m3 0 049 m3 m3 and 0 086 m3 m3 respectively although the evaluation results on days with data ssm gaps were slightly worse the average r rmse ubrmse and bias values of all the stations were 0 604 0115 m3 m3 0 054 m3 m3 and 0 077 m3 m3 respectively the r values obtained for most stations 18 stations out of 20 were higher than 0 5 and most ubrmses ranged between 0 04 m3 m3 and 0 06 m3 m3 these results revealed that the downscaling method has a relatively good downscaling accuracy while generating the seamless soil moisture data furthermore the comparison with the 1 km smos bec ssm product indicated that the downscaled ssm has an excellent spatial coverage and good temporal consistency and thus it can be used to depict the temporal evolution of ssm especially after cdf matching therefore the spatiotemporally seamless ssm data generation in this study will play a key role in weather prediction and climate change at regional scale the validation with in situ measurements indicated that the downscaled ssm had a better performance in terms of ubrmse and r in addition the downscaled ssm also presented high sensitivity to rainfall events according to the correlation analysis with precipitation data from 12 meteorological stations widely distributed in the iberian peninsula overall the proposed method presents good potential to produce a high resolution ssm product continuous in space and time which has big demands in related fields like weather prediction climate change etc at the same time this study can potentially be applied to a variety of microwave ssm products with coarse spatial resolution providing a way for achieving the large scale production of ssm with medium or high spatial resolution future studies will consider the application of the proposed method to other areas and possible enhancements such as a more robust lst reconstruction and further consideration of other impact factors like topography in the downscaling also a more systematic validation process against in situ measurements representing different landscapes and climates is needed to foster its adoption in a wider range of application domains credit authorship contribution statement wei zhao conceptualization methodology writing original draft resources supervision

3997,spatial downscaling has recently become a crucial process in the regional application of coarse resolution passive microwave surface soil moisture ssm products extensive gaps in auxiliary optical thermal infrared observation data mainly caused by cloud cover and gaps in coarse resolution passive microwave ssm data lead to spatiotemporal discontinuity in downscaled ssm maps thereby limiting their applications an improved downscaling method for the 25 km european space agency esa climate change initiative cci ssm product was proposed to obtain daily seamless downscaled ssm series at a 1 km scale the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis terra daily land surface temperature lst and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi products were used as auxiliary data for the downscaling process prior to the spatial downscaling an annual temperature cycle model was applied to the 1 km daily daytime lst data to fill the data gaps caused by cloud cover and to derive the spatial seamless lst gap filled subsequently the gap filled esa cci ssm was generated at the original resolution based on the relationships among the ssm lst and ndvi finally these were utilized to obtain a seamless downscaled series ssm at 1 km spatial resolution with a value consistent downscaling method the proposed method was applied to data obtained for the iberian peninsula from january 1 2016 to december 31 2018 based on the comparison with the precipitation dataset the downscaled ssm exhibited strong temporal correlation with rainfall events evaluation using the in situ ssm from the remedhus network highlighted the good performance of the downscaled ssm at network level with a correlation coefficient r of 0 820 the root mean square error unbiased root mean square error ubrmse and bias were 0 091 0 033 and 0 085 m3 m3 respectively a comparison with an alternative downscaled ssm product produced by the barcelona expert center one of the soil moisture and ocean salinity mission smos downscaled ssm datasets also indicated that the downscaled ssm has better spatiotemporal coverage and performance in terms of r and ubrmse with reference to the remedhus network these results confirmed that the proposed method is an efficient and convenient downscaling process that can be used to generate high resolution ssm data without spatiotemporal gaps the downscaled ssm data improves the accuracy of the original passive microwave ssm product in describing regional ssm variations and shows good potential for related applications at regional scale keywords surface soil moisture spatial downscaling annual temperature cycle esa cci modis 1 introduction surface soil moisture ssm at a depth of 0 5 cm plays an essential role in controlling the surface energy and water balances between the land surface and atmosphere piles et al 2016 sun et al 2019 under the background of climate change haile et al 2020 tabari 2020 yang and huang 2021 spatiotemporally continuous ssm data with a high spatial resolution 1 km are required to meet their increasing demand in regional applications such as the monitoring of extreme climatic events such as droughts and floods dai et al 2004

al 1997 scipal et al 2008 yeh et al 1984 and construction of land atmosphere models dirmeyer et al 2016 lievens et al 2016 owing to their good soil penetration ability and all day all weather operations microwave based observations from the sensors such as the tropical rainfall measuring mission microwave imager trmm owe et al 2008 advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003 amsr 2 parinussa et al 2015 soil moisture and ocean salinity mission smos kerr et al 2016 and soil moisture active passive mission smap entekhabi et al 2010a are widely used to generate global ssm maps for example the trmm amsr e and amsr 2 ssm products have a spatial resolution of 0 25 25 km and their temporal coverages are different at 1997 2015 2002 2011 and 2012 present respectively the amsr e provides ssm data in both the c band 6 9 ghz and x band 10 7 ghz whereas amsr 2 supplements the amsr e with an additional c band 7 3 ghz the smos and smap ssm products are derived from microwave observations in the l band 1 4 ghz with spatial resolutions of 25 and 36 km respectively although the l3 smos ssm is radio frequency interference rfi filtered al bitar et al 2017 rfis remain in the filtered ssm products stefan et al 2020 currently smos ssm and smap ssm are two of the most promising microwave ssm products although their data were first acquired in 2010 and 2015 respectively in conclusion these five microwave ssm products vary a lot in terms of temporal coverage in addition current ssm maps contain several orbital gaps as the revisit periods of these microwave sensors are usually 2 3 days consequently a single product cannot provide full spatial coverage at daily scale which is key for practical applications along with the products from individual sensors the european space agency esa has developed the climate change initiative cci ssm product at a depth of 1 10 cm by integrating active passive and combined microwave sensor observations the esa cci ssm product is a harmonized satellite observation based ssm product with a relatively good global coverage dorigo et al 2017 and spatial and temporal resolutions of 0 25 and one day respectively compared with the above mentioned five passive microwave ssm datasets the esa cci ssm exhibits the greatest potential in long term ssm records and provides the best spatial coverage dorigo et al 2017 dorigo et al 2015 however its poor spatial resolution limits its application at regional and local scales and hence spatial downscaling has attracted wide attention as a method to effectively improve the spatial resolution of coarse resolution microwave ssm products alemohammad et al 2018 montzka et al 2018 piles et al 2011 generally the downscaling methods would be classified into wen et al 2020 1 empirical model based methods 2 physical model based methods 3 data assimilation methods 4 spatial interpolation methods and 5 machine learning methods among the various downscaling methods land surface temperature lst and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are widely used because of their strong connections with ssm piles et al 2011 portal et al 2018a ray et al 2010 however both variables can be easily contaminated by cloud cover resulting in gaps in daily observations especially in lst maps the relatively low variability of ndvi enables the generation of composite cloud free images from the observations of a certain period in contrast because of its high temporal variability associated with the rapid changes in the surface thermal properties and atmospheric forcing environment the lst observations obtained on different days within a relatively short period do not accurately reflect the thermal conditions of the land surface for a specific day consequently the poor spatiotemporal continuity of daily lst data results in gaps in the downscaling results thereby hindering the regional application of high resolution ssm data obtained from the downscaling process based on optical lst data to obtain high resolution ssm products that are not affected by cloud cover there are increasing downscaling studies using spatiotemporally seamless auxiliary data long et al 2019 proposed a machine learning based downscaling method for generating spatially complete and daily continuous ssm data using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis esa cci and china meteorological administration land data assimilation system cldas data which yielded good results the estarfm model was used to fill the gaps in the modis lst product using the cldas lst data however the reconstruction was not successful when a large portion was covered by clouds greater than15 as the reconstruction is not independent and relies on the cldas lst data based on above framework abowarda et al 2021 tried to get spatiotemporally continuous ssm at 30 m 30 m by integrating multisource data song et al 2019 also proposed a downscaling scheme for cloud covered regions based on geographically weighted regression gwr and indicated that the use of a spatial interpolation method for the generation of reference cloud free lst data and the existence of invalid retrievals partly affect the accuracy and spatial continuity of the downscaling results meanwhile many lst reconstruction methods have been developed to fill cloud contaminated pixels in daily lst maps the spatiotemporal interpolation method is commonly used because of its ability to characterize spatial and or temporal variations of the lst kilibarda et al 2014 metz et al 2017 militino et al 2019 yang et al 2019 this method uses available lst values to determine the mechanism of lst variation at different temporal and spatial scales subsequently this mechanism is applied to predict the lst values under cloudy conditions the annual temperature cycle atc is a common model that is used to describe the temporal variation in the lst at the annual scale bechtel 2015 this model expresses temporal variations of lst as a series of harmonic functions and it has been applied in many research fields such as urban heat islands fu and weng 2018 huang et al 2016 climatology bechtel 2015 ding and elmore 2015 and soil temperature monitoring huang et al 2014 zhan et al 2014 because of its ability to capture annual temperature variations compared with other lst reconstruction methods based on data fusion models such as the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 spatial temporal adaptive algorithm for mapping reflectance change staarch hilker et al 2009 enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model estarfm long et al 2020 zhu et al 2010 reanalysis data and thermal infrared remote sensing data merging rtm method zhang et al 2021b and machine learning model zhao and duan 2020 gap free lst results can be easily and quickly obtained with a reliable accuracy using the spatiotemporal interpolation method based on the implementation of these lst reconstruction methods seamless lst maps can be generated which are essential for the downscaling process to derive fine resolution ssm products with spatiotemporal continuity in addition to the impacts from the auxiliary data missing data in the coarse resolution passive microwave ssm due to different causes such as the rfi or vegetation topography effects further worsen the spatial continuity of the downscaled ssm maps hence it is essential to develop an effective method to retrieve spatiotemporally continuous downscaled ssm data without the influence from cloud cover in downscaling auxiliary data and data gaps in original passive microwave ssm product therefore the objective of this study was to propose and evaluate an approach to generate a fine resolution ssm product without spatiotemporal gaps the atc model was first applied to generate seamless lst based on the daily modis lst product then the daily seamless lst and 16 day modis ndvi were used as auxiliary data to generate a 25 km seamless ssm by eliminating empty areas in the esa cci ssm maps combined product finally the 25 km seamless esa cci ssm was downscaled with the daily seamless lst and 16 day modis ndvi data to the 1 km scale using a value consistent downscaling scheme the performance of the downscaled results was evaluated using a meteorological dataset from the european climate assessment dataset eca d project and in situ ssm observations available from the soil moisture measurement stations network of the university of salamanca remedhus in spain additionally an intercomparison analysis was conducted with the 1 km ssm product of the smos barcelona expert center portal et al 2018b to assess the reliability of the downscaled ssm 2 study area and data 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the iberian peninsula light gray rectangle in fig 1 a region characterized by multiple climatic and topographic conditions the study area covers 8 5 13 5 latitude 35 75 44 25 n longitude 9 75 w 3 75 e the iberian peninsula is in the southwest corner of europe with the mediterranean sea to the east and south atlantic ocean to the west the bay of biscay to the north and the european continent pyrenees mountains to the northeast the landforms in the study area are diverse including plateaus mountains and lowlands primarily in the western and southwestern parts the peninsula is influenced by the cold temperature prevailing over the atlantic ocean and warm temperatures over the mediterranean sea and sahara desert fonseca et al 2016 the southeast of this area has a semi arid climate the central part has a mediterranean continental climate and the northwest part is relatively humid because it is mainly located in a maritime climate zone parinussa et al 2014 built up areas are mainly distributed in the central and coastal regions most of the iberian peninsula is covered by crops grass and shrubland forest cover is widespread in the north and west of the iberian peninsula that is in areas with heavy rainfall with respect to the soil types https www isric org the northern part is mostly covered by cambisols whereas luvisols are distributed in the southwestern region the cropland soils in the northeast south middle and southeast consist of calisols vertisols fluvisols and leptosols respectively 2 2 data 2 2 1 esa cci surface soil moisture data the soil moisture cci project is a part of esa s program on global monitoring of essential climate variables ecv which was initiated in 2010 and produces an updated ssm product annually since 1978 dorigo et al 2017 the esa cci ssm product has contributed to many hydrological and climatological studies worldwide ikonen et al 2018 kim et al 2018 liu et al 2018 the esa cci ssm series contains three separate ssm datasets which are derived from active and passive microwave remote missions as well as a combination of both the esa cci ssm product version 04 7 gruber et al 2017 gruber et al 2019 integrates observations derived from 11 microwave sensors including active sensors such as european remote sensing satellite 1 2 ers 1 2 and advanced scatterometer a b ascat a b and passive sensors such as scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i trmm microwave imager tmi amsr e windsat smos and amsr2 these products have a spatial resolution of 0 25 25 km and a temporal resolution of one day the ssm datasets are available in different observation spaces because of their different observation frequencies observation principles and retrieval techniques the daily esa cci ssm was rescaled to a common climatology scanlon et al 2020 as follows 1 rescaling of all passive microwave ssm observations except for amsr 2 to the climatology of amsr e 2 rescaling of all active microwave ssm observations to the climatology of ascat and 3 separate rescaling of all active and passive microwave datasets to the climatology of gldas noah noah land surface model of the global land data assimilation system version 2 1 which is available since 2000 the eidgenössische technische hochschule zürich eth provided an independent validation service to the esa cci ssm and indicated that the esa cci sm products have stronger correlation with in situ measurements within the depth of 0 to 5 cm than with those corresponding to a depth of 10 cm https www esa soilmoisture cci org validation in this study the combined esa cci ssm product version 04 7 was used as the coarse resolution passive microwave ssm dataset because of its better spatial coverage than that of the active or passive dataset taken separately hereafter the term the esa cci ssm refers to the combined esa cci ssm product for the study area a total of 1096 esa cci ssm images were available for the study period of january 1 2016 to december 31 2018 during this period the data coverage for the northwestern coastal area was 90 whereas for the eastern areas was only approximately 50 overall the data coverage of the study area during the study period was 60 in addition for some areas within the study region the esa cci ssm values were unavailable for some days because of snow coverage temperatures below 273 k dense vegetation or failed ssm estimates that were removed based on quality flags therefore the development of a convenient and effective methodology to estimate high resolution ssm data without spatiotemporal gaps is important and productive 2 2 2 modis land surface data modis products provide improved tools for moderate resolution land surface monitoring justice et al 1998 modis products with spatial resolutions of 250 m 500 m and 1 km are widely applied for long term global observations in land ocean and atmosphere research hu et al 2010 im et al 2016 vermote et al 2002 zhang et al 2003 we selected the daily modis lst mod11a1 daytime version 6 and 16 day modis ndvi mod13a2 version 6 both with a 1 km spatial resolution as auxiliary data for the proposed downscaling scheme considering their good connections with the ssm based on the lst vi triangle space theory carlson 2007 mallick et al 2009 sandholt et al 2002 zhao et al 2017 wen et al 2020 showed that the daytime lst mod11a2 and 16 day modis ndvi performed well in downscaling the 36 km smap ssm the pixel temperature value of the mod11a1 product was derived from the mod11 l2 swath product the mod11 l2 lst product was obtained using the generalized split window lst algorithm wan and dozier 1996 the 16 day modis ndvi product was a composite product that was highly close to being cloud free by integrating the best available pixel value low clouds low view angle and highest ndvi value from 16 different acquisitions therefore this product was appropriate for ssm downscaling considering its marginal temporal variation in terms of vegetation within a 16 day period in contrast the multi day composite product cannot fully represent regional thermal and water conditions at the daily level because of the strong daily variability of lst therefore the mod11a1 daily lst product was selected for this study although it is greatly affected by cloud cover especially in the rainy season both the mod11a1 and mod13a2 are freely accessible via the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earthdata search website https search earthdata nasa gov search 2 2 3 in situ soil moisture observations the remedhus network is located in the northcentral part of the iberian peninsula in the castilla león region within the central sector of the duero basin fig 1 it was installed in 1999 and it has been providing continuous ssm data since then which has been especially beneficial for the validation and calibration of ssm missions colliander et al 2017 cui et al 2018 gonzalez zamora et al 2016 sanchez et al 2012 including the esa cci ssm series gonzález zamora et al 2019 although the number of ground stations has slightly changed over time more than 20 stations are distributed in an area of 1300 km2 41 1 to 41 5 n 5 1 to 5 7 w forming a dense network crow et al 2012 the stations are equipped with hydra probe sensors stevens water monitoring system inc that provide hourly ssm readings for the top 5 cm of the topsoil the topography of this network is gentle with an elevation range of 700 900 m the land cover type of all the stations is cropland primarily dry farmed cropland the climate is semi arid with an average annual precipitation of 385 mm yr and a mean temperature of 12 c sanchez et al 2012 the ssm measurements obtained at the 20 stations of this network from january 1 2016 to december 31 2018 were selected as the in situ ssm benchmark dataset for this study these data can be openly accessed at the international soil moisture network https ismn geo tuwien ac at en to ensure the reliability of the in situ ssm data only the in situ ssm values with a quality flag of g good were selected for the validation dataset dorigo et al 2013 moreover because the esa cci ssm data include multiple data from different remote sensors the daily product is not based on a single observation time therefore the daily average of the in situ ssm was calculated from the hourly measurements hereafter in situ ssm refers to daily average ssm of remedhus stations in addition to the remarkable seasonal variations in ssm at most stations the moisture conditions of these stations also show big spatial variations the high variabilities in the in situ measurements of this network pose a big challenge while downscaling the coarse resolution esa cci ssm product to represent the sub pixel ssm changes therefore this network is an ideal choice for assessing the efficiency of the proposed downscaling method 2 2 4 eca daily precipitation dataset the variations in ssm correlate with the precipitation events the daily precipitation dataset from the eca d project https www ecad eu which contains a series of daily observations obtained at meteorological stations throughout europe and the mediterranean countries was used to evaluate the downscaled ssm the considered eca d dataset comprised 195 daily precipitation series observed at meteorological stations in europe and the middle east klein tank et al 2002 for this study we selected 12 stations spread across the study area with various land cover types according to the modis land cover product and elevations the detailed description of these 12 stations is listed in table 1 including the station codes used in this work station name from the metadata of eca d latitude longitude elevation and land cover type the locations of these 12 stations are shown in fig 1 green triangles as shown in table 1 there are two forest stations tg and th five cropland stations tc tf ti tk and tl two herbaceous vegetation stations ta and tb two shrubland stations te and tj and one urban station td the elevations of the stations range from 7 to 2451 m 2 2 5 1 km smos bec ssm to better assess the performance of the downscaled ssm the daily 1 km smos barcelona expert center bec ssm of the regional level 4 ssm version 5 0 produced by the smos bec was also collected for comparison the 1 km smos bec ssm was downscaled from the 25 km smos ssm based on the synergetic use of the esa smos l1c brightness temperature lst and ndvi pablos et al 2017 piles et al 2011 piles et al 2014 portal et al 2018a the 1 km smos bec ssm product includes two datasets corresponding to ascending and descending orbits more information about this product can be found at http bec icm csic es land datasets according to the evaluation study conducted by pablos et al 2020 at different in situ measurements the ssm dataset of the ascending orbit performs slightly better than that of the descending orbit in terms of correlation coefficient and unbiased root mean square error ubrmse therefore the daily 1 km smos bec ssm acquired on the ascending orbit was selected for the comparison 3 methodology 3 1 flowchart of the downscaling process the downscaling process consists of three steps fig 2 the atc model was first applied to the modis daily lst product to obtain a seamless lst product without cloud cover pixels then the gaps in the 25 km esa cci ssm maps were filled using neighboring information local linear regression finally the ssm downscaling method was used to downscale the 25 km filled esa cci ssm seamless esa cci ssm to 1 km spatial resolution using the daily seamless lst and ndvi data 3 2 seamless lst reconstruction usually lst exhibits a strong annual seasonality which can be described by a series of harmonic functions bechtel 2015 the atc model is an example of such a function due to its ability to capture annual temperature variations and it can be expressed as follows 1 lst atc d a 0 i 1 n b i sin 2 π d 365 2 i 1 c i where d is the day of the year doy d 1 2 365 366 a 0 is the annual mean lst and bi and ci are the amplitude and phase shift of the ith sine function i 1 2 n respectively generally n is the key parameter of the atc model which partly determines the accuracy of the atc model to capture the time dependent characteristics of lst the parameters a 0 bi and c i can be fitted using eq 1 based on the modis lsts in one year lstmod d and the specific n value subsequently the lst value on a cloudy day lstatc d can be generated with the fitted model and then used to generate the seamless lst image for this day with clear sky observations this process can be achieved in four steps step 1 determination of parameter n in eq 1 let n be 1 2 3 4 or 5 then fit the model coefficients a0 bi and ci with the available modis lsts that is lstmod d d 1 2 365 366 the days with null values caused by cloud cover or high uncertainty estimation error larger than 2 k were not entered into the fitting process subsequently lstatc d was estimated according to the fitted model the correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse between lstmod d and lstatc d were determined the r value is minimal and rmse is maximal when n equals 1 when n equals 2 r and rmse increase and decrease respectively whereas r and rmse only slightly change when n is greater than 2 n 3 4 or 5 therefore to establish a tradeoff between calculation accuracy and efficiency the n value was set to 2 step 2 calculation of lstatc d based on the parameter n obtained in step 1 the model coefficients a0 b1 c1 b2 and c2 and lstatc d were estimated using lstmod d however when the number of days for lstmod d without cloud cover in one year is 100 the calculation of lstatc d stops to avoid a weak atc fitting step 3 elimination of lstmod d outliers when the fitting rmse between lstmod d and lstatc d was lower than 2 k we considered the lstatc d to be reliable and the atc model fitting was stopped the lst values for the days with lst marked as null value were filled with the estimated lstatc d when the fitting accuracy rmse did not meet the requirements rmse 2 k the outlier was identified first according to residual lstatc d lstmod d when rmse greater than 2 k it was excluded from the fitting process this filtering rule is based on the assumption that the outlier was considered as the day with extremely low temperature compared to adjacent days which was highly affected by the thin cloud cover surrounding the cloud pixels step 4 calculation of the lstatc d using an iterative process when the atc model fitting did not stop in step 3 steps 2 3 and 4 were repeated the maximum iteration number was set to ten to achieve a balance between the calculation efficiency and the accuracy of the lstatc d when the atc model did not stop in step 3 in the tenth iteration the lst values for the days on which lstmod d equaled the null value were filled with lstatc d and the atc model fitting was stopped as shown in fig 3 the spatial filling percentage lstatc filled pixels number all pixels number 100 in the seamless lst maps significantly changed with the time scale a higher percentage was mainly observed in winter greater influence of cloud cover the average percentage for the study period is 43 54 indicating that the cloud cover has a significant effect on optical remote sensing data which supports the need for the atc based reconstruction conducted in this study the clear sky lst pixels from the original modis lst maps are preserved in the final filled lst maps seamless lst maps only the empty pixels primarily caused by cloud cover or poor quality were filled with the atc model fitted lst values lstatc in addition the fitting results for 2016 show that the r values range from 0 9 to 1 with an average of 0 98 and the rmse values range from 1 2 to 2 0 k with an average of 1 78 k therefore the fitting accuracy of the atc model is acceptable based on this method the annual variations in the lst can be accurately depicted and thus the clear sky lst on cloudy days can be predicted 3 3 seamless esa cci ssm generation before downscaling the esa cci ssm data were reconstructed to obtain seamless coarse ssm maps for the esa cci cells with empty ssm values an estimation model based on local linear regression was established linking the surrounding esa cci cells with available values and independent variables the upscaled seamless lst and upscaled modis ndvi at a coarse resolution the calibrated regression model was then used for the upscaled seamless lst and upscaled modis ndvi to predict ssm values for the empty esa cci ssm pixels the regression model can be expressed as follows 2 s s m l a b l l c n l re where subscript l indicates low spatial resolution 25 km and ssm l l l n l and re are the esa cci ssm upscaled seamless lst upscaled modis ndvi and regression residual in the local window respectively the parameters a b and c are regression coefficients a self adaptive window was applied to determine the best window size based on the performance of the regression model the self adaptive window consists of four neighborhoods with different radii from four to seven pixels for each local window size eq 2 was implemented and the average value of the residuals in the window was calculated when the average residual reached the minimum value the corresponding local regression coefficients a b and c were determined and the estimated value was used as a surrogate of the empty value however in some cases the central cell had many empty cells around it and therefore the self adaptive regression could not be conducted in such cases a global regression was applied using all the cells in the study area to fit eq 2 and get the global regression coefficients then these coefficients were used to estimate the ssm value of this empty cell 3 4 seamless esa cci ssm downscaling based on the self adaptive window the selected downscaling approach has been successfully tested with a 36 km smap ssm product in previous research wen et al 2020 similarly the downscaling approach was applied here to derive the 1 km downscaled ssm pixels from the 25 km esa cci ssm cell this downscaling approach includes two procedures 1 estimation of the 1 km regression ssm ssm hr and coarse resolution residual re l with geographically weighted regression gwr and 2 downscaling of the coarse resolution residual to 1 km spatial resolution re h with the area to point kriging atpk method therefore the final downscaled ssm ssm h can be expressed as follows 3 ss m h s s m hr r e h where the subscript h represents the high spatial resolution 1 km and the subscript hr represents the 1 km result from gwr the ssm h ssm hr and re h are the final downscaled ssm 1 km 1 km regression ssm after gwr implementation and downscaled regression residuals from atpk respectively the gwr and atpk methods ensure the value consistency between the esa cci ssm value from a 25 km cell and the average value of all downscaled 1 km pixels within the 25 km cell in addition the self adaptive window strategy is utilized for the above two procedures so that consistency can be more easily achieved and the uncertainty in the downscaling process is minimized 3 4 1 seamless esa cci ssm downscaling with gwr the gwr was constructed using a 25 km spatial scale and the regression coefficients and the 1 km lst and 1 km ndvi were used to predict the ssm hr the gwr is expressed as follows 4 ss m l i a i b i l l i c i n l i r e l i where the subscripts l and i indicate a low spatial resolution 25 km and the ith 25 km esa cci cell respectively the ssmi l li l ni l and rei l are the ssm value upscaled seamless lst upscaled modis ndvi and regression residual for the ith 25 km esa cci cell the parameters ai bi and ci are the regression coefficients estimated from eq 5 using a self adaptive window as follows 5 β i x t w i x 1 x t w i y w ij 1 d ij λ 2 2 where the superscript i indicates the ith 25 km esa cci cell cell i and superscript ij represents the jth esa cci cell in the self adaptive window of cell i the parameter βi is the regression coefficient matrix ai bi and ci and x t and y are the independent variable matrix seamless lst and modis ndvi and dependent variable matrix seamless esa cci ssm values in the self adaptive window respectively the parameter w i is the weighting matrix composed of wij indicating the weight of the esa cci cells within the self adaptive window and λ is the window radius which changes from four to seven pixels the weight wij is partly determined by the euclidean distance dij between each cell j and the central cell i the window size was automatically determined according to the regression performance of eq 4 where rei c is minimized for 1 km pixel m with in the coarse resolution grid i its soil moisture ss m hr m can be estimated as below 6 ss m hr m a i b i l h m c i n h m where lm h and nm h represent lst and ndvi of this pixel respectively 3 4 2 residual correction with atpk the regression residual rei l was downscaled with atpk as follows 7 r e h m j 1 n α ij r e l ij s t j 1 n α ij 1 where superscript ij represents the jth esa cci cell in the self adaptive window of cell i superscript m represents the mth 1 km subpixel located in cell i and n is the number of cells in the self adaptive window of cell i the self adaptive window contains a weight value αij for each cell representing its contribution to the rem h calculation the parameter αij was extracted using the following equation 8 γ ll 1 1 γ ll 1 n 1 γ ll g j γ ll n 1 γ ll n n 1 1 1 0 α i 1 α ij α in θ γ hl m 1 γ hl m j γ hl m n 1 where γll g j is the semivariance of the gth and jth cells in the self adaptive window γhl m j is the semivariance between the mth 1 km subpixel located in cell i in the esa cci map and jth cell in the self adaptive window and θ is the lagrange multiplier the parameter γ is a function of the distance between two locations which can be simulated based on the residual re l map of the 25 km regression wang et al 2016 3 5 evaluation strategy the precipitation dataset from meteorological stations and the in situ ssm measurements from remedhus were used to evaluate the performance of the downscaled ssm qualitatively and quantitatively the temporal series of the downscaled ssm and precipitation data from the 12 selected meteorological stations table 2 were analyzed the downscaled ssm was compared with the in situ ssm in the evaluation area as shown in fig 1 at the network and station levels moreover the downscaled ssm was also compared with the 1 km smos bec ssm with respect to their descriptions of the spatial and temporal patterns of ssm over the study area a cumulative distribution function cdf matching method was also applied for comparison and for the reduction of the effects of systematic bias between the two 1 km ssm products 3 5 1 evaluation metrics and level several commonly used metrics were adopted entekhabi et al 2010b oozeer et al 2020 including r eq 9 rmse eq 10 ubrmse eq 11 and mean difference bias eq 12 to assess the accuracy of the downscaled ssm as follows 9 r cov ssm h ssm i v a r ssm h v a r ssm i 10 rmse e ssm h ssm i 2 11 u b rmse e ssm h e ssm h ssm i e ssm i 2 12 bias e ssm h e ssm i where ssm h and ssm i represent the 1 km downscaled ssm and in situ ssm respectively cov and var are the covariance and variance respectively and e is the average the evaluation was performed at both the network and station levels in the evaluation area as shown in fig 1 to reflect the footprint differences between satellite observations downscaled ssm and point observations in situ ssm at network level the average value of all remedhus stations was used as the regional value and it was compared with the averages of the downscaled ssm and esa cci ssm in the same region evaluation area at station level the ssm of each individual remedhus station were compared with the downscaled ssm and esa cci ssm values extracted for each location at each evaluation level the downscaled ssm temporal series was classified into two groups one for the days when all ssm values were available and another for days when there were gaps moreover to further assess the downscaled ssm its network validation results were compared with the performance of the 1 km smos bec ssm during the study period the detailed validation strategy is listed in table 2 3 5 2 cdf matching method the direct comparison between the ssm grid and in situ ssm at different spatial scales would bring misleading uncertainties including biases or systematic differences to the evaluation results due to spatial scale differences brocca et al 2011 to reduce this impact the cdf matching method which has been widely used in ssm evaluation researches dorigo et al 2015 gumuzzio et al 2016 kornelsen and coulibaly 2015 wang et al 2018 was utilized to minimize the influences from the biases and systematic differences of the downscaled 1 km ssm product and the 1 km smos bec ssm product as regard of the in situ ssm in this study the cdf matching method made the cumulative distribution of the downscaled ssm product to match that of esa cci ssm product thus the systematic bias caused by the original coarse resolution product can be largely eliminated the cdf is defined for a continuous function as follows the sum of all the values is less than or equal to a and the probability of occurrence is f a p x a where p indicates the probability function in this study the downscaled ssm was fitted to the in situ ssm using the cdf matching method the downscaled ssm corrected by cdf matching downscaled ssm cdf is denoted as ssm h cdf as follows 13 f i ssm h c d f f h ssm h where f i and f h are the cdfs for the in situ and downscaled ssm respectively which is fitted using a polynomial with a degree of 5 and ssm h is the original downscaled ssm value 4 results 4 1 visual interpretation of the seamless downscaled ssm to make a contrast fig 4 a shows the coarse resolution series of the daily esa cci ssm maps at 25 km resolution and fig 4b shows the generated downscaled ssm maps at 1 km resolution for the period from october 17 to 31 2016 15 days in order to highlight the contrast effect between the esa cci ssm and the downscaled ssm we set the color of the gap pixels nodata pixels to white in fig 4a and b light blue for open sea from the visual inspection the spatial distributions of the downscaled ssm are consistent with those of the esa cci ssm this visual effect undoubtedly shows that our proposed method achieved the innovation of the research for its seamless downscaling the original ssm spatial pattern was also preserved after the downscaling the differences between the downscaled ssm aggregated to the 25 km cells and the original esa cci ssm were approximately 0 m3 m3 in most cells not only the spatial information was improved but the temporal variability of the original coarse resolution ssm maps was also preserved as shown in fig 4 c and d the downscaled ssm values at station tl present a rapid change in ssm associated with rainfall events before the occurrences of rainfall on oct 21 23 ssm shows a decreasing trend however a rapid increase happens after these rainfall events then the moisture condition generally becomes drier when there is no further rainfall although fig 4d only shows the temporal change in ssm and precipitation at one single 1 km cell the corresponding 25 km cell containing the station shown in fig 4c also presents a similar pattern this variation pattern confirmed well the reliability of the downscaled ssm in depicting the influence from rainfall on ssm 4 2 evaluation using in situ measurements at network level 4 2 1 network level evaluation on days with original esa cci ssm values the in situ ssm downscaled ssm and original esa cci ssm during the study period were assessed according to the validation strategy shown in table 2 table 3 details the resulting statistical metrics of the esa cci ssm and downscaled ssm compared to the in situ ssm at network level the statistical metrics of both ssm products were similar the rmse values of the esa cci and the downscaled ssm was 0 095 and 0 093 m3 m3 respectively after removing the bias the calculated ubrmses were 0 029 and 0 030 m3 m3 respectively indicating that both the downscaled ssm and original esa cci ssm correlate well with the in situ ssm similarly strong correlations can be observed for the downscaled ssm r 0 852 and esa cci ssm r 0 853 wet biases can also be observed for the downscaled ssm bias 0 088 m3 m3 which were inherited from the original esa cci ssm bias 0 091 m3 m3 fig 5 this overestimation was also reported by gonzález zamora et al 2019 to present the temporal changes of three ssm datasets at network level fig 5 shows the time series of the extracted esa cci ssm downscaled ssm and station average in situ ssm the downscaled ssm and the esa cci ssm exhibited the same temporal trend which is consistent with that of the in situ ssm in winter and spring the moisture condition is generally wetter whereas soil wetness is relatively dry in summer and autumn however the downscaled ssm has a systematic wet bias same overestimation as observed for the esa cci ssm 4 2 2 network level evaluation on days without esa cci ssm data similarly the downscaled ssm values acquired from days with data gaps in the esa cci cells were compared with the station average in situ ssm values at network level in the study area for the study period fig 1 gaps were observed on 196 days as shown in table 3 the r value between the downscaled and in situ ssms was 0 720 whereas the rmse ubrmse and bias were 0 088 m3 m3 0 039 m3 m3 and 0 078 m3 m3 respectively the r was slightly worse than that for days with the esa cci ssm values 0 852 m3 m3 this is because that the original esa cci ssm data is not available on these days at the evaluation area and the downscaled ssm mainly depend on the contribution of neighboring pixels meanwhile too many missing areas without esa cci ssm data resulted in poor accuracy of the seamless esa cci ssm and the downscaled ssm comparatively the bias value was slightly better than that for days with the esa cci ssm values however there was still overestimated in the downscaled results although the rmse value decreased due to the decrease of bias while the ubrmse was larger than the downscaled results with esa cci ssm data despite the relatively poor performance under the condition without esa cci ssm the downscaled ssm shows an acceptable accuracy and presents significant correlation with in situ observations 4 3 evaluation using field observations at station level 4 3 1 station level evaluation for days with esa cci ssm data as shown in table 4 the averages of the statistical metrics show that the performance of the evaluation at station level is similar to that at network level but slightly weaker the average statistical metrics for the downscaled ssm were 0 733 r 0 118 m3 m3 rmse 0 047 m3 m3 ubrmse and 0 088 m3 m3 bias whereas those of the esa cci ssm were 0 739 r 0 118 m3 m3 rmse 0 046 m3 m3 ubrmse and 0 091 m3 m3 bias the slight differences may be neglected at this level and indicated that both the downscaled ssm and the original ssm capture well the temporal dynamics of ssm measured by in situ measurements during the three years the r values of all stations were higher than 0 6 except for stations k13 and l3 both for the downscaled ssm and the esa cci ssm similarly the ubrmse of the downscaled ssm was 0 05 m3 m3 in 17 out of the 20 stations which was similar to that of the esa cci ssm the statistical metrics of station k13 were the worst because this station is located in an irrigated plot leading to higher and fluctuating ssm values however the correlations at all stations for both the downscaled ssm and esa cci ssm were significant at the 99 confident level positive biases were detected for most stations for both the downscaled ssm and esa cci ssm in 17 out of the 20 stations because the original esa cci ssm overestimates the ground values 4 3 2 station level evaluation on days without esa cci ssm data the downscaled ssm on days when the esa cci ssm was unavailable were compared with the in situ ssm table 5 displays the comparison results at the station scale from january 1 2016 to december 31 2018 in average the r rmse ubrmse and bias were 0 604 0 115 0 054 and 0 077 m3 m3 respectively only two stations had r values below 0 5 compared with the evaluation on days with esa cci ssm values at station level the general performance of the downscaled ssm was slightly worse but the downscaled ssm still showed significant correlations with the in situ measurements 4 4 comparison with the 1 km smos bec ssm product 4 4 1 comparison on spatial basis the 1 km smos bec ssm product was used together with the in situ observations to evaluate the downscaled results as shown in fig 6 the ssm maps of the downscaled ssm and 1 km smos bec ssm on january 22 april 22 july 22 and october 22 2016 were selected to represent winter spring summer and autumn respectively compared to the 1 km smos bec ssm fig 6e h for each date the downscaled ssm fig 6a d exhibited better spatial coverage the gaps in the 1 km smos bec ssm maps are primarily due to the orbital gaps of the smos satellite on the contrary the integration from the observation from different sensors of the esa cci ssm product results advantageous for the spatial coverage together with the enhancement of the spatial coverage after the seamless downscaling 4 4 2 comparison on temporal basis to further demonstrate the advantage of the spatial coverage in the downscaled maps fig 7 a shows the time series of the downscaled ssm 1 km smos bec ssm and in situ ssm during the study period the differences in fig 7a confirmed the overestimation of the downscaled ssm and the underestimation of the 1 km smos bec ssm however the temporal variations of both the downscaled ssm and 1 km smos bec ssm were consistent with that of the in situ ssm compared with the downscaled ssm and in situ ssm the 1 km smos bec ssm yielded systematically lower ssm values reaching extremely low values in the summer season to better visualize the differences between the time series of the three datasets the downscaled ssm and 1 km smos ssm were both scaled up by applying cdf matching based on the in situ ssm at network level in fig 7b the time series of the downscaled ssm and 1 km smos ssm after cdf matching denoted as downscaled ssm cdf and 1 km smos ssm cdf are plotted against the in situ ssm fig 7b shows that the downscaled ssm cdf and 1 km smos ssm cdf are closer to the curve of the in situ ssm compared with fig 7a hence both 1 km ssm products captured the variations in the ssm when the systematic biases primarily due to original flaws of the coarse resolution ssm were largely eliminated comparatively the downscaled ssm cdf had fewer values with high underestimation than the 1 km smos ssm cdf as it was remarkable in 2016 fig 7b therefore this comparison further confirms the reliability of the downscaling method proposed in this study 4 4 3 validated by in situ ssm measurements for further comparison the two 1 km ssm data were validated with the in situ ssm measurements from the remedhus network at network level as illustrated in table 6 the correlation between the downscaled ssm with the averaged in situ measurements is stronger r 0 820 than that of the 1 km smos bec ssm r 0 786 although the absolute bias and rmse of the downscaled ssm are higher than those of the smos bec ssm data the ubrmse of the downscaled ssm is lower than that of the 1 km smos bec ssm with a difference of 0 016 m3 m3 5 discussion in this study a spatial downscaling method is proposed to produce a seamless ssm series with a high spatial resolution of 1 km first the atc model was used to fill gaps caused by cloud cover in the modis daily lst terra daytime and to derive seamless lst images then the esa cci ssm was filled and downscaled to obtain the seamless esa cci ssm and seamless downscaled ssm respectively the downscaled results were evaluated by the in situ measurements from the remedhus network at different spatial scales and the evaluation confirmed the relatively good performance of the downscaling approach meanwhile a comparison with another downscaled ssm product smos bec ssm in the study area with a similar spatial resolution also proved that the seamless downscaled ssm can be used to characterize the spatiotemporal variations in the iberian peninsula based on the downscaled daily values fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the annual average downscaled ssm for years 2016 to 2018 the spatial distribution pattern of each annual average map for the three years were consistent the spatial pattern of the ssm in the iberian peninsula is primarily driven by the continental climate therefore the ssm is low in the central part of the study area and is high in the northern and northwestern parts atlantic climate zone such spatial variations in the ssm in the iberian peninsula have also been reported in previous studies montzka et al 2018 piles et al 2019 portal et al 2018a sánchez et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 in addition the annual average of 2017 is lower than that of the other two years this result agrees with the serious drought occurred in 2017 considered as the second driest year and the warmest one since 1965 according the spanish meteorological agency http www aemet es es noticias 2018 01 resumen climatico 2017 to highlight the temporal patterns the downscaled ssm series obtained at 12 meteorological stations were extracted for the study period and made comparison with the precipitation recorded by each station fig 9 shows the time series of ssm at each station together with the corresponding precipitation in the iberian peninsula the low ssm values were generally observed in dry season from july to september whereas the rainy season from november to january usually has high ssm condition de luis et al 2010 except for stations ta and tb the ssm values of all stations exhibited significant seasonal variations as indicated by brocca et al 2014 ssm shares an obvious and strong physical connection with rainfall and the temporal variation of the downscaled ssm also presented good temporal consistency with the occurrence of rainfall events therefore it is obvious that high precipitation usually led to good moisture condition in winter whereas low precipitation corresponded with dry condition in summer in most stations meanwhile this temporal change pattern also follows the rule for exact rainfall event that ssm shows a sudden increase followed by a smooth recession limb driven by evapotranspiration and drainage after a rainfall pulse ciabatta et al 2018 crow et al 2011 porporato et al 2004 the framed period within the red rectangle in fig 9 clearly indicate this pattern similar as the study conducted by zhao et al 2018 and long et al 2019 the comparison of the downscaled ssm with precipitation observed at different stations with different elevations and land cover types revealed a good temporal representation of the downscaled ssm in different regions in addition to the abovementioned aspects fig 10 a and b show the esa cci sm and the downscaled ssm in remedhus obtained on the fifth of each month in 2016 to figure out the advantage of the spatial downscaling in presenting the spatial variability within the coarse resolution cell obviously the intention of most downscaling methods is to generate high resolution ssm data to represent the real sub pixel spatial variability merlin et al 2015 peng et al 2017 to present this effect fig 10c shows the maximum and minimum values of the esa cci ssm and the downscaled ssm in the network from january 1 2016 to december 31 2016 the downscaled ssm greatly enlarged the regional differences in ssm and provided more detailed soil moisture information than the esa cci ssm because of the increase of the spatial heterogeneity the downscaled ssm presented high variability than the coarse resolution esa cci ssm data although the two data capture well the temporal variability the smoothing effect of the esa cci ssm slightly increase its average performance when compared with the in situ measurements at station level as shown in table 4 although the downscaling method proposed herein yields a seamless downscaled ssm series with high accuracy there are still some shortcomings should be considered further the first issue should be connected with the generation of seamless lst data as indicated by zhao et al 2019 lst is jointly affected by a variety of factors such as land cover type vegetation coverage ssm soil texture topographic factors and meteorological conditions only two downscaling factors were used during the downscaling process lst and ndvi and hence their interpretation for ssm is particularly important therefore the performance of downscaling is highly dependent on the accuracy of lst in this study the cloud covered lst values were reconstructed with the atc model to represent the clear sky lst according to the feature of the atc model although we have integrated two sine components in this model to consider the variability of lst at semiannual time scale the daily temperature variations caused by synoptic conditions cannot be quantitatively depicted in current level the enhanced atc model proposed by zou et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 increased its ability to describe the daily lst fluctuations and it would be helpful to provide more accurate lst values in addition some lst reconstruction methods proposed in recent years also provided alternatives to generate lst reconstructions with lower uncertainty long et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b zhao and duan 2020 and there is a successful application in estimating daily evapotranspiration with spatial completeness zhang et al 2021a another issue should be referred to the validation as indicated by colliander et al 2017 the lack of in situ data is a common problem in the evaluation of remote sensing ssm products previous studies have tried a lot to effectively evaluate remote sensed ssm gonzalez zamora et al 2016 jackson et al 2012 portal et al 2020 sanchez et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a in this study due to the lack of dense in situ observation network with different land cover conditions the remedhus network was the only choice to perform direct validation in this study however this network covers only a small part of the iberian peninsula with the key land cover type of cropland consequently the specific topographic climatic and land cover conditions in this network cannot represents the study area with different land conditions a more solid validation with the use of observations from stations with different land cover properties would be helpful to enhance the assessment of the proposed method moreover the evaluation study conducted in this work was mainly focus on the comparisons of the temporal variabilities of different ssm data at different scales the spatial heterogeneity of the downscaled ssm at a certain time was not evaluated because of the inherent scarcity of high resolution ssm datasets from in situ measurements some upscaling studies provided good alternatives to get high spatiotemporal resolution soil moisture data kang et al 2021 van der velde et al 2021 6 conclusions a new downscaling approach for the derivation of spatiotemporally seamless and high resolution 1 km downscaled ssm at a daily scale was presented in this study first the influence of the cloud cover in daily modis lst maps was eliminated using the atc model the daily seamless lst clear sky lst was estimated yielding a mean r and rmse of 0 98 and 1 78 k respectively based on the daily lst and 16 day modis ndvi the coarse resolution esa cci ssm was used to generate seamless esa cci ssm maps different from most previous downscaling research this study used seamless downscaling factors the daily lst and 16 day modis ndvi finally the seamless esa cci ssm maps were downscaled to 1 km using a downscaling model and combining the downscaling factors which has not been paid attention to in previous studies a systematic evaluation of the downscaled ssm data was conducted using in situ observations from the remedhus network at network level the evaluation of the downscaled ssm on days with esa cci ssm values yielded r rmse ubrmse and bias values of 0 852 0 093 m3 m3 0 030 m3 m3 and 0 088 m3 m3 respectively the remarkable wet bias in the downscaled ssm is primarily due to the original esa cci ssm bias 0 091 m3 m3 as reported in previous studies the evaluation results on days with data ssm gaps indicated that the accuracy of the downscaled ssm is acceptable with r rmse ubrmse and bias values of 0 720 0 088 m3 m3 0 039 m3 m3 and 0 078 m3 m3 respectively meanwhile a similar evaluation was conducted at station level the downscaled ssm data also showed good correlation with the in situ ssm measurements at each station on days with valid ssm values in the esa cells with average r rmse ubrmse and bias values of 0 711 0 118 m3 m3 0 049 m3 m3 and 0 086 m3 m3 respectively although the evaluation results on days with data ssm gaps were slightly worse the average r rmse ubrmse and bias values of all the stations were 0 604 0115 m3 m3 0 054 m3 m3 and 0 077 m3 m3 respectively the r values obtained for most stations 18 stations out of 20 were higher than 0 5 and most ubrmses ranged between 0 04 m3 m3 and 0 06 m3 m3 these results revealed that the downscaling method has a relatively good downscaling accuracy while generating the seamless soil moisture data furthermore the comparison with the 1 km smos bec ssm product indicated that the downscaled ssm has an excellent spatial coverage and good temporal consistency and thus it can be used to depict the temporal evolution of ssm especially after cdf matching therefore the spatiotemporally seamless ssm data generation in this study will play a key role in weather prediction and climate change at regional scale the validation with in situ measurements indicated that the downscaled ssm had a better performance in terms of ubrmse and r in addition the downscaled ssm also presented high sensitivity to rainfall events according to the correlation analysis with precipitation data from 12 meteorological stations widely distributed in the iberian peninsula overall the proposed method presents good potential to produce a high resolution ssm product continuous in space and time which has big demands in related fields like weather prediction climate change etc at the same time this study can potentially be applied to a variety of microwave ssm products with coarse spatial resolution providing a way for achieving the large scale production of ssm with medium or high spatial resolution future studies will consider the application of the proposed method to other areas and possible enhancements such as a more robust lst reconstruction and further consideration of other impact factors like topography in the downscaling also a more systematic validation process against in situ measurements representing different landscapes and climates is needed to foster its adoption in a wider range of application domains credit authorship contribution statement wei zhao conceptualization methodology writing original draft resources supervision

3998,groundwater is a life sustaining resource that supplies water to 2 billion people worldwide and is critical for agriculture despite the importance of groundwater understanding of groundwater recovery from meteorological droughts is limited here we utilize daily groundwater observations from unconfined aquifers without active groundwater management across the conterminous united states to illustrate that in response to a multi year drought it takes on average 3 years for shallow aquifers to recover the storage lost during the drought this recovery time increases with higher drought severity and is influenced by the time lag between the initiation termination of a meteorological drought and initiation termination of a groundwater drought there is considerable variation in the time lag duration up to 15 years in some aquifers controlled by geographic properties in regions with shallow water tables and precipitation characteristics in regions with deep water tables a machine learning algorithm finds that the most important controls on the time lag are the drought intensity at the beginning of the precipitation drought and the mean annual recharge projected increases in drought severity could potentially increase groundwater recovery times to droughts in a changing climate keywords groundwater drought aquifer recovery water resource management catchment

the severity intensity and duration of precipitation drought are important to varying degrees in controlling meteorological drought impacts on baseflow van lanen et al 2013 van loon laaha 2015 van loon van lanen 2012 previous work has quantified the impact of aquifer properties on groundwater droughts finding that the thickness of the vadose zone and hydraulic diffusivity ratio of transmissivity to specific yield of aquifers are important controls on the lagged groundwater response to precipitation drought in the united kingdom bloomfield and marchant 2013 additionally recession of a groundwater hydrograph in the absence of recharge is a function of aquifer properties cuthbert 2014 as drought impacts diffuse recharge and streamflow and therefore focused recharge it is expected that properties of both the vadose zone and aquifer control the lagged groundwater response time to droughts wong et al 2012 droughts can be defined in many ways including meteorological drought as a result of reduced precipitation hydrologic drought affecting streamflow snow drought agricultural drought where declining soil moisture results in crop failure and groundwater drought due to decline in groundwater levels mishra and singh 2010 as a result the spatial and temporal scales of droughts vary depending on the definition used a significant challenge in quantifying the groundwater response to meteorological drought is quantifying consistent drought periods for different hydrologic metrics tijdeman et al 2018 the standardized precipitation index spi a normalized index is one of the most widely used meteorological drought indices mckee et al 1993 the standardized groundwater index sgi is based on similar principles and has been shown as an effective metric to quantify anomalies in groundwater level across a variety of locations bloomfield and marchant 2013 however matching a precipitation drought with a corresponding drought in groundwater level data remains a challenge previous researchers calculated the correlation between the spi with various accumulation periods i e 1 month 3 month etc and the monthly sgi to understand the aquifer controls on the groundwater lag time due to precipitation drought hellwig and stahl 2018 while correlation between the sgi and spi provides overall characteristic time lags between precipitation and groundwater bloomfield et al 2015 weider and boutt 2010 the time lags are independent of meteorological drought variability therefore the correlation based methods do not demonstrate the impacts of meteorological drought properties on groundwater response additionally it is not entirely clear whether precipitation or geographic characteristics are the dominant control on the groundwater response time to drought similar to the drought definition there is no clear consensus on defining drought termination parry et al 2016 indeed predicting the termination of precipitation drought is difficult as one or few intense rainfall events can abruptly end the drought mo 2011 recovery of groundwater storage from drought has typically been studied at a specific point in time when storage recovers rather than as a recovery process parry et al 2016 the recovery of groundwater from drought typically lags behind the recovery of other metrics such as streamflow wang et al 2016 recent work has also suggested that watersheds might never recover from drought and attributes this response to a shift in ecosystem state peterson et al 2021 while parry et al 2016 present a framework to analyze drought termination as a long term process it remains unclear what factors influence groundwater drought termination trajectories parry et al 2018 furthermore understanding the relative importance of factors that influence groundwater recovery from meteorological drought in unconfined aquifers remains an important challenge in hydrology here we analyze observation wells in unconfined aquifers mean depth to groundwater of 8 0 11 5 m standard deviation from the climate response network located across the conterminous united states conus for the time period of 1981 2017 fig 1 a we provide an observation based analysis of the groundwater response and recovery from multi year meteorological droughts in the absence of anthropogenic management we limit our analysis to multi year precipitation droughts that have a corresponding groundwater drought as there are multiple definitions for a drought we define a precipitation groundwater drought as a period of negative precipitation groundwater anomalies below a certain threshold our precise definitions are presented in section 2 2 our goal is to answer three primary questions 1 do precipitation or subsurface properties play a stronger role in controlling groundwater response time to precipitation drought initiation 2 what factors influence the trajectory of groundwater recovery to drought and 3 under what conditions are precipitation or geographic properties impacting lagged groundwater response to drought 2 methods 2 1 datasets groundwater level data from unconfined aquifers across the united states was obtained from the climate response network managed by the usgs https pubs usgs gov fs 2007 3003 for inclusion in the climate response network wells are selected so that groundwater level responds solely to climate fluctuations and not groundwater pumping or land use change we started with 634 observation wells that had multiple years of data available for this study we removed the small number of observation wells that were not located in single unconfined aquifers wells with long term trends in groundwater level were also removed from the analysis as these trends are likely representative of long term climate trends rather than distinct drought periods and computing groundwater lag and recovery times in these non stationary time series is challenging to be included an observation well needed to have at least 10 consecutive years of data and should not be located under irrigated lands irrigated lands are defined by the 250 m resolution mirad dataset which merges remote sensing data and county level irrigated area statistics to estimate irrigation brown and pervez 2014 although many of the observation wells are located in the heavily populated northeast united states groundwater pumping is minimal in these states and the groundwater systems are not heavily managed by humans dieter et al 2018 additionally according to the 2016 national land cover dataset none of the wells are located in areas with medium or high intensity development and only 9 of the wells are located in areas with low intensity development there were 266 observation wells within the conus region that fit our criterion during the 1981 2017 period fig 1a consistent with the temporal availability of high quality precipitation data from prism daly et al 2001 daly et al 1994 the geographic properties included here include both land surface and subsurface data land surface data consists of a 30 arc second 1 km digital elevation model of the conus land surface elevation e gtopo30 dataset danielson and gesch 2011 and the percent canopy cover can from the 2016 national land cover dataset as we do not have high quality canopy cover data for each year of our analysis we assume constant canopy cover in time mean air temperature ta data is acquired from the prism 1981 2010 30 year normals the subsurface data includes soil and aquifer hydraulic conductivity and mean annual potential recharge mapr soil hydraulic conductivity over the top 2 m of soil ks were obtained by the weighted average of hydraulic conductivity values from the polaris dataset chaney et al 2016 aquifer hydraulic conductivity ka values were obtained from the glhymps dataset based on a global lithology map with standard hydraulic conductivity values assigned to each rock type gleeson et al 2014 we assume that the well depth is representative of the aquifer thickness to approximately calculate the transmissivity t of an unconfined aquifer by multiplying the hydraulic conductivity values by the well depth minus the minimum observed depth to water table the mapr is the residual of water balance observations across the united states and was obtained from the usgs reitz et al 2017 2 2 drought recognition algorithm many drought indices have been proposed zargar et al 2011 to quantify specific aspects of a drought i e meteorological agricultural etc in order to use a consistent metric for both meteorological and groundwater droughts we define drought solely based on the monthly and annual anomalies of precipitation and groundwater time series calculated relative to the 37 year or maximum available data period for sites with 37 years mean of monthly or annual time series respectively yang et al 2017 because precipitation and shallow groundwater storage exhibit strong seasonality eltahir and yeh 1999 the seasonal cycle from the monthly precipitation and groundwater level data are removed to compute monthly anomalies following li and rodell 2015 a key challenge for this study is associating groundwater decline to a corresponding decline in precipitation although short term precipitation fluctuations can impact shallow groundwater levels we only include sufficiently large drought periods in groundwater to clearly associate them with precipitation declines to accomplish this we first calculate the annual precipitation or groundwater anomaly and smooth it with a 3 year moving average window this filtering prevents a single wet year from interrupting a long and significant dry period to select a multi year precipitation drought period we define a drought period as any period of 3 year or more smoothed annual negative anomalies where the negative anomalies are larger than a 5 threshold with this approach the 3 year smoothed annual negative precipitation anomalies are obtained by either short and intense dry periods or long and not as intense dry periods we also selected a moving window of shorter than 3 years and a smaller threshold to define precipitation droughts but this selection resulted in identifying many precipitation droughts that do not have a corresponding groundwater drought for example defining a drought using annual precipitation anomalies and a 5 threshold resulted in identifying115 precipitation droughts that did not have corresponding groundwater droughts similarly setting the anomaly threshold at 0 i e any negative precipitation anomaly over a 3 year smoothing period is a drought resulted in detecting many small precipitation droughts that did not correspond with a groundwater drought therefore the 3 year smoothed annual precipitation anomalies with the threshold of 5 were used in the rest of the analysis we use a change detection analysis to determine the monthly start and end time of droughts from the monthly anomaly series we call this approach the anomaly based change detection abcd approach fig 1b to determine a specific month for the start and end of a drought we make use of the methods from yang et al 2017 after determining the approximate start or end year of a drought a period with 3 year smoothed annual precipitation anomalies of 5 or more below average we apply a piecewise linear function to the monthly anomaly time series to detect the turning points in the time series which indicate the beginning or end of a drought y β o β 1 t t α β o β 1 t β 2 t α t α where y is the time series of monthly precipitation anomalies t is the time in months βo β1 and β2 are coefficients and α is the turning point for the start of a drought different values of α are tested starting with 12 months before the first year of a drought 3 year smoothed anomaly is below the 5 threshold and ending with 12 months after the first year of the drought for a total of a 3 year window for each value of α least squares regression is used to fit the β coefficients and we use a t test to test statistical significance of β2 within this 3 year time window 36 months the value of α that produces the most significant β2 value is determined to be the drought starting point if no statistically significant β2 value is found the drought is not used in our analysis this same process is repeated at the end of a drought to determine the month at which the drought terminates this change detection approach has been shown effective for hydrologic datasets yang et al 2017 2014 groundwater droughts are detected using the same approach as precipitation droughts to define a groundwater drought however we require the 3 year smoothed annual anomalies to be negative i e 0 anomaly rather than less than a 5 anomaly finally we performed a manual check to ensure that each precipitation drought was associated with a drought identified in the groundwater time series if a precipitation drought does not correspond to a groundwater drought the precipitation drought was removed from the analysis in accordance with these drought periods we define the groundwater lag time tl and the recovery time tr the groundwater tl is calculated for both the start and end of a drought defined as the time lag between the start end of a precipitation drought fig 1b and the start end of the associated groundwater drought fig 1c this time lag represents the time that it takes until changes in precipitation propagate through the vadose zone and or changes in streamflow in a connected surface water groundwater system impact groundwater levels van lanen and peters 2000 the recovery time tr consists of the time lag between the cessation of negative monthly precipitation and groundwater anomalies negative anomalies become less negative than the identified thresholds and the time needed for the groundwater levels to rise to the 5 year average pre drought groundwater levels fig 1d as our focus is on multi year groundwater droughts no droughts overlapped the 5 year pre drought period with this approach we detected 332 droughts meeting our criteria present in both the precipitation and groundwater records every well presented in fig 1 has at least one drought identified we define several metrics to represent the strength of the precipitation drought the drought duration dd is the number of months between the start and the end of the precipitation drought the drought severity s is defined as the sum of the monthly precipitation anomalies during the precipitation drought divided by the mean precipitation expressed as a percentage to compare drought severities across the variable climate zones the drought intensity i is the drought severity divided by the duration expressed with units of mon finally the drought intensity during the lag time idlt is the drought severity during the tl divided by the tl to validate our method we also calculated the lag time between groundwater and precipitation time series using the standardized drought indices for each well location we calculate the spi and sgi metrics using a non parametric approach farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 and calculate the correlation coefficients between the spi estimated for different accumulation periods q where q 1 2 3 360 months and the monthly sgi we define the lag time of an aquifer as the spi accumulation period that provides the highest correlation with the sgi time series and call this method the correlation coefficient cc based lag time estimation method this method does not identify corresponding droughts in precipitation and groundwater time series and is only used to validate our approach locations with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0 4 were excluded from the analysis the value of 0 4 was chosen to include as many sites as possible while removing several sites with anomalously long lag times and poor correlation coefficients the effect of this threshold is explored in table s1 2 3 random forest model of lag and recovery times we apply a random forest method to identify the factors that most control the tl and tr breiman 2001 random forest models consist of an ensemble of decision trees used for either classification or regression denisko and hoffman 2018 this approach has been widely used to identify the most important factors that influence a dataset liu et al 2020 in this contribution we use regression based random forest models by including multiple factors that have been previously suggested to impact the tl or tr and examine their relative importance in predicting them for the tl these factors include the precipitation drought properties i s dd and idlt and the geographic properties mean depth to water table wtd mapr e ka ks can t and ta for the tr we omit the idlt from the drought properties and include the head depletion during the drought period dgw transmissivity as well as hydraulic conductivity estimates are included in the model because the aquifer response time depends on the saturated thickness hydraulic conductivity and storage properties cuthbert 2014 and in unconfined aquifers saturated thickness varies with changes in hydraulic head as higher aquifer diffusivity results in a shorter groundwater response time to changes in hydraulic perturbation it is important to include transmissivity in addition to hydraulic conductivity in the random forest model typically random forest models are unaffected by the inclusion of two correlated variables genuer et al 2010 but for completeness we build the model with each of ka and t separately and find that the predictor importance values do not vary we use permutation of the out of bag predictor observations to identify the most important factors in controlling the tl and tr as each decision tree is built from a random sample with replacement generally a higher number of trees results in better performance we use different numbers of trees 10 50 100 500 1000 to control the quality of the regression tree ensemble the variable importance factors are similar between the different numbers of trees so we present values from the case with 1000 trees to ensure the highest accuracy to validate the model performance we calculate the out of bag error estimates for each decision tree and present the cumulative ensemble error we also perform a pseudo validation by comparing the predicted tl or tr from the random forest model to the observed values finally to test if our results are biased by the large number of observations in the northeast of conus ecoregions 5 3 8 1 and 8 4 we build three random forest models where in each model data from one of the three ecoregions is excluded and a model where all three ecoregions are excluded 3 results following the abcd method 332 droughts were detected across conus the mean number of droughts per well is 1 2 and the maximum is 4 an anova analysis reveals that no statistically significant differences exist between the average number of droughts per well in different ecoregions the mean duration of a precipitation drought is 53 months range 11 211 months while for a groundwater drought is 55 months range 13 220 months the severity of precipitation droughts ranges from 5 to 49 with a mean of 18 4 while the intensity of precipitation droughts ranges from 0 03 to 3 1 mon with a mean of 0 51 mon 3 1 lagged groundwater response to large precipitation drought we first explore the spatial patterns in tl at the start of a drought across the conus fig 2 a across the conus the mean tl at the start end of a drought is 20 1 16 7 months the tl at the start of a drought ranges from 1 to 185 months and ranges from 1 to 184 months at the end of a drought the tl appears to decrease in the eastern conus and is correlated with the mapr r 0 31 p 0 0001 the majority of wells have relatively short tl 24 months fig s1 but this result appears to be an artifact of the large number of observation wells located in the humid northeast of the conus previous studies have found that basin average lag times are generally shorter than 1 year in humid regions bloomfield and marchant 2013 boxplots present the average tl value for various ecoregions at the start fig 2b and end fig 2c of droughts a paired t test demonstrates that there are not significant differences p 0 05 between the tl at the start or end of a drought for each ecoregion a 1 way anova analysis reveals that there are statistically significant differences in the mean tl between several different ecoregions for both the tl at the start and end of a drought though no ecoregion s average tl is significantly different from the tl of all other ecoregions generally the ecoregions 6 7 9 and 10 which cover most of the western united states have the longest tl while ecoregions 8 1 8 4 eastern u s wooded plains and 5 3 atlantic highlands have the shortest tl ecoregion 7 1 also exhibits the largest variability in tl particularly at the end of a drought followed by ecoregions 6 2 and 10 1 at the beginning of the drought fig 2b 2c ecoregions in the western conus have the largest variability in tl generally a result of long lag times and drier conditions than the eastern ecoregions a comparison between the actual and predicted tl from the random forest model reveals that the model accurately predicts the tl for a specific drought at a given site with a bias of 0 99 a correlation coefficient r of 0 89 and a root mean square error rmse of 0 12 months fig 3 a the out of bag estimate of the ensemble rmse is 16 months the model struggles to predict several lag times that exceed 60 months largely due to the low number of samples with exceptionally large tl in the training dataset fig 3b presents the predictor importance factors for the drought properties and geographic properties included in the random forest model the drought intensity during the lag time idlt is the most significant factor influencing the tl fig s3 followed by the mapr ta and ka the ka and t values have considerable uncertainty which may reduce their ability to predict the tl in the random forest model as indicated by the lower predictor importance values consistent with our observational study a previous modelling study found ka as the most important geographic property among ka elevation slope and specific yield controlling groundwater lags to precipitation hellwig et al 2020 comparing the variable importance factors from models with one of the northeast conus ecoregions excluded shows that the rank order of the most important predictors does not change when predicting the tl when all three ecoregions are excluded the importance rank of ka and can swaps places this sensitivity analysis provides strong evidence that our results are consistent throughout the conus despite the high concentration of observation wells in the northeast in a changing climate an important management consideration is to understand the most important set of factors geographic and or precipitation that control groundwater tl fig 4 a presents the r2 values of a single regression model between the aquifer tl at the start of a drought and explanatory variables including drought intensity blue crosses and a multivariate regression of tl and aquifer geographic properties orange crosses including elevation e aquifer hydraulic conductivity ka percent vegetation canopy cover can and the mean annual potential recharge mapr and temperature ta these geographic properties were selected because they were the factors with the highest predictor importance values fig 3b each cross represents the r2 value for the relation using data from 25 observation wells starting with the first 25 wells with the shallowest water levels we move the 25 well observation window by 1 location with a deeper groundwater level analogous to a moving window average until all wells have been included fig 4 demonstrates that the most important control on the tl for areas with deep groundwater levels 10 m below ground level m b g l is the precipitation drought intensity idlt and for shallow groundwater levels 3 m b g l is the geographic properties the purple crosses present the results of a multiple regression model with geographic properties that are most likely linked to et rates including e can and ta these three properties explain majority of the increase in geographic controls on tl at shallow groundwater depths 2 5 m b g l strong correlations between the shorter lag times of regions with deeper groundwater levels and idlt is counter intuitive and can be partly explained by the relation between the idlt and aquifer transmissivity t r 0 57 transmissivity increases in regions with deeper groundwater levels 5 m fig 4b suggesting that decreases in recharge during drought lead to faster groundwater recession rate in aquifers with larger diffusivity rousseau gueutin et al 2013 as can be seen in fig 4 the wtd influences what controls the lag time but the wtd does not directly control the lag time itself fig 3b 3 2 groundwater recovery from drought we apply the abcd drought detection method to characterize the time needed for an aquifer to recover the head lost during a drought tr across the conus fig 5 a we found that for 85 of droughts groundwater levels spanning across multiple aquifer systems have recovered from the drought within 10 years and the average tr is 3 years fig 5b this average tr represents the minimum average recovery time because droughts that had not been recovered from by the time another drought started or if the data series ended were excluded from the analysis in total 36 of the droughts in the record fit this criterion which could significantly alter the average tr the average storage recovery rate across conus is highest during the first post drought year where wells on average recover almost 60 of the head level lost during a drought the storage recovery rate declines quickly in subsequent years fig 5b this finding is consistent with a linear reservoir model of freshwater response to recharge rates in a freshwater saltwater boundary aquifer in florida usa klammler et al 2020 results also indicate that groundwater tr may be influenced by the presence of wet years with annual rainfall of 10 15 above average and a series of average to slightly above average rainfall years post precipitation drought is likely not sufficient to induce groundwater head recovery fig s4 the mean groundwater recovery trajectory presented in fig 5b is not consistent across all sites and varies depending on several factors fig 6 fig 6a presents the mean percent of hydraulic head recovered across all wells in each level i ecoregion wells in ecoregions 6 and 7 recover slower than the ones in ecoregions 5 and 8 which is partially attributable to the longer tl in ecoregions 6 and 7 the mapr impacts the recovery trajectory although the pattern is not very distinct across sites with higher mapr rates fig 6b in sites with 200 mm yr annual mapr the recovery is 50 in the first 3 post drought years compared to sites with higher mapr finally the water table depth wtd is the factor with the clearest impact on the recovery pathway greater wtd alters the recovery trajectory and increases the groundwater recovery time with increased vadose zone thickness fig 6c fig 7 a compares the tr predicted by the random forest model and the actual values as with the tl model the random forest model of tr performs well with a bias of 0 96 correlation coefficient of 0 89 and rmse of 0 26 years the out of bag estimate of the model ensemble rmse is 2 1 years the random forest model over predicts the tr when the actual tr is 4 years and under predicts tr when the actual tr is 8 years the head lost during the drought dgw is the most important factor that influences the tr followed by the mapr ta ks e and the canopy cover can fig 7b partial dependence plots revealed that higher dgw lower mapr higher ks and higher can all increase tr the effect of elevation is more complex and primarily exists at elevations below 500 m fig s5 the drought severity s is the most important precipitation control on the tr and plays an additional role by increasing the dgw as demonstrated by a statistically significant linear relation between s and dgw dgw 0 02s 0 23 p 0 004 as with the tl we tested building the random forest model with each one of the three ecoregions that are heavily populated with observation wells in the northeast when only one ecoregion is removed the predictor importance rankings are unchanged when all three ecoregions were removed the importance of mapr and elevation e swapped places if climate change increases drought severity aquifer tr should increase in the future although potential increases in extreme precipitation during wet periods may offset the impact 4 discussion 4 1 water table depth and controls on groundwater response time to drought from this analysis it is difficult to determine whether the drought properties intensity severity and duration or the geographic properties are more important in controlling the tl as shown here both sets of properties interact to impact the tl and consistent relations are found whether the tl at the start or the end of the drought is used based on our results the idlt is the most important factor for predicting the tl of multi year droughts fig 3b although idlt is a useful metric for understanding precipitation controls on tl it requires a priori knowledge of the tl and cannot be used independently to predict drought impacts on groundwater however the strong relation between idlt and tl figure s3 suggests that if precipitation droughts become more intense in the future the time lag between precipitation drought and groundwater response may decrease it is not surprising that mapr is the geographic property that most influences the tl arid regions with low annual recharge tend to have deeper water tables fan et al 2013 and thicker vadose zones for precipitation drought signals to traverse following this logic however it is surprising that the wtd has the least influence on tl the partial dependence plot fig s2a from the random forest model shows that the wtd is most important at very shallow depths 5m where the tl decreases as wtd increases from 0 to 5 m despite strong land atmosphere interactions in regions with shallow water table maxwell and kollet 2008 a long tl can occur because the wtd pattern often reflects topography driven lateral convergence fan et al 2013 a shallow wtd could be recharged remotely adding to the tl fan 2015 as a result regions with a shallow wtd can have a long tl if they are recharged remotely or a short tl if they are recharged locally the wtd plays an important role in determining whether the intensity of the precipitation drought or geographic properties are the primary controls on the tl fig 4 when a shallow wtd is the result of remote recharge this is intuitive as water must travel through the aquifer to reach the observation well additionally due to constant supply of moisture et can be temperature controlled maxwell and kollet 2008 when a shallow wtd is the result of local recharge we primarily attribute this response to the role of land surface atmosphere interactions and the two way feedbacks between groundwater loss and et rates in regions with shallow groundwater depths betts et al 1996 also plant roots are often lead to deeper soils by the presence of groundwater naumburg et al 2005 but they do not extend deep into the water table to avoid root anoxia stone and kalisz 1991 as a result plant roots are often found at interface between the water table and the vadose zone during a drought small increases in the depth to water table can disconnect plant roots from groundwater altering the aquifer response to drought this two way interaction between et and wtd may explain why the drought response of aquifers with a shallow wtd is more controlled by geographic properties that influence land atmosphere interactions than by precipitation drought intensity at water table depths 5 m the influence of groundwater on land atmosphere interactions is diminished and geographic controls become less important as water table depth increases from 5 to 10 m precipitation drought intensity becomes more important in controlling groundwater lag time to large droughts and fast aquifer response time is partly explained by increases in aquifer transmissivity fig 4b at wtd 25 m aquifer permeability and mean recharge rates further control the tl and define how responsive a groundwater system is as demonstrated by the difference between orange and purple crosses in fig 4a these results are consistent with the unsaturated zone simulations using hydrus 1d indicating that the magnitude and period of infiltration rates are more important than the ks in controlling the damping depth and lag time corona et al 2018 therefore shallow vadose zone properties cannot solely explain the tl response and other aquifer ka and hydrologic properties such as the idlt or mapr are more important in controlling groundwater response time in addition to feedbacks between wtd and land atmosphere interactions our results are consistent with the idea that deeper water tables tend to be more recharge controlled gleeson et al 2011 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 this pattern would suggest that the groundwater response to droughts in locations with deeper water tables would be more dependent on the changes in recharge rate caused by a drought than locations with shallow water tables 4 2 groundwater recovery process similar to groundwater lag time the groundwater recovery process is complex and is controlled by precipitation drought and geographic properties while recovery time mainly depends on the magnitude of groundwater depletion during droughts dgw controlled by precipitation drought severity fig 7b the relative importance of geographic properties is similar with the exception of mapr as illustrated in fig 1d groundwater recovery time depends on the lag time between the termination of precipitation drought and groundwater drought as well as time of rise of groundwater level to reach the 5 year mean pre drought well level we assessed variability in time of rise and found a mean value of 45 months with a standard deviation of 47 months this value is highly uncertain as we calculate the recovery time at an annual scale but the lag time at the monthly scale the conditions that allow groundwater levels to recover following a drought are very complex and remain poorly understood parry et al 2016 our results suggest that a return to average precipitation conditions is insufficient to create enough recharge to fully recover groundwater from a drought for example several sites along the northeast coast of conus do not recover the groundwater storage lost within 10 years of precipitation drought cessation although the lag time between the termination of precipitation and groundwater drought is short at these sites time of rise is very large because in each of these sites the end of the precipitation drought is followed by average precipitation years that do not allow full groundwater recovery although the majority of head lost is recovered this observation is consistent with our knowledge of episodic recharge events caused by infiltration pulses from well above average rainfall to recharge aquifers crosbie et al 2012 tashie et al 2016 4 3 drought definitions and identification while many indices and definitions for droughts exist including multivariate indices there is not a common approach to define drought and link a precipitation drought to a corresponding drought in groundwater aghakouchak et al 2021 ahmadi et al 2019 bloomfield and marchant 2013 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 mcevoy et al 2016 mckee et al 1993 drought definitions based on water availability p et are promising but et estimates at the continental scale contain considerable uncertainties as a result we only use precipitation data to select meteorological droughts as the identification of coinciding droughts in precipitation and groundwater is challenging we focus on multi year precipitation droughts that cause a corresponding drought in groundwater groundwater filters the precipitation signal and often does not respond to small events eltahir and yeh 1999 weider and boutt 2010 as a result our drought identification process is conservative in what we define as a drought fig s6 meaning that many smaller droughts or seasonal droughts are not included in this analysis future research to examine groundwater response to short i e not multi year droughts is warranted our focus on large droughts almost certainly biases our calculated tl and tr and it is unreasonable to assume groundwater recovery time of 3 years from a 1 month dry spell in this study we use the modified version of the yang et al 2017 approach which is demonstrated to be capable of quantifying lag times between two hydrologic metrics using cumulative anomalies of precipitation and groundwater time series while other methods for detecting change points in a time series exist such as the pettitt 1979 method the yang et al 2017 approach has been shown to be robust for hydrologic analysis yang et al 2014 to assess the robustness of our interpretations we calculate the groundwater lag time to drought using the cc method and compare it with the abcd method as the cc method provides an overall tl estimate for each site irrespective of precipitation properties average fig s7a and median fig s7b of tl values from the abcd method are compared with the cc method for each site in both cases statistically significant p 0 01 linear relations exist between the lag time estimates from the cc and abcd methods and the coefficient of determination with median values is slightly stronger r2 0 4 although the direct comparison between the tl estimates indicates significant uncertainty the controls on tl from each method are robust consistent with our previous results the mapr is the primary geographic factor impacting the cc based tl fig s8 5 conclusions we have shown a significant time lag of up to 15 years between the initiation or termination of a precipitation drought and the initiation or termination of a groundwater drought in unconfined aquifers not impacted by anthropogenic groundwater management while our focus is on groundwater response time to climate under stationary land use change with no pumping these two factors are important in most systems separating the impacts of droughts on groundwater in the presence of pumping is challenging in an observational study as the timing and magnitude of groundwater pumping are not often available we illustrate that the long and initially hidden legacy of precipitation droughts in aquifers with a range of climate and land cover conditions is important for determining groundwater recovery time and wtd affects whether precipitation or geographic properties will control the time lag finally the groundwater recovery time increases with increasing drought severity and the recovery trajectories mainly depend on the mean water table depth expected increases in drought severity in the future will likely increase aquifer vulnerability to droughts as aquifers recovery time may be longer climate change adaption strategies must therefore recognize that less groundwater will be available to supplement surface water supply during subsequent droughts credit authorship contribution statement adam p schreiner mcgraw

3998,groundwater is a life sustaining resource that supplies water to 2 billion people worldwide and is critical for agriculture despite the importance of groundwater understanding of groundwater recovery from meteorological droughts is limited here we utilize daily groundwater observations from unconfined aquifers without active groundwater management across the conterminous united states to illustrate that in response to a multi year drought it takes on average 3 years for shallow aquifers to recover the storage lost during the drought this recovery time increases with higher drought severity and is influenced by the time lag between the initiation termination of a meteorological drought and initiation termination of a groundwater drought there is considerable variation in the time lag duration up to 15 years in some aquifers controlled by geographic properties in regions with shallow water tables and precipitation characteristics in regions with deep water tables a machine learning algorithm finds that the most important controls on the time lag are the drought intensity at the beginning of the precipitation drought and the mean annual recharge projected increases in drought severity could potentially increase groundwater recovery times to droughts in a changing climate keywords groundwater drought aquifer recovery water resource management catchment characteristics groundwater storage 1 introduction droughts are responsible for billions of dollars in lost productivity each year and the projected increases in frequency and severity of droughts will impact water resource availability diffenbaugh et al 2015 trenberth 2011 since groundwater is often used to supplement declines in surface water resources during droughts alley 2006 giordano 2009 siebert et al 2010 the strategic importance of groundwater is likely to increase in the future as more frequent and intense climate extremes increase the variability in surface water availability taylor et al 2013 across the globe depth to groundwater most commonly ranges from 2 to 7 m which indicates the influence of land surface hydrology on groundwater dynamics through changes in climate variability and land cover cuthbert et al 2019 fan et al 2013 maxwell and miller 2005 groundwater response to changes in precipitation is often lagged as it takes time for the infiltrated water to reach groundwater van lanen and peters 2000 wossenyeleh et al 2020 yang et al 2017 in addition to reduced vertical infiltration the groundwater responds to changes in other boundary conditions such as the decreased streamflow that often accompanies drought this response time depends on the aquifer length horizontal distance between aquifer boundaries transmissivity and specific yield rousseau gueutin et al 2013 groundwater supplies 43 of irrigated agriculture worldwide elliott et al 2014 siebert et al 2010 and in drought conditions lags between the meteorological drought and groundwater response may result in overestimations of groundwater availability for pumping thus understanding drought groundwater interactions is critical in determining the sustainable groundwater abstraction rates during drought periods by humans in coupled food water energy systems several studies have used hydrologic models and find that both geographic properties climate geology land use elevation and the severity intensity and duration of precipitation drought are important to varying degrees in controlling meteorological drought impacts on baseflow van lanen et al 2013 van loon laaha 2015 van loon van lanen 2012 previous work has quantified the impact of aquifer properties on groundwater droughts finding that the thickness of the vadose zone and hydraulic diffusivity ratio of transmissivity to specific yield of aquifers are important controls on the lagged groundwater response to precipitation drought in the united kingdom bloomfield and marchant 2013 additionally recession of a groundwater hydrograph in the absence of recharge is a function of aquifer properties cuthbert 2014 as drought impacts diffuse recharge and streamflow and therefore focused recharge it is expected that properties of both the vadose zone and aquifer control the lagged groundwater response time to droughts wong et al 2012 droughts can be defined in many ways including meteorological drought as a result of reduced precipitation hydrologic drought affecting streamflow snow drought agricultural drought where declining soil moisture results in crop failure and groundwater drought due to decline in groundwater levels mishra and singh 2010 as a result the spatial and temporal scales of droughts vary depending on the definition used a significant challenge in quantifying the groundwater response to meteorological drought is quantifying consistent drought periods for different hydrologic metrics tijdeman et al 2018 the standardized precipitation index spi a normalized index is one of the most widely used meteorological drought indices mckee et al 1993 the standardized groundwater index sgi is based on similar principles and has been shown as an effective metric to quantify anomalies in groundwater level across a variety of locations bloomfield and marchant 2013 however matching a precipitation drought with a corresponding drought in groundwater level data remains a challenge previous researchers calculated the correlation between the spi with various accumulation periods i e 1 month 3 month etc and the monthly sgi to understand the aquifer controls on the groundwater lag time due to precipitation drought hellwig and stahl 2018 while correlation between the sgi and spi provides overall characteristic time lags between precipitation and groundwater bloomfield et al 2015 weider and boutt 2010 the time lags are independent of meteorological drought variability therefore the correlation based methods do not demonstrate the impacts of meteorological drought properties on groundwater response additionally it is not entirely clear whether precipitation or geographic characteristics are the dominant control on the groundwater response time to drought similar to the drought definition there is no clear consensus on defining drought termination parry et al 2016 indeed predicting the termination of precipitation drought is difficult as one or few intense rainfall events can abruptly end the drought mo 2011 recovery of groundwater storage from drought has typically been studied at a specific point in time when storage recovers rather than as a recovery process parry et al 2016 the recovery of groundwater from drought typically lags behind the recovery of other metrics such as streamflow wang et al 2016 recent work has also suggested that watersheds might never recover from drought and attributes this response to a shift in ecosystem state peterson et al 2021 while parry et al 2016 present a framework to analyze drought termination as a long term process it remains unclear what factors influence groundwater drought termination trajectories parry et al 2018 furthermore understanding the relative importance of factors that influence groundwater recovery from meteorological drought in unconfined aquifers remains an important challenge in hydrology here we analyze observation wells in unconfined aquifers mean depth to groundwater of 8 0 11 5 m standard deviation from the climate response network located across the conterminous united states conus for the time period of 1981 2017 fig 1 a we provide an observation based analysis of the groundwater response and recovery from multi year meteorological droughts in the absence of anthropogenic management we limit our analysis to multi year precipitation droughts that have a corresponding groundwater drought as there are multiple definitions for a drought we define a precipitation groundwater drought as a period of negative precipitation groundwater anomalies below a certain threshold our precise definitions are presented in section 2 2 our goal is to answer three primary questions 1 do precipitation or subsurface properties play a stronger role in controlling groundwater response time to precipitation drought initiation 2 what factors influence the trajectory of groundwater recovery to drought and 3 under what conditions are precipitation or geographic properties impacting lagged groundwater response to drought 2 methods 2 1 datasets groundwater level data from unconfined aquifers across the united states was obtained from the climate response network managed by the usgs https pubs usgs gov fs 2007 3003 for inclusion in the climate response network wells are selected so that groundwater level responds solely to climate fluctuations and not groundwater pumping or land use change we started with 634 observation wells that had multiple years of data available for this study we removed the small number of observation wells that were not located in single unconfined aquifers wells with long term trends in groundwater level were also removed from the analysis as these trends are likely representative of long term climate trends rather than distinct drought periods and computing groundwater lag and recovery times in these non stationary time series is challenging to be included an observation well needed to have at least 10 consecutive years of data and should not be located under irrigated lands irrigated lands are defined by the 250 m resolution mirad dataset which merges remote sensing data and county level irrigated area statistics to estimate irrigation brown and pervez 2014 although many of the observation wells are located in the heavily populated northeast united states groundwater pumping is minimal in these states and the groundwater systems are not heavily managed by humans dieter et al 2018 additionally according to the 2016 national land cover dataset none of the wells are located in areas with medium or high intensity development and only 9 of the wells are located in areas with low intensity development there were 266 observation wells within the conus region that fit our criterion during the 1981 2017 period fig 1a consistent with the temporal availability of high quality precipitation data from prism daly et al 2001 daly et al 1994 the geographic properties included here include both land surface and subsurface data land surface data consists of a 30 arc second 1 km digital elevation model of the conus land surface elevation e gtopo30 dataset danielson and gesch 2011 and the percent canopy cover can from the 2016 national land cover dataset as we do not have high quality canopy cover data for each year of our analysis we assume constant canopy cover in time mean air temperature ta data is acquired from the prism 1981 2010 30 year normals the subsurface data includes soil and aquifer hydraulic conductivity and mean annual potential recharge mapr soil hydraulic conductivity over the top 2 m of soil ks were obtained by the weighted average of hydraulic conductivity values from the polaris dataset chaney et al 2016 aquifer hydraulic conductivity ka values were obtained from the glhymps dataset based on a global lithology map with standard hydraulic conductivity values assigned to each rock type gleeson et al 2014 we assume that the well depth is representative of the aquifer thickness to approximately calculate the transmissivity t of an unconfined aquifer by multiplying the hydraulic conductivity values by the well depth minus the minimum observed depth to water table the mapr is the residual of water balance observations across the united states and was obtained from the usgs reitz et al 2017 2 2 drought recognition algorithm many drought indices have been proposed zargar et al 2011 to quantify specific aspects of a drought i e meteorological agricultural etc in order to use a consistent metric for both meteorological and groundwater droughts we define drought solely based on the monthly and annual anomalies of precipitation and groundwater time series calculated relative to the 37 year or maximum available data period for sites with 37 years mean of monthly or annual time series respectively yang et al 2017 because precipitation and shallow groundwater storage exhibit strong seasonality eltahir and yeh 1999 the seasonal cycle from the monthly precipitation and groundwater level data are removed to compute monthly anomalies following li and rodell 2015 a key challenge for this study is associating groundwater decline to a corresponding decline in precipitation although short term precipitation fluctuations can impact shallow groundwater levels we only include sufficiently large drought periods in groundwater to clearly associate them with precipitation declines to accomplish this we first calculate the annual precipitation or groundwater anomaly and smooth it with a 3 year moving average window this filtering prevents a single wet year from interrupting a long and significant dry period to select a multi year precipitation drought period we define a drought period as any period of 3 year or more smoothed annual negative anomalies where the negative anomalies are larger than a 5 threshold with this approach the 3 year smoothed annual negative precipitation anomalies are obtained by either short and intense dry periods or long and not as intense dry periods we also selected a moving window of shorter than 3 years and a smaller threshold to define precipitation droughts but this selection resulted in identifying many precipitation droughts that do not have a corresponding groundwater drought for example defining a drought using annual precipitation anomalies and a 5 threshold resulted in identifying115 precipitation droughts that did not have corresponding groundwater droughts similarly setting the anomaly threshold at 0 i e any negative precipitation anomaly over a 3 year smoothing period is a drought resulted in detecting many small precipitation droughts that did not correspond with a groundwater drought therefore the 3 year smoothed annual precipitation anomalies with the threshold of 5 were used in the rest of the analysis we use a change detection analysis to determine the monthly start and end time of droughts from the monthly anomaly series we call this approach the anomaly based change detection abcd approach fig 1b to determine a specific month for the start and end of a drought we make use of the methods from yang et al 2017 after determining the approximate start or end year of a drought a period with 3 year smoothed annual precipitation anomalies of 5 or more below average we apply a piecewise linear function to the monthly anomaly time series to detect the turning points in the time series which indicate the beginning or end of a drought y β o β 1 t t α β o β 1 t β 2 t α t α where y is the time series of monthly precipitation anomalies t is the time in months βo β1 and β2 are coefficients and α is the turning point for the start of a drought different values of α are tested starting with 12 months before the first year of a drought 3 year smoothed anomaly is below the 5 threshold and ending with 12 months after the first year of the drought for a total of a 3 year window for each value of α least squares regression is used to fit the β coefficients and we use a t test to test statistical significance of β2 within this 3 year time window 36 months the value of α that produces the most significant β2 value is determined to be the drought starting point if no statistically significant β2 value is found the drought is not used in our analysis this same process is repeated at the end of a drought to determine the month at which the drought terminates this change detection approach has been shown effective for hydrologic datasets yang et al 2017 2014 groundwater droughts are detected using the same approach as precipitation droughts to define a groundwater drought however we require the 3 year smoothed annual anomalies to be negative i e 0 anomaly rather than less than a 5 anomaly finally we performed a manual check to ensure that each precipitation drought was associated with a drought identified in the groundwater time series if a precipitation drought does not correspond to a groundwater drought the precipitation drought was removed from the analysis in accordance with these drought periods we define the groundwater lag time tl and the recovery time tr the groundwater tl is calculated for both the start and end of a drought defined as the time lag between the start end of a precipitation drought fig 1b and the start end of the associated groundwater drought fig 1c this time lag represents the time that it takes until changes in precipitation propagate through the vadose zone and or changes in streamflow in a connected surface water groundwater system impact groundwater levels van lanen and peters 2000 the recovery time tr consists of the time lag between the cessation of negative monthly precipitation and groundwater anomalies negative anomalies become less negative than the identified thresholds and the time needed for the groundwater levels to rise to the 5 year average pre drought groundwater levels fig 1d as our focus is on multi year groundwater droughts no droughts overlapped the 5 year pre drought period with this approach we detected 332 droughts meeting our criteria present in both the precipitation and groundwater records every well presented in fig 1 has at least one drought identified we define several metrics to represent the strength of the precipitation drought the drought duration dd is the number of months between the start and the end of the precipitation drought the drought severity s is defined as the sum of the monthly precipitation anomalies during the precipitation drought divided by the mean precipitation expressed as a percentage to compare drought severities across the variable climate zones the drought intensity i is the drought severity divided by the duration expressed with units of mon finally the drought intensity during the lag time idlt is the drought severity during the tl divided by the tl to validate our method we also calculated the lag time between groundwater and precipitation time series using the standardized drought indices for each well location we calculate the spi and sgi metrics using a non parametric approach farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 and calculate the correlation coefficients between the spi estimated for different accumulation periods q where q 1 2 3 360 months and the monthly sgi we define the lag time of an aquifer as the spi accumulation period that provides the highest correlation with the sgi time series and call this method the correlation coefficient cc based lag time estimation method this method does not identify corresponding droughts in precipitation and groundwater time series and is only used to validate our approach locations with a maximum correlation coefficient of 0 4 were excluded from the analysis the value of 0 4 was chosen to include as many sites as possible while removing several sites with anomalously long lag times and poor correlation coefficients the effect of this threshold is explored in table s1 2 3 random forest model of lag and recovery times we apply a random forest method to identify the factors that most control the tl and tr breiman 2001 random forest models consist of an ensemble of decision trees used for either classification or regression denisko and hoffman 2018 this approach has been widely used to identify the most important factors that influence a dataset liu et al 2020 in this contribution we use regression based random forest models by including multiple factors that have been previously suggested to impact the tl or tr and examine their relative importance in predicting them for the tl these factors include the precipitation drought properties i s dd and idlt and the geographic properties mean depth to water table wtd mapr e ka ks can t and ta for the tr we omit the idlt from the drought properties and include the head depletion during the drought period dgw transmissivity as well as hydraulic conductivity estimates are included in the model because the aquifer response time depends on the saturated thickness hydraulic conductivity and storage properties cuthbert 2014 and in unconfined aquifers saturated thickness varies with changes in hydraulic head as higher aquifer diffusivity results in a shorter groundwater response time to changes in hydraulic perturbation it is important to include transmissivity in addition to hydraulic conductivity in the random forest model typically random forest models are unaffected by the inclusion of two correlated variables genuer et al 2010 but for completeness we build the model with each of ka and t separately and find that the predictor importance values do not vary we use permutation of the out of bag predictor observations to identify the most important factors in controlling the tl and tr as each decision tree is built from a random sample with replacement generally a higher number of trees results in better performance we use different numbers of trees 10 50 100 500 1000 to control the quality of the regression tree ensemble the variable importance factors are similar between the different numbers of trees so we present values from the case with 1000 trees to ensure the highest accuracy to validate the model performance we calculate the out of bag error estimates for each decision tree and present the cumulative ensemble error we also perform a pseudo validation by comparing the predicted tl or tr from the random forest model to the observed values finally to test if our results are biased by the large number of observations in the northeast of conus ecoregions 5 3 8 1 and 8 4 we build three random forest models where in each model data from one of the three ecoregions is excluded and a model where all three ecoregions are excluded 3 results following the abcd method 332 droughts were detected across conus the mean number of droughts per well is 1 2 and the maximum is 4 an anova analysis reveals that no statistically significant differences exist between the average number of droughts per well in different ecoregions the mean duration of a precipitation drought is 53 months range 11 211 months while for a groundwater drought is 55 months range 13 220 months the severity of precipitation droughts ranges from 5 to 49 with a mean of 18 4 while the intensity of precipitation droughts ranges from 0 03 to 3 1 mon with a mean of 0 51 mon 3 1 lagged groundwater response to large precipitation drought we first explore the spatial patterns in tl at the start of a drought across the conus fig 2 a across the conus the mean tl at the start end of a drought is 20 1 16 7 months the tl at the start of a drought ranges from 1 to 185 months and ranges from 1 to 184 months at the end of a drought the tl appears to decrease in the eastern conus and is correlated with the mapr r 0 31 p 0 0001 the majority of wells have relatively short tl 24 months fig s1 but this result appears to be an artifact of the large number of observation wells located in the humid northeast of the conus previous studies have found that basin average lag times are generally shorter than 1 year in humid regions bloomfield and marchant 2013 boxplots present the average tl value for various ecoregions at the start fig 2b and end fig 2c of droughts a paired t test demonstrates that there are not significant differences p 0 05 between the tl at the start or end of a drought for each ecoregion a 1 way anova analysis reveals that there are statistically significant differences in the mean tl between several different ecoregions for both the tl at the start and end of a drought though no ecoregion s average tl is significantly different from the tl of all other ecoregions generally the ecoregions 6 7 9 and 10 which cover most of the western united states have the longest tl while ecoregions 8 1 8 4 eastern u s wooded plains and 5 3 atlantic highlands have the shortest tl ecoregion 7 1 also exhibits the largest variability in tl particularly at the end of a drought followed by ecoregions 6 2 and 10 1 at the beginning of the drought fig 2b 2c ecoregions in the western conus have the largest variability in tl generally a result of long lag times and drier conditions than the eastern ecoregions a comparison between the actual and predicted tl from the random forest model reveals that the model accurately predicts the tl for a specific drought at a given site with a bias of 0 99 a correlation coefficient r of 0 89 and a root mean square error rmse of 0 12 months fig 3 a the out of bag estimate of the ensemble rmse is 16 months the model struggles to predict several lag times that exceed 60 months largely due to the low number of samples with exceptionally large tl in the training dataset fig 3b presents the predictor importance factors for the drought properties and geographic properties included in the random forest model the drought intensity during the lag time idlt is the most significant factor influencing the tl fig s3 followed by the mapr ta and ka the ka and t values have considerable uncertainty which may reduce their ability to predict the tl in the random forest model as indicated by the lower predictor importance values consistent with our observational study a previous modelling study found ka as the most important geographic property among ka elevation slope and specific yield controlling groundwater lags to precipitation hellwig et al 2020 comparing the variable importance factors from models with one of the northeast conus ecoregions excluded shows that the rank order of the most important predictors does not change when predicting the tl when all three ecoregions are excluded the importance rank of ka and can swaps places this sensitivity analysis provides strong evidence that our results are consistent throughout the conus despite the high concentration of observation wells in the northeast in a changing climate an important management consideration is to understand the most important set of factors geographic and or precipitation that control groundwater tl fig 4 a presents the r2 values of a single regression model between the aquifer tl at the start of a drought and explanatory variables including drought intensity blue crosses and a multivariate regression of tl and aquifer geographic properties orange crosses including elevation e aquifer hydraulic conductivity ka percent vegetation canopy cover can and the mean annual potential recharge mapr and temperature ta these geographic properties were selected because they were the factors with the highest predictor importance values fig 3b each cross represents the r2 value for the relation using data from 25 observation wells starting with the first 25 wells with the shallowest water levels we move the 25 well observation window by 1 location with a deeper groundwater level analogous to a moving window average until all wells have been included fig 4 demonstrates that the most important control on the tl for areas with deep groundwater levels 10 m below ground level m b g l is the precipitation drought intensity idlt and for shallow groundwater levels 3 m b g l is the geographic properties the purple crosses present the results of a multiple regression model with geographic properties that are most likely linked to et rates including e can and ta these three properties explain majority of the increase in geographic controls on tl at shallow groundwater depths 2 5 m b g l strong correlations between the shorter lag times of regions with deeper groundwater levels and idlt is counter intuitive and can be partly explained by the relation between the idlt and aquifer transmissivity t r 0 57 transmissivity increases in regions with deeper groundwater levels 5 m fig 4b suggesting that decreases in recharge during drought lead to faster groundwater recession rate in aquifers with larger diffusivity rousseau gueutin et al 2013 as can be seen in fig 4 the wtd influences what controls the lag time but the wtd does not directly control the lag time itself fig 3b 3 2 groundwater recovery from drought we apply the abcd drought detection method to characterize the time needed for an aquifer to recover the head lost during a drought tr across the conus fig 5 a we found that for 85 of droughts groundwater levels spanning across multiple aquifer systems have recovered from the drought within 10 years and the average tr is 3 years fig 5b this average tr represents the minimum average recovery time because droughts that had not been recovered from by the time another drought started or if the data series ended were excluded from the analysis in total 36 of the droughts in the record fit this criterion which could significantly alter the average tr the average storage recovery rate across conus is highest during the first post drought year where wells on average recover almost 60 of the head level lost during a drought the storage recovery rate declines quickly in subsequent years fig 5b this finding is consistent with a linear reservoir model of freshwater response to recharge rates in a freshwater saltwater boundary aquifer in florida usa klammler et al 2020 results also indicate that groundwater tr may be influenced by the presence of wet years with annual rainfall of 10 15 above average and a series of average to slightly above average rainfall years post precipitation drought is likely not sufficient to induce groundwater head recovery fig s4 the mean groundwater recovery trajectory presented in fig 5b is not consistent across all sites and varies depending on several factors fig 6 fig 6a presents the mean percent of hydraulic head recovered across all wells in each level i ecoregion wells in ecoregions 6 and 7 recover slower than the ones in ecoregions 5 and 8 which is partially attributable to the longer tl in ecoregions 6 and 7 the mapr impacts the recovery trajectory although the pattern is not very distinct across sites with higher mapr rates fig 6b in sites with 200 mm yr annual mapr the recovery is 50 in the first 3 post drought years compared to sites with higher mapr finally the water table depth wtd is the factor with the clearest impact on the recovery pathway greater wtd alters the recovery trajectory and increases the groundwater recovery time with increased vadose zone thickness fig 6c fig 7 a compares the tr predicted by the random forest model and the actual values as with the tl model the random forest model of tr performs well with a bias of 0 96 correlation coefficient of 0 89 and rmse of 0 26 years the out of bag estimate of the model ensemble rmse is 2 1 years the random forest model over predicts the tr when the actual tr is 4 years and under predicts tr when the actual tr is 8 years the head lost during the drought dgw is the most important factor that influences the tr followed by the mapr ta ks e and the canopy cover can fig 7b partial dependence plots revealed that higher dgw lower mapr higher ks and higher can all increase tr the effect of elevation is more complex and primarily exists at elevations below 500 m fig s5 the drought severity s is the most important precipitation control on the tr and plays an additional role by increasing the dgw as demonstrated by a statistically significant linear relation between s and dgw dgw 0 02s 0 23 p 0 004 as with the tl we tested building the random forest model with each one of the three ecoregions that are heavily populated with observation wells in the northeast when only one ecoregion is removed the predictor importance rankings are unchanged when all three ecoregions were removed the importance of mapr and elevation e swapped places if climate change increases drought severity aquifer tr should increase in the future although potential increases in extreme precipitation during wet periods may offset the impact 4 discussion 4 1 water table depth and controls on groundwater response time to drought from this analysis it is difficult to determine whether the drought properties intensity severity and duration or the geographic properties are more important in controlling the tl as shown here both sets of properties interact to impact the tl and consistent relations are found whether the tl at the start or the end of the drought is used based on our results the idlt is the most important factor for predicting the tl of multi year droughts fig 3b although idlt is a useful metric for understanding precipitation controls on tl it requires a priori knowledge of the tl and cannot be used independently to predict drought impacts on groundwater however the strong relation between idlt and tl figure s3 suggests that if precipitation droughts become more intense in the future the time lag between precipitation drought and groundwater response may decrease it is not surprising that mapr is the geographic property that most influences the tl arid regions with low annual recharge tend to have deeper water tables fan et al 2013 and thicker vadose zones for precipitation drought signals to traverse following this logic however it is surprising that the wtd has the least influence on tl the partial dependence plot fig s2a from the random forest model shows that the wtd is most important at very shallow depths 5m where the tl decreases as wtd increases from 0 to 5 m despite strong land atmosphere interactions in regions with shallow water table maxwell and kollet 2008 a long tl can occur because the wtd pattern often reflects topography driven lateral convergence fan et al 2013 a shallow wtd could be recharged remotely adding to the tl fan 2015 as a result regions with a shallow wtd can have a long tl if they are recharged remotely or a short tl if they are recharged locally the wtd plays an important role in determining whether the intensity of the precipitation drought or geographic properties are the primary controls on the tl fig 4 when a shallow wtd is the result of remote recharge this is intuitive as water must travel through the aquifer to reach the observation well additionally due to constant supply of moisture et can be temperature controlled maxwell and kollet 2008 when a shallow wtd is the result of local recharge we primarily attribute this response to the role of land surface atmosphere interactions and the two way feedbacks between groundwater loss and et rates in regions with shallow groundwater depths betts et al 1996 also plant roots are often lead to deeper soils by the presence of groundwater naumburg et al 2005 but they do not extend deep into the water table to avoid root anoxia stone and kalisz 1991 as a result plant roots are often found at interface between the water table and the vadose zone during a drought small increases in the depth to water table can disconnect plant roots from groundwater altering the aquifer response to drought this two way interaction between et and wtd may explain why the drought response of aquifers with a shallow wtd is more controlled by geographic properties that influence land atmosphere interactions than by precipitation drought intensity at water table depths 5 m the influence of groundwater on land atmosphere interactions is diminished and geographic controls become less important as water table depth increases from 5 to 10 m precipitation drought intensity becomes more important in controlling groundwater lag time to large droughts and fast aquifer response time is partly explained by increases in aquifer transmissivity fig 4b at wtd 25 m aquifer permeability and mean recharge rates further control the tl and define how responsive a groundwater system is as demonstrated by the difference between orange and purple crosses in fig 4a these results are consistent with the unsaturated zone simulations using hydrus 1d indicating that the magnitude and period of infiltration rates are more important than the ks in controlling the damping depth and lag time corona et al 2018 therefore shallow vadose zone properties cannot solely explain the tl response and other aquifer ka and hydrologic properties such as the idlt or mapr are more important in controlling groundwater response time in addition to feedbacks between wtd and land atmosphere interactions our results are consistent with the idea that deeper water tables tend to be more recharge controlled gleeson et al 2011 haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 this pattern would suggest that the groundwater response to droughts in locations with deeper water tables would be more dependent on the changes in recharge rate caused by a drought than locations with shallow water tables 4 2 groundwater recovery process similar to groundwater lag time the groundwater recovery process is complex and is controlled by precipitation drought and geographic properties while recovery time mainly depends on the magnitude of groundwater depletion during droughts dgw controlled by precipitation drought severity fig 7b the relative importance of geographic properties is similar with the exception of mapr as illustrated in fig 1d groundwater recovery time depends on the lag time between the termination of precipitation drought and groundwater drought as well as time of rise of groundwater level to reach the 5 year mean pre drought well level we assessed variability in time of rise and found a mean value of 45 months with a standard deviation of 47 months this value is highly uncertain as we calculate the recovery time at an annual scale but the lag time at the monthly scale the conditions that allow groundwater levels to recover following a drought are very complex and remain poorly understood parry et al 2016 our results suggest that a return to average precipitation conditions is insufficient to create enough recharge to fully recover groundwater from a drought for example several sites along the northeast coast of conus do not recover the groundwater storage lost within 10 years of precipitation drought cessation although the lag time between the termination of precipitation and groundwater drought is short at these sites time of rise is very large because in each of these sites the end of the precipitation drought is followed by average precipitation years that do not allow full groundwater recovery although the majority of head lost is recovered this observation is consistent with our knowledge of episodic recharge events caused by infiltration pulses from well above average rainfall to recharge aquifers crosbie et al 2012 tashie et al 2016 4 3 drought definitions and identification while many indices and definitions for droughts exist including multivariate indices there is not a common approach to define drought and link a precipitation drought to a corresponding drought in groundwater aghakouchak et al 2021 ahmadi et al 2019 bloomfield and marchant 2013 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 mcevoy et al 2016 mckee et al 1993 drought definitions based on water availability p et are promising but et estimates at the continental scale contain considerable uncertainties as a result we only use precipitation data to select meteorological droughts as the identification of coinciding droughts in precipitation and groundwater is challenging we focus on multi year precipitation droughts that cause a corresponding drought in groundwater groundwater filters the precipitation signal and often does not respond to small events eltahir and yeh 1999 weider and boutt 2010 as a result our drought identification process is conservative in what we define as a drought fig s6 meaning that many smaller droughts or seasonal droughts are not included in this analysis future research to examine groundwater response to short i e not multi year droughts is warranted our focus on large droughts almost certainly biases our calculated tl and tr and it is unreasonable to assume groundwater recovery time of 3 years from a 1 month dry spell in this study we use the modified version of the yang et al 2017 approach which is demonstrated to be capable of quantifying lag times between two hydrologic metrics using cumulative anomalies of precipitation and groundwater time series while other methods for detecting change points in a time series exist such as the pettitt 1979 method the yang et al 2017 approach has been shown to be robust for hydrologic analysis yang et al 2014 to assess the robustness of our interpretations we calculate the groundwater lag time to drought using the cc method and compare it with the abcd method as the cc method provides an overall tl estimate for each site irrespective of precipitation properties average fig s7a and median fig s7b of tl values from the abcd method are compared with the cc method for each site in both cases statistically significant p 0 01 linear relations exist between the lag time estimates from the cc and abcd methods and the coefficient of determination with median values is slightly stronger r2 0 4 although the direct comparison between the tl estimates indicates significant uncertainty the controls on tl from each method are robust consistent with our previous results the mapr is the primary geographic factor impacting the cc based tl fig s8 5 conclusions we have shown a significant time lag of up to 15 years between the initiation or termination of a precipitation drought and the initiation or termination of a groundwater drought in unconfined aquifers not impacted by anthropogenic groundwater management while our focus is on groundwater response time to climate under stationary land use change with no pumping these two factors are important in most systems separating the impacts of droughts on groundwater in the presence of pumping is challenging in an observational study as the timing and magnitude of groundwater pumping are not often available we illustrate that the long and initially hidden legacy of precipitation droughts in aquifers with a range of climate and land cover conditions is important for determining groundwater recovery time and wtd affects whether precipitation or geographic properties will control the time lag finally the groundwater recovery time increases with increasing drought severity and the recovery trajectories mainly depend on the mean water table depth expected increases in drought severity in the future will likely increase aquifer vulnerability to droughts as aquifers recovery time may be longer climate change adaption strategies must therefore recognize that less groundwater will be available to supplement surface water supply during subsequent droughts credit authorship contribution statement adam p schreiner mcgraw

3999,the accurate characterization of the underground depositional structure and hydraulic property distribution is essential to understand flow and solute transport in heterogeneous rocks or soils hydraulic tomography was shown to be an efficient technique to infer the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties due to the fact that information about the sedimentary structures distribution is not always available to allow a three dimensional characterization many of existing field applications of hydraulic tomography have been limited to two dimensional imaging along horizontal layer or vertical profiles where hydraulic data were collected in this work we explore the potential of combining tomographic pumping and flowmeter tests responses in an inverse approach for three dimensional aquifer characterization the tomographic pumping data provide information about the lateral hydraulic connections between boreholes while the flowmeter data constrain the vertical heterogeneity structure the inverse approach is first validated using two synthetics models composed of multi layered depositional structures and heterogeneous hydraulic properties within each layer it is shown that adding the information provided by the flowmeter profiles the inverted model exhibits more realistic depositional features we then apply the proposed approach to characterize the 3d hydraulic conductivity field controlled by sedimentary structure of an experimental site in layered porous rocks the inverted hydraulic conductivity field is in a good agreement with permeability measurement on drilled cores the proposed method offers an efficient and low cost approach for rapid assessment of the hydraulic properties in 3d and could be extrapolated to other field applications keywords aquifer characterization hydraulic tomography flowmeter pumping tests 1 introduction the characterization of hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity and specific storage is very important in groundwater modeling and water resources management hubbard and rubin 2005 contaminant transport has always been strongly dependent on the accuracy of the hydraulic properties characterization a minor change in hydraulic properties may alter transport behaviors significantly zheng and gorelick 2003 because direct measurements of hydraulic properties are limited in real world applications early analytical analysis of aquifer hydraulic response to pumping injection often adopts a homogeneous assumption e g theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 it may be enough to infer the bulk aquifer property however it cannot capture most of the transient behavior of the tested aquifer in addition to pumping tests several other hydraulic testing methods such as slug tests yeh et al 1995 and flowmeter tests rehfeldt et al 1992 klepikova et al 2013 tamayo mas et al 2018 are being used to provide non redundant information with respect to pumping tests about the aquifer hydraulic tomography ht has been developed over the last two decades e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 butler et al 1999 bohling et al 2002 bohling and butler 2010 yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 zhu and yeh 2006 liu et al 2002 liu et al 2007 illman et al 2010 cardiff et al 2009 zha et al 2014 this approach has shown a great potential for reconstructing detailed spatial distributions of hydraulic parameters comparing to the traditional analytical solutions hydraulic tomography yields a detailed two or three dimensional map of hydraulic heterogeneity for regions within between the testing boreholes where constraining hydraulic head responses to cross hole pumping are collected the efficiency of ht has been demonstrated in many laboratory scale e g liu et al 2007 illman et al 2007 illman et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 and field scale studies e g bohling et al 2007 brauchler et al 2011 brauchler et al 2013 berg and illman 2011 cardiff et al 2012 fischer et al 2020 for a full 3d hydraulic tomography using only one observation from each testing well is not sufficient and packer tests are often required bohling et al 2007 berg and illman 2011 zha et al 2016 zha et al 2017 cardiff et al 2012 zhao and illman 2017 wen et al 2020 however packer tests which are costly and complex to set up are not always available in each experiment site without packer tests pumping tests data remain insufficient to capture the three dimensional aquifer behavior and may lead to erroneous characterization and sometimes model instability in layered aquifers in recent years other information such as geological and geophysical data have been used to constrain the inverse process of ht e g zha et al 2017 tso et al 2016 soueid ahmed et al 2015 the most widely used geostatistics based inverse modelling approaches are the quasi linear geostatistical approach kitanidis 1995 and the successive linear estimator sle yeh et al 1996 to improve efficiency when dealing with highly parameterized inverse problems different approaches were developed including principle component geostatistical approach kitanidis and lee 2014 reduced order sle zha et al 2018 and the use of geostatistical reduced order models liu et al 2013 previous works have highlighted the benefits of incorporating site specific geologic structure information into groundwater models when ht data are limited zha et al 2017 tso et al 2016 zha et al 2017 worked on quantitative incorporation of site specific information into groundwater models and introduced a general method to derive conditional mean and conditional covariance that can be used in ht analysis as prior information tso et al 2016 also concluded that only incorporating a qualitative facies trend information already yields a better conductivity estimate such improvement can also be seen in hydraulic conductivity estimates through laboratory field applications zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 de clercq et al 2020 used electrical resistivity maps to structure the distribution of the hydraulic properties in a 3d ht flowmeter surveys characterize the vertical inflow profile of a given well paillet 1998 molz et al 1994 zlotnik and zurbuchen 2003 williams and paillet 2002 day lewis et al 2011 they are a widely used approach to determine vertical profiles of hydraulic conductivities at well locations complex geological medias are often layered systems and flowmeter analysis has shown its efficiency to detect the main layers contributing to the total pumped flux day lewis et al 2011 paillet and reese 2000 flowmeter profiling can also be used to detect the well crossing fractures that contribute to flow day lewis et al 2011 roubinet et al 2015 flowmeter tests are easy and cheap but bulky and the investigated height is limited due to the space taken by the pump and the generated drawdown flowmeter tests may provide a new set of information and have been included in inverse modelling problems for instance fienen et al 2004 used a bayesian inverse approach to interpret the vertical hydraulic conductivity in a heterogeneous fractured aquifer other applications used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity values from flowmeter tests in the transmissivity map to constrain the geostatistical inversions e g rehfeldt et al 1992 chen et al 2001 in other studies flux measurements have also been used as observation data additional to hydraulic heads in hydraulic tomography li et al 2008 zha et al 2014 tso et al 2016 combining different hydraulic tests that characterize different parts of the aquifer may lead into a good characterization for example combining flowmeter tests data that give vertical information with pumping tests data that give lateral information might be a good alternative to obtain a three dimensional characterization of the aquifer without packer tests in this paper we integrate vertical hydrogeological information obtained from flowmeter surveys and horizontal information from cross hole pumping tests to achieve a 3d transient hydraulic tomographic tht characterization of sedimentary layered rocks the flowmeter data are incorporated to ht through the construction of conditional initial mean and covariance of model parameter we first validate the proposed inversion framework using synthetic data from a two dimensional cross section model and a three dimensional model we then apply the inverse approach to a real world study in an experimental site composed of layered porous rocks in the end we analyze the data fitting effectiveness and geological coherence of the inverted hydraulic conductivity fields 2 methodology the objective of the study is to integrate two sets of data to obtain spatialized hydraulic conductivity estimates through hydraulic tomography the first dataset corresponds to drawdown responses to pumping tests that give information about lateral variation of hydraulic properties the second dataset consists in flowmeter logs measured in every well of the site that give vertical information see fig 1 for datasets scheme flowmeter logs are first interpreted and converted into hydraulic conductivity profiles then the interpreted hydraulic conductivity profiles are interpolated using a triangular base bilinear or trilinear interpolation in order to obtain a continuous two or three dimensional hydraulic conductivity map between the wells and we use nearest neighbors interpolation for the rest of the inversion domain where the linear interpolation cannot be evaluated after that an inverse modelling approach is used to reconstruct the hydraulic conductivity distribution using interpolated map as a prior information we use the principal component geostatistical approach a deterministic iterative procedure that updates the conditional mean and the conditional covariance by matching model responses to the pumping tests observations 2 1 groundwater flow model we solve the problem of three dimensional transient fluid flow through a confined saturated and heterogeneous porous media the system is solved in transient regime and is described by the following equations 1 s s h t k h q with 2 h t 0 h 0 h φ h 0 where is the gradient operator ss is the specific storage which assumed constant in this study h is the hydraulic head k the hydraulic conductivity q the source term and h0 is the initial hydraulic head which remains constant at the boundary conditions φ the forward flow model is solved using a finite element method using unstructured mesh see fig r3 in supplementary materials 2 2 flowmeter analysis the applied approach of flowmeter data analyses is described in molz et al 1989 which is based on the study of flow in a layered stratified aquifer by javandel and witherspoon 1969 assuming that the idealized aquifer is layered and the flow quickly becomes horizontal even with high contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the layers the flow of a given layer is proportional to the hydraulic conductivity of that layer and the sum of the different flow rates into the well is equal to the pump flow rate during the pumping test during our flowmeter test water is extracted from an open hole well and once steady state is reached a spinner flowmeter is swept along the well from the bottom of the well to the top and a vertical flow rate profile is measured in most common cases when the pump is located at the top the flow rate log will have the trend of an increasing curve starting from a zero value at the bottom to a max value at the top that will correspond to the total extracted flux from the well the increase in flow rate over a certain depth increment is correlated to the relative hydraulic conductivity profile higher the hydraulic conductivity stronger the rate increase flowmeter tests therefore provide relative values of hydraulic conductivity distribution along the borehole in order to extract the absolute values an effective value of hydraulic conductivity of the well obtainable from the interpretation single hole of a pumping tests will be used single hole flowmeter data can be analyzed to estimate conductivity profiles along boreholes and characterize aquifer compartmentalization molz et al 1989 kabala 1994 paillet 1998 if a well is subject to a pumping with a pump placed at the top of the well working at the rate qp the underground layers connected to that well will contribute to the total extracted flux their contribution is proportional to their hydraulic conductivity for the following equations b m refers to the aquifer thickness z0 m the reference level of the borehole bottom and z m the height above the bottom fig 2 in an idealized layered aquifer the flow into the well from a given layer is proportional to the transmissivity of that layer 3 δ q i α δ z i k i where α m is a constant of proportionality δqi m3 s corresponds to the induced flow increments observed in the borehole along the ith increment of height δzi m that has a hydraulic conductivity ki m s the average horizontal hydraulic conductivity k avg can be expressed by 4 k a v g k i δ z i b the cumulative flow qcum b over the aquifer thickness can be expressed as follows 5 q c u m b z 0 b q z d z q p i δ q i α i δ z i k i α k a v g b by substituting the sum α can be solved as 6 α q p k a v g b then the hydraulic conductivity of each layer can be quantified by 7 k i δ q i k a v g b q p δ z i 2 3 principal component geostatistical approach in order to optimize the hydraulic conductivity field in the model we use the principal component geostatistical approach pcga kitanidis and lee 2014 the observation equation that links the m unknown hydraulic conductivities stored in a vector s to the observation data hydraulic heads stored in a matrix y is kitanidis 1995 8 y h s v where h is the forward model v is the observation error with a random normal distribution with mean 0 and variance r which is usually the error measurement multiplied by the identity matrix the prior probability of s is a gaussian distribution with mean x β generalized by a covariance matrix q x is a m vector of ones and β represents the mean hydraulic conductivity value the posterior probability density function objective function l of s and β is given by 9 l 1 2 y h s t r 1 y h s 1 2 s x β t q 1 s x β the optimization of the hydraulic conductivity values is obtained by minimizing this objective function through an iterative method inversion process requires the calculation of the sensitivity matrix jacobian matrix which require as much forward model simulations as unknowns m despite the computer science advancement the forward model itself can be time consuming when dealing with high dimensional problems 3d simulations fine mesh presence of complex structures in order to bypass this difficulty the principal component geostatistical approach which avoids the full jacobian matrix calculation was proposed the reduced order successive linear estimator rosle zha et al 2018 based on sle yeh et al 1996 can be one alternative to the pcga these methods use a singular value decomposition and then a truncation based on the eigenvalues and eigen functions of the covariance matrix q the covariance matrix can be rewritten with its decomposed form as 10 q v s v t where v s columns correspond to the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and s is a diagonal matrix of its eigenvalues λ which are decreasingly organized the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are then k rank truncated the k first eigenvalues and its corresponding eigenvectors are kept the compressed covariance can be calculated as 11 q k v k s k v k t where 12 q k q it can be also written as a sum 13 q k v k s k v k t i 1 k ξ i ξ i t where 14 ξ i λ i v i the accuracy of the low rank covariance depends on the truncation number however it is already shown that a much smaller truncation number than the number of unknowns k m can be used kitanidis and lee 2014 the quasi linear geostatistical approach kitanidis 1995 updates the actual best estimate s for the next iteration as 15 s x β q h t where h is the jacobian matrix and the accentuation bar denotes the best estimate β and ξ are solved from the following linear system 16 h q h t r h x h x t 0 ξ β y h s h s 0 the minimized objective function l can also be written as 17 l 1 2 y h x β q h t ξ t r 1 y h x β q h t ξ 1 2 ξ t h q h t ξ in pcga the sensitivity matrix h is not fully calculated and an alternative way to approximate it is proposed in order to estimate hq and hqht k forward runs are needed to be solved in additional to the forward run of the actual best estimate the forward models are used to calculate η defined as follows 18 η i h ξ i 1 δ h s δ ξ i h s δ is the finite difference interval from the taylor series expansion kitanidis and lee 2014 then hq and hqht are defined as 19 h q h q k h i 1 k ξ i ξ i t i 1 k h ξ i ξ i t i 1 k η i ξ i t 20 h q h t h q k h t h i 1 k ξ i ξ i t h t i 1 k h ξ i h ξ i t i 1 k η i η i t in order to estimate hx one columns of x forward run is needed following 21 h x i 1 δ h s δ x i h s in order to estimate h s one forward run is needed in addition to the forward model of the actual best estimate following 22 h s 1 δ h s δ s h s o δ 1 δ h s δ s h s in total each iteration requires k 3 forward runs 1 forward run of the actual best estimate 1 forward run to estimate h s 1 forward run to estimate hx and k forward models to estimate hq and hqht the above steps are repeated iteratively until convergence of the objective function value is reached 2 4 prior information the approach of conditional mean and conditional covariance using geological information as presented in zha et al 2017 work is used in this study the two main prior information are the initial guess and the initial covariance matrix the prior input of the inversion is constructed using interpreted flowmeter data the 3d interpolated conductivity is mapped into inversion grid stored in s and used as an initial guess for the first iteration instead of using an initial mean an interpolation or and an extrapolation might be often used it also allows identifying the main facies and constructing the prior covariance accordingly zha et al 2017 however the covariance matrix q is constructed as a sum of different covariance sub matrixes zha et al 2017 a a covariance matrix that defines the different facies layers will be of high importance and its construction is achieved only by using a strong correlation between the cells that belong to the same facies b another covariance matrix that defines the correlation between the cells of the same facies defined as an intra facies covariance c a third covariance matrix defined as an inter facies covariance can be used on the global inverted domain by conditioning the prior covariance with facies information distinguished from flowmeter data we try to incorporate the vertical information into the inversion process and constrain its convergence path 3 validation of concept the main objective of the paper is the use of two different datasets which are easily available to better characterize the hydraulic conductivity of a multi layered sedimentary structure constitutive of the aquifer the first dataset corresponds to flowmeter data along the profile of each well flowmeter logs are obtained by pumping in the top of each well and the flowmeter tool is swept under the pump to get the flow contribution along the borehole the second dataset corresponds to measured hydraulic response drawdowns to pumping tests here we try to perform a 3d inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field to characterize the aquifer on the basis of pumping tests data and incorporating flowmeter information in order to validate this concept the proposed inverse approach is first applied on two synthetic cases the first case is performed in 2d and the second one in 3d 3 1 2d synthetic case by using a two dimensional random field generator tool paul constantine 2021 a random hydraulic conductivity field is generated following an exponential correlation function using the parameters of standard deviation σ 1 5 the correlation length in direction lx 100 m the correlation length in y direction ly 5 m with such set of parameters the obtained hydraulic conductivity field displays multi layered hydraulic properties see fig 3 a we consider the obtained 2d map as a vertical cross section of an aquifer centered on the inverted domain which is extended using a buffer area until the boundary conditions the dimensions of the inverted domain are 70 m by 50 m the dimensions of the buffer area are 700 m by 50 m the lateral boundaries are set to constant zero hydraulic head while the upper and lower boundaries are set to no flow condition the initial condition is set to zero hydraulic head in the whole domain for forward flow simulations we use the subsurface flow module of comsol multiphysics comsol ab 2018 we assume the aquifer to be confined the specific storage is assumed constant and a value of ss 10 4 m 1 was used the wells are modeled explicitly with a radius of rw 0 1 m we attribute to wells a high hydraulic conductivity k 1 m s 1 and a low specific storage 10 10 m 1 see fig s1 in supplementary material the spacing of wells in the direction is 15 m fig 3a we simulate five cross hole pumping tests which are considered as the data for inversion the location of selected wells is indicated in fig s4 we simulate flowmeter data for each well by using a point source at the top of the well and applying a steady state pumping flow rate once the steady state flow regime is reached we evaluate the vertical velocity along a line in the middle of the well in our flow simulations extra fine meshes are adopted to discretize the well domain fig r3 examples of simulated flowmeter measurements for the 2d case can be found in supplementary material fig r2 for cross hole pumping tests dataset to be used in ht we simulate the transient hydraulic heads using a point source in the middle of explicitly modelled wells the black dots shown in fig 3 are the position of the points to be used as point source for the pumping tests and the monitoring points for hydraulic head data we sample at five different time steps covering the early to middle times for all pumping tests the total number of drawdown data used for inversions are 5 number of time steps 5 number of pumping tests 4 number of observation wells 100 the simulated vertical velocity curves are converted into hydraulic conductivity distributions following the procedure described as follows an example of the manipulation is provided in the supplementary information file step 1 idiscretize the vertical velocity profile into depth intervals δz step 2 in each interval evaluate the change in velocity δvi corresponding to the change in depth δzi step 3 use equation 7 to estimate ki for each δzi step 4 hydraulic conductivity profile is obtained in each well the hydraulic conductivity profiles are then interpolated using a triangular base bilinear interpolation to obtain a hydraulic conductivity map for areas within between the wells for the rest of the inversion domain where the linear interpolation cannot be evaluated we use a nearest neighbors extrapolation in the next step we construct a nested covariance using the interpolated hydraulic conductivity map the nested covariance is constructed by the combination of multiscale correlated heterogeneities zha et al 2017 for example a geological facies from another survey can be used a soft constraint added into the initial covariance matrix for ht the interface between different facies or zones may exhibit an abrupt change of hydraulic properties on the other hand the variability inside a particular facies or zone compared to its large scale mean can be described by a zero mean and a small scale covariance function the covariance matrix used in ht of the 2d study is either calculated using a covariance model similar to the one used to generate the true random field fig 3b and 3c or built from a nested covariance which is a sum of different covariance matrices a covariance matrix built using a covariance model similar to the one used to generate the true random field plus a covariance matrix defining the important facies of flowmeter interpreted map fig 3e and 3f the first covariance matrix is simply calculated using an exponential covariance model with standard deviation 1 5 correlation length in direction lx 100 m and correlation length in y direction ly 5 m for the second covariance matrix that defines the facies we simply identify the facies from flowmeter map fig 3g and we build a binary covariance that correlates the cells that belong to the same facies in the inverse problem a structured grid is used to discretize the model domain for the two dimensional cases the number of grid blocks in and y directions are nx 30 and ny 15 respectively see fig r3 as a result the total number of unknown k parameters is 450 for pcga setup we use a truncation number of k 20 for a number of unknowns n 30 15 r 0 001 id where id is the identity matrix and δ 0 0001 for the finite difference interval the specific storage was kept constant in the inversion and the value is the same as in the forward simulation i e ss 10 4 m 1 fig 3 shows the results of the two dimensional validation case fig 3a corresponds to the generated considered true hydraulic conductivity field fig 3b is the inverted hydraulic conductivity field using a classical hydraulic tomography that used similar covariance information as in the generation of the random field fig 3d shows the interpreted hydraulic conductivity from flowmeter analysis fig 3c 3e and 3f show the inverted hydraulic conductivity by integrating flowmeter interpretations into prior information of the inversion fig 3c used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 3d to initialize only the parameter fig 3e used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 3d to initialize both the parameter and the covariance matrix which remained constant during inversion iterations fig 3f used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 3d to initialize both the parameter and the covariance matrix which was updated during inversion iterations the flowmeter interpretation allows the detection of the main layers in the system fig 3d while the attempt of an inversion using only pumping tests data couldn t assess the vertical profiles of hydraulic conductivity fig 3b fig 3c 3e and 3f show better k estimates flowmeter data clearly carry non redundant information on the vertical hydraulic conductivity profiles along the wells by only using the obtained hydraulic conductivity map from flowmeter interpretation as an initial guess the inverted conductivity already contains vertical profile information and show different layers fig 3c the inverted hydraulic conductivity shown in fig 3e is also representative of a layered system but clearly not better than the inverted hydraulic conductivity shown in fig 3c on the contrary when the nested covariance has the freedom to update through inversion iterations the best parameter estimate was obtained compared to all other configurations fig 3f fig 4 shows a scatter plot of true hydraulic conductivity and estimated hydraulic conductivity shown in fig 3 in each scatter plot we plot a linear model of data fitting red dashed line and calculated the coefficient of determination i e r2 shown in fig 4 the solid line is the first bisector line of y x fig 4a and 4b present results of using pumping tests and an exponential covariance model for inversion the difference is that in fig 4a the initial guess of hydraulic conductivity was assumed constant while in fig 4b the hydraulic conductivity distribution constructed by interpolating measured flowmeter profiles was used as the initial model when the flowmeter data are integrated the inverted hydraulic conductivities represent the true model better r2 of fig 4b is lower than that of fig 4a on the other hand fig 4c confirms that the flowmeter data can capture the true k distribution to some extent indicated by the strong linear trend and high value of r2 however the variance of the hydraulic conductivity estimates seems underestimated the improved hydraulic conductivity estimation is obtained when flowmeter data are used to construct both the initial model and the covariance model fig 4d comparing results shown in fig 4d and 4e indicates that allowing the update of the nested covariance improves the estimation considerably 3 2 3d synthetic case we extend the approach to a three dimensional synthetic case and try to show if flowmeter data can provide the vertical information for a 3d aquifer characterization instead of packer tests similar to the simplified two dimensional case we use a three dimensional random field generator räss et al 2019 to generate a three dimensional synthetic hydraulic conductivity map using the following parameters correlation function exponential standard deviation 1 5 lx 100 m ly 100 m and lz 5 m such parameters provide a hydraulic conductivity map that is representative of a multilayered system the dimensions of the inverted domain are length 70 m width 70 m and height 30 m the lateral dimensions of the buffer area are length 700 m and width 700 m the buffer was not extended in the vertical direction the outer boundaries are set to constant zero hydraulic head while the upper and lower boundaries top and bottom are set to no flow condition the initial condition is set to zero hydraulic head in the whole domain the specific storage is assumed constant and a value of ss 10 4 m 1 was used as for the two dimensional case we simulate flowmeter and cross hole datasets by modelling explicit wells and point source pump the point source in the top for the flowmeter simulation and in the middle for cross hole tests simulations extra fine meshes are adopted to discretize the well domain fig r3 see fig r2 in supplementary material for an example of simulated flowmeter measurements for the 3d case five cross hole pumping tests data are simulated and considered as the data for the inversions the location of selected wells is indicated in fig s4 as for the 2d cases the total number of observations for the 3d cases is 100 the flowmeter data are interpreted and the hydraulic conductivity profiles are then interpolated using a triangular base trilinear interpolation to fill the area between the wells the rest of the inversion domain where the linear interpolation cannot be evaluated we use a nearest neighbors extrapolation we construct a nested covariance using the interpreted flowmeter map as described for the two dimensional case in the inverse problem a structured grid is used to discretize the model domain for the three dimensional cases the number of grid blocks in y and z directions are nx 20 ny 20 nz 8 respectively see fig r3 for pcga setup we use a truncation number of k 30 for a number of unknowns n 20 20 8 r 0 001 id where id is the identity matrix and δ 0 0001 for the finite difference interval the specific storage was kept constant ss 10 4 m 1 in the inversion and we focus on the characterization of k fields fig 5 shows the results of the three dimensional validation case fig 5c corresponds to the generated considered true hydraulic conductivity field fig 5a is the inverted hydraulic conductivity field using a classical hydraulic tomography that used same covariance information as in the random field generation fig 5b shows the interpreted hydraulic conductivity from flowmeter analysis fig 5d and 5e show the inverted hydraulic conductivity by integrating flowmeter interpretations into prior information of the inversion fig 5d used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 5b to initialize only the parameter fig 5e used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 5b to initialize both the parameter and the covariance matrix which was updated during inversion iterations the results of the 3d validation case agree with the observed results of the 2d validation case the flowmeter interpretation allows vaguely the detection of the main layers in the system fig 5b while the attempt of an inversion using only pumping tests data couldn t assess the vertical profiles of hydraulic conductivity fig 5a fig 5d and 5e show better characterization in the vertical profiles due to non redundant added information brought by flowmeter data using the flowmeter s interpreted hydraulic conductivity as an initial guess in the inversion already improves considerably the results fig 5d also as seen in the 2d validation case the best k estimate was obtained when flowmeter interpretation was used to initialize both the parameter and the covariance matrix fig 5e these results obtained with the 3d synthetic case are similar to the ones obtained with the 2d synthetic case and thus confirm that adding flowmeter information allows improving the hydraulic permeability field this conclusion is consistent with the fact that flux in addition to hydraulic head measurements enhance k values estimate yeh et al 2011 2015a 2015b mao et al 2013a 2013b tso et al 2016 to better evaluate the quality of the estimated hydraulic conductivity field we simulate a transient pumping test in well p6 see fig 5c using this inverted hydraulic conductivity map and compare the simulated drawdowns to the simulated drawdowns obtained with the true hydraulic conductivity field see fig 6 fig 6 compares different drawdowns obtained on 5 boreholes in response to a pumping test in the new added prediction well p6 the drawdowns were simulated by using different hydraulic conductivity fields the curves represented by solid red lines correspond to simulated drawdowns using true hydraulic conductivity the curves represented by dotted black lines correspond to simulated drawdowns using inverted hydraulic conductivity obtained from hydraulic tomography using other pumping tests observation data fig 5a the curves represented by dashed black lines correspond to simulated drawdowns using inverted hydraulic conductivity obtained from hydraulic tomography using other pumping tests observation data and conditioned by flowmeter data fig 5e the results clearly show that the dashed lines ht flowmeter data are closer to the solid red lines true drawdown compared to the dotted lines classical ht such observation confirms that incorporating flowmeter data in the hydraulic tomography leads to better k estimates we also show a scatter plot of true hydraulic conductivity and estimated hydraulic conductivity in fig 7 each scatter plot has a linear model of data fitting represented by a red dashed line with a linear regression expression and a coefficient of determination the solid line is the first bisector line of y x fig 7a shows the result of using pumping tests and an exponential covariance model fig 7b presents the result of hydraulic conductivity comparison based on flowmeter interpretation the small bias toward high absolute values of hydraulic conductivities indicates that the effective hydraulic conductivity is overestimated by the interpolation of flowmeter profiles when the interpreted hydraulic conductivity distribution from flowmeter is used as initial guess for the inversion we observe that the characterization of hydraulic conductivity becomes considerably better compare fig 7c to fig 7a the incorporation of multiscale heterogeneity with the nested covariance model generates a different representation but the hydraulic conductivity estimates is considerably improved as well fig 7d this demonstrates the importance of integrating flowmeter data 4 application in this section the approach is applied to an experimental field site on the basis of real field data the experimental site is located in southern france 20 km northeast of montpellier fig 8 a the site s aquifer is composed of mollusc shells of late burdigalian the deposit is a dune system constructed during miocene s tidal currents within the experimental site 13 vertical wells were drilled in a square of 50 m by 50 m in which full diameter cores were obtained in borehole p6 p8 and p12 fig 8b the wells have a depth of 30 m and are fully penetrating wells since they crosscut the whole late burdigalian down to the roof of the mid burdigalian which presents a very low permeability the hydraulic conductivity measured using 330 one inch diameter cores plugged from the full diameter cores spans four orders of magnitude 10 8 to 10 4 the preliminary analysis of hydrodynamic response to pumping test and slug tests wang et al 2018 showed a pretty high lateral heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field besides both the well logs and laboratory measurements on cores showed that the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity field is constrained by a multilayered system fig 8c 4 1 flowmeter implementation and analysis a series of spinner flowmeter tests are performed in the experimental site the flowmeter tests are performed in each well as described in the methodology the flow log is obtained in a well subject to a pumping where the pump is positioned close to the surface we also point out that the pump needs to remain under water and depending on the generated drawdown the investigated depth will be limited to maximize the investigated depth a small pumping flow rate was used a series of flowmeter sweeps are performed inside a pvc with static water in order to realize the tool calibration of spin velocity conversion the log of flow rate can be obtained by taking into consideration the well diameter changes along the depth an example of flowmeter measurements and interpretation for hydraulic conductivity distribution may be found in the supplementary material fig s3 considering that the total pumping flow rate comes under the pump we can estimate the hydraulic conductivity log of the well as a function of the flow rate contribution of the different layers once the effective hydraulic conductivity of the investigated depth of the aquifer is determined with the estimated hydraulic conductivity logs from the different wells we fill the remaining space between them by interpolation assuming that the distribution of the hydraulic properties in layers is continuous and correlated a 3d hydraulic conductivity field is obtained 4 2 pumping tests data 13 pumping tests were performed in our experimental site during summer 2016 during each test the transient responses are measured in all the wells for all the tests the pumping tests were long enough to reach a pseudo steady state response we randomly choose 5 cross hole pumping tests to use as observations for the following application different times from early and middle parts of the response were sampled and used as the ht observations we didn t sample from late time to avoid any instability that may come from the biased modelling of the uncertain regional heterogeneity and boundary conditions from the well test analysis the estimated effective permeability and specific storage of the test site are k eff 1 34e 4 m s 1 and ss 2 65e 5 m 1 which are used in the inversions 4 3 hydraulic tomography the dimensions of the inverted domain are length 50 m width 50 m and height 20 m the dimensions of the buffer area are length 200 m width 200 m and height 20 m the outer boundaries are set to constant hydraulic head h0 25 m while the upper and lower boundaries top and bottom are set to no flow condition the initial condition is set to a constant hydraulic head h0 25 m in the whole domain a covariance matrix is constructed using the hydraulic conductivity field in fact a nested covariance function for multiscale heterogeneity is used in order to perform the inversion it allows to incorporate geological information to constrain the results zha et al 2017 the nested covariance matrix constructed based on flowmeter data interpolation can be found in fig s5 the statistical parameter used for the generating the covariance is provided in table s2 different facies are determined and in each facies a correlation is defined the main objective is not to perfectly reproduce the drawdown responses but to obtain a more realistic hydraulic property distribution with a good fitting of the observed drawdowns the initial guess is constructed from flowmeter interpreted hydraulic conductivity field a similar interpolation method as adopted in the synthetic inversion is used to interpolate the flowmeter data the covariance matrix is built accordingly to flowmeter results layers information is prioritized the covariance is a result of a sum of different covariance matrices one defines the layers another represents the variance and correlation length inside each layer and the last one defines the variance and the correlation length of the whole domain for the experimental field case we performed two inversion runs the first one by a classical hydraulic tomography approach and we used only observation from the pumping tests while in the second run flowmeter interpretations were used to initialize the parameter and the covariance matrix fig 7 shows the inverted hydraulic conductivity for both cases fig 7a corresponds to the inverted hydraulic conductivity field with classical hydraulic tomography while fig 7b corresponds to the inverted hydraulic conductivity field with hydraulic tomography conditioned by flowmeter data fig 7c and 7d are scatter plots of observations hydraulic head measurements data fitting obtained using respectively results from fig 7a and 7b 5 discussion incorporating flowmeter data into hydraulic tomography allows to obtain a better k estimate in the synthetic validation cases for the 2d validation case the results see fig 3 show that initializing the parameter and the covariance matrix with flowmeter interpretation data provides better k estimates the initial parameter value can play an important role on converging to a different k estimate solution such an effect can be observed on the inverted hydraulic conductivity when flowmeter estimate was used to initialize the parameter fig 3c on the other hand the initial covariance matrix can also contain layers information by correlating the cells that belong to the same layer however the correlation constraint can be strong on the k estimate especially when the covariance remains unchanged and equal to the initial fig 3e the covariance of unknown parameter can be updated to derive the residual covariance the continuous updating of residual covariance allows to correctly address the uncertainty and enhance convergence of the inverse solution zha et al 2018 which can be confirmed with the results in fig 3f the approach of integrating flowmeter data was also tested using synthetic case in three dimensions and results see fig 5 are in total agreement with the 2d case observations for this case we also showed the quality of the result by simulating drawdown curves in a prediction well which was not included in observation wells using the inverted hydraulic conductivity field and compared them with the true observed drawdown see fig 6 it clearly shows how flowmeter data adds a non redundant vertical profile information and thus enhance considerably the k estimates in the present study we focused on reconstructing k distributions by keeping ss as a constant although previous studies have shown that the selection of ss value may impact the k estimates castagna et al 2011 zhao et al 2021 our interpretation of field site single hole and cross hole pumping tests did not indicate a strong variation of ss for this reason we think the treatment is reasonable however in the future we attempt to perform a full inversion to simultaneously estimate the spatial distribution of both k and ss these would require more pumping test data points to be sampled and used in the inversion as the inclusion of ss distribution would double the number of unknown parameters which increases drastically the underdetermined ness of the inversion problem fig 9 summarizes the results of the approach applied to a real field case the two inverted hydraulic conductivity fields are totally different from each other while their data fitting are quite similar k estimates obtained from ht conditioned by flowmeter data exhibits a multilayered system with more geological realism comparing to k estimates obtained from classical ht without any additional profile information the same layering system has been observed in other measurements core analysis logs permeameter measurements etc the data fitting in both inversions is relatively similar rmse 0 0912 for ht using pumping tests data and rmse 0 0874 for ht using pumping tests and flowmeter data however the prediction of transient drawdowns becomes significantly better using k estimate obtained with the incorporation of flux measurements data for further validation we sampled hydraulic conductivity values from inversion results and we compared them to some available permeameter measurements at the same locations within the 13 wells available in the experimental site three pc6 pc8 and pc12 were cored cores allowed to obtain a permeability log from laboratory permeameter measurements along the wells fig 8 shows a comparison of extracted conductivity from tht results and laboratory permeability measurements converted into hydraulic conductivity using water density ρ 1000 kg m 3 water viscosity µ 0 001 kg m 1 s 1 and gravity acceleration g 9 81 m s 2 of plugs on the cored wells as well as the flowmeter interpreted hydraulic conductivity fig 10 strengthen the fact that flowmeter data enhance ht results especially in the vertical profiles of the hydraulic conductivity estimates flowmeter conditioning data allows the k estimate to get closer to the measured permeability from the plugs of the cored wells hydraulic conductivity profiles in the wells obtained from transient hydraulic tomography fig 10 grey solid line show that normal pumping tests do not contain vertical information about the aquifer s hydraulic properties the hydraulic conductivity profiles are similar to a result of a 2d tht extruded into the third dimension depth averaged values our work is in agreement with other previous works in terms of how flux measurements enhance hydraulic tomography results the work of li et al 2008 showed that inverting both steady state hydraulic head measurements and flux measurements data leads to better hydraulic conductivity estimates they used both data in the inverse process as conditioning observations however in this work only transient hydraulic head measurements are used to condition the inversion and flowmeter tests data are used to initialize the prior inputs of the inversion our results show that incorporating flowmeter data in the initial parameter and the prior covariance matrix may be sufficient to enhance considerably the k estimates zha et al 2014 and tso et al 2016 also worked on combining flux measurements with pumping tests data zha et al 2014 inverted synthetic case in 2d by using normal pumping tests and used lateral fluxes as an additional data to strengthen the result and tso et al 2016 extended it to 3d by using the same observation datasets they both showed that flux data improves estimates resolution of ht analysis the difference between the two studies is the dimension and the fact that zha et al 2014 used it to characterize a discrete fracture network while tso et al 2016 investigated a porous media instead however both studies were not tested on any real case study 6 summary and conclusions in this study we performed a transient hydraulic tomography of cross hole pumping tests by integrating flowmeter data in prior inputs on an experimental site and managed a 3d imaging of the aquifer system that was coherent with geological observations and existing permeability measurements we used flowmeter data as source of the vertical information additional to pumping tests that provides the lateral information in order to incorporate the vertical data into hydraulic tomography flowmeter tests are interpreted separately to obtain a prior k estimate which was used to initialize the parameter and the covariance matrix while the pumping tests observations were used to condition the inversion convergence process using different initial parameters and initial covariance matrices showed that the prior inputs of the inversion are important and can modify the result considerably also the non packer pumping tests do not contain vertical information the inverted hydraulic conductivity using only pumping tests was generally constant along the vertical profile the integration of vertical hydrogeological information obtained from flowmeter surveys and horizontal information from cross hole pumping tests allow a 3d transient hydraulic tomographic tht characterization of sedimentary layered rocks flowmeter data are a non redundant information and different data other than flowmeter could also be used to better define the variations of vertical hydraulic conductivity such as laboratory measurements on cored wells or classical logs that are able

3999,the accurate characterization of the underground depositional structure and hydraulic property distribution is essential to understand flow and solute transport in heterogeneous rocks or soils hydraulic tomography was shown to be an efficient technique to infer the spatial distribution of hydraulic properties due to the fact that information about the sedimentary structures distribution is not always available to allow a three dimensional characterization many of existing field applications of hydraulic tomography have been limited to two dimensional imaging along horizontal layer or vertical profiles where hydraulic data were collected in this work we explore the potential of combining tomographic pumping and flowmeter tests responses in an inverse approach for three dimensional aquifer characterization the tomographic pumping data provide information about the lateral hydraulic connections between boreholes while the flowmeter data constrain the vertical heterogeneity structure the inverse approach is first validated using two synthetics models composed of multi layered depositional structures and heterogeneous hydraulic properties within each layer it is shown that adding the information provided by the flowmeter profiles the inverted model exhibits more realistic depositional features we then apply the proposed approach to characterize the 3d hydraulic conductivity field controlled by sedimentary structure of an experimental site in layered porous rocks the inverted hydraulic conductivity field is in a good agreement with permeability measurement on drilled cores the proposed method offers an efficient and low cost approach for rapid assessment of the hydraulic properties in 3d and could be extrapolated to other field applications keywords aquifer characterization hydraulic tomography flowmeter pumping tests 1 introduction the characterization of hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity and specific storage is very important in groundwater modeling and water resources management hubbard and rubin 2005 contaminant transport has always been strongly dependent on the accuracy of the hydraulic properties characterization a minor change in hydraulic properties may alter transport behaviors significantly zheng and gorelick 2003 because direct measurements of hydraulic properties are limited in real world applications early analytical analysis of aquifer hydraulic response to pumping injection often adopts a homogeneous assumption e g theis 1935 cooper and jacob 1946 it may be enough to infer the bulk aquifer property however it cannot capture most of the transient behavior of the tested aquifer in addition to pumping tests several other hydraulic testing methods such as slug tests yeh et al 1995 and flowmeter tests rehfeldt et al 1992 klepikova et al 2013 tamayo mas et al 2018 are being used to provide non redundant information with respect to pumping tests about the aquifer hydraulic tomography ht has been developed over the last two decades e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 butler et al 1999 bohling et al 2002 bohling and butler 2010 yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 zhu and yeh 2006 liu et al 2002 liu et al 2007 illman et al 2010 cardiff et al 2009 zha et al 2014 this approach has shown a great potential for reconstructing detailed spatial distributions of hydraulic parameters comparing to the traditional analytical solutions hydraulic tomography yields a detailed two or three dimensional map of hydraulic heterogeneity for regions within between the testing boreholes where constraining hydraulic head responses to cross hole pumping are collected the efficiency of ht has been demonstrated in many laboratory scale e g liu et al 2007 illman et al 2007 illman et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 and field scale studies e g bohling et al 2007 brauchler et al 2011 brauchler et al 2013 berg and illman 2011 cardiff et al 2012 fischer et al 2020 for a full 3d hydraulic tomography using only one observation from each testing well is not sufficient and packer tests are often required bohling et al 2007 berg and illman 2011 zha et al 2016 zha et al 2017 cardiff et al 2012 zhao and illman 2017 wen et al 2020 however packer tests which are costly and complex to set up are not always available in each experiment site without packer tests pumping tests data remain insufficient to capture the three dimensional aquifer behavior and may lead to erroneous characterization and sometimes model instability in layered aquifers in recent years other information such as geological and geophysical data have been used to constrain the inverse process of ht e g zha et al 2017 tso et al 2016 soueid ahmed et al 2015 the most widely used geostatistics based inverse modelling approaches are the quasi linear geostatistical approach kitanidis 1995 and the successive linear estimator sle yeh et al 1996 to improve efficiency when dealing with highly parameterized inverse problems different approaches were developed including principle component geostatistical approach kitanidis and lee 2014 reduced order sle zha et al 2018 and the use of geostatistical reduced order models liu et al 2013 previous works have highlighted the benefits of incorporating site specific geologic structure information into groundwater models when ht data are limited zha et al 2017 tso et al 2016 zha et al 2017 worked on quantitative incorporation of site specific information into groundwater models and introduced a general method to derive conditional mean and conditional covariance that can be used in ht analysis as prior information tso et al 2016 also concluded that only incorporating a qualitative facies trend information already yields a better conductivity estimate such improvement can also be seen in hydraulic conductivity estimates through laboratory field applications zhao et al 2016 zhao and illman 2017 de clercq et al 2020 used electrical resistivity maps to structure the distribution of the hydraulic properties in a 3d ht flowmeter surveys characterize the vertical inflow profile of a given well paillet 1998 molz et al 1994 zlotnik and zurbuchen 2003 williams and paillet 2002 day lewis et al 2011 they are a widely used approach to determine vertical profiles of hydraulic conductivities at well locations complex geological medias are often layered systems and flowmeter analysis has shown its efficiency to detect the main layers contributing to the total pumped flux day lewis et al 2011 paillet and reese 2000 flowmeter profiling can also be used to detect the well crossing fractures that contribute to flow day lewis et al 2011 roubinet et al 2015 flowmeter tests are easy and cheap but bulky and the investigated height is limited due to the space taken by the pump and the generated drawdown flowmeter tests may provide a new set of information and have been included in inverse modelling problems for instance fienen et al 2004 used a bayesian inverse approach to interpret the vertical hydraulic conductivity in a heterogeneous fractured aquifer other applications used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity values from flowmeter tests in the transmissivity map to constrain the geostatistical inversions e g rehfeldt et al 1992 chen et al 2001 in other studies flux measurements have also been used as observation data additional to hydraulic heads in hydraulic tomography li et al 2008 zha et al 2014 tso et al 2016 combining different hydraulic tests that characterize different parts of the aquifer may lead into a good characterization for example combining flowmeter tests data that give vertical information with pumping tests data that give lateral information might be a good alternative to obtain a three dimensional characterization of the aquifer without packer tests in this paper we integrate vertical hydrogeological information obtained from flowmeter surveys and horizontal information from cross hole pumping tests to achieve a 3d transient hydraulic tomographic tht characterization of sedimentary layered rocks the flowmeter data are incorporated to ht through the construction of conditional initial mean and covariance of model parameter we first validate the proposed inversion framework using synthetic data from a two dimensional cross section model and a three dimensional model we then apply the inverse approach to a real world study in an experimental site composed of layered porous rocks in the end we analyze the data fitting effectiveness and geological coherence of the inverted hydraulic conductivity fields 2 methodology the objective of the study is to integrate two sets of data to obtain spatialized hydraulic conductivity estimates through hydraulic tomography the first dataset corresponds to drawdown responses to pumping tests that give information about lateral variation of hydraulic properties the second dataset consists in flowmeter logs measured in every well of the site that give vertical information see fig 1 for datasets scheme flowmeter logs are first interpreted and converted into hydraulic conductivity profiles then the interpreted hydraulic conductivity profiles are interpolated using a triangular base bilinear or trilinear interpolation in order to obtain a continuous two or three dimensional hydraulic conductivity map between the wells and we use nearest neighbors interpolation for the rest of the inversion domain where the linear interpolation cannot be evaluated after that an inverse modelling approach is used to reconstruct the hydraulic conductivity distribution using interpolated map as a prior information we use the principal component geostatistical approach a deterministic iterative procedure that updates the conditional mean and the conditional covariance by matching model responses to the pumping tests observations 2 1 groundwater flow model we solve the problem of three dimensional transient fluid flow through a confined saturated and heterogeneous porous media the system is solved in transient regime and is described by the following equations 1 s s h t k h q with 2 h t 0 h 0 h φ h 0 where is the gradient operator ss is the specific storage which assumed constant in this study h is the hydraulic head k the hydraulic conductivity q the source term and h0 is the initial hydraulic head which remains constant at the boundary conditions φ the forward flow model is solved using a finite element method using unstructured mesh see fig r3 in supplementary materials 2 2 flowmeter analysis the applied approach of flowmeter data analyses is described in molz et al 1989 which is based on the study of flow in a layered stratified aquifer by javandel and witherspoon 1969 assuming that the idealized aquifer is layered and the flow quickly becomes horizontal even with high contrast of hydraulic conductivity between the layers the flow of a given layer is proportional to the hydraulic conductivity of that layer and the sum of the different flow rates into the well is equal to the pump flow rate during the pumping test during our flowmeter test water is extracted from an open hole well and once steady state is reached a spinner flowmeter is swept along the well from the bottom of the well to the top and a vertical flow rate profile is measured in most common cases when the pump is located at the top the flow rate log will have the trend of an increasing curve starting from a zero value at the bottom to a max value at the top that will correspond to the total extracted flux from the well the increase in flow rate over a certain depth increment is correlated to the relative hydraulic conductivity profile higher the hydraulic conductivity stronger the rate increase flowmeter tests therefore provide relative values of hydraulic conductivity distribution along the borehole in order to extract the absolute values an effective value of hydraulic conductivity of the well obtainable from the interpretation single hole of a pumping tests will be used single hole flowmeter data can be analyzed to estimate conductivity profiles along boreholes and characterize aquifer compartmentalization molz et al 1989 kabala 1994 paillet 1998 if a well is subject to a pumping with a pump placed at the top of the well working at the rate qp the underground layers connected to that well will contribute to the total extracted flux their contribution is proportional to their hydraulic conductivity for the following equations b m refers to the aquifer thickness z0 m the reference level of the borehole bottom and z m the height above the bottom fig 2 in an idealized layered aquifer the flow into the well from a given layer is proportional to the transmissivity of that layer 3 δ q i α δ z i k i where α m is a constant of proportionality δqi m3 s corresponds to the induced flow increments observed in the borehole along the ith increment of height δzi m that has a hydraulic conductivity ki m s the average horizontal hydraulic conductivity k avg can be expressed by 4 k a v g k i δ z i b the cumulative flow qcum b over the aquifer thickness can be expressed as follows 5 q c u m b z 0 b q z d z q p i δ q i α i δ z i k i α k a v g b by substituting the sum α can be solved as 6 α q p k a v g b then the hydraulic conductivity of each layer can be quantified by 7 k i δ q i k a v g b q p δ z i 2 3 principal component geostatistical approach in order to optimize the hydraulic conductivity field in the model we use the principal component geostatistical approach pcga kitanidis and lee 2014 the observation equation that links the m unknown hydraulic conductivities stored in a vector s to the observation data hydraulic heads stored in a matrix y is kitanidis 1995 8 y h s v where h is the forward model v is the observation error with a random normal distribution with mean 0 and variance r which is usually the error measurement multiplied by the identity matrix the prior probability of s is a gaussian distribution with mean x β generalized by a covariance matrix q x is a m vector of ones and β represents the mean hydraulic conductivity value the posterior probability density function objective function l of s and β is given by 9 l 1 2 y h s t r 1 y h s 1 2 s x β t q 1 s x β the optimization of the hydraulic conductivity values is obtained by minimizing this objective function through an iterative method inversion process requires the calculation of the sensitivity matrix jacobian matrix which require as much forward model simulations as unknowns m despite the computer science advancement the forward model itself can be time consuming when dealing with high dimensional problems 3d simulations fine mesh presence of complex structures in order to bypass this difficulty the principal component geostatistical approach which avoids the full jacobian matrix calculation was proposed the reduced order successive linear estimator rosle zha et al 2018 based on sle yeh et al 1996 can be one alternative to the pcga these methods use a singular value decomposition and then a truncation based on the eigenvalues and eigen functions of the covariance matrix q the covariance matrix can be rewritten with its decomposed form as 10 q v s v t where v s columns correspond to the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and s is a diagonal matrix of its eigenvalues λ which are decreasingly organized the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are then k rank truncated the k first eigenvalues and its corresponding eigenvectors are kept the compressed covariance can be calculated as 11 q k v k s k v k t where 12 q k q it can be also written as a sum 13 q k v k s k v k t i 1 k ξ i ξ i t where 14 ξ i λ i v i the accuracy of the low rank covariance depends on the truncation number however it is already shown that a much smaller truncation number than the number of unknowns k m can be used kitanidis and lee 2014 the quasi linear geostatistical approach kitanidis 1995 updates the actual best estimate s for the next iteration as 15 s x β q h t where h is the jacobian matrix and the accentuation bar denotes the best estimate β and ξ are solved from the following linear system 16 h q h t r h x h x t 0 ξ β y h s h s 0 the minimized objective function l can also be written as 17 l 1 2 y h x β q h t ξ t r 1 y h x β q h t ξ 1 2 ξ t h q h t ξ in pcga the sensitivity matrix h is not fully calculated and an alternative way to approximate it is proposed in order to estimate hq and hqht k forward runs are needed to be solved in additional to the forward run of the actual best estimate the forward models are used to calculate η defined as follows 18 η i h ξ i 1 δ h s δ ξ i h s δ is the finite difference interval from the taylor series expansion kitanidis and lee 2014 then hq and hqht are defined as 19 h q h q k h i 1 k ξ i ξ i t i 1 k h ξ i ξ i t i 1 k η i ξ i t 20 h q h t h q k h t h i 1 k ξ i ξ i t h t i 1 k h ξ i h ξ i t i 1 k η i η i t in order to estimate hx one columns of x forward run is needed following 21 h x i 1 δ h s δ x i h s in order to estimate h s one forward run is needed in addition to the forward model of the actual best estimate following 22 h s 1 δ h s δ s h s o δ 1 δ h s δ s h s in total each iteration requires k 3 forward runs 1 forward run of the actual best estimate 1 forward run to estimate h s 1 forward run to estimate hx and k forward models to estimate hq and hqht the above steps are repeated iteratively until convergence of the objective function value is reached 2 4 prior information the approach of conditional mean and conditional covariance using geological information as presented in zha et al 2017 work is used in this study the two main prior information are the initial guess and the initial covariance matrix the prior input of the inversion is constructed using interpreted flowmeter data the 3d interpolated conductivity is mapped into inversion grid stored in s and used as an initial guess for the first iteration instead of using an initial mean an interpolation or and an extrapolation might be often used it also allows identifying the main facies and constructing the prior covariance accordingly zha et al 2017 however the covariance matrix q is constructed as a sum of different covariance sub matrixes zha et al 2017 a a covariance matrix that defines the different facies layers will be of high importance and its construction is achieved only by using a strong correlation between the cells that belong to the same facies b another covariance matrix that defines the correlation between the cells of the same facies defined as an intra facies covariance c a third covariance matrix defined as an inter facies covariance can be used on the global inverted domain by conditioning the prior covariance with facies information distinguished from flowmeter data we try to incorporate the vertical information into the inversion process and constrain its convergence path 3 validation of concept the main objective of the paper is the use of two different datasets which are easily available to better characterize the hydraulic conductivity of a multi layered sedimentary structure constitutive of the aquifer the first dataset corresponds to flowmeter data along the profile of each well flowmeter logs are obtained by pumping in the top of each well and the flowmeter tool is swept under the pump to get the flow contribution along the borehole the second dataset corresponds to measured hydraulic response drawdowns to pumping tests here we try to perform a 3d inversion of the hydraulic conductivity field to characterize the aquifer on the basis of pumping tests data and incorporating flowmeter information in order to validate this concept the proposed inverse approach is first applied on two synthetic cases the first case is performed in 2d and the second one in 3d 3 1 2d synthetic case by using a two dimensional random field generator tool paul constantine 2021 a random hydraulic conductivity field is generated following an exponential correlation function using the parameters of standard deviation σ 1 5 the correlation length in direction lx 100 m the correlation length in y direction ly 5 m with such set of parameters the obtained hydraulic conductivity field displays multi layered hydraulic properties see fig 3 a we consider the obtained 2d map as a vertical cross section of an aquifer centered on the inverted domain which is extended using a buffer area until the boundary conditions the dimensions of the inverted domain are 70 m by 50 m the dimensions of the buffer area are 700 m by 50 m the lateral boundaries are set to constant zero hydraulic head while the upper and lower boundaries are set to no flow condition the initial condition is set to zero hydraulic head in the whole domain for forward flow simulations we use the subsurface flow module of comsol multiphysics comsol ab 2018 we assume the aquifer to be confined the specific storage is assumed constant and a value of ss 10 4 m 1 was used the wells are modeled explicitly with a radius of rw 0 1 m we attribute to wells a high hydraulic conductivity k 1 m s 1 and a low specific storage 10 10 m 1 see fig s1 in supplementary material the spacing of wells in the direction is 15 m fig 3a we simulate five cross hole pumping tests which are considered as the data for inversion the location of selected wells is indicated in fig s4 we simulate flowmeter data for each well by using a point source at the top of the well and applying a steady state pumping flow rate once the steady state flow regime is reached we evaluate the vertical velocity along a line in the middle of the well in our flow simulations extra fine meshes are adopted to discretize the well domain fig r3 examples of simulated flowmeter measurements for the 2d case can be found in supplementary material fig r2 for cross hole pumping tests dataset to be used in ht we simulate the transient hydraulic heads using a point source in the middle of explicitly modelled wells the black dots shown in fig 3 are the position of the points to be used as point source for the pumping tests and the monitoring points for hydraulic head data we sample at five different time steps covering the early to middle times for all pumping tests the total number of drawdown data used for inversions are 5 number of time steps 5 number of pumping tests 4 number of observation wells 100 the simulated vertical velocity curves are converted into hydraulic conductivity distributions following the procedure described as follows an example of the manipulation is provided in the supplementary information file step 1 idiscretize the vertical velocity profile into depth intervals δz step 2 in each interval evaluate the change in velocity δvi corresponding to the change in depth δzi step 3 use equation 7 to estimate ki for each δzi step 4 hydraulic conductivity profile is obtained in each well the hydraulic conductivity profiles are then interpolated using a triangular base bilinear interpolation to obtain a hydraulic conductivity map for areas within between the wells for the rest of the inversion domain where the linear interpolation cannot be evaluated we use a nearest neighbors extrapolation in the next step we construct a nested covariance using the interpolated hydraulic conductivity map the nested covariance is constructed by the combination of multiscale correlated heterogeneities zha et al 2017 for example a geological facies from another survey can be used a soft constraint added into the initial covariance matrix for ht the interface between different facies or zones may exhibit an abrupt change of hydraulic properties on the other hand the variability inside a particular facies or zone compared to its large scale mean can be described by a zero mean and a small scale covariance function the covariance matrix used in ht of the 2d study is either calculated using a covariance model similar to the one used to generate the true random field fig 3b and 3c or built from a nested covariance which is a sum of different covariance matrices a covariance matrix built using a covariance model similar to the one used to generate the true random field plus a covariance matrix defining the important facies of flowmeter interpreted map fig 3e and 3f the first covariance matrix is simply calculated using an exponential covariance model with standard deviation 1 5 correlation length in direction lx 100 m and correlation length in y direction ly 5 m for the second covariance matrix that defines the facies we simply identify the facies from flowmeter map fig 3g and we build a binary covariance that correlates the cells that belong to the same facies in the inverse problem a structured grid is used to discretize the model domain for the two dimensional cases the number of grid blocks in and y directions are nx 30 and ny 15 respectively see fig r3 as a result the total number of unknown k parameters is 450 for pcga setup we use a truncation number of k 20 for a number of unknowns n 30 15 r 0 001 id where id is the identity matrix and δ 0 0001 for the finite difference interval the specific storage was kept constant in the inversion and the value is the same as in the forward simulation i e ss 10 4 m 1 fig 3 shows the results of the two dimensional validation case fig 3a corresponds to the generated considered true hydraulic conductivity field fig 3b is the inverted hydraulic conductivity field using a classical hydraulic tomography that used similar covariance information as in the generation of the random field fig 3d shows the interpreted hydraulic conductivity from flowmeter analysis fig 3c 3e and 3f show the inverted hydraulic conductivity by integrating flowmeter interpretations into prior information of the inversion fig 3c used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 3d to initialize only the parameter fig 3e used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 3d to initialize both the parameter and the covariance matrix which remained constant during inversion iterations fig 3f used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 3d to initialize both the parameter and the covariance matrix which was updated during inversion iterations the flowmeter interpretation allows the detection of the main layers in the system fig 3d while the attempt of an inversion using only pumping tests data couldn t assess the vertical profiles of hydraulic conductivity fig 3b fig 3c 3e and 3f show better k estimates flowmeter data clearly carry non redundant information on the vertical hydraulic conductivity profiles along the wells by only using the obtained hydraulic conductivity map from flowmeter interpretation as an initial guess the inverted conductivity already contains vertical profile information and show different layers fig 3c the inverted hydraulic conductivity shown in fig 3e is also representative of a layered system but clearly not better than the inverted hydraulic conductivity shown in fig 3c on the contrary when the nested covariance has the freedom to update through inversion iterations the best parameter estimate was obtained compared to all other configurations fig 3f fig 4 shows a scatter plot of true hydraulic conductivity and estimated hydraulic conductivity shown in fig 3 in each scatter plot we plot a linear model of data fitting red dashed line and calculated the coefficient of determination i e r2 shown in fig 4 the solid line is the first bisector line of y x fig 4a and 4b present results of using pumping tests and an exponential covariance model for inversion the difference is that in fig 4a the initial guess of hydraulic conductivity was assumed constant while in fig 4b the hydraulic conductivity distribution constructed by interpolating measured flowmeter profiles was used as the initial model when the flowmeter data are integrated the inverted hydraulic conductivities represent the true model better r2 of fig 4b is lower than that of fig 4a on the other hand fig 4c confirms that the flowmeter data can capture the true k distribution to some extent indicated by the strong linear trend and high value of r2 however the variance of the hydraulic conductivity estimates seems underestimated the improved hydraulic conductivity estimation is obtained when flowmeter data are used to construct both the initial model and the covariance model fig 4d comparing results shown in fig 4d and 4e indicates that allowing the update of the nested covariance improves the estimation considerably 3 2 3d synthetic case we extend the approach to a three dimensional synthetic case and try to show if flowmeter data can provide the vertical information for a 3d aquifer characterization instead of packer tests similar to the simplified two dimensional case we use a three dimensional random field generator räss et al 2019 to generate a three dimensional synthetic hydraulic conductivity map using the following parameters correlation function exponential standard deviation 1 5 lx 100 m ly 100 m and lz 5 m such parameters provide a hydraulic conductivity map that is representative of a multilayered system the dimensions of the inverted domain are length 70 m width 70 m and height 30 m the lateral dimensions of the buffer area are length 700 m and width 700 m the buffer was not extended in the vertical direction the outer boundaries are set to constant zero hydraulic head while the upper and lower boundaries top and bottom are set to no flow condition the initial condition is set to zero hydraulic head in the whole domain the specific storage is assumed constant and a value of ss 10 4 m 1 was used as for the two dimensional case we simulate flowmeter and cross hole datasets by modelling explicit wells and point source pump the point source in the top for the flowmeter simulation and in the middle for cross hole tests simulations extra fine meshes are adopted to discretize the well domain fig r3 see fig r2 in supplementary material for an example of simulated flowmeter measurements for the 3d case five cross hole pumping tests data are simulated and considered as the data for the inversions the location of selected wells is indicated in fig s4 as for the 2d cases the total number of observations for the 3d cases is 100 the flowmeter data are interpreted and the hydraulic conductivity profiles are then interpolated using a triangular base trilinear interpolation to fill the area between the wells the rest of the inversion domain where the linear interpolation cannot be evaluated we use a nearest neighbors extrapolation we construct a nested covariance using the interpreted flowmeter map as described for the two dimensional case in the inverse problem a structured grid is used to discretize the model domain for the three dimensional cases the number of grid blocks in y and z directions are nx 20 ny 20 nz 8 respectively see fig r3 for pcga setup we use a truncation number of k 30 for a number of unknowns n 20 20 8 r 0 001 id where id is the identity matrix and δ 0 0001 for the finite difference interval the specific storage was kept constant ss 10 4 m 1 in the inversion and we focus on the characterization of k fields fig 5 shows the results of the three dimensional validation case fig 5c corresponds to the generated considered true hydraulic conductivity field fig 5a is the inverted hydraulic conductivity field using a classical hydraulic tomography that used same covariance information as in the random field generation fig 5b shows the interpreted hydraulic conductivity from flowmeter analysis fig 5d and 5e show the inverted hydraulic conductivity by integrating flowmeter interpretations into prior information of the inversion fig 5d used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 5b to initialize only the parameter fig 5e used the interpreted hydraulic conductivity in fig 5b to initialize both the parameter and the covariance matrix which was updated during inversion iterations the results of the 3d validation case agree with the observed results of the 2d validation case the flowmeter interpretation allows vaguely the detection of the main layers in the system fig 5b while the attempt of an inversion using only pumping tests data couldn t assess the vertical profiles of hydraulic conductivity fig 5a fig 5d and 5e show better characterization in the vertical profiles due to non redundant added information brought by flowmeter data using the flowmeter s interpreted hydraulic conductivity as an initial guess in the inversion already improves considerably the results fig 5d also as seen in the 2d validation case the best k estimate was obtained when flowmeter interpretation was used to initialize both the parameter and the covariance matrix fig 5e these results obtained with the 3d synthetic case are similar to the ones obtained with the 2d synthetic case and thus confirm that adding flowmeter information allows improving the hydraulic permeability field this conclusion is consistent with the fact that flux in addition to hydraulic head measurements enhance k values estimate yeh et al 2011 2015a 2015b mao et al 2013a 2013b tso et al 2016 to better evaluate the quality of the estimated hydraulic conductivity field we simulate a transient pumping test in well p6 see fig 5c using this inverted hydraulic conductivity map and compare the simulated drawdowns to the simulated drawdowns obtained with the true hydraulic conductivity field see fig 6 fig 6 compares different drawdowns obtained on 5 boreholes in response to a pumping test in the new added prediction well p6 the drawdowns were simulated by using different hydraulic conductivity fields the curves represented by solid red lines correspond to simulated drawdowns using true hydraulic conductivity the curves represented by dotted black lines correspond to simulated drawdowns using inverted hydraulic conductivity obtained from hydraulic tomography using other pumping tests observation data fig 5a the curves represented by dashed black lines correspond to simulated drawdowns using inverted hydraulic conductivity obtained from hydraulic tomography using other pumping tests observation data and conditioned by flowmeter data fig 5e the results clearly show that the dashed lines ht flowmeter data are closer to the solid red lines true drawdown compared to the dotted lines classical ht such observation confirms that incorporating flowmeter data in the hydraulic tomography leads to better k estimates we also show a scatter plot of true hydraulic conductivity and estimated hydraulic conductivity in fig 7 each scatter plot has a linear model of data fitting represented by a red dashed line with a linear regression expression and a coefficient of determination the solid line is the first bisector line of y x fig 7a shows the result of using pumping tests and an exponential covariance model fig 7b presents the result of hydraulic conductivity comparison based on flowmeter interpretation the small bias toward high absolute values of hydraulic conductivities indicates that the effective hydraulic conductivity is overestimated by the interpolation of flowmeter profiles when the interpreted hydraulic conductivity distribution from flowmeter is used as initial guess for the inversion we observe that the characterization of hydraulic conductivity becomes considerably better compare fig 7c to fig 7a the incorporation of multiscale heterogeneity with the nested covariance model generates a different representation but the hydraulic conductivity estimates is considerably improved as well fig 7d this demonstrates the importance of integrating flowmeter data 4 application in this section the approach is applied to an experimental field site on the basis of real field data the experimental site is located in southern france 20 km northeast of montpellier fig 8 a the site s aquifer is composed of mollusc shells of late burdigalian the deposit is a dune system constructed during miocene s tidal currents within the experimental site 13 vertical wells were drilled in a square of 50 m by 50 m in which full diameter cores were obtained in borehole p6 p8 and p12 fig 8b the wells have a depth of 30 m and are fully penetrating wells since they crosscut the whole late burdigalian down to the roof of the mid burdigalian which presents a very low permeability the hydraulic conductivity measured using 330 one inch diameter cores plugged from the full diameter cores spans four orders of magnitude 10 8 to 10 4 the preliminary analysis of hydrodynamic response to pumping test and slug tests wang et al 2018 showed a pretty high lateral heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field besides both the well logs and laboratory measurements on cores showed that the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity field is constrained by a multilayered system fig 8c 4 1 flowmeter implementation and analysis a series of spinner flowmeter tests are performed in the experimental site the flowmeter tests are performed in each well as described in the methodology the flow log is obtained in a well subject to a pumping where the pump is positioned close to the surface we also point out that the pump needs to remain under water and depending on the generated drawdown the investigated depth will be limited to maximize the investigated depth a small pumping flow rate was used a series of flowmeter sweeps are performed inside a pvc with static water in order to realize the tool calibration of spin velocity conversion the log of flow rate can be obtained by taking into consideration the well diameter changes along the depth an example of flowmeter measurements and interpretation for hydraulic conductivity distribution may be found in the supplementary material fig s3 considering that the total pumping flow rate comes under the pump we can estimate the hydraulic conductivity log of the well as a function of the flow rate contribution of the different layers once the effective hydraulic conductivity of the investigated depth of the aquifer is determined with the estimated hydraulic conductivity logs from the different wells we fill the remaining space between them by interpolation assuming that the distribution of the hydraulic properties in layers is continuous and correlated a 3d hydraulic conductivity field is obtained 4 2 pumping tests data 13 pumping tests were performed in our experimental site during summer 2016 during each test the transient responses are measured in all the wells for all the tests the pumping tests were long enough to reach a pseudo steady state response we randomly choose 5 cross hole pumping tests to use as observations for the following application different times from early and middle parts of the response were sampled and used as the ht observations we didn t sample from late time to avoid any instability that may come from the biased modelling of the uncertain regional heterogeneity and boundary conditions from the well test analysis the estimated effective permeability and specific storage of the test site are k eff 1 34e 4 m s 1 and ss 2 65e 5 m 1 which are used in the inversions 4 3 hydraulic tomography the dimensions of the inverted domain are length 50 m width 50 m and height 20 m the dimensions of the buffer area are length 200 m width 200 m and height 20 m the outer boundaries are set to constant hydraulic head h0 25 m while the upper and lower boundaries top and bottom are set to no flow condition the initial condition is set to a constant hydraulic head h0 25 m in the whole domain a covariance matrix is constructed using the hydraulic conductivity field in fact a nested covariance function for multiscale heterogeneity is used in order to perform the inversion it allows to incorporate geological information to constrain the results zha et al 2017 the nested covariance matrix constructed based on flowmeter data interpolation can be found in fig s5 the statistical parameter used for the generating the covariance is provided in table s2 different facies are determined and in each facies a correlation is defined the main objective is not to perfectly reproduce the drawdown responses but to obtain a more realistic hydraulic property distribution with a good fitting of the observed drawdowns the initial guess is constructed from flowmeter interpreted hydraulic conductivity field a similar interpolation method as adopted in the synthetic inversion is used to interpolate the flowmeter data the covariance matrix is built accordingly to flowmeter results layers information is prioritized the covariance is a result of a sum of different covariance matrices one defines the layers another represents the variance and correlation length inside each layer and the last one defines the variance and the correlation length of the whole domain for the experimental field case we performed two inversion runs the first one by a classical hydraulic tomography approach and we used only observation from the pumping tests while in the second run flowmeter interpretations were used to initialize the parameter and the covariance matrix fig 7 shows the inverted hydraulic conductivity for both cases fig 7a corresponds to the inverted hydraulic conductivity field with classical hydraulic tomography while fig 7b corresponds to the inverted hydraulic conductivity field with hydraulic tomography conditioned by flowmeter data fig 7c and 7d are scatter plots of observations hydraulic head measurements data fitting obtained using respectively results from fig 7a and 7b 5 discussion incorporating flowmeter data into hydraulic tomography allows to obtain a better k estimate in the synthetic validation cases for the 2d validation case the results see fig 3 show that initializing the parameter and the covariance matrix with flowmeter interpretation data provides better k estimates the initial parameter value can play an important role on converging to a different k estimate solution such an effect can be observed on the inverted hydraulic conductivity when flowmeter estimate was used to initialize the parameter fig 3c on the other hand the initial covariance matrix can also contain layers information by correlating the cells that belong to the same layer however the correlation constraint can be strong on the k estimate especially when the covariance remains unchanged and equal to the initial fig 3e the covariance of unknown parameter can be updated to derive the residual covariance the continuous updating of residual covariance allows to correctly address the uncertainty and enhance convergence of the inverse solution zha et al 2018 which can be confirmed with the results in fig 3f the approach of integrating flowmeter data was also tested using synthetic case in three dimensions and results see fig 5 are in total agreement with the 2d case observations for this case we also showed the quality of the result by simulating drawdown curves in a prediction well which was not included in observation wells using the inverted hydraulic conductivity field and compared them with the true observed drawdown see fig 6 it clearly shows how flowmeter data adds a non redundant vertical profile information and thus enhance considerably the k estimates in the present study we focused on reconstructing k distributions by keeping ss as a constant although previous studies have shown that the selection of ss value may impact the k estimates castagna et al 2011 zhao et al 2021 our interpretation of field site single hole and cross hole pumping tests did not indicate a strong variation of ss for this reason we think the treatment is reasonable however in the future we attempt to perform a full inversion to simultaneously estimate the spatial distribution of both k and ss these would require more pumping test data points to be sampled and used in the inversion as the inclusion of ss distribution would double the number of unknown parameters which increases drastically the underdetermined ness of the inversion problem fig 9 summarizes the results of the approach applied to a real field case the two inverted hydraulic conductivity fields are totally different from each other while their data fitting are quite similar k estimates obtained from ht conditioned by flowmeter data exhibits a multilayered system with more geological realism comparing to k estimates obtained from classical ht without any additional profile information the same layering system has been observed in other measurements core analysis logs permeameter measurements etc the data fitting in both inversions is relatively similar rmse 0 0912 for ht using pumping tests data and rmse 0 0874 for ht using pumping tests and flowmeter data however the prediction of transient drawdowns becomes significantly better using k estimate obtained with the incorporation of flux measurements data for further validation we sampled hydraulic conductivity values from inversion results and we compared them to some available permeameter measurements at the same locations within the 13 wells available in the experimental site three pc6 pc8 and pc12 were cored cores allowed to obtain a permeability log from laboratory permeameter measurements along the wells fig 8 shows a comparison of extracted conductivity from tht results and laboratory permeability measurements converted into hydraulic conductivity using water density ρ 1000 kg m 3 water viscosity µ 0 001 kg m 1 s 1 and gravity acceleration g 9 81 m s 2 of plugs on the cored wells as well as the flowmeter interpreted hydraulic conductivity fig 10 strengthen the fact that flowmeter data enhance ht results especially in the vertical profiles of the hydraulic conductivity estimates flowmeter conditioning data allows the k estimate to get closer to the measured permeability from the plugs of the cored wells hydraulic conductivity profiles in the wells obtained from transient hydraulic tomography fig 10 grey solid line show that normal pumping tests do not contain vertical information about the aquifer s hydraulic properties the hydraulic conductivity profiles are similar to a result of a 2d tht extruded into the third dimension depth averaged values our work is in agreement with other previous works in terms of how flux measurements enhance hydraulic tomography results the work of li et al 2008 showed that inverting both steady state hydraulic head measurements and flux measurements data leads to better hydraulic conductivity estimates they used both data in the inverse process as conditioning observations however in this work only transient hydraulic head measurements are used to condition the inversion and flowmeter tests data are used to initialize the prior inputs of the inversion our results show that incorporating flowmeter data in the initial parameter and the prior covariance matrix may be sufficient to enhance considerably the k estimates zha et al 2014 and tso et al 2016 also worked on combining flux measurements with pumping tests data zha et al 2014 inverted synthetic case in 2d by using normal pumping tests and used lateral fluxes as an additional data to strengthen the result and tso et al 2016 extended it to 3d by using the same observation datasets they both showed that flux data improves estimates resolution of ht analysis the difference between the two studies is the dimension and the fact that zha et al 2014 used it to characterize a discrete fracture network while tso et al 2016 investigated a porous media instead however both studies were not tested on any real case study 6 summary and conclusions in this study we performed a transient hydraulic tomography of cross hole pumping tests by integrating flowmeter data in prior inputs on an experimental site and managed a 3d imaging of the aquifer system that was coherent with geological observations and existing permeability measurements we used flowmeter data as source of the vertical information additional to pumping tests that provides the lateral information in order to incorporate the vertical data into hydraulic tomography flowmeter tests are interpreted separately to obtain a prior k estimate which was used to initialize the parameter and the covariance matrix while the pumping tests observations were used to condition the inversion convergence process using different initial parameters and initial covariance matrices showed that the prior inputs of the inversion are important and can modify the result considerably also the non packer pumping tests do not contain vertical information the inverted hydraulic conductivity using only pumping tests was generally constant along the vertical profile the integration of vertical hydrogeological information obtained from flowmeter surveys and horizontal information from cross hole pumping tests allow a 3d transient hydraulic tomographic tht characterization of sedimentary layered rocks flowmeter data are a non redundant information and different data other than flowmeter could also be used to better define the variations of vertical hydraulic conductivity such as laboratory measurements on cored wells or classical logs that are able
