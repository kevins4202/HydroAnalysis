5795,preferential water flow in soil macropores such as underground channels formed by worm activity and plant root growth can move a large volume of water and contaminants to groundwater resources in a short time to describe these types of water flow in soil di pietro et al 2003 developed and proposed kinematic dispersive wave kdw model they suggested this model by adding a dispersive term to the kinematic wave kw model that was severely convective and was presented by germann in 1985 the fundamental assumption of this model is that the water flux u is exclusively a function of the mobile water content but in the kdw model considering its additional dispersive term it is assumed that the water flux is a non linear function of the mobile water content and its first time derivative the first term of this assumption is a power function where the water flux depends on the mobile water content this equation is just a mathematical equation and has no significant physical meaning in this research this power function is substituted by the shape of van genuchten model that has an acceptable physical meaning and thus the kinematic dispersive wave van genuchten kdw vg model is introduced for the first time as the innovation of this research the models were calibrated and validated with observations of four different rainfall intensities that were applied on the surface of a soil column with artificial preferential pathways the output water fluxes from the bottom of the soil column versus the soil mobile volumetric water content in the column were recorded at set times first both the kdw and kdw vg models were calibrated and their indefinite coefficients were determined by minimizing the error function between the observed and modelled water fluxes versus mobile volumetric water content using particle swarm optimization pso algorithm next both models which are second degree non linear partial differential equations were solved using numerical finite difference method with the matlab programming language and were validated by experimental observations of rainfall hydrograph that was passed through the preferential routes of a physical model and was recorded from the bottom of the soil column root mean square error rmse comparison of the models predictions and observations indicated that the proposed model kdw vg could predict the observations more accurately compared with the kdw model and also had better performance in the calibration stage keywords preferential water flow artificial preferential pathways porous media numerical solution particle swarm optimization pso algorithm finite difference 1 introduction preferential water flow which is a non uniform flow is a common phenomenon in unsaturated soils this type of flow normally causes the rapid movement of pollutants and is often observed when mass transport is dominated by macropore flow sheng et al 2011 li et al 2018 cohen and weisbrod 2018 flows through macropores are a kind of preferential flow that occur on paths created by earthworms or plant roots gerke 2006 khitrov et al 2009 klammler et al 2017 blue dye tracer studies show that the tracer moves not only along cracks but also through the burrows created by earthworms sander and gerke 2007 the appearance of preferential paths has been confirmed by direct observation using sequential magnetic resonance imaging mri hoffman et al 1996 the occurrence of this phenomenon during water infiltration depends on the initial water content of soils the amount and intensity of rainfall and soil hydraulic conductivity jarvis 2007 studies show that deep water movement in soils is predominantly due to the existence of preferential flow paths alaoui 2015 in non homogeneous and cracked soils water flows move significantly faster than the soil matrix snehota et al 2015 and create numerous splits in the soil profile resulting in poor water retention alaoui 2015 and influencing runoff regulation sediment transportation and soil and water conservation tao et al 2017 solutes such as nitrogenous fertilizer and phosphorus that are widely used in agriculture moradzadeh et al 2014 are transported through these routes and thereby contaminate both surface and underground water flury 1996 zhang et al 2017 saadat et al 2018 indirectly affecting the amount and concentration of runoff salts preferential flows induced by macropores are the main cause of pollution transport and groundwater circulation and contamination chemical fertilizers can also easily be transported through soil macropores to groundwater zhang et al 2015 therefore preferential flows can have a significant effect on human life products and ecology niu et al 2007 investigation of the behaviour of contaminant transport in the soil matrix requires knowledge of the equations governing water movement in the soil additionally further research appears necessary to understand the enhancement of contaminant transport by preferential paths majdalani et al 2008 in this regard germann 1985 1990 and chen and wagenet 1992 extracted the relationship between average water flux u and mobile water content in draining porosity germann 1985 germann 1990 chen and wagenet 1992 both models revealed a non linear relationship between water flux and the amount of mobile water content these equations which are based on the law of continuity finally lead to the kinematic wave kw model to simulate preferential water flow but usually overestimate the real flows germann 1985 di pietro et al 2003 as the kw model is severely convective it cannot consider the dispersive effect because this model assumes that water flux is just a function of mobile water content di pietro et al 2003 to compensate for this defect the kinematic dispersive wave kdw model was proposed by di pietro and colleagues in 2003 to simulate preferential water flows in draining porosity with more accuracy di pietro et al 2003 majdalani et al 2008 in this model a dispersive term was added to the kw model and it was assumed that the water flux was a non linear function of the mobile water content and its first time derivative this improvement made the kdw model more accurate than the kw model the first term of this assumption is a power function where the water flux depends on mobile water content and the second term is a differential equation that models the hysteresis water content effect in the soil matrix the power function term is just a mathematical equation and has no significant physical meaning in this study this power function is replaced with the shape of van genuchten model that is more physically based as the primary contribution of the study the kinematic dispersive wave van genuchten kdw vg model is introduced for the first time which is the innovation of this research 2 definition of models 2 1 kinematic dispersive wave kdw model to apply the kdw model di pietro et al 2003 some fundamental assumptions listed by di pietro et al 2003 and niu et al 2007 should be considered the most important assumption is that the gravitational force dominates the capillary force and the other forces are not considered in the system therefore the flow transport is assumed to have a vertical downward direction the other important assumption states that the model is established principally in the mobile water section given these assumptions w is the mobile volumetric water content w t w t is the first order partial time derivative of w and u is the volumetric water flux this assumes that the microporosity is completely saturated so there is no water exchange between the two porosities the law of continuity equation and its first derivative with respect to z are respectively defined as di pietro et al 2003 1 w z t t u z t z 0 2 2 w z t z t 2 u z t z 2 0 it is also assumed that the volumetric water flux within the macropores is a non linear function of the relation between w and w t described by the following equation 3 u u w w t u z t b w z t a ν w w z t t accordingly in the same water content the negative sign is applied when the volumetric water flux of the drainage stage is greater than that of infiltration and the positive sign is used when the volumetric water flux of infiltration stage is greater than that of drainage because as will be explained later the results of this study showed that in the same water content the volumetric water flux of the infiltration stage would be greater than drainage the positive sign is used to define the formula the model depends on three coefficients where u z t mm h 1 is volumetric water flux in time t and depth z a is a macropore flow distribution index b mm h 1 is a conductance term and ν w mm is the water dispersion coefficient all of which are positive numbers majdalani et al 2008 given the first derivative of eq 3 with respect to z the following description is derived 4 u z u w w z u w t w t z u z t z a b w z t a 1 w z t z v w 2 w z t z t where c w u z t w w t constant a b w z t a 1 is signal speed and v w is equal to u z t w t w constant the continuity equation eq 1 and eq 4 are combined to give the following equation 5 w z t t a b w z t a 1 w z t z v w 2 w z t z t considering the first derivative of the continuity equation eq 2 the following equation is derived from the substitution of 2 w z t z t 2 u z t z 2 and multiplication of u z t w or ab w z t a 1 on both sides of eq 5 6 u z t t a b w z t a 1 u z t z v w a b w z t a 1 2 u z t z 2 neglecting the second term of eq 3 ν w w z t t w z t u z t b 1 a is derived finally with the substitution of u z t b 1 a instead of w z t the following non linear partial differential equation was derived by di pietro and colleagues in 2003 majdalani et al 2008 7 u z t t a b 1 a u z t a 1 a u z t z ν w a b 1 a u z t a 1 a 2 u z t z 2 2 2 model development 2 2 1 modified kdw model with combination of van genuchten model introducing the kinematic dispersive wave van genuchten kdw vg model as mentioned di pietro and colleagues in 2003 applied eq 3 to model volumetric water flux in this equation ν w w z t t is the term that can model the loops of the hysteresis phenomenon during the infiltration drainage cycles and b w z t a is a power function that appears to have been taken from the power form of the volumetric water flux versus mobile water content fig 1 as reported by di pietro and colleagues in 2003 as fig 1 shows the curves follow a form of the power equation which is an empirical model the power function term of eq 3 b w z t a emphasizes the mathematical aspects with fewer physical assumptions here this term is substituted with the van genuchten model which is more physically based van genuchten in 1980 showed that based on the theory of mualem s capillary model mualem 1976 the hydraulic conductivity model can be expressed in closed form radcliffe and simunek 2010 2 2 2 van genuchten model the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 abbasi et al 2012 wang et al 2017 is an unsaturated hydraulic conductivity equation that has a physical base and is presented as follows 8 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 m 1 1 n n 1 9 s e w w r w s w r where s e is the effective water content k s e and k s l t 1 are the unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively l is the pore connectivity value n and m are dimensionless empirical constants w l3 l 3 is the soil volumetric water content w r is the residual soil volumetric water content and w s is the saturated or field saturated soil volumetric water content as the volumetric water flux resembles hydraulic conductivity in terms of physical and dimensions and similarly its amount varies between different levels of water content here the apparent shape of the van genuchten model is used instead of the first term of eq 3 b w z t a according to the experimental conditions some slight variations should be applied to the definitions of the input parameters of the van genuchten model whereas the amount of s e is normalized and dimensionless in this study with the redefinition of the parameters of s e as w m i n and w m a x the amount of s e always varies between 0 and 1 instead of w r w m i n is substituted in as the minimum amount of soil volumetric water content due to rainfall in each data series and w s is substituted with w m a x as the maximum amount of observed water content in each experiment therefore with the redefinition of the parameters of s e s e is defined as w z t w min w max w min in this study all experiments were conducted in the unsaturated condition and w max denotes the maximum amount of water content due to rainfall and is related to the maximum amount of water flux in each experiment therefore we changed w r and w s to w min and w m a x respectively both the van genuchten model and the first term of eq 3 b w z t a are power functions but the van genuchten model has more significant physical meaning in the proposed model the first term of eq 3 b w z t a is substituted with the van genuchten model thus with the general format of the van genuchten model for simulating water flux and considering the hysteresis term of eq 3 ν w w z t t the following equation is derived 10 u z t u in s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 ν w w z t t as mentioned previously the value of c in the kdw model is u w w t constant thus the first derivative of eq 10 will be as follows 11 c w u w w t constant l u in w z t w min l 1 w max w min l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 2 u in w max w min 1 1 s e 1 m m 1 s e 1 m m 1 s e 1 m l 1 therefore after defining all parameters of the kdw vg model the model is introduced as below 12 u z t t c u u z t z v u 2 u z t z 2 where v u c u v w to solve eq 12 numerically c u should be specified for the kdw model this was solved as mentioned by the substitution of w z t u z t b 1 a into c w u w w t constant a b w z t a 1 and the expression for w was arranged according to u here for the sake of simplicity di pietro did not consider the hysteresis term of eq 3 ν w w z t t to be eligible to easily arrange the expression for w according to u otherwise algebraically it would not be possible to create this change in the variable this can partly hinder the convergence of the equation to better results however in the kdw vg model to consider the full relationship between the observed values of w and u a numerical relationship was created between these two terms and the function of w f u was considered as a polynomial using the least squares method in this way the effect of hysteresis water content was also considered in this study eqs 7 and 12 are solved in the matlab programming language by the finite difference method and with the following initial and boundary conditions which were used by germann in 1985 13 u z t u i n t z 0 t 0 u z t u 0 z 0 t 0 where u i n t is the initial water flux 2 2 3 estimation of coefficients of both models the indefinite parameters of both models are defined by minimizing the error function of the root mean square error rmse between the observed and modelled water fluxes eqs 3 and 10 versus mobile water content in the kdw model the parameters a b and v w are unknown these parameters are defined by the following equation 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n u i b w i a v w w t i 2 where n u i and w i are the number of experimental observations observed fluxes at the bottom of the soil column at time i and mean measured mobile water content at time i respectively in addition in the kdw vg model the indefinite parameters l m and v w are calculated using the following equation 15 rmse 1 n i 1 n u i u in w i w min w max w min l 1 1 w i w min w max w min 1 m m 2 v w w t i 2 to define the indefinite parameters of the two above mentioned models the amount of rmse in eqs 14 and 15 should be minimized for this minimization the heuristic method of particle swarm optimization pso salahi et al 2013 is applied in the present work finally both kdw and kdw vg models represented by eqs 7 and 12 respectively are solved using the finite difference method and the models are validated in other words the hydrograph of drainage from the bottom of the soil columns due to an artificial rainfall is compared with the results of the kdw and kdw vg models in corresponding water fluxes it is hypothesized that the proposed model will provide a better prediction of the observations due to more physical assumptions in the kdw vg model based on mualem s 1976 capillary model overall the main objectives of this study are to 1 estimate the preferential water flow parameters of both kdw and kdw vg models to achieve the global minimum of error function using the pso algorithm and 2 validate both models with experimental observations to compare their performance 2 3 optimization one of the most important aspects of this study is to estimate the parameters of applied models by finding the global minimum of the error functions as the model developed in this study kdw vg is an innovation of the research the ranges of the model parameters are not definite except for parameter m which varies between 0 and 1 therefore this research is the first attempt to optimize and determine the parameters of the model with the aim of minimizing the error function the literature review also shows that the kdw model has seldom been used to explain preferential water flow behavior and so far its parameters have rarely been estimated by inverse methods local or global therefore the variation range of the parameter is still unclear and this can be attributed to the occurrence of the local optimization problem this study is one of the first attempts to optimize the parameters of the kdw model the study attempts to find the global minimum of the error functions global methods have the advantage of avoiding the problems of local optimizations however this advantage is obtained through a large number of evaluations of the objective function rauch and harremoës 1999 as the parameters of the applied models are obtained by the pso algorithm the features of this method are briefly presented 2 4 particle swarm optimization pso algorithm pso is one of the optimization methods inspired by nature and has been designed to solve numerical optimization problems nop with a very large search space and without the need to know the gradient of the objective function this method was first introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 the method is a suitable way to find the optimal global point of an error function tsoulos and stavrakoudis 2010 in this algorithm to solve an optimization problem a population of candidate responses randomly flows into the scope of the problem using a simple relation and then it is explored to find the optimal global answer 2 5 algorithm operation assume that x the search space for the pso algorithm is an n dimensional and continuous search space each particle in the t repetition of the pso algorithm has three attributes x t the current position of the particle in the t repetition v t the current speed of the particle in the t repetition and y t the best individual position of the particle until t repetition the suitability of each particle is equal to its objective function value then each particle moves in the search space with an initial speed of v based on the suitability of the particle and other particles in the group the best individual position of the particle until t repetition yields the y t that is the best value and the best position of the particle from the beginning to the t repetition now it is easy to determine y i t that is the best individual position of the particle i until t repetition based on the following relation 16 y i t x i t f x i t f y i t 1 y i t 1 o w in the above equation the function f is the value of the suitability of each particle based on the objective function after definition of y i t the set of p t can be defined as follows 17 p t y 1 t y 2 t y m t subsequently for the minimization mode y t which is the best global position found between all particles of the group until t repetition is defined as 18 y t y g t arg min i 1 m f y i t then the position of each particle can be updated at the end of each iteration based on the following relations 19 v i t 1 ω v i t r 1 c 1 y i t x i t r 2 c 2 y t x i t 20 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where r 1 r 2 0 1 represent uniformly distributed random numbers that are applied to maintain the dispersion of the particles and induction of the random property of particle motion and prevent them from sudden mutation c 1 and c 2 are individual and social acceleration coefficients that control the personal and global best values respectively and their values are determined by trial and error based on empirical results to start the optimization these numbers are usually considered to be around 2 on the other hand r 1 c 1 y i t x i t is the personal component that determines the rate of efficiency of particle i relative to the previous steps and r 2 c 2 y t x i t is the global social component that determines the efficiency rate of the particle i relative to the whole group in eq 19 the inertia weight ω actually provides a relation for the particle speed that allows for more efficient search in the search space regarding eq 19 it is obvious that large values of ω lead to a global search i e a large step search and small values of ω lead to a local search i e a small step search therefore with the application of large values of ω the algorithm will regularly search for new spaces without as much focus on accurate local searches while by reducing the values of ω the search will be performed more locally and around the optimal answers obtained in the previous generation many relationships have already been proposed to determine the inertia weight see shi and eberhart 1998 eberhart and shi 2001 malik et al 2007 feng et al 2007 nikabadi and ebadzadeh 2008 kentzoglanakis and poole 2009 li and gao 2009 chen et al 2018 yan et al 2018 ajdad et al 2019 3 materials and methods laboratory and numerical studies were conducted to investigate the preferential water flow in artificial macropores under different rainfall intensities an artificial preferential path was made by inserting a light soil lens into a field soil matrix which is proven to have a considerable effect on the preferential water flow to find an appropriate soil for the experiments different soil samples were first studied the samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and passed through a 2 mm stainless steel screen then the hydraulic conductivity of the soil samples was measured by the constant pressure head method after selecting the appropriate soil to construct the model the main sample which had an artificial preferential path to simulate the preferred water flow in the soil created by coarse sand was prepared using the following procedure wang et al 2013 2014 first a pvc tube with an internal diameter of 15 5 cm and a height of 40 cm was prepared the bottom of the soil column was covered with a double layer of plastic mesh with a pore diameter of 1 2 mm sharp edge sand was also glued to the inner wall of the pvc tube to increase the friction of the walls against the soil and reduce the probability of preferential flows from the walls then about 1 cm of gravel between the two sieves no 10 and no 6 2 and 3 35 mm respectively was poured onto the plastic mesh for better drainage next the empty pvc tube with a tripod was placed in a bucket of water which was filled with water to about one third of the height of the soil column a tube with an external diameter of 1 4 cm and a height of 60 cm was placed in the center of the pvc tube temporarily subsequently the soil was slowly poured into the pvc tube around the inner tube after pouring the soil around the inner tube at each stage the water was drained from the bottom by gravity and the soil was allowed to almost dry after this the inner tube was carefully pulled out from the pvc tube without disturbing the surrounding main experimental soil leaving a 1 4 cm diameter hole in the center of the main column the hole was immediately filled with coarse sand to avoid the collapse of the hole walls as the inner tube was pulled out of the middle of the main pvc tube the whole soil column was filled by wet pack method in three successive steps in each step a length of 10 cm was filled wang et al 2013 2014 at the end of each step the hole that was considered for creating the macropores was carefully filled with light sand this was repeated three times until the entire soil sample was finally added the soil had a coefficient of uniformity c u of 1 645 a coefficient of curvature c c of 1 183 and a median grain size d 50 of 0 146 mm the particle diameters of the coarse sand used to fill the inner hole were between 0 85 and 1 mm after the construction of the soil sample the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the whole soil sample was measured by the constant pressure head method as 172 6 mm h 1 then the soil column was made saturated from the bottom for 48 h before the infiltration drainage experiments after saturation of the soil column the water was allowed to be drained by gravity until the weight of the soil column was stabilized after ensuring the emptying of soil pores involved in the preferential flow mostly macropores the soil column was most probably kept moist by water retained by capillary forces in micropores a little exchange of water is expected between micropores and drainage porosity the amount of water in the micropores could be determined by weighing the soil column then as shown in fig 2 a funnel was attached to the bottom of the soil column after preparing the soil sample and the physical model as shown in fig 2 water droplets were created on the surface of the soil column with a rainfall simulator located about 10 cm above the soil surface the rainfall simulator was connected to a pump fed from a water tank majdalani et al 2008 the pump and two bypass pipes controlled rainfall duration and intensity the flow condition was unsaturated and the rainfall intensities should not have exceeded the hydraulic conductivity of the whole soil sample the drainage flow was also monitored continuously with a precise scale and the drainage hydrograph water flux versus time was derived from these data for each experiment the larger scale was used to record the weight of the entire soil column moisture during the whole experiment to calculate the evaluation of the mobile soil water content of the soil column the soil mobile volumetric water content at the desired time was calculated as follows 21 w m w t o t a l m w m i c r o p o r e m s ρ b where w is the mobile volumetric water content m w t o t a l is the total mass of water stored into the soil column m w m i c r o p o r e is the mass of water stored in the micropores m s is the dry soil mass measured at the end of the experiments after oven drying at 105 c and ρ b is the dry bulk density of the soil given by the following equation 22 ρ b m s v t where v t is the total volume of the soil column for this study the dry bulk density was 1 47 g cm 3 in this study infiltration experiments were performed with four simulated rainfall intensities of 56 97 107 64 133 01 and 161 71 mm h 1 two different scales were used one was set at the bottom of the funnel to determine the amount of drainage flow and the other was used to weigh the whole soil sample thus as soon as the second scale reached a plateau the rainfall simulator could be switched off from this point the scale placed under the funnel recorded the drainage flow or the falling limb of the drainage hydrograph the scale below the soil sample measured the amount of mobile water content at each moment and the other scale measured the drainage flow at the bottom of the soil column 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration of the kdw and kdw vg models to determine the indefinite coefficients of both models the objective functions eqs 14 and 15 were minimized using the pso algorithm for the kdw and kdw vg models respectively the water flux u was drawn as a function of w in infiltration drainage cycles in each of the four rainfall intensities fig 3 this figure is similar to the findings of di pietro and colleagues in 2003 and shows a hysteresis loop between the infiltration and drainage stage however the direction of the hysteresis loop is different in our experiments the water flux was higher for the infiltration stage than for the drainage stage for a given soil water content therefore the differential equation used in eqs 14 and 15 should have a positive sign di pietro et al 2003 found a negative sign in their equation as they observed that the water flux was lower for the infiltration stage than for the drainage stage different studies have reported contradictory results di pietro et al 2003 van genuchten 1980 gallage et al 2013 nielsen and biggar 1961 topp and miller 1966 youngs 1964 poulovassilis 1969 these authors used different soil textures in their research and achieved different results for the movement direction of the hysteresis cycle of soil moisture against the water flux it seems that no general findings on the direction of the hysteresis loop can be drawn from the literature for each level of rainfall intensity eqs 14 and 15 were fitted for the kdw and kdw vg models to the observations plotted on fig 3 in this study for optimization after investigating several relationships the relationship of linearly decreasing inertia weight presented by xin et al 2009 was finally used to determine the inertia weight as follows 23 ω k ω max ω max ω min iter max k where ω k is the amount of inertia weight in the k repetition and ω m i n and ω m a x are the amounts of inertia weight that are considered by default in this relationship for the initial minimum and maximum values here the values of 0 2 and 1 2 were selected for ω m i n and ω m a x respectively which yielded the best results and the maximum allowed iteration was the termination criterion of the optimization algorithm the initial value of ω k was selected as 1 for the first generation and due to the values of ω m i n and ω m a x the number of created generations and algorithm iteration after 5000 iterations this fell linearly to reach its minimum amount of 0 2 this range of changes was selected by conducting calculations and reviewing previous studies bansal et al 2011 here to make a balance between global and local searches and therefore faster convergence of the algorithm to the optimal global solution the inertia weight was reduced uniformly throughout the implementation of the algorithm in addition according to eq 19 different values for c 1 and c 2 were selected and tested and finally the values of 1 2 and 2 4 for c 1 and c 2 respectively yielded the best answers moreover the size of each answer group or the number of particles of each generation in other words the group size m in this study were selected to be equal to 200 particles 4 2 calibration results of the kdw model and determination of indefinite coefficients of the model parameters a b and v w were estimated according to eq 14 by minimizing the difference between the response of the relation of b w z t a ν w w z t t with u measured from the end of the soil column in corresponding w determined from the average whole of the soil column by the pso algorithm the optimization process of eq 14 and how to achieve the best results is shown in fig 4 the figure depicts the process of finding the optimal global point of the error function using the pso algorithm for different rainfall intensities here the horizontal axis represents the number of optimization algorithm iterations and the vertical axis represents the value of the error function which is equal to the rmse of eq 14 computed for each iteration as can be seen in fig 4 the algorithm finds the best response whatever the rainfall intensity after about 3300 iterations and the line becomes perfectly horizontal reflecting a constant and minimum value of rmse the optimized coefficients of the kdw model are presented in table 1 the value of the parameter b decreases with an increase in rainfall intensity similar results were found by di pietro and lafolie 1991 with the kw model on artificial soil but contradictory results were found by di pietro et al 2003 on natural soil with the kdw model the macropore networks in di pietro et al 2003 were formed by earthworms and were mainly cylindrical whereas the macropore network in di pietro and lafolie 1991 is quite similar to our experimental design due to the packing of large soil aggregates mean diameter about 10 mm the contradiction of our results with those of di pietro et al 2003 can be related to the fact that in di pietro s research in 2003 at a constant moisture level the amount of water flux in the drainage stage was higher than in the infiltration stage we derived the opposite finding the inconsistency in the direction of the hysteresis cycle movement may be associated with the difference in the applied soil texture in the two studies nonetheless v w was approximately constant moreover the values of the parameter a were approximately 1 however further experiments are needed to prove this trend the results of the model fitting to the experimental observations are presented in fig 5 where the line depicts the fitted values of the model and the squares represent the observed values as shown in fig 5 eq 14 fits the experimental observations well 4 3 calibration results of the kdw vg model and determination of indefinite coefficients of the model again to determine the indefinite coefficients of the model the objective function was minimized using the pso algorithm hence the parameters l m and v w were estimated with respect to eq 15 by minimizing the difference between the response of the relation of u in w z t w min w max w min l 1 1 w z t w min w max w min 1 m m 2 v w w z t t with the u measured at the bottom of the soil column in corresponding w that was obtained from the average of the whole soil column fig 6 displays the process of achieving the best responses and optimization of eq 15 using the pso algorithm for all different rainfall intensities here the horizontal axis represents the number of optimization algorithm iterations and the vertical axis represents the value of the error function which is equal to the rmse of eq 15 computed for each iteration based on fig 6 the algorithm achieved the best response after 3500 iterations whatever the rainfall intensity and the line became perfectly horizontal reflecting a constant and minimum value of rmse the optimized coefficients of the kdw vg model are presented in table 2 we observe that as the intensity was increased the values of parameters l m and v w did not significantly change this means that the ranges of the coefficients in the model developed in this study are not sensitive to the intensity of input rainfall in the van genuchten model the value of m cannot be greater than 1 and higher values of m represent more rapid movement of water or lighter texture of the soil in this regard in an attempt to determine the coefficient m in the van genuchten model ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2010 obtained the maximum amount of this coefficient for the lightest soil sand as 0 61 carsel and parrish 1988 reported a value of 0 63 for the coefficient m in sandy soil this was 0 68 for sandy soil based on the rosetta database schaap et al 2001 in addition leij et al 1996 obtained a maximum value of 0 85 for m in the van genuchten model in sandy soil yates et al 1992 examined several types of sandy soil and reported that m and l in the van genuchten model were equal to 0 86 and 1 92 0 85 and 1 3 and 0 84 and 1 26 respectively these values imply that due to the existence of preferential flows in the current study and the rapid movement of water through macropores the value of 0 98 that was derived for m in the present study seems logical conversely according to table 2 the values of l obtained in this study are approximately equal to the values reported by yates yates et al 1992 the results of model fitting to the experimental observations are shown in fig 7 here the squares represent the observed values and the line is the fitted value of the model to the observation according to fig 7 eq 15 fit the experimental observations very well and with very high accuracy in general by comparing the results of the two models see tables 1 and 2 it can be concluded that kdw vg model fit the observations with a slightly lower rmse value compared to the kdw model this indicates that the kdw vg model in which the power function used in the kdw model was replaced with the van genuchten model was able to fit the observations better due to its stronger physical meaning and concept generally the fitting of both kdw and kdw vg models was better at lower rainfall intensities because the dispersive effect was gradually decreased with the increase in input intensities therefore the effect of this factor was higher at lower velocities and fitting of the observations was better at lower rainfall intensities it should be mentioned that the only common coefficient of the two models the water dispersion coefficient ν w was found to be almost constant whatever the rainfall intensity and was not affected by the differences between the two models in addition table 2 shows that the changes in the three optimized coefficients of the kdw vg model are very low regardless of the initial rainfall intensity this implies that the parameters of the developed kdw vg model are not sensitive to rainfall intensity which is one of the advantages of the model developed in this study whereas according to table 1 the coefficient b in the kdw model changed significantly with changes in rainfall intensity 4 4 comparison of the models predictions with experimental observations model validation results after calibration of the models with data on the water flux exiting the soil column at different rainfall intensities versus soil mobile volumetric water content the coefficients of both the kdw and kdw vg models were obtained these models eqs 7 and 12 respectively were then solved with a numerical finite difference method for the numerical solution the spatial h step size of the finite difference method was selected to be equal in all corresponding experiments of both models this was also done for temporal τ step size thereby the results of the models in corresponding intensities became fairly comparable these spatial and temporal steps were selected primarily to satisfy the stability condition see appendix and capture the best response of the finite difference method and the lowest rmse values between observations and the models predictions numerical results were compared to the observed values of the water flux amount exiting the soil column versus time or the recorded hydrograph at the outlet of the soil column fig 8 shows the recorded hydrographs for the different rainfall experiments with different intensities in fig 8 regardless of the rainfall intensity at first the drainage hydrograph shows a rapid increase in flux u up to a non sloping part corresponding to a pseudo steady state and when the input flow stops the downside stage is a sudden drop in the flow rate that is followed by a drainage stage with a milder gradient 4 5 validation of the kdw model the rmse between the numerical results and those observed experimentally represents the difference between measurements and simulations it is shown in table 3 for different rainfall intensities the results of this numerical modelling are also displayed in fig 9 in which the line represents the simulation results and the circles represent the observed values as can be seen from table 3 and fig 9 the numerical solutions are in good agreement with experimental observations 4 6 cross simulation to determine the optimal coefficients of the kdw model as discussed earlier the coefficients of the kdw model were optimized with four different rainfall intensities and the model was calibrated for each then it was important to specify which of these four series of coefficients could be accepted as a single set of coefficients for this soil type whatever the rainfall intensity to answer the question as shown in table 4 the kdw model was separately validated for each rainfall intensity using each series of coefficients which had separately been calculated previously here the rmse values for the cross simulation of the experiment j column were obtained using the estimated parameters from the experiment k row which were equal to k j 1 2 3 4 as shown in table 4 the coefficients derived from the rainfall intensity of 133 01 mm h 1 gave better predictions of the experimental observations related to the hydrograph of the outlet from the end of the soil column 4 7 validation of the kdw vg model the rmse values between the numerical results of the kdw vg model and the observed values of drainage flux are shown for all rainfall intensities in table 5 the results of this numerical modeling are depicted in fig 10 in which the line depicts the simulation results and the circles represent the measurements based on the results presented in table 5 and fig 10 it is clear that the numerical solutions are strongly consistent with the experimental observations 4 8 cross simulation to determine the optimal coefficients of the kdw vg model here to determine the best of the four series of coefficients that were separately obtained using each rainfall intensity as shown in table 6 the kdw vg model was separately validated for each level of rainfall intensity using each series of coefficients as previously for the cross simulation of the experiment j column the rmse values were derived from the estimated parameters of the experiment k row which were equal to k j 1 2 3 4 respectively as is clear from table 6 for this model too the optimized coefficients of rainfall intensity of 131 01 mm h 1 provide a better prediction of the experimental observations pertaining to the hydrograph of the outlet from the end of the soil column for all rainfall intensities however this prediction for rainfall intensities other than 133 01 mm h 1 was better than the prediction of the optimal coefficients of each rainfall intensity and the third row had the minimum value of rmse for each column here it should be mentioned that the rmses of the prediction of other optimized coefficients for each rainfall intensity were not very different it can be observed in the columns of table 6 that the rmses of each column are all within the same range and are not very different because in the kdw vg model the coefficients of l m and v w did not differ significantly from one to another irrespective of the rainfall intensity from which they were derived this is not the case for the original kdw model see table 4 and can be seen as one of the advantages of the developed kdw vg model for which the input parameters do not depend on the rainfall intensity in other words none of the coefficients l m or v w exhibit significant variation in the validation stage when compared with the coefficient b in the kdw model and they could be considered as parameters representative of the soil properties only whereas the parameters of the kdw models are not representative of the soil properties only as they also depend on the rainfall intensity 4 9 comparison of performance of the kdw and kdw vg models in prediction of output hydrographs from the end of the soil column here the comparison of tables 3 and 5 clearly shows that the new kdw vg model predicted the output hydrograph from the end of the soil column with better accuracy than the original kdw model in fact the rmse values of the kdw vg model were lower than those of the kdw model for the corresponding rainfall intensities this finding can also be related to the application of the van genuchten model instead of the power equation in the kdw model the predictions of both the kdw and kdw vg models were improved at lower rainfall intensities especially at the rainfall intensity of 56 97 mm h 1 this proves the hypothesis that the dispersive effect is gradually eliminated as input intensities increase and can be more effective in better prediction at lower velocities the results show that the dispersion of the wetting front decreases as the input intensity increases at high intensities some small scale dispersive effects such as capillary effects may not occur at intermediate pore sizes and the coarse pores in most cases participate more in rapid preferential flows this has also been reported by di pietro et al 2003 here for a more accurate comparison of the accuracy of the models the cumulative square deviations of the measured and predicted values were calculated for both models the cumulative square deviations are depicted in fig 11 as a function of time in fig 11 part a shows the shape of the output hydrograph from the end of the soil column for each rainfall intensity and part b represents the amounts of the cumulative square deviations between the measured and predicted values for both models at the corresponding observation points of part a from fig 11 it can be seen that the cumulative square deviations between the measured and predicted values versus time are generally lower for the kdw vg model than for the kdw model this means that our proposed model is more accurate than the kdw model 5 conclusions this study presented the new kinematic dispersive wave van genuchten kdw vg model for the simulation of water flow through preferential paths this model is an evolution of the former kdw model di pietro et al 2003 in the kdw vg model the power equation that was applied in the kdw model to describe the relation between water flux and mobile water content was replaced with the shape of the van genuchten model which had more physical meaning infiltration drainage experiments were carried out on a soil column prone to preferential flow a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm was used to optimize and estimate the coefficients of the kdw and kdw vg models after parameters optimization both models could simulate the experiments with very low error after calibration of the models the output hydrographs from the end of the soil column were used for validation of the models despite a very close agreement between the simulated and measured hydrographs the kdw vg model could better predict the drainage hydrograph and water flow through the preferential paths the rmse was lower for the kdw vg model than for the kdw model the prediction of both models was better at lower rainfall intensities because when the input rainfall intensities increased the dispersive effect gradually decreased and this effect could be more influential on better prediction processes at lower velocities moreover the optimized parameters of the kdw vg model were not sensitive to rainfall intensity compared to the coefficients of the kdw model also a single set of parameters representative of only soil properties can be obtained with the kdw vg model whereas the kdw parameters also depend on rainfall intensity this is a very significant advance in the modelling and prediction of preferential flow but these results need to be confirmed by applying the kdw vg model for different soils overall the developed equation of this study is suggested to be used in water and solute transport models in porous media especially to model preferential flows and transport of solutes in soils for future studies it is recommended to replace the van genuchten model with the burdine meng 2018 or brooks corey models huber et al 2018 to investigate the performance of these models in combination with the kdw model in addition for further research work these experiments could be replicated with a precise weighing lysimeter to evaluate the efficiency of the kdw vg model and the solution method and estimate the coefficients for field and real conditions

5795,preferential water flow in soil macropores such as underground channels formed by worm activity and plant root growth can move a large volume of water and contaminants to groundwater resources in a short time to describe these types of water flow in soil di pietro et al 2003 developed and proposed kinematic dispersive wave kdw model they suggested this model by adding a dispersive term to the kinematic wave kw model that was severely convective and was presented by germann in 1985 the fundamental assumption of this model is that the water flux u is exclusively a function of the mobile water content but in the kdw model considering its additional dispersive term it is assumed that the water flux is a non linear function of the mobile water content and its first time derivative the first term of this assumption is a power function where the water flux depends on the mobile water content this equation is just a mathematical equation and has no significant physical meaning in this research this power function is substituted by the shape of van genuchten model that has an acceptable physical meaning and thus the kinematic dispersive wave van genuchten kdw vg model is introduced for the first time as the innovation of this research the models were calibrated and validated with observations of four different rainfall intensities that were applied on the surface of a soil column with artificial preferential pathways the output water fluxes from the bottom of the soil column versus the soil mobile volumetric water content in the column were recorded at set times first both the kdw and kdw vg models were calibrated and their indefinite coefficients were determined by minimizing the error function between the observed and modelled water fluxes versus mobile volumetric water content using particle swarm optimization pso algorithm next both models which are second degree non linear partial differential equations were solved using numerical finite difference method with the matlab programming language and were validated by experimental observations of rainfall hydrograph that was passed through the preferential routes of a physical model and was recorded from the bottom of the soil column root mean square error rmse comparison of the models predictions and observations indicated that the proposed model kdw vg could predict the observations more accurately compared with the kdw model and also had better performance in the calibration stage keywords preferential water flow artificial preferential pathways porous media numerical solution particle swarm optimization pso algorithm finite difference 1 introduction preferential water flow which is a non uniform flow is a common phenomenon in unsaturated soils this type of flow normally causes the rapid movement of pollutants and is often observed when mass transport is dominated by macropore flow sheng et al 2011 li et al 2018 cohen and weisbrod 2018 flows through macropores are a kind of preferential flow that occur on paths created by earthworms or plant roots gerke 2006 khitrov et al 2009 klammler et al 2017 blue dye tracer studies show that the tracer moves not only along cracks but also through the burrows created by earthworms sander and gerke 2007 the appearance of preferential paths has been confirmed by direct observation using sequential magnetic resonance imaging mri hoffman et al 1996 the occurrence of this phenomenon during water infiltration depends on the initial water content of soils the amount and intensity of rainfall and soil hydraulic conductivity jarvis 2007 studies show that deep water movement in soils is predominantly due to the existence of preferential flow paths alaoui 2015 in non homogeneous and cracked soils water flows move significantly faster than the soil matrix snehota et al 2015 and create numerous splits in the soil profile resulting in poor water retention alaoui 2015 and influencing runoff regulation sediment transportation and soil and water conservation tao et al 2017 solutes such as nitrogenous fertilizer and phosphorus that are widely used in agriculture moradzadeh et al 2014 are transported through these routes and thereby contaminate both surface and underground water flury 1996 zhang et al 2017 saadat et al 2018 indirectly affecting the amount and concentration of runoff salts preferential flows induced by macropores are the main cause of pollution transport and groundwater circulation and contamination chemical fertilizers can also easily be transported through soil macropores to groundwater zhang et al 2015 therefore preferential flows can have a significant effect on human life products and ecology niu et al 2007 investigation of the behaviour of contaminant transport in the soil matrix requires knowledge of the equations governing water movement in the soil additionally further research appears necessary to understand the enhancement of contaminant transport by preferential paths majdalani et al 2008 in this regard germann 1985 1990 and chen and wagenet 1992 extracted the relationship between average water flux u and mobile water content in draining porosity germann 1985 germann 1990 chen and wagenet 1992 both models revealed a non linear relationship between water flux and the amount of mobile water content these equations which are based on the law of continuity finally lead to the kinematic wave kw model to simulate preferential water flow but usually overestimate the real flows germann 1985 di pietro et al 2003 as the kw model is severely convective it cannot consider the dispersive effect because this model assumes that water flux is just a function of mobile water content di pietro et al 2003 to compensate for this defect the kinematic dispersive wave kdw model was proposed by di pietro and colleagues in 2003 to simulate preferential water flows in draining porosity with more accuracy di pietro et al 2003 majdalani et al 2008 in this model a dispersive term was added to the kw model and it was assumed that the water flux was a non linear function of the mobile water content and its first time derivative this improvement made the kdw model more accurate than the kw model the first term of this assumption is a power function where the water flux depends on mobile water content and the second term is a differential equation that models the hysteresis water content effect in the soil matrix the power function term is just a mathematical equation and has no significant physical meaning in this study this power function is replaced with the shape of van genuchten model that is more physically based as the primary contribution of the study the kinematic dispersive wave van genuchten kdw vg model is introduced for the first time which is the innovation of this research 2 definition of models 2 1 kinematic dispersive wave kdw model to apply the kdw model di pietro et al 2003 some fundamental assumptions listed by di pietro et al 2003 and niu et al 2007 should be considered the most important assumption is that the gravitational force dominates the capillary force and the other forces are not considered in the system therefore the flow transport is assumed to have a vertical downward direction the other important assumption states that the model is established principally in the mobile water section given these assumptions w is the mobile volumetric water content w t w t is the first order partial time derivative of w and u is the volumetric water flux this assumes that the microporosity is completely saturated so there is no water exchange between the two porosities the law of continuity equation and its first derivative with respect to z are respectively defined as di pietro et al 2003 1 w z t t u z t z 0 2 2 w z t z t 2 u z t z 2 0 it is also assumed that the volumetric water flux within the macropores is a non linear function of the relation between w and w t described by the following equation 3 u u w w t u z t b w z t a ν w w z t t accordingly in the same water content the negative sign is applied when the volumetric water flux of the drainage stage is greater than that of infiltration and the positive sign is used when the volumetric water flux of infiltration stage is greater than that of drainage because as will be explained later the results of this study showed that in the same water content the volumetric water flux of the infiltration stage would be greater than drainage the positive sign is used to define the formula the model depends on three coefficients where u z t mm h 1 is volumetric water flux in time t and depth z a is a macropore flow distribution index b mm h 1 is a conductance term and ν w mm is the water dispersion coefficient all of which are positive numbers majdalani et al 2008 given the first derivative of eq 3 with respect to z the following description is derived 4 u z u w w z u w t w t z u z t z a b w z t a 1 w z t z v w 2 w z t z t where c w u z t w w t constant a b w z t a 1 is signal speed and v w is equal to u z t w t w constant the continuity equation eq 1 and eq 4 are combined to give the following equation 5 w z t t a b w z t a 1 w z t z v w 2 w z t z t considering the first derivative of the continuity equation eq 2 the following equation is derived from the substitution of 2 w z t z t 2 u z t z 2 and multiplication of u z t w or ab w z t a 1 on both sides of eq 5 6 u z t t a b w z t a 1 u z t z v w a b w z t a 1 2 u z t z 2 neglecting the second term of eq 3 ν w w z t t w z t u z t b 1 a is derived finally with the substitution of u z t b 1 a instead of w z t the following non linear partial differential equation was derived by di pietro and colleagues in 2003 majdalani et al 2008 7 u z t t a b 1 a u z t a 1 a u z t z ν w a b 1 a u z t a 1 a 2 u z t z 2 2 2 model development 2 2 1 modified kdw model with combination of van genuchten model introducing the kinematic dispersive wave van genuchten kdw vg model as mentioned di pietro and colleagues in 2003 applied eq 3 to model volumetric water flux in this equation ν w w z t t is the term that can model the loops of the hysteresis phenomenon during the infiltration drainage cycles and b w z t a is a power function that appears to have been taken from the power form of the volumetric water flux versus mobile water content fig 1 as reported by di pietro and colleagues in 2003 as fig 1 shows the curves follow a form of the power equation which is an empirical model the power function term of eq 3 b w z t a emphasizes the mathematical aspects with fewer physical assumptions here this term is substituted with the van genuchten model which is more physically based van genuchten in 1980 showed that based on the theory of mualem s capillary model mualem 1976 the hydraulic conductivity model can be expressed in closed form radcliffe and simunek 2010 2 2 2 van genuchten model the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 abbasi et al 2012 wang et al 2017 is an unsaturated hydraulic conductivity equation that has a physical base and is presented as follows 8 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 m 1 1 n n 1 9 s e w w r w s w r where s e is the effective water content k s e and k s l t 1 are the unsaturated and saturated hydraulic conductivity respectively l is the pore connectivity value n and m are dimensionless empirical constants w l3 l 3 is the soil volumetric water content w r is the residual soil volumetric water content and w s is the saturated or field saturated soil volumetric water content as the volumetric water flux resembles hydraulic conductivity in terms of physical and dimensions and similarly its amount varies between different levels of water content here the apparent shape of the van genuchten model is used instead of the first term of eq 3 b w z t a according to the experimental conditions some slight variations should be applied to the definitions of the input parameters of the van genuchten model whereas the amount of s e is normalized and dimensionless in this study with the redefinition of the parameters of s e as w m i n and w m a x the amount of s e always varies between 0 and 1 instead of w r w m i n is substituted in as the minimum amount of soil volumetric water content due to rainfall in each data series and w s is substituted with w m a x as the maximum amount of observed water content in each experiment therefore with the redefinition of the parameters of s e s e is defined as w z t w min w max w min in this study all experiments were conducted in the unsaturated condition and w max denotes the maximum amount of water content due to rainfall and is related to the maximum amount of water flux in each experiment therefore we changed w r and w s to w min and w m a x respectively both the van genuchten model and the first term of eq 3 b w z t a are power functions but the van genuchten model has more significant physical meaning in the proposed model the first term of eq 3 b w z t a is substituted with the van genuchten model thus with the general format of the van genuchten model for simulating water flux and considering the hysteresis term of eq 3 ν w w z t t the following equation is derived 10 u z t u in s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 ν w w z t t as mentioned previously the value of c in the kdw model is u w w t constant thus the first derivative of eq 10 will be as follows 11 c w u w w t constant l u in w z t w min l 1 w max w min l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 2 u in w max w min 1 1 s e 1 m m 1 s e 1 m m 1 s e 1 m l 1 therefore after defining all parameters of the kdw vg model the model is introduced as below 12 u z t t c u u z t z v u 2 u z t z 2 where v u c u v w to solve eq 12 numerically c u should be specified for the kdw model this was solved as mentioned by the substitution of w z t u z t b 1 a into c w u w w t constant a b w z t a 1 and the expression for w was arranged according to u here for the sake of simplicity di pietro did not consider the hysteresis term of eq 3 ν w w z t t to be eligible to easily arrange the expression for w according to u otherwise algebraically it would not be possible to create this change in the variable this can partly hinder the convergence of the equation to better results however in the kdw vg model to consider the full relationship between the observed values of w and u a numerical relationship was created between these two terms and the function of w f u was considered as a polynomial using the least squares method in this way the effect of hysteresis water content was also considered in this study eqs 7 and 12 are solved in the matlab programming language by the finite difference method and with the following initial and boundary conditions which were used by germann in 1985 13 u z t u i n t z 0 t 0 u z t u 0 z 0 t 0 where u i n t is the initial water flux 2 2 3 estimation of coefficients of both models the indefinite parameters of both models are defined by minimizing the error function of the root mean square error rmse between the observed and modelled water fluxes eqs 3 and 10 versus mobile water content in the kdw model the parameters a b and v w are unknown these parameters are defined by the following equation 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n u i b w i a v w w t i 2 where n u i and w i are the number of experimental observations observed fluxes at the bottom of the soil column at time i and mean measured mobile water content at time i respectively in addition in the kdw vg model the indefinite parameters l m and v w are calculated using the following equation 15 rmse 1 n i 1 n u i u in w i w min w max w min l 1 1 w i w min w max w min 1 m m 2 v w w t i 2 to define the indefinite parameters of the two above mentioned models the amount of rmse in eqs 14 and 15 should be minimized for this minimization the heuristic method of particle swarm optimization pso salahi et al 2013 is applied in the present work finally both kdw and kdw vg models represented by eqs 7 and 12 respectively are solved using the finite difference method and the models are validated in other words the hydrograph of drainage from the bottom of the soil columns due to an artificial rainfall is compared with the results of the kdw and kdw vg models in corresponding water fluxes it is hypothesized that the proposed model will provide a better prediction of the observations due to more physical assumptions in the kdw vg model based on mualem s 1976 capillary model overall the main objectives of this study are to 1 estimate the preferential water flow parameters of both kdw and kdw vg models to achieve the global minimum of error function using the pso algorithm and 2 validate both models with experimental observations to compare their performance 2 3 optimization one of the most important aspects of this study is to estimate the parameters of applied models by finding the global minimum of the error functions as the model developed in this study kdw vg is an innovation of the research the ranges of the model parameters are not definite except for parameter m which varies between 0 and 1 therefore this research is the first attempt to optimize and determine the parameters of the model with the aim of minimizing the error function the literature review also shows that the kdw model has seldom been used to explain preferential water flow behavior and so far its parameters have rarely been estimated by inverse methods local or global therefore the variation range of the parameter is still unclear and this can be attributed to the occurrence of the local optimization problem this study is one of the first attempts to optimize the parameters of the kdw model the study attempts to find the global minimum of the error functions global methods have the advantage of avoiding the problems of local optimizations however this advantage is obtained through a large number of evaluations of the objective function rauch and harremoës 1999 as the parameters of the applied models are obtained by the pso algorithm the features of this method are briefly presented 2 4 particle swarm optimization pso algorithm pso is one of the optimization methods inspired by nature and has been designed to solve numerical optimization problems nop with a very large search space and without the need to know the gradient of the objective function this method was first introduced by kennedy and eberhart 1995 the method is a suitable way to find the optimal global point of an error function tsoulos and stavrakoudis 2010 in this algorithm to solve an optimization problem a population of candidate responses randomly flows into the scope of the problem using a simple relation and then it is explored to find the optimal global answer 2 5 algorithm operation assume that x the search space for the pso algorithm is an n dimensional and continuous search space each particle in the t repetition of the pso algorithm has three attributes x t the current position of the particle in the t repetition v t the current speed of the particle in the t repetition and y t the best individual position of the particle until t repetition the suitability of each particle is equal to its objective function value then each particle moves in the search space with an initial speed of v based on the suitability of the particle and other particles in the group the best individual position of the particle until t repetition yields the y t that is the best value and the best position of the particle from the beginning to the t repetition now it is easy to determine y i t that is the best individual position of the particle i until t repetition based on the following relation 16 y i t x i t f x i t f y i t 1 y i t 1 o w in the above equation the function f is the value of the suitability of each particle based on the objective function after definition of y i t the set of p t can be defined as follows 17 p t y 1 t y 2 t y m t subsequently for the minimization mode y t which is the best global position found between all particles of the group until t repetition is defined as 18 y t y g t arg min i 1 m f y i t then the position of each particle can be updated at the end of each iteration based on the following relations 19 v i t 1 ω v i t r 1 c 1 y i t x i t r 2 c 2 y t x i t 20 x i t 1 x i t v i t 1 where r 1 r 2 0 1 represent uniformly distributed random numbers that are applied to maintain the dispersion of the particles and induction of the random property of particle motion and prevent them from sudden mutation c 1 and c 2 are individual and social acceleration coefficients that control the personal and global best values respectively and their values are determined by trial and error based on empirical results to start the optimization these numbers are usually considered to be around 2 on the other hand r 1 c 1 y i t x i t is the personal component that determines the rate of efficiency of particle i relative to the previous steps and r 2 c 2 y t x i t is the global social component that determines the efficiency rate of the particle i relative to the whole group in eq 19 the inertia weight ω actually provides a relation for the particle speed that allows for more efficient search in the search space regarding eq 19 it is obvious that large values of ω lead to a global search i e a large step search and small values of ω lead to a local search i e a small step search therefore with the application of large values of ω the algorithm will regularly search for new spaces without as much focus on accurate local searches while by reducing the values of ω the search will be performed more locally and around the optimal answers obtained in the previous generation many relationships have already been proposed to determine the inertia weight see shi and eberhart 1998 eberhart and shi 2001 malik et al 2007 feng et al 2007 nikabadi and ebadzadeh 2008 kentzoglanakis and poole 2009 li and gao 2009 chen et al 2018 yan et al 2018 ajdad et al 2019 3 materials and methods laboratory and numerical studies were conducted to investigate the preferential water flow in artificial macropores under different rainfall intensities an artificial preferential path was made by inserting a light soil lens into a field soil matrix which is proven to have a considerable effect on the preferential water flow to find an appropriate soil for the experiments different soil samples were first studied the samples were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and passed through a 2 mm stainless steel screen then the hydraulic conductivity of the soil samples was measured by the constant pressure head method after selecting the appropriate soil to construct the model the main sample which had an artificial preferential path to simulate the preferred water flow in the soil created by coarse sand was prepared using the following procedure wang et al 2013 2014 first a pvc tube with an internal diameter of 15 5 cm and a height of 40 cm was prepared the bottom of the soil column was covered with a double layer of plastic mesh with a pore diameter of 1 2 mm sharp edge sand was also glued to the inner wall of the pvc tube to increase the friction of the walls against the soil and reduce the probability of preferential flows from the walls then about 1 cm of gravel between the two sieves no 10 and no 6 2 and 3 35 mm respectively was poured onto the plastic mesh for better drainage next the empty pvc tube with a tripod was placed in a bucket of water which was filled with water to about one third of the height of the soil column a tube with an external diameter of 1 4 cm and a height of 60 cm was placed in the center of the pvc tube temporarily subsequently the soil was slowly poured into the pvc tube around the inner tube after pouring the soil around the inner tube at each stage the water was drained from the bottom by gravity and the soil was allowed to almost dry after this the inner tube was carefully pulled out from the pvc tube without disturbing the surrounding main experimental soil leaving a 1 4 cm diameter hole in the center of the main column the hole was immediately filled with coarse sand to avoid the collapse of the hole walls as the inner tube was pulled out of the middle of the main pvc tube the whole soil column was filled by wet pack method in three successive steps in each step a length of 10 cm was filled wang et al 2013 2014 at the end of each step the hole that was considered for creating the macropores was carefully filled with light sand this was repeated three times until the entire soil sample was finally added the soil had a coefficient of uniformity c u of 1 645 a coefficient of curvature c c of 1 183 and a median grain size d 50 of 0 146 mm the particle diameters of the coarse sand used to fill the inner hole were between 0 85 and 1 mm after the construction of the soil sample the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the whole soil sample was measured by the constant pressure head method as 172 6 mm h 1 then the soil column was made saturated from the bottom for 48 h before the infiltration drainage experiments after saturation of the soil column the water was allowed to be drained by gravity until the weight of the soil column was stabilized after ensuring the emptying of soil pores involved in the preferential flow mostly macropores the soil column was most probably kept moist by water retained by capillary forces in micropores a little exchange of water is expected between micropores and drainage porosity the amount of water in the micropores could be determined by weighing the soil column then as shown in fig 2 a funnel was attached to the bottom of the soil column after preparing the soil sample and the physical model as shown in fig 2 water droplets were created on the surface of the soil column with a rainfall simulator located about 10 cm above the soil surface the rainfall simulator was connected to a pump fed from a water tank majdalani et al 2008 the pump and two bypass pipes controlled rainfall duration and intensity the flow condition was unsaturated and the rainfall intensities should not have exceeded the hydraulic conductivity of the whole soil sample the drainage flow was also monitored continuously with a precise scale and the drainage hydrograph water flux versus time was derived from these data for each experiment the larger scale was used to record the weight of the entire soil column moisture during the whole experiment to calculate the evaluation of the mobile soil water content of the soil column the soil mobile volumetric water content at the desired time was calculated as follows 21 w m w t o t a l m w m i c r o p o r e m s ρ b where w is the mobile volumetric water content m w t o t a l is the total mass of water stored into the soil column m w m i c r o p o r e is the mass of water stored in the micropores m s is the dry soil mass measured at the end of the experiments after oven drying at 105 c and ρ b is the dry bulk density of the soil given by the following equation 22 ρ b m s v t where v t is the total volume of the soil column for this study the dry bulk density was 1 47 g cm 3 in this study infiltration experiments were performed with four simulated rainfall intensities of 56 97 107 64 133 01 and 161 71 mm h 1 two different scales were used one was set at the bottom of the funnel to determine the amount of drainage flow and the other was used to weigh the whole soil sample thus as soon as the second scale reached a plateau the rainfall simulator could be switched off from this point the scale placed under the funnel recorded the drainage flow or the falling limb of the drainage hydrograph the scale below the soil sample measured the amount of mobile water content at each moment and the other scale measured the drainage flow at the bottom of the soil column 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration of the kdw and kdw vg models to determine the indefinite coefficients of both models the objective functions eqs 14 and 15 were minimized using the pso algorithm for the kdw and kdw vg models respectively the water flux u was drawn as a function of w in infiltration drainage cycles in each of the four rainfall intensities fig 3 this figure is similar to the findings of di pietro and colleagues in 2003 and shows a hysteresis loop between the infiltration and drainage stage however the direction of the hysteresis loop is different in our experiments the water flux was higher for the infiltration stage than for the drainage stage for a given soil water content therefore the differential equation used in eqs 14 and 15 should have a positive sign di pietro et al 2003 found a negative sign in their equation as they observed that the water flux was lower for the infiltration stage than for the drainage stage different studies have reported contradictory results di pietro et al 2003 van genuchten 1980 gallage et al 2013 nielsen and biggar 1961 topp and miller 1966 youngs 1964 poulovassilis 1969 these authors used different soil textures in their research and achieved different results for the movement direction of the hysteresis cycle of soil moisture against the water flux it seems that no general findings on the direction of the hysteresis loop can be drawn from the literature for each level of rainfall intensity eqs 14 and 15 were fitted for the kdw and kdw vg models to the observations plotted on fig 3 in this study for optimization after investigating several relationships the relationship of linearly decreasing inertia weight presented by xin et al 2009 was finally used to determine the inertia weight as follows 23 ω k ω max ω max ω min iter max k where ω k is the amount of inertia weight in the k repetition and ω m i n and ω m a x are the amounts of inertia weight that are considered by default in this relationship for the initial minimum and maximum values here the values of 0 2 and 1 2 were selected for ω m i n and ω m a x respectively which yielded the best results and the maximum allowed iteration was the termination criterion of the optimization algorithm the initial value of ω k was selected as 1 for the first generation and due to the values of ω m i n and ω m a x the number of created generations and algorithm iteration after 5000 iterations this fell linearly to reach its minimum amount of 0 2 this range of changes was selected by conducting calculations and reviewing previous studies bansal et al 2011 here to make a balance between global and local searches and therefore faster convergence of the algorithm to the optimal global solution the inertia weight was reduced uniformly throughout the implementation of the algorithm in addition according to eq 19 different values for c 1 and c 2 were selected and tested and finally the values of 1 2 and 2 4 for c 1 and c 2 respectively yielded the best answers moreover the size of each answer group or the number of particles of each generation in other words the group size m in this study were selected to be equal to 200 particles 4 2 calibration results of the kdw model and determination of indefinite coefficients of the model parameters a b and v w were estimated according to eq 14 by minimizing the difference between the response of the relation of b w z t a ν w w z t t with u measured from the end of the soil column in corresponding w determined from the average whole of the soil column by the pso algorithm the optimization process of eq 14 and how to achieve the best results is shown in fig 4 the figure depicts the process of finding the optimal global point of the error function using the pso algorithm for different rainfall intensities here the horizontal axis represents the number of optimization algorithm iterations and the vertical axis represents the value of the error function which is equal to the rmse of eq 14 computed for each iteration as can be seen in fig 4 the algorithm finds the best response whatever the rainfall intensity after about 3300 iterations and the line becomes perfectly horizontal reflecting a constant and minimum value of rmse the optimized coefficients of the kdw model are presented in table 1 the value of the parameter b decreases with an increase in rainfall intensity similar results were found by di pietro and lafolie 1991 with the kw model on artificial soil but contradictory results were found by di pietro et al 2003 on natural soil with the kdw model the macropore networks in di pietro et al 2003 were formed by earthworms and were mainly cylindrical whereas the macropore network in di pietro and lafolie 1991 is quite similar to our experimental design due to the packing of large soil aggregates mean diameter about 10 mm the contradiction of our results with those of di pietro et al 2003 can be related to the fact that in di pietro s research in 2003 at a constant moisture level the amount of water flux in the drainage stage was higher than in the infiltration stage we derived the opposite finding the inconsistency in the direction of the hysteresis cycle movement may be associated with the difference in the applied soil texture in the two studies nonetheless v w was approximately constant moreover the values of the parameter a were approximately 1 however further experiments are needed to prove this trend the results of the model fitting to the experimental observations are presented in fig 5 where the line depicts the fitted values of the model and the squares represent the observed values as shown in fig 5 eq 14 fits the experimental observations well 4 3 calibration results of the kdw vg model and determination of indefinite coefficients of the model again to determine the indefinite coefficients of the model the objective function was minimized using the pso algorithm hence the parameters l m and v w were estimated with respect to eq 15 by minimizing the difference between the response of the relation of u in w z t w min w max w min l 1 1 w z t w min w max w min 1 m m 2 v w w z t t with the u measured at the bottom of the soil column in corresponding w that was obtained from the average of the whole soil column fig 6 displays the process of achieving the best responses and optimization of eq 15 using the pso algorithm for all different rainfall intensities here the horizontal axis represents the number of optimization algorithm iterations and the vertical axis represents the value of the error function which is equal to the rmse of eq 15 computed for each iteration based on fig 6 the algorithm achieved the best response after 3500 iterations whatever the rainfall intensity and the line became perfectly horizontal reflecting a constant and minimum value of rmse the optimized coefficients of the kdw vg model are presented in table 2 we observe that as the intensity was increased the values of parameters l m and v w did not significantly change this means that the ranges of the coefficients in the model developed in this study are not sensitive to the intensity of input rainfall in the van genuchten model the value of m cannot be greater than 1 and higher values of m represent more rapid movement of water or lighter texture of the soil in this regard in an attempt to determine the coefficient m in the van genuchten model ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2010 obtained the maximum amount of this coefficient for the lightest soil sand as 0 61 carsel and parrish 1988 reported a value of 0 63 for the coefficient m in sandy soil this was 0 68 for sandy soil based on the rosetta database schaap et al 2001 in addition leij et al 1996 obtained a maximum value of 0 85 for m in the van genuchten model in sandy soil yates et al 1992 examined several types of sandy soil and reported that m and l in the van genuchten model were equal to 0 86 and 1 92 0 85 and 1 3 and 0 84 and 1 26 respectively these values imply that due to the existence of preferential flows in the current study and the rapid movement of water through macropores the value of 0 98 that was derived for m in the present study seems logical conversely according to table 2 the values of l obtained in this study are approximately equal to the values reported by yates yates et al 1992 the results of model fitting to the experimental observations are shown in fig 7 here the squares represent the observed values and the line is the fitted value of the model to the observation according to fig 7 eq 15 fit the experimental observations very well and with very high accuracy in general by comparing the results of the two models see tables 1 and 2 it can be concluded that kdw vg model fit the observations with a slightly lower rmse value compared to the kdw model this indicates that the kdw vg model in which the power function used in the kdw model was replaced with the van genuchten model was able to fit the observations better due to its stronger physical meaning and concept generally the fitting of both kdw and kdw vg models was better at lower rainfall intensities because the dispersive effect was gradually decreased with the increase in input intensities therefore the effect of this factor was higher at lower velocities and fitting of the observations was better at lower rainfall intensities it should be mentioned that the only common coefficient of the two models the water dispersion coefficient ν w was found to be almost constant whatever the rainfall intensity and was not affected by the differences between the two models in addition table 2 shows that the changes in the three optimized coefficients of the kdw vg model are very low regardless of the initial rainfall intensity this implies that the parameters of the developed kdw vg model are not sensitive to rainfall intensity which is one of the advantages of the model developed in this study whereas according to table 1 the coefficient b in the kdw model changed significantly with changes in rainfall intensity 4 4 comparison of the models predictions with experimental observations model validation results after calibration of the models with data on the water flux exiting the soil column at different rainfall intensities versus soil mobile volumetric water content the coefficients of both the kdw and kdw vg models were obtained these models eqs 7 and 12 respectively were then solved with a numerical finite difference method for the numerical solution the spatial h step size of the finite difference method was selected to be equal in all corresponding experiments of both models this was also done for temporal τ step size thereby the results of the models in corresponding intensities became fairly comparable these spatial and temporal steps were selected primarily to satisfy the stability condition see appendix and capture the best response of the finite difference method and the lowest rmse values between observations and the models predictions numerical results were compared to the observed values of the water flux amount exiting the soil column versus time or the recorded hydrograph at the outlet of the soil column fig 8 shows the recorded hydrographs for the different rainfall experiments with different intensities in fig 8 regardless of the rainfall intensity at first the drainage hydrograph shows a rapid increase in flux u up to a non sloping part corresponding to a pseudo steady state and when the input flow stops the downside stage is a sudden drop in the flow rate that is followed by a drainage stage with a milder gradient 4 5 validation of the kdw model the rmse between the numerical results and those observed experimentally represents the difference between measurements and simulations it is shown in table 3 for different rainfall intensities the results of this numerical modelling are also displayed in fig 9 in which the line represents the simulation results and the circles represent the observed values as can be seen from table 3 and fig 9 the numerical solutions are in good agreement with experimental observations 4 6 cross simulation to determine the optimal coefficients of the kdw model as discussed earlier the coefficients of the kdw model were optimized with four different rainfall intensities and the model was calibrated for each then it was important to specify which of these four series of coefficients could be accepted as a single set of coefficients for this soil type whatever the rainfall intensity to answer the question as shown in table 4 the kdw model was separately validated for each rainfall intensity using each series of coefficients which had separately been calculated previously here the rmse values for the cross simulation of the experiment j column were obtained using the estimated parameters from the experiment k row which were equal to k j 1 2 3 4 as shown in table 4 the coefficients derived from the rainfall intensity of 133 01 mm h 1 gave better predictions of the experimental observations related to the hydrograph of the outlet from the end of the soil column 4 7 validation of the kdw vg model the rmse values between the numerical results of the kdw vg model and the observed values of drainage flux are shown for all rainfall intensities in table 5 the results of this numerical modeling are depicted in fig 10 in which the line depicts the simulation results and the circles represent the measurements based on the results presented in table 5 and fig 10 it is clear that the numerical solutions are strongly consistent with the experimental observations 4 8 cross simulation to determine the optimal coefficients of the kdw vg model here to determine the best of the four series of coefficients that were separately obtained using each rainfall intensity as shown in table 6 the kdw vg model was separately validated for each level of rainfall intensity using each series of coefficients as previously for the cross simulation of the experiment j column the rmse values were derived from the estimated parameters of the experiment k row which were equal to k j 1 2 3 4 respectively as is clear from table 6 for this model too the optimized coefficients of rainfall intensity of 131 01 mm h 1 provide a better prediction of the experimental observations pertaining to the hydrograph of the outlet from the end of the soil column for all rainfall intensities however this prediction for rainfall intensities other than 133 01 mm h 1 was better than the prediction of the optimal coefficients of each rainfall intensity and the third row had the minimum value of rmse for each column here it should be mentioned that the rmses of the prediction of other optimized coefficients for each rainfall intensity were not very different it can be observed in the columns of table 6 that the rmses of each column are all within the same range and are not very different because in the kdw vg model the coefficients of l m and v w did not differ significantly from one to another irrespective of the rainfall intensity from which they were derived this is not the case for the original kdw model see table 4 and can be seen as one of the advantages of the developed kdw vg model for which the input parameters do not depend on the rainfall intensity in other words none of the coefficients l m or v w exhibit significant variation in the validation stage when compared with the coefficient b in the kdw model and they could be considered as parameters representative of the soil properties only whereas the parameters of the kdw models are not representative of the soil properties only as they also depend on the rainfall intensity 4 9 comparison of performance of the kdw and kdw vg models in prediction of output hydrographs from the end of the soil column here the comparison of tables 3 and 5 clearly shows that the new kdw vg model predicted the output hydrograph from the end of the soil column with better accuracy than the original kdw model in fact the rmse values of the kdw vg model were lower than those of the kdw model for the corresponding rainfall intensities this finding can also be related to the application of the van genuchten model instead of the power equation in the kdw model the predictions of both the kdw and kdw vg models were improved at lower rainfall intensities especially at the rainfall intensity of 56 97 mm h 1 this proves the hypothesis that the dispersive effect is gradually eliminated as input intensities increase and can be more effective in better prediction at lower velocities the results show that the dispersion of the wetting front decreases as the input intensity increases at high intensities some small scale dispersive effects such as capillary effects may not occur at intermediate pore sizes and the coarse pores in most cases participate more in rapid preferential flows this has also been reported by di pietro et al 2003 here for a more accurate comparison of the accuracy of the models the cumulative square deviations of the measured and predicted values were calculated for both models the cumulative square deviations are depicted in fig 11 as a function of time in fig 11 part a shows the shape of the output hydrograph from the end of the soil column for each rainfall intensity and part b represents the amounts of the cumulative square deviations between the measured and predicted values for both models at the corresponding observation points of part a from fig 11 it can be seen that the cumulative square deviations between the measured and predicted values versus time are generally lower for the kdw vg model than for the kdw model this means that our proposed model is more accurate than the kdw model 5 conclusions this study presented the new kinematic dispersive wave van genuchten kdw vg model for the simulation of water flow through preferential paths this model is an evolution of the former kdw model di pietro et al 2003 in the kdw vg model the power equation that was applied in the kdw model to describe the relation between water flux and mobile water content was replaced with the shape of the van genuchten model which had more physical meaning infiltration drainage experiments were carried out on a soil column prone to preferential flow a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm was used to optimize and estimate the coefficients of the kdw and kdw vg models after parameters optimization both models could simulate the experiments with very low error after calibration of the models the output hydrographs from the end of the soil column were used for validation of the models despite a very close agreement between the simulated and measured hydrographs the kdw vg model could better predict the drainage hydrograph and water flow through the preferential paths the rmse was lower for the kdw vg model than for the kdw model the prediction of both models was better at lower rainfall intensities because when the input rainfall intensities increased the dispersive effect gradually decreased and this effect could be more influential on better prediction processes at lower velocities moreover the optimized parameters of the kdw vg model were not sensitive to rainfall intensity compared to the coefficients of the kdw model also a single set of parameters representative of only soil properties can be obtained with the kdw vg model whereas the kdw parameters also depend on rainfall intensity this is a very significant advance in the modelling and prediction of preferential flow but these results need to be confirmed by applying the kdw vg model for different soils overall the developed equation of this study is suggested to be used in water and solute transport models in porous media especially to model preferential flows and transport of solutes in soils for future studies it is recommended to replace the van genuchten model with the burdine meng 2018 or brooks corey models huber et al 2018 to investigate the performance of these models in combination with the kdw model in addition for further research work these experiments could be replicated with a precise weighing lysimeter to evaluate the efficiency of the kdw vg model and the solution method and estimate the coefficients for field and real conditions

this the taylor expansion of f around x 0 is defined as follows a 3 f x f x 0 x x 0 f x 0 x x 0 2 2 f x 0 x x 0 3 3 f x 0 regarding the above relationship the following phrases can be written a 4 f x

5796,in cotonou as in many expanding west african cities major population growth and infrastructural development has not kept up with informal settlement development onto floodable plains and marshes the population of the slum which makes up about 60 of the city s inhabitants is highly disadvantaged and vulnerable to rising sea levels flooding sanitation and waste management issues however the risks associated with the use of contaminated shallow groundwater for domestic purposes are less recognised our study demonstrates that in many instances the cheaper option of the use of shallow groundwater from the coastal quaternary aquifer for domestic purposes represents a significant risk for the poorer residents of cotonou through the voluntary drinking or non volontary dish washing cooking consumption of this unmonitored and untreated water resource in the 3 neighbourhoods surveyed environmental tracers major ions cl br molar ratios and stables isotopes showed that this shallow aquifer is degraded by seawater intrusion as well as septic and sewerage contamination in particular the higher nox concentrations correspond to ranges associated with sewerage and septic tank effluent pollution and the major ion concentrations and δ2h δ18o signatures showed that high salinity values are where groundwater mixes with saline lake nokoue water the population using this resource from local wells should be made aware of seasonal changes in groundwater contamination and potential health risks associated with sewerage and septic tank contamination keywords groundwater sewerage and septic tank contamination salinization urbanization recharge and discharge 1 introduction with cities in developing countries expanding at unprecedented rates ensuring clean water supplies for all inhabitants is becoming increasingly more challenging this is particularly the case in more impoverished urban areas where infrastructure development often lags behind population growth lapworth et al 2017 in addition there often exist two types of water supplies firstly there is the official water supply that is monitored treated and comes at a cost for consumers and then there is the second unregulated water supply that is often sourced from wells accessing shallow groundwater that is unmonitored untreated but free the health risks in using the unregulated groundwater resource for domestic purposes including drinking water supplies is high due to water quality issues in many urban areas e g ouedraogo et al 2016 hassane 2010 the same factors driving the demand for water supplies accelerated urban growth and the expansion of informal settlements are also significant drivers of groundwater pollution unesco 2017 one of the many threats to shallow groundwater quality in cities is from sanitary wastewater and solid waste disposal lu et al 2015 uncontrolled seepage of wastewater from septic tanks and human activities as well as infiltration of urban stormwater lead to groundwater contamination dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 many parts of the world are now reporting groundwater and surface water nitrate pollution issues roy et al 2007 stuart et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 ogrinc et al 2019 for example in the coimbatore city india population growth pit latrines and septic tanks industrial effluents and irrigation water return flows are the main sources of groundwater contamination selvakumar et al 2017 in florida the proximity of wells to septic tanks contributes to increasing fecal coliform nitrate and phosphate concentrations during wet season compared with the dry season arnade 1999 many studies have identified sewerage and latrine contamination as a significant public health issue due to the resultant presence of faecal bacteria in waters such as escherichia coli faecal streptococci salmonella and shigella boukari 1998 odoulami and gbesso 2013 yadouléton 2015 during this study for the first time the seasonal variation in the contamination of waters by sewerage and latrine contaminantion is investigated using environmental tracers in addition shallow groundwater resources in coastal cities are particularly vulnerable to salinity problems due to mixing with saline surface waters and seawater intrusion barker et al 1998 cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2016 najib et al 2017 liu et al 2017 for example in ho chi minh city vietnam the groundwater resources are under threat due to saltwater intrusion in the shallow aquifer ngo et al 2015 in this study we use the example from cotonou benin to identify processes resulting in nitrate and salinity contamination of a city s unmonitored and untreated shallow groundwater resource the complexity of contamination processes in evolving urban environments makes it difficult to study the risks of shallow groundwater quality this can be due to both natural seasonal shifts from climatic and environmental influences and significant anthropogenic influences on the hydrogeological system in this study we analyse the distribution and concentration of major ions and stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o to investigate the temporal variation in groundwater quality across 3 sites in cotonou these 3 neighbourhoods were selected to represent contrasting hydrogeological environments i a neighbourhood st jean where there is no surface inundation ii a neighbourhood ladji bordering lake nokoué which overflows towards the end of the wet season and iii a neighbourhood agla located in a swamp low land and is subject to inundation during both the small and large wet seasons in doing so we identify hydrological conditions and seasons when groundwater is at its greatest vulnerability in terms of salinization and latrine contamination at each site there are wells where local inhabitants have access to unmonitored and untreated shallow groundwater for domestic consumption 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the city of cotonou is bordered by lake nokoué to the north and the atlantic ocean to the south the location of cotonou and the average monthly interannual rainfall at cotonou station from 1971 to 2016 are shown in figs 1 and 2 the topography of the city is relatively flat with an altitude varying between 0 m and 6 m boukari 1998 the average annual rainfall for cotonou is 1 300 mm yabi and afouda 2012 the city s climate is characterised by 4 seasons main dry season average rainfall is 25 mm from mid november to mid march main wet season average rainfall is 152 mm from mid march to mid july small dry season average rainfall is 55 mm in mid july to mid september and small wet season average rainfall is 75 mm from mid september to mid novembre 2 2 aquifer geology cotonou is located in the coastal sedimentary basin comprised of quaternary holocene sediments which include facies of the littoral plain sands and alluvial deposits underlain by sediments from the mio pliocene continental tenninal paleocene and upper cretaceous maliki 1993 previous studies by oyédé 1991 maliki 1993 alidou et al 1994 and boukari 1998 have described in detail the different sedimentary units of this coastal sedimentary basin and the distribution are presented in fig 1 the shallow quaternary sediments consist predominantly of fine to medium sands 85 5 silts 5 5 and clays 9 oyédé 1991 the low clay content in these sediments results in the high permeability of the shallow sandy soils maliki 1993 and therefore a high vulnerability of the aquifers to the transfer of surficial pollutants the clays in quaternary sediments are constituted by smectite and a kaolinite content which increases with depth the traditional domestic wells were sampled in this study so that we could analyse the water consumed and used by local residents however due to the intense pumping of these wells the fluctuations in hydraulic head are heavily influenced by pumping therefore we were unable to use the hydraulic head data to infer subsurface flow directions there has however been previous work that has addressed this question the work of maliki 1993 and boukari 1998 focused on the piezometry of the cotonou water table during the flood and low water periods and the interactions with the lake it appears from these studies that during the flood period there is a flow direction of groundwater from the center of cotonou piezometric dome to outlets such as lake nokoué the lagoon the atlantic ocean and swamps in comparison during the low water period it was observed that water from the lake nokoué flows into the groundwater aquifer 2 3 sewerage and waste the city of cotonou has about 166 433 households and the population evaluated at 679 012 inhabitants in 2013 insae 2015 and is subject to increasing urbanization the poorer dwellings are located in the neighborhoods along the coastline along the edges of the cotonou channel and lake nokoué and in the swamp areas in these neighbourhoods solid and liquid wastes are released into the immediate environment without treatment as illustrated in the fig 1 c in addition they are also scattered in various places of the city where garbage heaps have formed 78 5 of household wastewater and 33 of solid wastes are ejected in gardens streets gutters unused wells and empty blocks insae 2016 these poorer neighborhoods are also without adequate sanitation systems in cotonou 64 9 of households use latrines that are reportedly leak proof whereas 13 5 adopt unsafe and non hygienic practices such as stilt latrines and open defecation only 20 8 of the population use septic tanks which are generally evacuated by drainage structures insae 2016 since there are few market gardens in this heavily urbanised city the potential sources of nitrate in the study area are predominantly from wastewater solid waste and septic tanks therefore the risk of pollutant transfers to the shallow aquifers is high in the poorer neighbourhoods because they are exposed to both i frequent episodes of inundation and ii high levels of pollutants from poorly constructed landfills and latrines 2 4 groundwater quality and use several studies have evaluated the impact of human activities on the quality of the shallow groundwater in the cotonou region and have reported relatively high levels of nitrates e g up to 100 mg l maliki 1993 boukari 1998 odoulami and gbesso 2013 totin et al 2013 in addition the vulnerability of this groundwater resource is also related to its proximity to the atlantic ocean and the saltwater or brackish lakes boukari 1998 totin et al 2013 data from previous studies have shown an increase in salinity levels in groundwater near lake nokoué the salinity of the lake nokoué also exhibits a marked seasonal cycle 0 psu during the small wet season in october and 25 30 psu at the end of the dry season stephen et al 2010 mcinnis et al 2013 totin et al 2013 the coastal groundwater system in cotonou has relatively high chloride 23 6 to 160 mg l and sulphate 6 4 to 25 7 mg l concentrations alassane et al 2015 nlend et al 2018 lake nokoué and the atlantic ocean are therefore a major concern in terms of the source of salinization of groundwater resources in the coastal zone alassane et al 2015 due to the groundwater pollution problems shallow groundwater is excluded from the official supply of drinking water to the city of cotonou however the low rate of services to the public water supply network in the neighborhoods of peri urban areas 51 leads the population to use the groundwater from the shallow quaternary aquifer for their various domestic uses insae 2016 this is despite the fact that the quaternary aquifer is not part of the official monitoring services of the national water company of benin the only legal water distribution structure groundwater from the shallow quaternary aquifer is accessed by the residents of cotonou via large diameter wells installed on private household property these large diameter wells are shallow and are designed to pump groundwater from the water table surface so as not to pump deeper saline groundwater maliki 1993 the quaternary aquifer sands have a high permeability in the order of 10 2 to 10 4 m s and locally contains fresh to brackish groundwater whose exploitation is related to the position of the lake water and seawater instrusions and to the replenishment of freshwater lenses in cotonou 81 of the neighbourhoods have wells and whilst 9 have not any water supply no wells nor stand pipe for drinking water supply for domestic purposes they sometimes buy water for drinking purposes from neighbours hounkpe et al 2014 furthermore the groundwater from the large diameter private wells is used in households for drinking cooking laundry bathing and washing dishes yadouléton 2015 eaa 2018 in this study we expand on previous work to elucidate the seasonality of hydrogeological processes resulting in the contamination of groundwater from latrine waste notably nitrate and nitrite concentrations herein referred to as nox and from salinization 3 methods three neighbourhoods in cotonou were selected for sampling based on differences in their hydrogeological environments i st jean where there is no long term surface inundation and the heavy rainfall infiltrates the soils or leaves the site via overland flow ii ladji which is located at the shore of lake nokoué and is inundated towards the small wet season and iii agla which is located in a flood plain and is inundated early during both the small and large wet seasons the locations of these three neighbourhoods and sampling sites are presented in fig 1 in each neighbourhood groundwater wells were selected for sampling and where when possible surface water samples permanent and temporary pools as well as lake nokoué were also included the depths to the water table and the electrical conductivity ec of groundwater in the quaternary aquifer were monitored monthly at 9 wells and 3 piezometers from each of the 3 neighbourhoods from june 2017 to june 2018 the wells are separated by an average distance of 200 m within the same neighbourhood probe the hydrochemistry of waters were analysed 6 times between november 2016 to june 2018 during the months of february main dry season june main wet season and november small wet season resulting in a total of 127 groundwater and 60 surface water samples in addition for the period from june 2017 to june 2018 13 rainfall samples were analysed to determine water stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o lastly 2 water samples from atlantic ocean ao were collected of the periods from january 2019 main dry season groundwater was sampled from the quaternary aquifer via the large diameter wells groundwater and surface water temperature ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ using a wtw 3430i portable digital multiparameter water samples were collected for the analyses of cations filtered at 0 45 µm and acidified with hno3 anions and stable isotopes that were conducted at the laboratory of hydrogeology of the university of avignon france major ions were analysed using ion chromatography dionex ics1100 and autosampler as ap ion analysis uncertainty is in the order of 3 and all ionic balances were 5 the alkalinity was measured using a hach digital titrator and stable isotopes were analysed using a picarro analyser l 2130 i for the stable isotopes of waters the error is 0 1 for δ18o and 1 δ2h the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 the mixing ratio between lake and shallow groundwater is calculated by using stable isotopes values according to paran et al 2015 δ 18 o m f δ 18 o l 1 f δ 18 o gw the same equation is used with δ2h to compute the δ2hm mixing ratio om is water sample isotope composition where groundwater gw and lake l mixing is supposed ol is lake isotope composition ogw is groundwater isotope composition and f is mixing fraction one questionnaire in each sampling site was administered 10 per study area ladji agla and st john a total of thirty 30 questionnaires were administered through an interview with households in each study area main information such as the the source of drinking water supply groundwater use waste and wastewater management are mentioned in the questionnaire supplementary data 4 results 4 1 seasonal variations of the water table and groundwater ec the monthly monitoring of the depth to water table and ec over a one year period highlights the variations in seasonal fluctuations of the aquifers between the sites typical of unconfined shallow aquifers the quaternary aquifer shows marked spatial and seasonal variations and is in phase with the monthly rainfall the seasonal variations of the water table and groundwater ec in each of the neighbourhoods are illustrated in figs 3 and 5 between the neighbourhoods st jean has a maximum depth to water table 1 5 m at site j5 corresponding with the dry season february that is relatively deep compared with the depths of 1 4 m and 1 0 m observed in ladji site l7 and agla site a4 respectively fig 5 in addition at 2 of the 4 sites in agla the negative depth values indicate that the water table is above the land surface during the wet season thus contributing to the floods whereas groundwater at st jean and ladji remains below the surface the seasonal fluctuation amplitudes also vary in st jean the maximum change between wet and dry season water table depth is of 1 2 m here the water table fluctuations also vary between wells well j5 strongly reacts to the increased rainfall in october small wet season whereas the deepening of the water table in wells j1 and j2 remain relatively weak fig 5 these relatively low water table values can be attributed to the use of wells by households boukari 1998 kadjangaba et al 2018 similar to st jean in ladji the seasonal fluctuations in the water table between the wet and dry seasons vary by 1 3 m fig 5 in comparison in agla the seasonal amplitude of the water table variation is lower 0 5 m since ladji is located on the shore of lake nokoué the lake fluctuations likely influence the variation of the water table depths an increase of about 90 cm in the water table is observed at ladji between the wet and dry seasons is consistent with the observed elevation of the lake level during the same period ird irhob unpublished data the rise in water level starts in january and increases gradually to april may which is a 2 month time lag from agla and st jean with seasonal variations in the water table depth the groundwater ec also shows varying trends fig 3 in st jean the groundwater ec values 297 1 285 μs cm are relatively weak compared to agla and ladji and show variable seasonal changes fig 3 wells j1 and j2 recorded higher ec values in the dry season 511 1 285 μs cm when groundwater levels were low compared with the wet season 297 799 μs cm in comparison the well j5 and the piezometer had higher ec values 444 1 169 μs cm in the rainy season rise of the water table compared with the dry season 497 685 μs cm in agla the groundwater ec ranges between 353 and 1 468 μs cm which is low compared with local surface waters including temporary ponds and swamps 2 800 2 900 μs cm ec values are similar during the rainy season and the dry season fig 3 in ladji the groundwater ec values are higher than in the other neighbourhoods 633 5 340 μs cm and similar to the local temporary ponds 480 4 090 μs cm but strongly lower than the lake nokoué up to 49 700 μs cm during dry season with the exception of well l2 no difference was observed in the variation of the ec during the dry season and the rainy season 1 478 5 340 μs cm 4 2 seasonal variations of major ions the composition of major ion concentrations of waters is different in each of the neighbourhoods as highlighted in fig 4 in st jean the groundwater is of na ca hco3 cl type in comparison the groundwater in ladji is of na hco3 cl type and agla groundwater is more of the na ca hco3 so4 hco3 type fig 4 the ponds sampled in both ladji and agla show some similarities in major ion compositions with local groundwater thus indicating a potential connection between surface and subsurface waters however this connection is spatially and or temporally variable in particular in agla since some of the pond samples have a greater concentration of hco3 relative to cl and so4 and increased ca relative to na and mg compared with groundwater in addition in ladji the lake nokoué has a greater ratio of cl to so4 and hco3 compared with groundwater the temporal evolution of these major ions at each site is presented in fig 5 and similar to ec values the seasonal changes vary both between sites and between neighbourhoods greatest seasonal variations are observed in ladji and particularly for groundwater sampled at l6 and l7 where dry season conditions results in increases in na by 244 374 mg l ca by 76 81 mg l cl by 301 447 mg l and hco3 by 530 622 mg l these sites are located between 100 and 150 m from the lake shore the increase of the ions concentration during dry season is associated with a deepening of the water table and may therefore indicate influences of lake infiltration the lake nokoué has greater concentrations of na 3 168 12 219 mg l ca 146 419 mg l cl 6 166 1 9310 mg l and hco3 73 110 mg l compared with all groundwater samples tables 1 and 2 in agla the seasonal variations in major ions remain relatively stable except for hco3 and so4 concentrations fig 5 however between sites there are large differences in seasonal trends four of the eight groundwater wells a4 a5 a9 and a10 show an increase in na by 47 128 mg l ca by 20 88 mg l hco3 by 155 750 mg l and cl by 61 155 mg l during the month of february dry season during the wet seasons june and october november the remaining four wells a2 a6 a8 and a7 show an increase in na by 93 158 mg l ca by 34 78 mg l hco3 by 99 436 mg l cl by 110 176 mg l and so4 by 75 276 mg l concentrations these trends correspond to changes in the water table depths where the increasing wet season major ion concentrations occurs in wells where the groundwater is sub artesian during the wet season a2 and a8 compared to wells where groundwater remains well below the surface and has increased dry season major ion concentrations a4 these trends may highlight the influence of groundwater mixing with pond water in the discharge areas compared with infiltrating rainfall diluting groundwater in other areas during the wet season the temporary and permanent pond waters have similar concentrations of na 56 166 mg l ca 34 147 mg l cl 43 240 mg l and hco3 97 738 mg l compared with agla groundwater samples tables 1 and 2 in st jean groundwater at seven of the ten wells sampled j1 j2 j10 j3 j4 j6 and j9 show an increase in na by 36 115 mg l ca by 49 114 mg l hco3 by 119 439 mg l and cl by 42 111 mg l concentrations during the dry season february and march fig 5 this occurs at the time when the water table is at its deepest level in addition small wet season peaks in major ion concentrations are also observed in groundwater from wells j5 j7 and j8 these increases include na by 63 65 mg l ca by 63 80 mg l hco3 by 128 272 mg l and cl by 61 79 mg l concentrations since st jean does not have any surface water bodies the wet and dry season major ion variations are probably due to variations in the composition of infiltrating water mixing between subsurface waters reactions during water table fluctuations and evaporation 4 3 stables isotopes the δ18o and δ2h values of rainfall in cotonou obtained from 95 samples from the iita and iaea global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip from 2005 to 2016 has a weighted average of 2 8 1 6 for δ18o and 11 2 11 7 for δ2h the local meteorological water line lmwl of rainfall obtained from these data has a slope of 7 and is presented together with the global meteoric water line gmwl slope of 8 craig 1961 in fig 6 these data were also used to calculate the mean weighted average values of δ18o and δ2h for different ranges in monthly rainfall the results show that when monthly rainfall is 50 mm the isotope values are greater compared with monthly rainfall ranging from 50 mm to 500 mm fig 6a the isotope values of rainfall collected in cotonou show an overall mass effect a depletion in heavy isotopes correlates with an increase in rainfall amounts in cotonou the local rainfall has stable isotope values covering a large range from 5 4 to 0 8 for δ18o and from 30 9 to 14 5 for δ2h fig 6a black crosses the groundwater values from the three sites are also presented in fig 6a which also highlights a large range in values from 4 17 to 0 35 for δ18o and from 21 9 to 4 3 for δ2h in st jean the stable isotope values for groundwater vary between 4 17 and 2 37 for δ18o and between 21 87 and 8 98 for δ2h these values show that the groundwater in st jean is depleted at δ18o and δ2h the linear regression between δ18o and δ2h values slope of 7 5 lie close to the lmwl fig 6a suggesting that groundwater likely originates from local rainfall in ladji groundwater has enriched in δ18o and δ2h compared with st jean 3 36 to 0 35 and 12 96 to 4 17 respectively fig 6b this discrepancy may be due to three distinct phenomena i the recharge of relatively low volume rainfall events 50 mm month in ladji compared with st jean ii evaporation effects some values lie to the right of the lmwl indicating a slope of 5 2 or iii groundwater mixing with lake water during the dry season groundwater isotopic values are close to the lake nakoue values fig 6b which suggests a strong mixing between the lake and groundwater during this season there are also a number of groundwater samples whose δ18o and δ2h values remain close to those of the temporary and permanent ponds δ18o and δ2h mixing ratios indicate ranges from 72 to 74 of shallow groundwater mixing with lake water during the dry season in ladji like in ladji groundwater in agla is also enriched in δ18o and δ2h 3 57 to 0 03 and 18 22 to 2 78 respectively compared with st jean some samples from agla mostly during the dry season lie to the right of the mwl with a slope of 5 4 fig 6c therefore these groundwaters may also be subject to evaporation and mixing with enriched surface waters such as the lake water via the lowlands and the pond water in addition groundwaters e g wells a9 and a10 that are close to lake water are located in discharge areas δ18o and δ2h mixing ratios indicate ranges from 54 to 62 of shallow groundwater mixing with lake water in agla 4 4 nitrogen the beninese quality standard for drinking water for nitrogen is 45 mg l 0 70 mmol l for no3 3 2 mg l 0 07 mmol l for no2 and 250 mg l 7 0 mmol l for cl decree n 2001 094 of february 20th in this study 26 values of 0 73 5 06 mmol l of the groundwater sampled exceeds these limits in terms of no3 and 7 0 values of 0 12 2 04 mmol l for no2 table 1 highest values of nox no2 no3 are observed in groundwater of st jean where the concentrations reach values of 5 06 mmol l average of 0 90 mmol l for nh4 the groundwater concentrations remain low up to 0 80 mmol l average of 0 04 mmol l the highest concentrations of nox are observed during the dry season 3 mmol l compared with wet season samples nox 3 37 mmol l two sites j6 and j8 have elevated nox concentrations in both the wet and dry seasons 1 15 5 06 and 0 99 2 58 mmol l respectively nox in st jean groundwater may originate from natural fixation of nitrogen in the soil and human pollution via leaky latrines and human defacation in the streets in ladji the groundwater nox concentrations ranges up to 2 51 mmol l average of 0 54 mmol l and nh4 is up to 0 43 mmol l average of 0 11 mmo l during the wet season the groundwater nox concentrations are highest 1 06 2 51 mmol l compared to dry season concentrations 0 13 mmol l the wet season increase in nox of groundwater in ladji may either be due to infiltration of anthropogenic pollution or nitrogen fixed by vegetation in the soils the nox concentrations are low in the permanent ponds and the lake 0 01 mmol l however the wet season temporary ponds have high concentrations of nh4 up to 1 55 mmol l which may undergo nitrification during infiltration and may also result in the nox contaminantion of groundwater the highest value of nh4 in groundwater is observed in agla but only at one site a10 4 91 mmol l all other sites have nh4 concentrations in groundwater ranging from 0 00 to 0 52 mmol l average of 0 17 mmol l compared with ladji and st jean groundwater nox concentrations in agla are low with a maximum of 0 86 mmol l average of 0 15 mmol l in contrast permanent ponds in the agla lowlands have high nox levels only at one site a13 17 50 mmol l particularly in the dry season as described by katz et al 2011 the cl br ratio can be a valuable first assessment of septic tank contamination of shallow groundwater this is based on the assumption that sewerage waters and septic tank effluent exhibit distinct ranges and higher values of cl br molar ratios and cl concentrations compared with rainwater davis et al 1998 as observed in many samples form this study fig 7 a elevated cl br ratios may also result from the dissolution of halite however halites have not been reported in the local quaternary aquifer in addition many of the groundwater values correspond to ranges reported for sewerage and septic tank effluent davis et al 1998 vengosh and pankratov 1998 katz et al 2011 compared with waters with halite dissolution davis et al 1998 pastén zapata et al 2014 panno et al 2006 rainwater from coastal areas and seawater alcalá and custodio 2008 davis et al 1998 according to fig 7b groundwater values with similar cl br ratios and cl concentrations than sewerage wastewater also show higher concentrations of nox three samples wells j2 l9 and a6 plot above the cl br ratios for sewage or septic tank effluent cl br molar ratios 676 1350 cl 1000 ml l likely indicating animal manure as evidenced in fig 7b values that fall into the animal manure animal urine cl br molar ratios 2810 3730 cl 1000 mg l also have high nox concentrations 0 76 0 81 mmol l other evidence for a septic tank and animal manure influence are the corresponding elevated dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations table 1 however not all the groundwater samples have high doc concentrations according to kortelainen and karhu 2006 rapid oxidation of doc into carbon dioxyde may account for the low doc concentration in groundwater alternatively samples with low nox concentrations and relatively low cl br ratios such as groundwater from agla fig 7b can indicate areas of organic biodegradation e g mcarthur et al 2012 the relationship between hco3 nox and do for all groundwater sampled at agla is shown in fig 8 the samples where dissolved oxygen do and nox are low compared with hco3 correspond to discharge areas this is especially the case for groundwater sampled during the dry season at wells a10 a9 and piezometers a11 j11 where hco3 values increases 4 80 12 31 mmol l and nox decreases 0 0 0 40 mmol l with low do values 0 06 4 22 mg l however this may also indicate areas of recent rainfall infiltration resulting in a dilution of nox concentrations e g for well a4 fig 9 5 discussion 5 1 variations in the drivers of groundwater degradation the vulnerability of groundwater degradation from either salinization or sewage leakage in cotonou is temporally and spatially variable the quarternary aquifer is exposed to large fluctuations in the water table in response to rainfall changes all sites show seasonal water table fluctuations higher than 0 5 m however both the timing of the water table fluctuations and the seasonal changes in groundwater quality varies between urban areas in agla a strong driver of groundwater quality is the proximity to lowlands agla is scattered by these low elevation zones which have either temporary or permanent ponds where groundwater seasonally discharges as highlighted by the major ion results wet season increases in the water table can either result in increased groundwater salinity ec up to 1468 µs cm in these lowland discharge areas due to mixing with pond water or can result in lower groundwater salinity ec 842 µs cm due to the dilution effect from infiltrating rainfall during the dry season the groundwater stable isotope values also highlight increased mixing with pond water and saltier lake nokoué water elevated nox concentrations in groundwater at agla is due to sewerage contamination and was recordered during both dry and wet seasons nox concentrations up to 0 86 mmol l groundwater contamination from sewerage may infiltrate direcly from leaky latrines or from mixing with the permanent ponds which have accumulated nox concentrations up to 17 50 mmol l according to starr and gillham 1993 denitrification tends to occur in aquifers with very shallow groundwater compared to aquifers with deeper groundwater more than 2 m low dissolved oxygen levels combined with low nox levels in shallow wells even less than 1 0 m in the study area fig 8 where higher levels can be expected may be related to biodegradation or denitrification processes postma et al 1991 jorgensen et al 2004 hassane et al 2016 kadjangaba et al 2018 either by reducing no3 to hco3 1 or n2 2 according to postma et al 1991 and anornu et al 2017 the absence or low concentrations of no2 and nh4 in groundwater is probably related to the reduction of no3 to n2 the overall denitrification process can be described as berner 1980 1 5ch2o 4no3 2n2 4hco3 co2 3h2o 2 2no3 12h 10e n2 6h2o however denitrification may not be the only process that contributes to the increase of hco3 in shallow groundwater which probably also results from the decomposition of organic matter and mineral dissolution reactions e g alassane et al 2015 in ladji the main influence on groundwater salinization ec up to 5 340 µs cm is the mixing with the lake nokoué waters this was obvious during the dry season where both stable isotopes values and major ion concentrations clearly highlight mixing and the water level also shows an early dry season rise in values due to lake infiltration in comparison the sewerage contamination of groundwater is mostly evidenced during the wet season groundwater nox up to 2 5 mmol l during the wet season increases in nox from sewerage sources may result from both i rises in the water table mobilising nox in the unsaturated zone and or ii infiltrating rainfall and temporary ponds recharging the shallow groundwater as suggested by stable isotope results and therefore transporting nox to the saturated zone st jean is the only studied neighbourhood that does not have any surface water bodies and no groundwater discharge sites therefore the wet and dry season variations in groundwater degradation are potentially due to variations in the composition of infiltrating water mixing between subsurface waters and reactions during water table fluctuations although st jean has low groundwater salinity levels ec up to 1 285 us cm this area has the highest nox concentrations recorded in this study nox up to 5 06 mmol l since the local rainfall is the only origin of the shallow groundwater as seen from stable isotope values it is expected that either recharging rainfall or rising water tables transfers nox from the sewerage sources to the groundwater system during the wet season however at st jean groundwater nox concentrations are greater during the dry season up to 5 06 mmol l compared with the wet season up to 2 58 mmol l so instead the contamination may be constant leakage from latrines throughout the year and wet season rainfall may act to dilute this contamination almost all the pit latrines and septic tanks in cotonou have depths between 1 50 and 2 50 m hounkpe et al 2014 yadouléton 2015 in st jean the maximum depth to water table is observed at 1 53 m in the dry season which means that dry season saturated zones remain close to leaking sewerage sources 5 2 periods of increased risk due to groundwater degradation generally speaking groundwater samples with nitrate levels that exceed the beninese quality standards for drinking water originated from wells j1 j3 j6 j7 j8 j9 and j11 piezometer during the dry season february and march in st jean from wells l7 and l11 during the rainy season june and october in ladji and from wells a2 a6 in the dry season february and november in agla thus risk for nitrate pollution in shallow groundwater shows high seasonal variation between sites similar results were obtained by boukari 1998 and totin et al 2013 at different sites in cotonou with higher no3 levels up to 1 61 mmol l observed during recharge of the wet season the measured ec values show a large amplitude of spatial and temporal variation the ec values in agla and st jean are in the same order of variations 200 1 800 μs cm whereas the groundwater in ladji records ec values in the order of 750 5 340 μs cm in st jean the waters are more saline during the dry season unlike st jean the wells in agla and ladji are saline during both the dry and the rainy seasons due to mixing processes with lake water 5 3 shallow groundwater an unregulated water resource in expanding urban environments in urban areas of sub saharan africa groundwater from shallow wells is commonly used to partially or fully supply drinking water resources okotto et al 2015 in major cities such official groundwater resources are monitored and treated for example in the coastal city of douala cameroon shallow groundwater is the main source for domestic and drinking purposes takem et al 2015 likewise in bamako mali around 55 of the population uses water from aquifer resources british geological survey 2002 where shallow groundwater is not the official resource the shallow groundwater usually free and therefore commonly used in the impoverished areas of urban sprawls including for domestic uses normally this resource is meant for washing only but it commonly ends up for drinking dish washing shower and cooking water supplies for example the interviews conducted during this study showed that 10 on 10 of the households in st jean 9 on 10 in agla and 4 on 10 in ladji reported to use well water only for dish washing in st jean 1 on 10 households declared to use well water for drinking water supply compared with agla and ladji where no households have reported such use the results of the interviews have therefore showed that there are differences in groundwater use between st jean ladji and agla the underprivileged areas of the city are subject to greater groundwater quality issues and this also correspond to the parts of the city where the residents are more dependent on the groundwater as a domestic water resource this is the case in kinshasa democratic republic of congo where in peri urban and rural inhabitants widely use the unregulated and untreated shallow groundwater resources for drinking water supply ndembo 2009 unfortunately as seen in this case study of cotonou the shallow groundwater in urban environments is often contaminated this was also observed in blantyre malawi where drinking water from shallow groundwater was heavily polluted by a lack of sanitation facilities and indiscriminate waste disposal mkandawire 2008 likewise high no3 concentrations in urban shallow groundwater resources have been observed in dakar senegal no3 100 mg l ndeye et al 2017 douala cameroon no3 up to 241 mg l ketchemen tandia et al 2017 and in different regions of ghana no3 up to 507 mg l rossiter et al 2010 in many urban cases the nitrate contamination of shallow groundwatear is from anthropogenic sources martínez santos et al 2017 this was also observed in this study and previous work in cotonou boukari 1998 maliki 1993 boukari et al 1996 totin et al 2013 and as also noted in other major sub saharan cities such as n djaména tchad kadjangaba et al 2018 and djibouti ahamed et al 2017 as highlighted in the study of ouagadougou burkina faso yameogo 2008 such nitrate contamination is linked to the high population density that relies on archaic or non existent sanitation systems this is a particularly significant challenge in informal settlements like in the cities of douala takem et al 2010 ketchemen tandia et al 2017 and kampala ouganda nyenje et al 2013 where the increase in nitrates and chlorides in shallow groundwater are related to faeces from pit latrines sewages landfills surface discharges and droppings from domestic animals 6 conclusion although pollution sources are identical for each of the three neighbourhoods studied the resultant transfers and reactions controlling concentrations are distinct in the neighbourhood where there is no surface inundation and acts as a local recharge area the groundwater salinity values remain low ec 1285 µs cm however nox concentrations are the highest recorded in this study up to 5 1 mmol l in the neighbourhood bordering a lake where there is seasonal inundation and groundwater discharge the dry season interaction with lake water results in groundwater with highest observed ec values up to 5340 μs cm stable isotope δ2h and δ18o mixing ratios indicate mixing of up to 74 with lake water in the neighbourhood located in a swamp that is subject to inundation during both the small and large wet seasons also shows mixing with lake water up to 62 using δ2h and δ18o values resulting in groundwater ec values up to 1468 µs cm this discharge site notably has lower nox concentrations up to 0 86 mmol l however this is not indicative of less sewerage contamination only greater degradation processes understanding the seasonal changes in processes controlling groundwater quality between each site is key to identifying risks to the residents who use this unregulated shallow groundwater resource for domestic purposes including drinking water supplies seasonal variations highlight heightened risks from sewerage and septic tank leakage during the wet season in neighbourhoods located in discharge areas compared with increased risk during the dry season in the recharge area in addition there are increased risks of shallow groundwater salinization during both the small wet and dry seasons in discharge areas stable water isotopes showed a direct relationship between local rainfall water and groundwater at st jean compared with ladji and agla where groundwaters are also be subjected to mixing with enriched surface waters such as the lake water via the lowlands and the pond water particularly during the dry and small wet seasons groundwaters chemistry in each of the neighbourhoods are different in st jean the composition of major ion concentrations of waters is dominated by na ca hco3 cl groundwater type while ladji is of the na hco3 cl type and agla of the na ca hco3 so4 hco3 one the ponds sampled in both ladji and agla showed some similarities in major ion compositions with local groundwater thus indicating a potential connection the lake nokoué has greater concentrations of na and cl compared with all groundwater samples groundwater samples indicated that 26 for no3 and 7 0 for no2 do not comply with the beninese quality standard for drinking water based on cl br molar ratios sources of nox in groundwater appear to be dominated by infiltration of sewerage and septic tanks in dry season in st jean while in agla and ladji contamination was obvious in wet season following infiltrating rainfall and ponds recharging low nox for some of the groundwater samples may indicate effects from biodegradation in discharge area or dilution from rainfall credit authorship contribution statement honoré houéménou conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing methodology

5796,in cotonou as in many expanding west african cities major population growth and infrastructural development has not kept up with informal settlement development onto floodable plains and marshes the population of the slum which makes up about 60 of the city s inhabitants is highly disadvantaged and vulnerable to rising sea levels flooding sanitation and waste management issues however the risks associated with the use of contaminated shallow groundwater for domestic purposes are less recognised our study demonstrates that in many instances the cheaper option of the use of shallow groundwater from the coastal quaternary aquifer for domestic purposes represents a significant risk for the poorer residents of cotonou through the voluntary drinking or non volontary dish washing cooking consumption of this unmonitored and untreated water resource in the 3 neighbourhoods surveyed environmental tracers major ions cl br molar ratios and stables isotopes showed that this shallow aquifer is degraded by seawater intrusion as well as septic and sewerage contamination in particular the higher nox concentrations correspond to ranges associated with sewerage and septic tank effluent pollution and the major ion concentrations and δ2h δ18o signatures showed that high salinity values are where groundwater mixes with saline lake nokoue water the population using this resource from local wells should be made aware of seasonal changes in groundwater contamination and potential health risks associated with sewerage and septic tank contamination keywords groundwater sewerage and septic tank contamination salinization urbanization recharge and discharge 1 introduction with cities in developing countries expanding at unprecedented rates ensuring clean water supplies for all inhabitants is becoming increasingly more challenging this is particularly the case in more impoverished urban areas where infrastructure development often lags behind population growth lapworth et al 2017 in addition there often exist two types of water supplies firstly there is the official water supply that is monitored treated and comes at a cost for consumers and then there is the second unregulated water supply that is often sourced from wells accessing shallow groundwater that is unmonitored untreated but free the health risks in using the unregulated groundwater resource for domestic purposes including drinking water supplies is high due to water quality issues in many urban areas e g ouedraogo et al 2016 hassane 2010 the same factors driving the demand for water supplies accelerated urban growth and the expansion of informal settlements are also significant drivers of groundwater pollution unesco 2017 one of the many threats to shallow groundwater quality in cities is from sanitary wastewater and solid waste disposal lu et al 2015 uncontrolled seepage of wastewater from septic tanks and human activities as well as infiltration of urban stormwater lead to groundwater contamination dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 many parts of the world are now reporting groundwater and surface water nitrate pollution issues roy et al 2007 stuart et al 2007 zhang et al 2014 ogrinc et al 2019 for example in the coimbatore city india population growth pit latrines and septic tanks industrial effluents and irrigation water return flows are the main sources of groundwater contamination selvakumar et al 2017 in florida the proximity of wells to septic tanks contributes to increasing fecal coliform nitrate and phosphate concentrations during wet season compared with the dry season arnade 1999 many studies have identified sewerage and latrine contamination as a significant public health issue due to the resultant presence of faecal bacteria in waters such as escherichia coli faecal streptococci salmonella and shigella boukari 1998 odoulami and gbesso 2013 yadouléton 2015 during this study for the first time the seasonal variation in the contamination of waters by sewerage and latrine contaminantion is investigated using environmental tracers in addition shallow groundwater resources in coastal cities are particularly vulnerable to salinity problems due to mixing with saline surface waters and seawater intrusion barker et al 1998 cary et al 2015 petelet giraud et al 2016 najib et al 2017 liu et al 2017 for example in ho chi minh city vietnam the groundwater resources are under threat due to saltwater intrusion in the shallow aquifer ngo et al 2015 in this study we use the example from cotonou benin to identify processes resulting in nitrate and salinity contamination of a city s unmonitored and untreated shallow groundwater resource the complexity of contamination processes in evolving urban environments makes it difficult to study the risks of shallow groundwater quality this can be due to both natural seasonal shifts from climatic and environmental influences and significant anthropogenic influences on the hydrogeological system in this study we analyse the distribution and concentration of major ions and stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o to investigate the temporal variation in groundwater quality across 3 sites in cotonou these 3 neighbourhoods were selected to represent contrasting hydrogeological environments i a neighbourhood st jean where there is no surface inundation ii a neighbourhood ladji bordering lake nokoué which overflows towards the end of the wet season and iii a neighbourhood agla located in a swamp low land and is subject to inundation during both the small and large wet seasons in doing so we identify hydrological conditions and seasons when groundwater is at its greatest vulnerability in terms of salinization and latrine contamination at each site there are wells where local inhabitants have access to unmonitored and untreated shallow groundwater for domestic consumption 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the city of cotonou is bordered by lake nokoué to the north and the atlantic ocean to the south the location of cotonou and the average monthly interannual rainfall at cotonou station from 1971 to 2016 are shown in figs 1 and 2 the topography of the city is relatively flat with an altitude varying between 0 m and 6 m boukari 1998 the average annual rainfall for cotonou is 1 300 mm yabi and afouda 2012 the city s climate is characterised by 4 seasons main dry season average rainfall is 25 mm from mid november to mid march main wet season average rainfall is 152 mm from mid march to mid july small dry season average rainfall is 55 mm in mid july to mid september and small wet season average rainfall is 75 mm from mid september to mid novembre 2 2 aquifer geology cotonou is located in the coastal sedimentary basin comprised of quaternary holocene sediments which include facies of the littoral plain sands and alluvial deposits underlain by sediments from the mio pliocene continental tenninal paleocene and upper cretaceous maliki 1993 previous studies by oyédé 1991 maliki 1993 alidou et al 1994 and boukari 1998 have described in detail the different sedimentary units of this coastal sedimentary basin and the distribution are presented in fig 1 the shallow quaternary sediments consist predominantly of fine to medium sands 85 5 silts 5 5 and clays 9 oyédé 1991 the low clay content in these sediments results in the high permeability of the shallow sandy soils maliki 1993 and therefore a high vulnerability of the aquifers to the transfer of surficial pollutants the clays in quaternary sediments are constituted by smectite and a kaolinite content which increases with depth the traditional domestic wells were sampled in this study so that we could analyse the water consumed and used by local residents however due to the intense pumping of these wells the fluctuations in hydraulic head are heavily influenced by pumping therefore we were unable to use the hydraulic head data to infer subsurface flow directions there has however been previous work that has addressed this question the work of maliki 1993 and boukari 1998 focused on the piezometry of the cotonou water table during the flood and low water periods and the interactions with the lake it appears from these studies that during the flood period there is a flow direction of groundwater from the center of cotonou piezometric dome to outlets such as lake nokoué the lagoon the atlantic ocean and swamps in comparison during the low water period it was observed that water from the lake nokoué flows into the groundwater aquifer 2 3 sewerage and waste the city of cotonou has about 166 433 households and the population evaluated at 679 012 inhabitants in 2013 insae 2015 and is subject to increasing urbanization the poorer dwellings are located in the neighborhoods along the coastline along the edges of the cotonou channel and lake nokoué and in the swamp areas in these neighbourhoods solid and liquid wastes are released into the immediate environment without treatment as illustrated in the fig 1 c in addition they are also scattered in various places of the city where garbage heaps have formed 78 5 of household wastewater and 33 of solid wastes are ejected in gardens streets gutters unused wells and empty blocks insae 2016 these poorer neighborhoods are also without adequate sanitation systems in cotonou 64 9 of households use latrines that are reportedly leak proof whereas 13 5 adopt unsafe and non hygienic practices such as stilt latrines and open defecation only 20 8 of the population use septic tanks which are generally evacuated by drainage structures insae 2016 since there are few market gardens in this heavily urbanised city the potential sources of nitrate in the study area are predominantly from wastewater solid waste and septic tanks therefore the risk of pollutant transfers to the shallow aquifers is high in the poorer neighbourhoods because they are exposed to both i frequent episodes of inundation and ii high levels of pollutants from poorly constructed landfills and latrines 2 4 groundwater quality and use several studies have evaluated the impact of human activities on the quality of the shallow groundwater in the cotonou region and have reported relatively high levels of nitrates e g up to 100 mg l maliki 1993 boukari 1998 odoulami and gbesso 2013 totin et al 2013 in addition the vulnerability of this groundwater resource is also related to its proximity to the atlantic ocean and the saltwater or brackish lakes boukari 1998 totin et al 2013 data from previous studies have shown an increase in salinity levels in groundwater near lake nokoué the salinity of the lake nokoué also exhibits a marked seasonal cycle 0 psu during the small wet season in october and 25 30 psu at the end of the dry season stephen et al 2010 mcinnis et al 2013 totin et al 2013 the coastal groundwater system in cotonou has relatively high chloride 23 6 to 160 mg l and sulphate 6 4 to 25 7 mg l concentrations alassane et al 2015 nlend et al 2018 lake nokoué and the atlantic ocean are therefore a major concern in terms of the source of salinization of groundwater resources in the coastal zone alassane et al 2015 due to the groundwater pollution problems shallow groundwater is excluded from the official supply of drinking water to the city of cotonou however the low rate of services to the public water supply network in the neighborhoods of peri urban areas 51 leads the population to use the groundwater from the shallow quaternary aquifer for their various domestic uses insae 2016 this is despite the fact that the quaternary aquifer is not part of the official monitoring services of the national water company of benin the only legal water distribution structure groundwater from the shallow quaternary aquifer is accessed by the residents of cotonou via large diameter wells installed on private household property these large diameter wells are shallow and are designed to pump groundwater from the water table surface so as not to pump deeper saline groundwater maliki 1993 the quaternary aquifer sands have a high permeability in the order of 10 2 to 10 4 m s and locally contains fresh to brackish groundwater whose exploitation is related to the position of the lake water and seawater instrusions and to the replenishment of freshwater lenses in cotonou 81 of the neighbourhoods have wells and whilst 9 have not any water supply no wells nor stand pipe for drinking water supply for domestic purposes they sometimes buy water for drinking purposes from neighbours hounkpe et al 2014 furthermore the groundwater from the large diameter private wells is used in households for drinking cooking laundry bathing and washing dishes yadouléton 2015 eaa 2018 in this study we expand on previous work to elucidate the seasonality of hydrogeological processes resulting in the contamination of groundwater from latrine waste notably nitrate and nitrite concentrations herein referred to as nox and from salinization 3 methods three neighbourhoods in cotonou were selected for sampling based on differences in their hydrogeological environments i st jean where there is no long term surface inundation and the heavy rainfall infiltrates the soils or leaves the site via overland flow ii ladji which is located at the shore of lake nokoué and is inundated towards the small wet season and iii agla which is located in a flood plain and is inundated early during both the small and large wet seasons the locations of these three neighbourhoods and sampling sites are presented in fig 1 in each neighbourhood groundwater wells were selected for sampling and where when possible surface water samples permanent and temporary pools as well as lake nokoué were also included the depths to the water table and the electrical conductivity ec of groundwater in the quaternary aquifer were monitored monthly at 9 wells and 3 piezometers from each of the 3 neighbourhoods from june 2017 to june 2018 the wells are separated by an average distance of 200 m within the same neighbourhood probe the hydrochemistry of waters were analysed 6 times between november 2016 to june 2018 during the months of february main dry season june main wet season and november small wet season resulting in a total of 127 groundwater and 60 surface water samples in addition for the period from june 2017 to june 2018 13 rainfall samples were analysed to determine water stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o lastly 2 water samples from atlantic ocean ao were collected of the periods from january 2019 main dry season groundwater was sampled from the quaternary aquifer via the large diameter wells groundwater and surface water temperature ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ using a wtw 3430i portable digital multiparameter water samples were collected for the analyses of cations filtered at 0 45 µm and acidified with hno3 anions and stable isotopes that were conducted at the laboratory of hydrogeology of the university of avignon france major ions were analysed using ion chromatography dionex ics1100 and autosampler as ap ion analysis uncertainty is in the order of 3 and all ionic balances were 5 the alkalinity was measured using a hach digital titrator and stable isotopes were analysed using a picarro analyser l 2130 i for the stable isotopes of waters the error is 0 1 for δ18o and 1 δ2h the results are presented in tables 1 and 2 the mixing ratio between lake and shallow groundwater is calculated by using stable isotopes values according to paran et al 2015 δ 18 o m f δ 18 o l 1 f δ 18 o gw the same equation is used with δ2h to compute the δ2hm mixing ratio om is water sample isotope composition where groundwater gw and lake l mixing is supposed ol is lake isotope composition ogw is groundwater isotope composition and f is mixing fraction one questionnaire in each sampling site was administered 10 per study area ladji agla and st john a total of thirty 30 questionnaires were administered through an interview with households in each study area main information such as the the source of drinking water supply groundwater use waste and wastewater management are mentioned in the questionnaire supplementary data 4 results 4 1 seasonal variations of the water table and groundwater ec the monthly monitoring of the depth to water table and ec over a one year period highlights the variations in seasonal fluctuations of the aquifers between the sites typical of unconfined shallow aquifers the quaternary aquifer shows marked spatial and seasonal variations and is in phase with the monthly rainfall the seasonal variations of the water table and groundwater ec in each of the neighbourhoods are illustrated in figs 3 and 5 between the neighbourhoods st jean has a maximum depth to water table 1 5 m at site j5 corresponding with the dry season february that is relatively deep compared with the depths of 1 4 m and 1 0 m observed in ladji site l7 and agla site a4 respectively fig 5 in addition at 2 of the 4 sites in agla the negative depth values indicate that the water table is above the land surface during the wet season thus contributing to the floods whereas groundwater at st jean and ladji remains below the surface the seasonal fluctuation amplitudes also vary in st jean the maximum change between wet and dry season water table depth is of 1 2 m here the water table fluctuations also vary between wells well j5 strongly reacts to the increased rainfall in october small wet season whereas the deepening of the water table in wells j1 and j2 remain relatively weak fig 5 these relatively low water table values can be attributed to the use of wells by households boukari 1998 kadjangaba et al 2018 similar to st jean in ladji the seasonal fluctuations in the water table between the wet and dry seasons vary by 1 3 m fig 5 in comparison in agla the seasonal amplitude of the water table variation is lower 0 5 m since ladji is located on the shore of lake nokoué the lake fluctuations likely influence the variation of the water table depths an increase of about 90 cm in the water table is observed at ladji between the wet and dry seasons is consistent with the observed elevation of the lake level during the same period ird irhob unpublished data the rise in water level starts in january and increases gradually to april may which is a 2 month time lag from agla and st jean with seasonal variations in the water table depth the groundwater ec also shows varying trends fig 3 in st jean the groundwater ec values 297 1 285 μs cm are relatively weak compared to agla and ladji and show variable seasonal changes fig 3 wells j1 and j2 recorded higher ec values in the dry season 511 1 285 μs cm when groundwater levels were low compared with the wet season 297 799 μs cm in comparison the well j5 and the piezometer had higher ec values 444 1 169 μs cm in the rainy season rise of the water table compared with the dry season 497 685 μs cm in agla the groundwater ec ranges between 353 and 1 468 μs cm which is low compared with local surface waters including temporary ponds and swamps 2 800 2 900 μs cm ec values are similar during the rainy season and the dry season fig 3 in ladji the groundwater ec values are higher than in the other neighbourhoods 633 5 340 μs cm and similar to the local temporary ponds 480 4 090 μs cm but strongly lower than the lake nokoué up to 49 700 μs cm during dry season with the exception of well l2 no difference was observed in the variation of the ec during the dry season and the rainy season 1 478 5 340 μs cm 4 2 seasonal variations of major ions the composition of major ion concentrations of waters is different in each of the neighbourhoods as highlighted in fig 4 in st jean the groundwater is of na ca hco3 cl type in comparison the groundwater in ladji is of na hco3 cl type and agla groundwater is more of the na ca hco3 so4 hco3 type fig 4 the ponds sampled in both ladji and agla show some similarities in major ion compositions with local groundwater thus indicating a potential connection between surface and subsurface waters however this connection is spatially and or temporally variable in particular in agla since some of the pond samples have a greater concentration of hco3 relative to cl and so4 and increased ca relative to na and mg compared with groundwater in addition in ladji the lake nokoué has a greater ratio of cl to so4 and hco3 compared with groundwater the temporal evolution of these major ions at each site is presented in fig 5 and similar to ec values the seasonal changes vary both between sites and between neighbourhoods greatest seasonal variations are observed in ladji and particularly for groundwater sampled at l6 and l7 where dry season conditions results in increases in na by 244 374 mg l ca by 76 81 mg l cl by 301 447 mg l and hco3 by 530 622 mg l these sites are located between 100 and 150 m from the lake shore the increase of the ions concentration during dry season is associated with a deepening of the water table and may therefore indicate influences of lake infiltration the lake nokoué has greater concentrations of na 3 168 12 219 mg l ca 146 419 mg l cl 6 166 1 9310 mg l and hco3 73 110 mg l compared with all groundwater samples tables 1 and 2 in agla the seasonal variations in major ions remain relatively stable except for hco3 and so4 concentrations fig 5 however between sites there are large differences in seasonal trends four of the eight groundwater wells a4 a5 a9 and a10 show an increase in na by 47 128 mg l ca by 20 88 mg l hco3 by 155 750 mg l and cl by 61 155 mg l during the month of february dry season during the wet seasons june and october november the remaining four wells a2 a6 a8 and a7 show an increase in na by 93 158 mg l ca by 34 78 mg l hco3 by 99 436 mg l cl by 110 176 mg l and so4 by 75 276 mg l concentrations these trends correspond to changes in the water table depths where the increasing wet season major ion concentrations occurs in wells where the groundwater is sub artesian during the wet season a2 and a8 compared to wells where groundwater remains well below the surface and has increased dry season major ion concentrations a4 these trends may highlight the influence of groundwater mixing with pond water in the discharge areas compared with infiltrating rainfall diluting groundwater in other areas during the wet season the temporary and permanent pond waters have similar concentrations of na 56 166 mg l ca 34 147 mg l cl 43 240 mg l and hco3 97 738 mg l compared with agla groundwater samples tables 1 and 2 in st jean groundwater at seven of the ten wells sampled j1 j2 j10 j3 j4 j6 and j9 show an increase in na by 36 115 mg l ca by 49 114 mg l hco3 by 119 439 mg l and cl by 42 111 mg l concentrations during the dry season february and march fig 5 this occurs at the time when the water table is at its deepest level in addition small wet season peaks in major ion concentrations are also observed in groundwater from wells j5 j7 and j8 these increases include na by 63 65 mg l ca by 63 80 mg l hco3 by 128 272 mg l and cl by 61 79 mg l concentrations since st jean does not have any surface water bodies the wet and dry season major ion variations are probably due to variations in the composition of infiltrating water mixing between subsurface waters reactions during water table fluctuations and evaporation 4 3 stables isotopes the δ18o and δ2h values of rainfall in cotonou obtained from 95 samples from the iita and iaea global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip from 2005 to 2016 has a weighted average of 2 8 1 6 for δ18o and 11 2 11 7 for δ2h the local meteorological water line lmwl of rainfall obtained from these data has a slope of 7 and is presented together with the global meteoric water line gmwl slope of 8 craig 1961 in fig 6 these data were also used to calculate the mean weighted average values of δ18o and δ2h for different ranges in monthly rainfall the results show that when monthly rainfall is 50 mm the isotope values are greater compared with monthly rainfall ranging from 50 mm to 500 mm fig 6a the isotope values of rainfall collected in cotonou show an overall mass effect a depletion in heavy isotopes correlates with an increase in rainfall amounts in cotonou the local rainfall has stable isotope values covering a large range from 5 4 to 0 8 for δ18o and from 30 9 to 14 5 for δ2h fig 6a black crosses the groundwater values from the three sites are also presented in fig 6a which also highlights a large range in values from 4 17 to 0 35 for δ18o and from 21 9 to 4 3 for δ2h in st jean the stable isotope values for groundwater vary between 4 17 and 2 37 for δ18o and between 21 87 and 8 98 for δ2h these values show that the groundwater in st jean is depleted at δ18o and δ2h the linear regression between δ18o and δ2h values slope of 7 5 lie close to the lmwl fig 6a suggesting that groundwater likely originates from local rainfall in ladji groundwater has enriched in δ18o and δ2h compared with st jean 3 36 to 0 35 and 12 96 to 4 17 respectively fig 6b this discrepancy may be due to three distinct phenomena i the recharge of relatively low volume rainfall events 50 mm month in ladji compared with st jean ii evaporation effects some values lie to the right of the lmwl indicating a slope of 5 2 or iii groundwater mixing with lake water during the dry season groundwater isotopic values are close to the lake nakoue values fig 6b which suggests a strong mixing between the lake and groundwater during this season there are also a number of groundwater samples whose δ18o and δ2h values remain close to those of the temporary and permanent ponds δ18o and δ2h mixing ratios indicate ranges from 72 to 74 of shallow groundwater mixing with lake water during the dry season in ladji like in ladji groundwater in agla is also enriched in δ18o and δ2h 3 57 to 0 03 and 18 22 to 2 78 respectively compared with st jean some samples from agla mostly during the dry season lie to the right of the mwl with a slope of 5 4 fig 6c therefore these groundwaters may also be subject to evaporation and mixing with enriched surface waters such as the lake water via the lowlands and the pond water in addition groundwaters e g wells a9 and a10 that are close to lake water are located in discharge areas δ18o and δ2h mixing ratios indicate ranges from 54 to 62 of shallow groundwater mixing with lake water in agla 4 4 nitrogen the beninese quality standard for drinking water for nitrogen is 45 mg l 0 70 mmol l for no3 3 2 mg l 0 07 mmol l for no2 and 250 mg l 7 0 mmol l for cl decree n 2001 094 of february 20th in this study 26 values of 0 73 5 06 mmol l of the groundwater sampled exceeds these limits in terms of no3 and 7 0 values of 0 12 2 04 mmol l for no2 table 1 highest values of nox no2 no3 are observed in groundwater of st jean where the concentrations reach values of 5 06 mmol l average of 0 90 mmol l for nh4 the groundwater concentrations remain low up to 0 80 mmol l average of 0 04 mmol l the highest concentrations of nox are observed during the dry season 3 mmol l compared with wet season samples nox 3 37 mmol l two sites j6 and j8 have elevated nox concentrations in both the wet and dry seasons 1 15 5 06 and 0 99 2 58 mmol l respectively nox in st jean groundwater may originate from natural fixation of nitrogen in the soil and human pollution via leaky latrines and human defacation in the streets in ladji the groundwater nox concentrations ranges up to 2 51 mmol l average of 0 54 mmol l and nh4 is up to 0 43 mmol l average of 0 11 mmo l during the wet season the groundwater nox concentrations are highest 1 06 2 51 mmol l compared to dry season concentrations 0 13 mmol l the wet season increase in nox of groundwater in ladji may either be due to infiltration of anthropogenic pollution or nitrogen fixed by vegetation in the soils the nox concentrations are low in the permanent ponds and the lake 0 01 mmol l however the wet season temporary ponds have high concentrations of nh4 up to 1 55 mmol l which may undergo nitrification during infiltration and may also result in the nox contaminantion of groundwater the highest value of nh4 in groundwater is observed in agla but only at one site a10 4 91 mmol l all other sites have nh4 concentrations in groundwater ranging from 0 00 to 0 52 mmol l average of 0 17 mmol l compared with ladji and st jean groundwater nox concentrations in agla are low with a maximum of 0 86 mmol l average of 0 15 mmol l in contrast permanent ponds in the agla lowlands have high nox levels only at one site a13 17 50 mmol l particularly in the dry season as described by katz et al 2011 the cl br ratio can be a valuable first assessment of septic tank contamination of shallow groundwater this is based on the assumption that sewerage waters and septic tank effluent exhibit distinct ranges and higher values of cl br molar ratios and cl concentrations compared with rainwater davis et al 1998 as observed in many samples form this study fig 7 a elevated cl br ratios may also result from the dissolution of halite however halites have not been reported in the local quaternary aquifer in addition many of the groundwater values correspond to ranges reported for sewerage and septic tank effluent davis et al 1998 vengosh and pankratov 1998 katz et al 2011 compared with waters with halite dissolution davis et al 1998 pastén zapata et al 2014 panno et al 2006 rainwater from coastal areas and seawater alcalá and custodio 2008 davis et al 1998 according to fig 7b groundwater values with similar cl br ratios and cl concentrations than sewerage wastewater also show higher concentrations of nox three samples wells j2 l9 and a6 plot above the cl br ratios for sewage or septic tank effluent cl br molar ratios 676 1350 cl 1000 ml l likely indicating animal manure as evidenced in fig 7b values that fall into the animal manure animal urine cl br molar ratios 2810 3730 cl 1000 mg l also have high nox concentrations 0 76 0 81 mmol l other evidence for a septic tank and animal manure influence are the corresponding elevated dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations table 1 however not all the groundwater samples have high doc concentrations according to kortelainen and karhu 2006 rapid oxidation of doc into carbon dioxyde may account for the low doc concentration in groundwater alternatively samples with low nox concentrations and relatively low cl br ratios such as groundwater from agla fig 7b can indicate areas of organic biodegradation e g mcarthur et al 2012 the relationship between hco3 nox and do for all groundwater sampled at agla is shown in fig 8 the samples where dissolved oxygen do and nox are low compared with hco3 correspond to discharge areas this is especially the case for groundwater sampled during the dry season at wells a10 a9 and piezometers a11 j11 where hco3 values increases 4 80 12 31 mmol l and nox decreases 0 0 0 40 mmol l with low do values 0 06 4 22 mg l however this may also indicate areas of recent rainfall infiltration resulting in a dilution of nox concentrations e g for well a4 fig 9 5 discussion 5 1 variations in the drivers of groundwater degradation the vulnerability of groundwater degradation from either salinization or sewage leakage in cotonou is temporally and spatially variable the quarternary aquifer is exposed to large fluctuations in the water table in response to rainfall changes all sites show seasonal water table fluctuations higher than 0 5 m however both the timing of the water table fluctuations and the seasonal changes in groundwater quality varies between urban areas in agla a strong driver of groundwater quality is the proximity to lowlands agla is scattered by these low elevation zones which have either temporary or permanent ponds where groundwater seasonally discharges as highlighted by the major ion results wet season increases in the water table can either result in increased groundwater salinity ec up to 1468 µs cm in these lowland discharge areas due to mixing with pond water or can result in lower groundwater salinity ec 842 µs cm due to the dilution effect from infiltrating rainfall during the dry season the groundwater stable isotope values also highlight increased mixing with pond water and saltier lake nokoué water elevated nox concentrations in groundwater at agla is due to sewerage contamination and was recordered during both dry and wet seasons nox concentrations up to 0 86 mmol l groundwater contamination from sewerage may infiltrate direcly from leaky latrines or from mixing with the permanent ponds which have accumulated nox concentrations up to 17 50 mmol l according to starr and gillham 1993 denitrification tends to occur in aquifers with very shallow groundwater compared to aquifers with deeper groundwater more than 2 m low dissolved oxygen levels combined with low nox levels in shallow wells even less than 1 0 m in the study area fig 8 where higher levels can be expected may be related to biodegradation or denitrification processes postma et al 1991 jorgensen et al 2004 hassane et al 2016 kadjangaba et al 2018 either by reducing no3 to hco3 1 or n2 2 according to postma et al 1991 and anornu et al 2017 the absence or low concentrations of no2 and nh4 in groundwater is probably related to the reduction of no3 to n2 the overall denitrification process can be described as berner 1980 1 5ch2o 4no3 2n2 4hco3 co2 3h2o 2 2no3 12h 10e n2 6h2o however denitrification may not be the only process that contributes to the increase of hco3 in shallow groundwater which probably also results from the decomposition of organic matter and mineral dissolution reactions e g alassane et al 2015 in ladji the main influence on groundwater salinization ec up to 5 340 µs cm is the mixing with the lake nokoué waters this was obvious during the dry season where both stable isotopes values and major ion concentrations clearly highlight mixing and the water level also shows an early dry season rise in values due to lake infiltration in comparison the sewerage contamination of groundwater is mostly evidenced during the wet season groundwater nox up to 2 5 mmol l during the wet season increases in nox from sewerage sources may result from both i rises in the water table mobilising nox in the unsaturated zone and or ii infiltrating rainfall and temporary ponds recharging the shallow groundwater as suggested by stable isotope results and therefore transporting nox to the saturated zone st jean is the only studied neighbourhood that does not have any surface water bodies and no groundwater discharge sites therefore the wet and dry season variations in groundwater degradation are potentially due to variations in the composition of infiltrating water mixing between subsurface waters and reactions during water table fluctuations although st jean has low groundwater salinity levels ec up to 1 285 us cm this area has the highest nox concentrations recorded in this study nox up to 5 06 mmol l since the local rainfall is the only origin of the shallow groundwater as seen from stable isotope values it is expected that either recharging rainfall or rising water tables transfers nox from the sewerage sources to the groundwater system during the wet season however at st jean groundwater nox concentrations are greater during the dry season up to 5 06 mmol l compared with the wet season up to 2 58 mmol l so instead the contamination may be constant leakage from latrines throughout the year and wet season rainfall may act to dilute this contamination almost all the pit latrines and septic tanks in cotonou have depths between 1 50 and 2 50 m hounkpe et al 2014 yadouléton 2015 in st jean the maximum depth to water table is observed at 1 53 m in the dry season which means that dry season saturated zones remain close to leaking sewerage sources 5 2 periods of increased risk due to groundwater degradation generally speaking groundwater samples with nitrate levels that exceed the beninese quality standards for drinking water originated from wells j1 j3 j6 j7 j8 j9 and j11 piezometer during the dry season february and march in st jean from wells l7 and l11 during the rainy season june and october in ladji and from wells a2 a6 in the dry season february and november in agla thus risk for nitrate pollution in shallow groundwater shows high seasonal variation between sites similar results were obtained by boukari 1998 and totin et al 2013 at different sites in cotonou with higher no3 levels up to 1 61 mmol l observed during recharge of the wet season the measured ec values show a large amplitude of spatial and temporal variation the ec values in agla and st jean are in the same order of variations 200 1 800 μs cm whereas the groundwater in ladji records ec values in the order of 750 5 340 μs cm in st jean the waters are more saline during the dry season unlike st jean the wells in agla and ladji are saline during both the dry and the rainy seasons due to mixing processes with lake water 5 3 shallow groundwater an unregulated water resource in expanding urban environments in urban areas of sub saharan africa groundwater from shallow wells is commonly used to partially or fully supply drinking water resources okotto et al 2015 in major cities such official groundwater resources are monitored and treated for example in the coastal city of douala cameroon shallow groundwater is the main source for domestic and drinking purposes takem et al 2015 likewise in bamako mali around 55 of the population uses water from aquifer resources british geological survey 2002 where shallow groundwater is not the official resource the shallow groundwater usually free and therefore commonly used in the impoverished areas of urban sprawls including for domestic uses normally this resource is meant for washing only but it commonly ends up for drinking dish washing shower and cooking water supplies for example the interviews conducted during this study showed that 10 on 10 of the households in st jean 9 on 10 in agla and 4 on 10 in ladji reported to use well water only for dish washing in st jean 1 on 10 households declared to use well water for drinking water supply compared with agla and ladji where no households have reported such use the results of the interviews have therefore showed that there are differences in groundwater use between st jean ladji and agla the underprivileged areas of the city are subject to greater groundwater quality issues and this also correspond to the parts of the city where the residents are more dependent on the groundwater as a domestic water resource this is the case in kinshasa democratic republic of congo where in peri urban and rural inhabitants widely use the unregulated and untreated shallow groundwater resources for drinking water supply ndembo 2009 unfortunately as seen in this case study of cotonou the shallow groundwater in urban environments is often contaminated this was also observed in blantyre malawi where drinking water from shallow groundwater was heavily polluted by a lack of sanitation facilities and indiscriminate waste disposal mkandawire 2008 likewise high no3 concentrations in urban shallow groundwater resources have been observed in dakar senegal no3 100 mg l ndeye et al 2017 douala cameroon no3 up to 241 mg l ketchemen tandia et al 2017 and in different regions of ghana no3 up to 507 mg l rossiter et al 2010 in many urban cases the nitrate contamination of shallow groundwatear is from anthropogenic sources martínez santos et al 2017 this was also observed in this study and previous work in cotonou boukari 1998 maliki 1993 boukari et al 1996 totin et al 2013 and as also noted in other major sub saharan cities such as n djaména tchad kadjangaba et al 2018 and djibouti ahamed et al 2017 as highlighted in the study of ouagadougou burkina faso yameogo 2008 such nitrate contamination is linked to the high population density that relies on archaic or non existent sanitation systems this is a particularly significant challenge in informal settlements like in the cities of douala takem et al 2010 ketchemen tandia et al 2017 and kampala ouganda nyenje et al 2013 where the increase in nitrates and chlorides in shallow groundwater are related to faeces from pit latrines sewages landfills surface discharges and droppings from domestic animals 6 conclusion although pollution sources are identical for each of the three neighbourhoods studied the resultant transfers and reactions controlling concentrations are distinct in the neighbourhood where there is no surface inundation and acts as a local recharge area the groundwater salinity values remain low ec 1285 µs cm however nox concentrations are the highest recorded in this study up to 5 1 mmol l in the neighbourhood bordering a lake where there is seasonal inundation and groundwater discharge the dry season interaction with lake water results in groundwater with highest observed ec values up to 5340 μs cm stable isotope δ2h and δ18o mixing ratios indicate mixing of up to 74 with lake water in the neighbourhood located in a swamp that is subject to inundation during both the small and large wet seasons also shows mixing with lake water up to 62 using δ2h and δ18o values resulting in groundwater ec values up to 1468 µs cm this discharge site notably has lower nox concentrations up to 0 86 mmol l however this is not indicative of less sewerage contamination only greater degradation processes understanding the seasonal changes in processes controlling groundwater quality between each site is key to identifying risks to the residents who use this unregulated shallow groundwater resource for domestic purposes including drinking water supplies seasonal variations highlight heightened risks from sewerage and septic tank leakage during the wet season in neighbourhoods located in discharge areas compared with increased risk during the dry season in the recharge area in addition there are increased risks of shallow groundwater salinization during both the small wet and dry seasons in discharge areas stable water isotopes showed a direct relationship between local rainfall water and groundwater at st jean compared with ladji and agla where groundwaters are also be subjected to mixing with enriched surface waters such as the lake water via the lowlands and the pond water particularly during the dry and small wet seasons groundwaters chemistry in each of the neighbourhoods are different in st jean the composition of major ion concentrations of waters is dominated by na ca hco3 cl groundwater type while ladji is of the na hco3 cl type and agla of the na ca hco3 so4 hco3 one the ponds sampled in both ladji and agla showed some similarities in major ion compositions with local groundwater thus indicating a potential connection the lake nokoué has greater concentrations of na and cl compared with all groundwater samples groundwater samples indicated that 26 for no3 and 7 0 for no2 do not comply with the beninese quality standard for drinking water based on cl br molar ratios sources of nox in groundwater appear to be dominated by infiltration of sewerage and septic tanks in dry season in st jean while in agla and ladji contamination was obvious in wet season following infiltrating rainfall and ponds recharging low nox for some of the groundwater samples may indicate effects from biodegradation in discharge area or dilution from rainfall credit authorship contribution statement honoré houéménou conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing methodology

biodegradation chemical compositions fluorescence spectra uv visible spectra 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is widely distributed in freshwater ecosystems and largely changes the carbon cycling in globe williams et al 2016 li et al 2018 it is known that dom is a heterogeneous mixture and comprises conjugated aliphatic and aromatic structures its chemical components and bioactivities could determine how it reacts and mobilizes in running waters dalmagro et al 2017 natural dom vary on both temporal and spatial scales which can trace its sources and behaviours of environmental processing hansen et al 2016 li et al 2020 fluvial doms are derived from terrigenous inputs root exudates and microbial biomass and will be selectively decomposed by aquatic microbes saadi et al 2006 the bioavailability of organic compounds is influenced by intrinsic molecular properties e g aromaticity aliphaticity and proteome koehler et al 2015 resulting in highly variable mineralizing effect in aquatic environments williams et al 2013 natural dom mobilizes and transports chemicals supporting bacterial respiration and aquatic food webs pollard 2013 in particular dom biodegradation

refractory materials recalcitrant doc e g lignin and humic acids hu et al 2018 hence the variations of chemical compositions indicate the fate of aquatic dom and also associate with the bioavailability and microbial respiration zhang et al 2009 catalan et al 2017 prior studies reported the strong linkages between the dom intrinsic properties and aquatic microbes suggesting all major bacterial clades were co varied with dom abundance and composition lin et al 2012 amaral et al 2016 in this context dom properties not only characterize the riverine biodegradability but also trace the biodegradation processes moody and worrall 2017 in river systems different characterization methods e g fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry have been used to explore dom structures kellerman et al 2014 among them optical measurement is regarded as a reliable method due to its molecular level understandings of dom dynamics spencer et al 2008 for instance the non normalized a254 and doc normalized absorbance coefficient at wavelength of 254 nm suva254 indicate the abundance of aromatic fractions and aromaticity in doms respectively weishaar et al 2003 spectral slopes at the wavelength ranges of 275 295 nm s275 295 and 350 400 nm s350 400 decipher the dom molecular weight and their slope ratio s275 295 s350 400 sr indicates the dom sources in waters helms et al 2008 the fluorescence index fi and biological index bix identify the microbial sources and young doms in waters kolic et al 2014 natural biodegradation occurs in photic and aphotic zone resulting in the alteration of the dom components molecular weight bioavailability and fate yamada et al 2012 optical properties are effective in explaining dom features and sources at a molecular level and thus can underscore the dom biodegradation processes in freshwater wu et al 2007 while optical properties were widely employed to demonstrate spatio temporal patterns of dom components and origins seidel et al 2016 few studies have examined how optical properties trace the dom biodegradation in rivers the river continuum concept theorized that dom diversity would rapidly decrease in the upstream within a river system vannote et al 1980 suggesting a high potential of riverine doc biodegradation bdoc in headwater rivers ejarque et al 2017 we thus hypothesized that 1 optical properties can trace the dom biodegradation processes because they decipher the variations of dom characterization hansen et al 2016 2 riverine bdoc can be predicted by initial dom properties because they largely explain the doc biodegradability wickland et al 2012 in testing our hypotheses we examined riverine bdoc and optical measurements in the longchuan river a headwater tributary of the upper yangtze river the objectives of this study were to 1 reveal how the optical properties trace the dom biodegradation and 2 explore the couplings of riverine bdoc and dom optical parameters suva254 s275 295 s350 400 sr fi and bix our results indicated that initial dom components could predict the biodegradability of doc and the variability of optical properties largely characterized the dom biodegradation processes in the longchuan river this study hopes to supplement the knowledge gaps of linkages between optical properties and dom biodegradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area

were picked out and the average of readings was record cv 2 with the majority being 1 prior observations implied that some uncertainties for bdoc incubations could be attributed to doc biodegradation in transit begum et al 2017 in this study water samples were cryopreserved 4 c and the bdoc incubation was carried out once the samples were transported to the laboratory which minimized deterioration of doc quantity and dom optical properties the influence from diurnal fluctuation on samples could be ignored according to the river continuum concept because riverine continuous gradient of physical and chemical conditions led to a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of bdoc and dom loadings statzner and higler 1985 meanwhile the diurnal variability was also corrected by all

metabolism and the main stem is inclined to more metabolically balanced according to the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 hotchkiss et al 2015 besides terrigenous organic carbon inputs and biological doc exudation are strong determinants of riverine bdoc pools sachse et al 2005 extensive observations suggested the larger allochthonous and autochthonous bdoc inputs in streams compared to rivers hotchkiss et al 2015 substantiating a greater proportion of bdoc in the tributaries fig 2 particularly agricultural practices enhanced the land water connectivity and thus organic carbon inputs which promoted the in situ biomineralization west and marland 2002 and resulted in the high bdoc levels 62 2 79 7 in the agricultural regions site 18 26 and 28 however excessive tillage and crop

suva254 values averaged 4 43 2 22 l mg 1 m 1 fig 3 indicating the high abundance of aromatic recalcitrant dom piirsoo et al 2012 the high sr values 1 5 fig 3 suggested the dominance of autochthonous doms which was similar to the prior reports in the yangtze river chen et al 2011 the fi 2 35 0 07 and bix values 0 83 0 05 implied that the doms were derived from the microbial origins or autochthonous but not recently produced xu et al 2016 besides a previous study found the significant relationships between dom optical properties and aquatic bacteria suggesting that doms could explain the bacterial groups amaral et al 2016 in fact bacteria adapted to the surrounding environment and tended to co vary with specific dom properties lin et al 2012 for example the high loadings

supported that biodegradation was a continuous process and aromatics gained biodegradation after 56 day incubations koehler et al 2015 the disaggregation and bond cleavage of high molecular weight doms could explain the increasing trend of s350 400 values at 20 c hansen et al 2016 on the other hand the s275 295 values decreased after doc incubations at 30 c fig 3 suggesting that the high temperature 30 c could promote the decomposition of low molecular weight doms some of them were the broken doms as mentioned above fellman et al 2009 these apparently conflicting observations

bdoc doc and dom optical properties fig 3 suggesting that the initial dom components predicted the doc biodegradability saadi et al 2006 for example the bdoc doc was negatively correlated with a254

doc biodegradability increased with the increasing dom molecular weight in the longchuan river this suggested the consumption of partial high molecular weight doms during long term doc incubations and

recently produced doms which established the negative links between the bix values and bdoc doc fig 4 however previous studies have observed that the labile moieties could be dominant in young doms in the amazonian rivers mayorga et al 2005 these inconsistent observations could be explained by the distinct regional biodegradability in fragile ecosystem of the longchuan river catchment the intensive

biodegradation chemical compositions fluorescence spectra uv visible spectra 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is widely distributed in freshwater ecosystems and largely changes the carbon cycling in globe williams et al 2016 li et al 2018 it is known that dom is a heterogeneous mixture and comprises conjugated aliphatic and aromatic structures its chemical components and bioactivities could determine how it reacts and mobilizes in running waters dalmagro et al 2017 natural dom vary on both temporal and spatial scales which can trace its sources and behaviours of environmental processing hansen et al 2016 li et al 2020 fluvial doms are derived from terrigenous inputs root exudates and microbial biomass and will be selectively decomposed by aquatic microbes saadi et al 2006 the bioavailability of organic compounds is influenced by intrinsic molecular properties e g aromaticity aliphaticity and proteome koehler et al 2015 resulting in highly variable mineralizing effect in aquatic environments williams et al 2013 natural dom mobilizes and transports chemicals supporting bacterial respiration and aquatic food webs pollard 2013 in particular dom biodegradation typically depletes labile dissolved organic carbon doc de falco et al 2016 leading to the rapid loss of biodegradable fractions biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc and relative accumulation of refractory materials recalcitrant doc e g lignin and humic acids hu et al 2018 hence the variations of chemical compositions indicate the fate of aquatic dom and also associate with the bioavailability and microbial respiration zhang et al 2009 catalan et al 2017 prior studies reported the strong linkages between the dom intrinsic properties and aquatic microbes suggesting all major bacterial clades were co varied with dom abundance and composition lin et al 2012 amaral et al 2016 in this context dom properties not only characterize the riverine biodegradability but also trace the biodegradation processes moody and worrall 2017 in river systems different characterization methods e g fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry have been used to explore dom structures kellerman et al 2014 among them optical measurement is regarded as a reliable method due to its molecular level understandings of dom dynamics spencer et al 2008 for instance the non normalized a254 and doc normalized absorbance coefficient at wavelength of 254 nm suva254 indicate the abundance of aromatic fractions and aromaticity in doms respectively weishaar et al 2003 spectral

in the alteration of the dom components molecular weight bioavailability and fate yamada et al 2012 optical properties are effective in explaining dom features and sources at a molecular level and thus can underscore the dom biodegradation processes in freshwater wu et al 2007 while optical properties were widely employed to demonstrate spatio temporal patterns of dom components and origins seidel et al 2016 few studies have examined how optical properties trace the dom biodegradation in rivers the river continuum concept theorized that dom diversity would rapidly decrease in the upstream within a river system vannote et al 1980 suggesting a high potential of riverine doc biodegradation bdoc in headwater rivers ejarque et al 2017 we thus hypothesized that 1 optical properties can trace the dom biodegradation processes because they decipher the variations of dom characterization hansen et al 2016 2 riverine bdoc can be predicted by initial dom properties because they largely explain the doc biodegradability wickland et al 2012 in testing our hypotheses we examined riverine bdoc and optical measurements in the longchuan river a headwater tributary of the upper yangtze river the objectives of this study were to 1 reveal how the optical properties trace the dom biodegradation and 2 explore the couplings of riverine bdoc and dom optical parameters suva254 s275

ecosystem poor ability of ecological self recovery 2 2 sample collection and measurement sampling expedition was carried out in september 2017 and a total of 15 and 21 grab samples were collected in the main stem and the major tributaries respectively the sampling sites were selected to incorporate full spectrum of stream order depending on the spatial representativeness and thus gave a typical

of doc quantity and dom optical properties the influence from diurnal fluctuation on samples could be ignored according to the river continuum concept because riverine continuous gradient of physical

status of dongting lake china twenty two sampling sites were selected in dongting lake basin during two days in august 2017 after range responsive and redundancy tests four core metrics were selected from the dataset of 130 candidate metrics to develop the ba ibi including the proportions of flavobacteriia burkholderiales phototrophs and streptomycin producers the ba ibi value which was the sum of each individual metric value was ranged from 1 37 to 3 66 based on the 25th and 75th percentiles of the ba ibi three levels were classified to show the influence degree of fluvial inputs on the ecological status the ba ibi showed a gradient distribution for the distance from estuaries to the major lake regions to further investigate the relative contributions of each individual fluvial input to the ba ibi a path model was established and validated the results showed that water nutrients r 0 658 p 0 1 was the controlling group of factors for the ba ibi including direct r 0 538 p 0 002 and indirect effect r 0 12 p 0 1 water organics and sediment characteristics groups exerted direct effects with coefficients of 0 324 p 0 015 and 0 271 p 0 089 the hydrological parameters group r 0 3 p 0 1 had an indirect effect on the ba ibi mediated through water nutrients water physicochemical properties and sediment characteristics groups the bio assessment framework can provide a new insight for the management and protection of lake ecosystems keywords river lake system fluvial inputs bacteria based index of biotic integrity path model dongting lake 1 introduction the river lake system is considered to be a longitudinal composition of two different areas where the lakes are hydrologically linked with stream or river courses hillbricht ilkowska 1999 the interactions between rivers and lakes are complex and dynamic often closely correlated with the seasonal shortage of water resources deterioration of water quality eutrophication and ecosystem degradation within the lakes yang et al 2016 the material exchange between rivers and lakes has a deep influence on substance transferring and energy flowing of the river lake ecosystem therefore a comprehensive understanding of river lake relationships can improve the utilization of water resources and maintain the water ecological balance in a river lake network rivers bring large amounts of water sediment and abundant materials e g pollutants nutrients and heavy metals into the lake pan et al 2012 these fluvial inputs are buffered and processed through the river lake transition zone prior to entering the lake carvalho et al 2018 the sediment discharge from rivers is deposited at the bottom of the lake which can further influence the aquatic organisms in the lake laas et al 2015 xu and li 2019 the water nutrients karthic et al 2013 organics chen et al 2017 and heavy metal dai et al 2018 inputs from rivers would influence the material cycling of lake ecosystem which leading to ecological degradation however a separation of fluvial inputs is not sufficient for understanding their comprehensive impact on lake ecosystems therefore an indicator that could synthetically reflect the variations in the environmental variables is needed as a utility approach biological indicators could provide measurable stress sensitive and predictable metrics to understand how ecosystems respond to environmental stressors niemi and mcdonald 2004 sediment bacteria is one of the most significant aquatic organisms regarding ecosystem functions which carries out the fundamental ecological processes such as decomposition and mineralization poret peterson et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 the distribution of sediment bacteria is the result of complex and interdependent biogeochemical cycles and hydrodynamic transport processes li et al 2015 hence a better understanding of the variations of sediment bacterial communities under the influence of fluvial inputs is critical to the comprehension of river lake ecosystems estuarine sediment bacterial community diversity was relatively lower under the influence of fluvial inputs in taihu lake wu et al 2017 the composition of the bacterial communities in lake erie was associated with east to west gradients of nutrients and xenobiotics inputs bouzat et al 2013 although the shifts in sediment bacterial communities influenced by fluvial inputs have been qualitatively described by estimating the correlation between bacterial communities and fluvial inputs quantitative analysis based on comprehensive bacterial data has not been conducted therefore a systematic and quantitative tool is needed to investigate the response of lake sediment bacteria to fluvial inputs the biotic integrity of aquatic systems has generally been the core issue of the ecological conservation novotny et al 2005 since the index of biotic integrity ibi was first introduced by karr 1981 it has become an essential tool in the restoration and conservation of aquatic ecosystems by quantitatively assessing the ecological status ruaro and gubiani 2013 the ibi framework is established based on a several biological metrics including diversity composition tolerance and functional metrics the lower values of ibi indicate poor biotic condition under anthropogenic influence hence the distribution of ibi values across a region could provide information for the regulation of environmental stressors fausch et al 1984 the indicators used in the bioassessment of lake have been largely confined to macro organisms including benthic macro invertebrates meredith et al 2019 fishes cooper et al 2018 birds uzarski et al 2017 amphibians menetrey et al 2011 periphyton wang et al 2015 and plants yang et al 2018 recently bacterial communities have been included in the ibi to assess the ecological status of aquatic ecosystem li et al 2017 revealed that bacteria based index of biotic integrity ba ibi was a reliable tool to access the ecological health of qinhuai river a typical urban river in nanjing china the sensitivity and reliability of microbial community based index of biotic integrity for assessing the ecological response of taihu lake to surrounding rivers were confirmed by niu et al 2018 with the development of ba ibi a quantitative way to assess the synthetical impacts of fluvial inputs on lake ecosystems is provided however the causal relationship of each fluvial input and the impact of the fluvial inputs on the ba ibi remain to be elucidated the structural equation models are statistical procedures for testing measurement functional predictive and causal hypotheses a path model structural equation modeling with no latent variables is a reliable tool to describe the directed dependencies among a set of variables guo et al 2013 studied the direct and indirect effects of biotic and abiotic factors on denitrification by using the structural equation models hitchman et al 2018 used a path model to clarify the effects of dams and habitats on the fish species richness and test how dams habitats and fish interact hence it can be hypothesized that the path model together with the ba ibi may facilitate our understanding of the driving mechanisms of fluvial inputs on lake ecosystems therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to develop the ba ibi responding to fluvial input gradients 2 to apply the ba ibi to quantitatively assess the impact of fluvial inputs on sediment bacterial communities from different lake regions and 3 to quantify the relative contribution of each fluvial input to ba ibi by building a path model this study may provide a full comprehensive understanding of the management and protection of lake ecosystems 2 materials and methods dongting lake which is representative of intricate river lake interactions was selected as the study area in this study physicochemical analyses were taken to clarify the water and sediment quality of the dongting lake basin high throughput sequencing which can characterize the entire taxonomic composition of a bacterial communities was used to identify the lake sediment bacterial communities based on multiple statistics analyses the bio assessment which integrated ba ibi and path model was established to determine the direct and indirect effects of fluvial inputs on lake ecosystem 2 1 study area and sample collection dongting lake the second largest fresh water lake in china with an area of 2820 km2 is located at the confluence of the yangtze yuan li zi and xiang rivers dongting lake basin has a subtropical monsoon climate the lake area expands dramatically during the wet season may to october and draws down to expose mud flats and grasslands during the dry season november to march with mean depth 6 7 m ma et al 2016 the topography of dongting lake showed an apparent west to east elevation gradient with elevations higher than 40 m in western dongting lake but lower than 25 m in eastern dongting lake yan et al 2014 dongting lake basin is fed by yangtze river with 89 5 109 m3 of water and 111 4 106 ton t of sediment per year via three inlets namely the songzi taiping and ouchi the xiang zi yuan and li rivers annually discharged 166 7 109 m3 water and 26 3 106 t sediment per year into dongting lake the dongting lake also receives discharge from several small basin tributaries such as the miluo and xinqiang rivers finally the water of dongting lake discharges into the yangtze river from the chenglingji outlet yu et al 2018 the dongting lake basin was divided into three parts in this study including the transition zone between yangtze river and major lake region the major lake region and the estuaries twenty two sampling sites were selected which covered the transition zone estuaries and major lake regions in the dongting lake basin w1 to w22 as illustrated in fig 1 the yangtze river sediment bulletin 2016 indicated that the observed water and sediment discharge in the flood season between may and august of chenglingji hydrologic station the only outlet of dongting lake contributed 60 01 and 35 31 to the annual discharge respectively in the flood season of dongting lake basin the water and sediment discharge reached a peak triplicate water and sediment samples at each site were collected during two days in august 2017 using pre cleaned polyethylene bottles water samples were collected and stored at 4 c using a hand held coring device wildlife supply co saginaw mi usa surface sediment samples were taken from the top of the streambed 0 10 cm all of the sediment samples were homogenized subsampled and subsequently frozen at 80 c for dna isolation 2 2 physicochemical and molecular analyses a total of 22 environmental variables were used in this study including 17 water parameters and 5 sediment parameters as listed in table 1 the water temperature t dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured in situ using a hach hq30d portable meter hach co loveland co usa the flow

read archive http www ncbi nlm nih gov sra project reference prjna517085 2 3 development of ba ibi 2 3 1 selection of reference sites the development of ba ibi was followed by general procedures huang et al 2015 four main steps were taken to develop ba ibi including reference sites selection candidate metrics selection core metrics screening and scores calculation of ibi the concrete processes for developing ba ibi were shown in fig s1 to apply the ba ibi in the quantitative assessment of the ecological status of different lake regions under the influence of fluvial inputs the appropriate reference sites were set as the most dynamic region in the river lake system river water mixes with lake water in the transition zone leading to significant changes in distribution and speciation of organic matter bioactive elements and pollutants xu et al 2018 compared with adjacent river or lake ecosystems the ecosystem of the transition zone maintains a unique blend of characteristics and ecological communities in this study the sites in the transition zone and river estuaries were considered as impaired sites and the sites in the middle area of the major lake region which were relatively less influenced by the fluvial inputs were considered as the reference sites fig 1 2 3 2 metrics selection the dataset of candidate metrics was composed of four categories including diversity composition tolerance and functional metrics hering et al 2006 based on the otus the diversity metrics were calculated using the vegan package in r v 3 12 http www r project org niu et al 2015 based on the relative abundance of dominant taxa in different level of classification composition metrics were selected according to the results of the redundancy analysis rda the tolerance metrics were selected based on the proportion of taxa at the level of genus responding sensitively or tolerantly to a single stressor li et al 2017 to investigate the variation of bacterial phenotypes metabolic processes and functional pathways under the influence of fluvial inputs functional metrics were selected using metagenassist http www metagenassist ca arndt et al 2012 2 3 3 index development the purpose of the metrics screening is to select the core metrics which can respond to fluvial inputs and discriminate the different ecological status from impaired sites to reference sites in order to screen the core bacterial metrics which can reflect the different ecological status under the influence of fluvial inputs the stepwise processes including range responsive and redundancy tests were used firstly a range test was employed to exclude the metrics for assemblages with fewer taxa to make sure the wide distribution range of the core metrics none of the candidate metrics values should be zero in any sites the candidate metrics with narrow distribution were first excluded secondly the responsive tests including mann whitney u test and box plot test were employed to discriminate the responsiveness of the remaining candidate metrics the non parametric mann whitney u test p 0 05 was used to test whether the mean value of the candidate metrics in reference and impaired sites were significantly different furthermore the box plots for reference and impaired sites were drew to compare the 25th and 75th percentiles of overlap between boxes only metrics with higher discrimination power i e boxes did not overlap between the two sites groups were selected for further analysis li et al 2018 finally a redundancy test was employed to exclude the remaining metrics with redundant bioinformation pearson correlation analysis was used to distinguish the redundant metrics when the pearson s correlation coefficient between the candidate metrics was 0 60 p 0 01 that means these two metrics had bioinformation redundancy under the premise of ensuring each core metric belongs to different category diversity composition tolerance and functional as possible the metric that was significant correlated with more metrics would be chosen as core metric because it contained more bioinformation to make sure that the different types of data could be analyzed in the same scale two standardization methods were taken the proportional metrics which were between 0 and 1 were arcsine square root transformed whereas others were log transformed jia et al 2013 the mann whitney u test and pearson s correlation analysis were carried out using ibm spss statistics 20 0 software to further quantify the differences of the ecological status under the influence of fluvial inputs the selected core metrics were assigned using the 5th and 95th percentiles abdelkefi et al 2013 the ecological response tendency of each metrics to the fluvial inputs showed a difference therefore two different equations were required if the metrics increased with fluvial inputs the metrics were assigned using eq 1 1 metric value maximum site value maximum 5 th percentile if the metrics decreased with fluvial inputs the metrics were assigned using eq 2 2 metric value site value 95 th percentile the trends of the metrics varying with the influence of fluvial inputs were indicated by the boxplots of the core metrics between the reference and impaired sites fig s2 the value of ba ibi was the sum of each individual metric value the sensitivity of the ba ibi was validated using the box plot to compare the discrimination between the reference and impaired sites fig 2 2 4 establishment of path model before the construction of path model principal component analysis pca was used to reduce the dimensionality of the observed variables related to hydrological parameters water physicochemical properties water nutrients water organics water heavy metals and sediment characteristics for each group of fluvial inputs the first principal component with cumulative variance cv nearly or 50 table 1 was used in further path analysis guo et al 2013 liu et al 2018 in this study we constructed and tested a path model based on the existing literature and ecological principals the path coefficients and model fit parameters were determined by amos 24 0 software amos development corp chicago il usa with the maximum likelihood estimation method the strength of the direct and indirect effects from an exogenous variable to an endogenous variable was represented by a standard path coefficient r value by multiplying the standardized path coefficients of the direct effects of the fluvial input involved in the total pathway indirect effects i e effects mediated by other fluvial inputs were calculated liu et al 2018 the total effects were the sum of the direct and indirect effects we tested how well the model fitted the data using the maximum likelihood relative chi square goodness of fit test cmin df cmin df less than 4 is considered acceptable shipley 2000 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of the ba ibi 130 candidate metrics were calculated and established based on the sediment bacterial community data table s1 firstly diversity metrics were composed of six alpha diversity indexes such as simpson and shannon index which revealed the number and relative abundance of species within a community secondly composition metrics were the sets of the relative abundance of the top seven phyla 16 classes 20 orders 20 families and 20 genera to include the representative bacterial groups into the index ten metrics which were the sums of proportions of representative bacterial groups were selected such as bacteroidetes grammaproteobacteria and nitrospira betaproteobacteria bgn beta thirdly the result of rda indicated that tn sediment cr s cr and sediment tp s tp contributed significantly to the variations in the sediment bacterial communities hence these three environmental variables were used to represent the primary environmental stressors the tolerance metrics were the sums of the ratios of top four taxa in genus level which significantly correlated with environmental stressors according to rda fourthly function metrics were composed of bacterial metabolic processes e g ammonia oxidization nitrogen fixation and sulfate reduction oxygen demands e g aerobic anaerobic and their ratio energy sources e g autotrophs diazotrophs and phototrophs and so on of all the candidate metrics eight metrics were firstly excluded with the range test secondly based on the mann whitney u test p 0 05 115 metrics were rejected because they did not exhibit apparent differences between the reference and impaired sites thirdly seven metrics were retained because they displayed significant sensitivities in box and whisker plots fourthly three metrics were redundant by pearson s correlation test table s2 because they showed high correlations with other metrics p 0 05 r 0 6 finally four core metrics were retained for the ba ibi namely the proportion of flavobacteriia m23 proportion of burkholderiales m41 phototrophs m112 and streptomycin producers m122 the metric value of m41 showed an increasing trend toward the stronger effects of the fluvial inputs whereas the metric values of m23 m112 and m122 showed opposing trends fig s2 the ba ibi was calculated by adding the value of each metric the core metrics for developing the ba ibi were further explained as follows firstly flavobacteriia one of the major denitrifiers are especially abundant during and or after phytoplankton blooms teeling et al 2012 tekedar et al 2017 it was included to indicate the eutrophic state secondly the order burkholderiales includes several pathogenic bacteria and is known to harbor various oxygenase genes that function in the degradation of aromatic compounds perez pantoja et al 2012 wang et al 2018 some groups within burkholderiales are also assumed to be responsible for n2o consumption in rice paddy ishii et al 2011 thirdly phototrophs are organisms that carry out photon capture to acquire energy and play important roles in metabolic processes of metabolism degradation hand et al 2001 finally streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic originally isolated from streptomyces griseus the application of streptomycin may lead to a decrease in the ratio of streptomycin producers laskaris et al 2012 the ba ibi was calculated by adding the value of each metric based on the minimum maximum 5th and 95th percentiles of each metric and their responses to the impairment the formulas shown in table s3 were used for the calculation 3 2 application of the ba ibi on assessing the effects of fluvial inputs the ba ibi was applied to quantitatively evaluate the ecological status under the influences of the fluvial inputs of the 22 sampling sites the ba ibi ranged from 1 37 to 3 66 with an average of 2 56 after the operation of three gorges dam in 2003 the natural flow sediment regime of dongting lake was seriously disturbed and the sediment from the yangtze river into dongting lake decreased sharply pan et al 2017 a drawdown of the mainstream resulted in dried up days of the three inlets which in turn decreased fluvial inputs xu and li 2019 therefore the ba ibi fluctuated within a small range at most sites in dongting lake but observable discriminations were still detected for recognizing the different effects of the fluvial inputs on the sampling sites three levels were defined based on the 25th and 75th percentiles of the ba ibi high scores of 1 19 1 98 indicating severe impairment medium scores of 2 03 2 82 indicating moderate impairment and low scores of 2 91 3 37 indicating mildly impairment and almost equivalent to the reference conditions as shown in fig 2 the constituent ratios corresponding to high medium and low effects were 27 27 45 45 and 27 27 respectively almost all of the reference sites which were located at the major lake regions belonged to the low effects except m18 based on the box and whisker plots fig 3 the ba ibi tended to represent high discriminations between reference and impaired site groups whereas the impaired sites exhibited lower ba ibi than the reference sites the ba ibi at the junction of the yangtze river and dongting lake was relatively lower indicating that the lake ecological status was mainly affected by the inputs from the yangtze river the songzi and taiping inlets i e high effect were influenced by the strong inputs from the yangtze river as the fluvial inputs i e nutrients pollutants and heavy metals buffered along the transition zone the ba ibi increased at the downstream of the transition zone w6 and w20 showed a low effect with regard to fluvial inputs w6 was located at the estuary of li river on east dongting lake w20 was located at the downstream of the transition zone between yangtze river and major lake region the ba ibi at the transition zone showed a clear gradient distribution from estuaries to major lake region most high effects were distributed in the estuaries which were greatly affected by fluvial inputs except w14 which connected the yangtze river with the largest inner lake of dongting lake the specific environmental characteristics of w14 resulted in the unique ecological status except for the yangtze river four waters i e yuan zi xiang and li rivers and other small basin tributaries also impacted the dongting lake ecological status among these tributaries the estuaries of the li and miluo rivers had high effects on the ecological status some estuaries such as the yuan xiang and xinqiang rivers had medium effects most of the reference sites located at the major lake regions of dongting lake were low effects influenced by fluvial inputs except for w16 which was at south dongting lake the ecological status of w16 were directly affected by the inputs of the zi and xiang rivers which may have caused a higher ba ibi of w16 than that of the other reference sites 3 3 direct and indirect effects of the fluvial inputs on the ba ibi in general hydrological parameters including water and sediment are the main inputs of the rivers into the lakes as carriers of other fluvial inputs changes in the water and sediment can further affect the concentrations compositions fluxes nutrient cycles organic matter and other fluvial inputs teodoru and wehrli 2005 the altered fluvial inputs can in turn influence the ba ibi therefore we developed a conceptual model to link fluvial inputs to the ba ibi the model was comprised of four layers namely hydrological parameters water properties i e water nutrients water organics water heavy metals and water physicochemical properties sediment characteristics and the ba ibi the path model was established based on the hypothesis that the former layer had a direct effect on the subsequent layers fig 4 and all these layers finally had a combined effect on the ba ibi the maximum likelihood relative chi square goodness of fit test cmin df 3 166 was used to test how well the model fitted the data according to the results hydrological parameters had a significant negative indirect effect r 0 300 on the ba ibi which was intermediated by water nutrients water physicochemical properties and sediment characteristics this conclusion indicates that the transition zone which had stronger water and sediment inputs had a relatively lower ba ibi the fluvial inputs put a relatively higher influence on the transition zone than the major lake region which was consistent with the selection of reference sites as discussed in section 2 3 1 the model also revealed the pathways in which the hydrological parameters affected the ecological status of dongting lake the hydrological parameters had a significant positive direct effect r 0 513 on the water nutrients the hydrological parameters mainly affected the lake ecological status by altering the distribution of water nutrients which contributed a significant negative indirect effect r 0 337 on the ba ibi another significant pathway with regard to the effects of the hydrological parameters on the ba ibi r 0 037 was to alter the water physicochemical properties the water physicochemical properties had a relatively weak indirect effect r 0 107 on the ba ibi water nutrients was the controlling group of factors for the ba ibi it had a significant negative total effect r 0 658 which was the sum of the direct r 0 538 and indirect effects r 0 12 the results of path model showed that the direct effects r 0 538 of the water nutrients on the ba ibi were considerably higher than the indirect effects r 0 120 mediated through the sediment characteristics the pearson s correlation test showed that the first principal component of water nutrients group was significantly p 0 05 related to total nitrogen tn and nitrate no3 as shown in table s4 the tn and no3 could be considered as the two main factors of the first principal component of water nutrients group the average tn concentrations showed a reduced tendency from river inlets w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 w10 and w11 to the central lake area w13 w14 w18 w20 and w21 which is from 1 58 mg l to 1 18 mg l the spatial distribution of tn concentration was correlated to the distance from upstream inflows to the lake tian et al 2017 which showed a consistent trend with ecological influence gradient from estuaries to the central lake area furthermore water organics group also played an important role in driving the lake ecological status which showed a significant negative direct effect r 0 324 on the ba ibi the inputs of the water nutrients and water organics from the rivers into the lake had a direct effect on the dongting lake ecosystem the result of path model indicated that the water heavy metals group did not show a significant effect on ba ibi all of the water heavy metals elements were better than the second grade a total of five of the surface water quality standards of china gb3838 2002 the concentrations of hg as cr cd pb and cu were even below the detection limits such low concentrations of water heavy metals in dongting lake were consistent with the studies of bi et al 2018 and chen et al 2019 hence it was reasonable that water heavy metals had less effects on ba ibi because of the rapidly changing hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions between the river and the lake dongting lake has a complex ecosystem with frequent exchange of nutrients at the sediment water interface as the most important intermediaries of the water properties and hydrological parameters affecting the ba ibi the sediment of dongting lake has many unique characteristics the sediment characteristics had a direct effect r 0 271 on the ba ibi after path analysis the hydrological parameters water nutrients and water physicochemical properties had significant effects on the sediment characteristics and indirect effects on the ba ibi via the sediment characteristics therefore this study revealed ways to control the impacts of fluvial inputs on the ecological status of different lake regions in dongting lake firstly by controlling the water nutrients and the water organic inputs and secondly by regulating the hydrological inputs 3 4 implications for ba ibi and path model in the river lake system rivers bring diverse materials into the lake these fluvial inputs have complex synergistic effects on the lake ecosystems this study introduced sediment bacteria communities which have a rapid response to environmental changing to indicate the lake ecosystem integrity by developing a ba ibi the ecological status of different lake regions affected by fluvial inputs were evaluated quantitatively furthermore the use of path model illuminated the direct and indirect effects of fluvial inputs on the ba ibi and revealed the main pathway of each fluvial input that affects the ecological status of different lake region in summary our study fills the knowledge gap in how well we understand the direct and indirect effects of the fluvial inputs on the ecological status of different lake regions and provides thoughtful insights into the intrinsic relationship between fluvial inputs and ecological status moreover the combination of ba ibi and path model makes it possible to recognize the dominant influence factors extracted from the fluvial inputs on the lake ecological status by altering and controlling the influence factors this method provides a new insight to regulate the lake ecological status which is beneficial to effectively maintain the ecological balance of the lake therefore this novel bio assessment framework could afford a valuable and effective alternative approach for the management and protection of lake ecosystems and provide a reference for the quantitative assessment in other similar water intersection regions 4 conclusions this study provided a novel bio assessment framework which combined the ba ibi and path model to assess and explain the ecological status of different lake regions the ba ibi was developed to quantitatively evaluate the ecological status of different lake regions under the influence of fluvial inputs from the results of pca the first principal components cv was nearly or 50 of each group of fluvial inputs were used into the establishment of path model a path model was used to clarify the causal relationship between the ba ibi and fluvial inputs the distribution of ba ibi showed that fluvial inputs exerted greater influence on the estuaries than on the major lake regions the ba ibi at the transition zone showed a clear gradient distribution from estuaries to major lake region according to the results of the path model the water nutrients group played the most important role in determining the ba ibi including direct r 0 538 p 0 002 and indirect effect r 0 12 p 0 1 water organics and sediment characteristics groups exerted direct effects with coefficients of 0 324 p 0 015 and 0 271 p 0 089 respectively hydrological parameters exerted indirect effects with coefficients of 0 3 p 0 1 this study provided new insights on how to improve the ecological management of lakes by quantifying the ecological influence pathways of fluvial inputs to lakes this study may also serve as a

5798,rivers bring large amounts of water sediment and other abundant materials nitrogen phosphorus carbons etc into lakes which places great pressure on lake ecosystems in this study a novel bio assessment framework integrating the bacteria based index of biotic integrity ba ibi and path model was established to determine the direct and indirect effects of fluvial inputs on the ecological status of dongting lake china twenty two sampling sites were selected in dongting lake basin during two days in august 2017 after range responsive and redundancy tests four core metrics were selected from the dataset of 130 candidate metrics to develop the ba ibi including the proportions of flavobacteriia burkholderiales phototrophs and streptomycin producers the ba ibi value which was the sum of each individual metric value was ranged from 1 37 to 3 66 based on the 25th and 75th percentiles of the ba ibi three levels were classified to show the influence degree of fluvial inputs on the ecological status the ba ibi showed a gradient distribution for the distance from estuaries to the major lake regions to further investigate the relative contributions of each individual fluvial input to the ba ibi a path model was established and validated the results showed that water nutrients r 0 658 p 0 1 was the controlling group of factors for the ba ibi including direct r 0 538 p 0 002 and indirect effect r 0 12 p 0 1 water organics and sediment characteristics groups exerted direct effects with coefficients of 0 324 p 0 015 and 0 271 p 0 089 the hydrological parameters group r 0 3 p 0

considered to be a longitudinal composition of two different areas where the lakes are hydrologically linked with stream or river courses hillbricht ilkowska 1999 the interactions between rivers and lakes are complex and dynamic often closely correlated with the seasonal shortage of water resources deterioration of water quality eutrophication and ecosystem degradation within the lakes yang et al 2016 the material exchange between rivers and lakes has a deep influence on substance transferring and energy flowing of the river lake ecosystem therefore a comprehensive understanding of river lake relationships can improve the utilization of water resources and maintain the water ecological balance in a river lake network rivers bring large amounts of water sediment and abundant materials e g pollutants nutrients and heavy metals into the lake pan et al 2012 these fluvial inputs are buffered and processed through the river lake transition zone prior to entering the lake carvalho et al 2018 the sediment discharge from rivers is deposited at the bottom of the lake which can further influence the aquatic organisms in the lake laas et al 2015 xu and li 2019 the water nutrients karthic et al 2013 organics chen et al 2017 and heavy metal dai et al 2018 inputs from rivers would influence the material cycling of lake ecosystem which leading to ecological degradation however a separation of fluvial inputs is not sufficient for understanding their comprehensive impact on lake ecosystems therefore an indicator that could synthetically reflect the variations in the environmental variables is needed as a utility approach biological indicators could provide measurable stress sensitive and predictable metrics to understand how ecosystems respond to environmental stressors niemi and mcdonald 2004 sediment bacteria is one of the most significant aquatic organisms regarding ecosystem functions which carries out the fundamental ecological processes such as decomposition and mineralization poret peterson et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 the distribution of sediment bacteria is the result of complex and interdependent biogeochemical cycles and hydrodynamic transport processes li et al 2015 hence a better understanding of the variations of sediment bacterial communities under the influence of fluvial inputs is critical to the comprehension of river lake ecosystems estuarine sediment bacterial community diversity was relatively lower under the influence of fluvial inputs in taihu lake wu et al 2017 the composition of the bacterial communities in lake erie was associated with east to west gradients of nutrients and xenobiotics inputs bouzat et al 2013 although the shifts in sediment bacterial communities influenced by fluvial inputs have been qualitatively described by estimating the correlation between bacterial communities and fluvial inputs quantitative analysis based on comprehensive bacterial data has not been conducted therefore a systematic and quantitative tool is needed to investigate the response of lake sediment bacteria to fluvial inputs the biotic integrity of aquatic systems has generally been the core issue of the ecological conservation novotny et al 2005 since the index of biotic integrity ibi was first introduced by karr 1981 it has become an essential tool in the restoration and conservation of aquatic ecosystems by quantitatively assessing the ecological status ruaro and gubiani 2013 the ibi framework is established based on a several biological metrics including diversity composition tolerance and functional metrics the lower values of ibi indicate poor biotic condition under anthropogenic influence hence the distribution of ibi values across a region could provide information for the regulation of environmental stressors fausch et al 1984 the indicators used in the bioassessment of lake have been largely confined to macro organisms including benthic macro invertebrates meredith et al 2019 fishes cooper et al 2018 birds uzarski et al 2017 amphibians menetrey et al 2011 periphyton wang et al 2015 and plants yang et al 2018 recently bacterial communities have been included in the ibi to assess the ecological status of aquatic ecosystem li et al 2017 revealed that bacteria based index of biotic integrity ba ibi was a reliable tool to access the ecological health of qinhuai river a typical urban river in nanjing china the sensitivity and reliability of microbial community based index of biotic integrity for assessing the ecological response of taihu lake to surrounding rivers were confirmed by niu et al 2018 with the development of ba ibi a quantitative way to assess the synthetical impacts of fluvial inputs on lake ecosystems is provided however the causal relationship of each fluvial input and the impact of the fluvial inputs on the ba ibi remain to be elucidated the structural equation models are statistical procedures for testing measurement functional predictive and causal hypotheses a path model structural equation modeling with no latent variables is a reliable tool to describe the directed dependencies among a set of variables guo et al 2013 studied the direct and indirect effects of biotic and abiotic factors on denitrification by using the structural equation models hitchman et al 2018 used a path model to clarify the effects of dams and habitats on the fish species richness and test how dams habitats and fish interact hence it can be hypothesized that the path model together with the ba ibi may facilitate our understanding of the driving mechanisms of fluvial inputs on lake ecosystems therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to develop the ba ibi responding to fluvial input gradients 2 to apply the ba ibi to quantitatively assess the impact of fluvial inputs on sediment bacterial communities from different lake regions and 3 to quantify the relative contribution of each fluvial input to ba ibi by building a path model this study may provide a full comprehensive understanding of the management and protection of lake ecosystems 2 materials and methods dongting lake which is representative of intricate river lake interactions was selected as the study area in this study physicochemical analyses were taken to clarify the water and sediment quality of the dongting lake basin high throughput sequencing which can characterize the entire taxonomic composition of a bacterial communities was used to identify the lake sediment bacterial communities based on multiple statistics analyses the bio assessment which integrated ba ibi and path model was established to determine the direct and indirect effects of fluvial inputs on lake ecosystem 2 1 study area and sample collection dongting lake the second largest fresh water lake in china with an area of 2820 km2 is located at the confluence of the yangtze yuan li zi and xiang rivers dongting lake basin has a subtropical monsoon climate the lake area expands dramatically during the wet season may to october and draws down to expose mud flats and grasslands during the dry season november to march with mean depth 6 7 m ma et al 2016 the topography of dongting lake showed an apparent west to east elevation gradient with elevations higher than 40 m in western dongting lake but lower than 25 m in eastern dongting lake yan et al 2014 dongting lake basin is fed by yangtze river with 89 5 109 m3 of water and 111 4 106 ton t of sediment per year via three inlets namely the songzi taiping and ouchi the xiang zi yuan and li rivers annually discharged 166 7 109 m3 water and 26 3 106 t sediment per year into dongting lake the dongting lake also receives discharge from several small basin tributaries such as the miluo and xinqiang rivers finally the water of dongting lake discharges into the yangtze river from the chenglingji outlet yu et al 2018 the dongting lake basin was divided into three parts in this study including the transition zone between yangtze river and major lake region the major lake region and the estuaries twenty two sampling sites were selected which covered the transition zone estuaries and major lake regions in the dongting lake basin w1 to w22 as illustrated in fig 1 the yangtze river sediment bulletin 2016 indicated that the observed water and sediment discharge in the flood season between may and august of chenglingji hydrologic station the only outlet of dongting lake contributed 60 01 and 35 31 to the annual discharge respectively in the flood season of dongting lake basin the water and sediment discharge reached a peak triplicate water and sediment samples at each site were collected during two days in august 2017 using pre cleaned polyethylene bottles water samples were collected

read archive http www ncbi nlm nih gov sra project reference prjna517085 2 3 development of ba ibi 2 3 1 selection of reference sites the development of ba ibi was followed by general procedures huang et al 2015 four main steps were taken to develop ba ibi including reference sites selection candidate metrics selection core metrics screening and scores calculation of ibi the concrete processes for developing ba ibi were shown in fig s1 to apply the ba ibi in the quantitative assessment of the ecological status of different lake regions under the influence of fluvial inputs the appropriate reference sites were set as the most dynamic region in the river lake system river water mixes with lake water in the transition zone leading to significant changes in distribution and speciation of organic matter bioactive elements and pollutants xu et al 2018 compared with adjacent river or lake ecosystems the ecosystem of the transition zone maintains a unique blend of characteristics and ecological communities in this study the sites in the transition zone and river estuaries were considered as impaired sites and the sites in the middle area of the major lake region which were relatively less influenced by the fluvial inputs were considered as the reference sites fig 1 2 3 2 metrics selection the dataset of candidate metrics was composed of four categories including diversity composition tolerance and functional metrics hering et al 2006 based on the otus the diversity metrics were calculated using the vegan package in r v 3 12 http www r project org niu et al 2015 based on the relative abundance of dominant taxa in different level of classification composition metrics were selected according to the results of the redundancy analysis rda the tolerance metrics were selected based on the proportion of taxa at the level of genus responding sensitively or tolerantly to a single stressor li et al 2017 to investigate the variation of bacterial phenotypes metabolic processes and functional pathways under the influence of fluvial inputs functional metrics were selected using metagenassist http www metagenassist ca arndt et al 2012 2 3 3 index development the purpose of the metrics screening is to select the core metrics which can respond to fluvial inputs and discriminate the different ecological status from impaired sites to reference sites in order to screen the core bacterial metrics which can reflect the different ecological status under the influence of fluvial inputs the stepwise processes including range responsive and redundancy tests were used firstly a range test was employed to exclude the metrics for assemblages with fewer taxa to make sure the wide distribution range of the core metrics none of the candidate metrics values should be zero in any sites the candidate metrics with narrow distribution were first excluded secondly the responsive tests including mann whitney u test and box plot test were employed to discriminate the responsiveness of the remaining candidate metrics the non parametric mann whitney u test p 0 05 was used to test whether the mean value of the candidate metrics in reference and impaired sites were significantly different furthermore the box plots for reference and impaired sites were drew to compare the 25th and 75th percentiles of overlap between boxes only metrics with higher discrimination power i e boxes did not overlap between the two sites groups were selected for further analysis li et al 2018 finally a redundancy test was employed to exclude the remaining metrics with redundant bioinformation pearson correlation analysis was used to distinguish the redundant metrics when the pearson s correlation coefficient between the candidate metrics was 0 60 p 0 01 that means these two metrics had bioinformation redundancy under the premise of ensuring each core metric belongs to different category diversity composition tolerance and functional as possible the metric that was significant correlated with more metrics would be chosen as core metric because it contained more bioinformation to make sure that the different types of data could be analyzed in the same scale two standardization methods were taken the proportional metrics which were between 0 and 1 were arcsine square root transformed whereas others were log transformed jia et al 2013 the mann whitney u test and pearson s correlation analysis were carried out using ibm spss statistics 20 0 software to further quantify the differences of the ecological status under the influence of fluvial inputs the selected core metrics were assigned using the 5th and 95th percentiles abdelkefi et al 2013 the ecological response tendency of each metrics to the fluvial inputs showed a difference therefore two different equations were required if the metrics increased with fluvial inputs the metrics were assigned using eq 1 1 metric value maximum site value maximum 5 th percentile if the metrics decreased with fluvial inputs the metrics were assigned using eq 2 2 metric value site value 95 th percentile the trends of the metrics varying with the influence of fluvial inputs were indicated by the boxplots of the core metrics between the reference and impaired sites fig s2 the value of ba ibi was the sum of each individual metric value the sensitivity of the ba ibi was validated using the box plot to compare the discrimination between the reference and impaired sites fig 2 2 4 establishment of path model before the construction of path model principal component analysis pca was used to reduce the dimensionality of the observed variables related to hydrological parameters water physicochemical properties water nutrients water organics water heavy metals and sediment characteristics for each group of fluvial inputs the first principal component with cumulative variance cv nearly or 50 table 1 was used in further path analysis guo et al 2013 liu et al 2018 in this study we constructed and tested a path model based on the existing literature and ecological principals the path coefficients and model fit parameters were determined by amos 24 0 software amos development corp chicago il usa with the maximum likelihood estimation method the strength of the direct and indirect effects from an exogenous variable to an endogenous variable was represented by a standard path coefficient r value by multiplying the standardized path coefficients of the direct effects of the fluvial input involved in the total pathway indirect effects i e effects mediated by other fluvial inputs were calculated liu et al 2018 the total effects were the sum of the direct and indirect effects we tested how well the model fitted the data using the maximum likelihood relative chi square goodness of fit test cmin df cmin df less than 4 is considered acceptable shipley 2000 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of the ba ibi 130 candidate metrics were calculated and established based on the sediment bacterial community data table s1 firstly diversity metrics were composed of six alpha diversity indexes such as simpson and shannon index which revealed the number and relative abundance of species within a community secondly composition metrics were the sets of the relative abundance of the top seven phyla 16 classes 20 orders 20 families and 20 genera to include the representative bacterial groups into the index ten metrics which were the sums of proportions of representative bacterial groups were selected such as bacteroidetes grammaproteobacteria and nitrospira betaproteobacteria bgn beta thirdly the result of rda indicated that tn sediment cr s cr and sediment tp s tp contributed significantly to the variations in the sediment bacterial communities hence these three environmental variables were used to represent the primary environmental stressors the tolerance metrics were the sums of the ratios of top four taxa in genus level which significantly correlated with environmental stressors according to rda fourthly function metrics were composed of bacterial metabolic processes e g ammonia oxidization nitrogen fixation and sulfate reduction oxygen demands e g aerobic anaerobic and their ratio energy sources e g autotrophs diazotrophs and phototrophs and so on of all the candidate metrics eight metrics were firstly excluded with the range test secondly based on the mann whitney u test p 0 05 115 metrics were rejected because they did not exhibit apparent differences between the reference and impaired sites thirdly seven metrics were retained because they displayed significant sensitivities in box and whisker plots fourthly three metrics were redundant by pearson s correlation test table s2 because they showed high correlations with other metrics p 0 05 r 0 6 finally four core metrics were retained for the ba ibi namely the proportion of flavobacteriia m23 proportion of burkholderiales m41 phototrophs m112 and streptomycin producers m122 the metric value of m41 showed an increasing trend toward the stronger effects of the fluvial inputs whereas the metric values of m23 m112 and m122 showed opposing trends fig s2 the ba ibi was calculated by adding the value of each metric the core metrics for developing the ba ibi were further explained as follows firstly flavobacteriia one of the major denitrifiers are especially abundant during and or after phytoplankton blooms teeling et al 2012 tekedar et al 2017 it was included to indicate the eutrophic state secondly the order burkholderiales includes several pathogenic bacteria and is known to harbor various oxygenase genes that function in the degradation of aromatic compounds perez pantoja et al 2012 wang et al 2018 some groups within burkholderiales are also assumed to be responsible for n2o consumption in rice paddy ishii et al 2011 thirdly phototrophs are organisms that carry out photon capture to acquire energy and play important roles in metabolic processes of metabolism degradation hand et al 2001 finally streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic originally isolated from streptomyces griseus the application of streptomycin may lead to a decrease in the ratio of streptomycin producers laskaris et al 2012 the ba ibi was calculated by adding the value of each metric based on the minimum maximum 5th and 95th percentiles of each metric and their responses to the impairment the formulas shown in table s3 were used for the calculation 3 2 application of the ba ibi on assessing the effects of fluvial inputs the ba ibi was applied to quantitatively evaluate the ecological status under the influences of the fluvial inputs of the 22 sampling sites the ba ibi ranged from 1 37 to 3 66 with an average of 2 56 after the operation of three gorges dam in 2003 the natural flow sediment regime of dongting lake was seriously disturbed and the sediment from the yangtze river into dongting lake decreased sharply pan et al 2017 a drawdown of the mainstream resulted in dried up days of the three inlets which in turn decreased fluvial inputs xu and li 2019 therefore the ba ibi fluctuated within a small range at most sites in dongting lake but observable discriminations were still detected for recognizing the different effects of the fluvial inputs on the sampling sites three levels were defined based on the 25th and 75th percentiles of the ba ibi high scores of 1 19 1 98 indicating severe impairment medium scores of 2 03 2 82 indicating moderate impairment and low scores of 2 91 3 37 indicating mildly impairment and almost equivalent to the reference conditions as shown in fig 2 the constituent ratios corresponding to high medium and low effects were 27 27 45 45 and 27 27 respectively almost all of the reference sites which were located at the major lake regions belonged to the low effects except m18 based on the box and whisker plots fig 3 the ba ibi tended to represent high discriminations between reference and impaired site groups whereas the impaired sites exhibited lower ba ibi than the reference sites the ba ibi at the junction of the yangtze river and dongting lake was relatively lower indicating that the lake ecological status was mainly affected by the inputs from the yangtze river the songzi and taiping inlets i e high effect were influenced by the strong inputs from the yangtze river as the fluvial inputs i e nutrients pollutants and heavy metals buffered along the transition zone the ba ibi increased at the downstream of the transition zone w6 and w20 showed a low effect with regard to fluvial inputs w6 was located at the estuary of li river on east dongting lake w20 was located at the downstream of the transition zone between yangtze river and major lake region the ba ibi at the transition zone showed a clear gradient distribution from estuaries to major lake region most high effects were distributed in the estuaries which were greatly affected by fluvial inputs except w14 which connected the yangtze river with the largest inner lake of dongting lake the specific environmental characteristics of w14 resulted in the unique ecological status except for the yangtze river four waters i e yuan zi xiang and li rivers and other small basin tributaries also impacted the dongting lake ecological status among these tributaries the estuaries of the li and miluo rivers had high effects on the ecological status some estuaries such as the yuan xiang and xinqiang rivers had medium effects most of the reference sites located at the major lake regions of dongting lake were low effects influenced by fluvial inputs except for w16 which was at south dongting lake the ecological status of w16 were directly affected by the inputs of the zi and xiang rivers which may have caused a higher ba ibi of w16 than that of the other reference sites 3 3 direct and indirect effects of the fluvial inputs on the ba ibi in general hydrological parameters including water and sediment are the main inputs of the rivers into the lakes as carriers of other fluvial inputs changes in the water and sediment can further affect the concentrations compositions fluxes nutrient cycles organic matter and other fluvial inputs teodoru and wehrli 2005 the altered fluvial inputs can in turn influence the ba ibi therefore we developed a conceptual model to link fluvial inputs to the ba ibi the model was comprised of four layers namely hydrological parameters water properties i e water nutrients water organics water heavy metals and water physicochemical properties sediment characteristics and the ba ibi the path model was established based on the hypothesis that the former layer had a direct effect on the subsequent layers fig 4 and all these layers finally had a combined effect on the ba ibi the maximum likelihood relative chi square goodness of fit test cmin df 3 166 was used to test how well the model fitted the data according to the results hydrological parameters had a significant negative indirect effect r 0 300 on the ba ibi which was intermediated by water nutrients water physicochemical properties and sediment characteristics this conclusion indicates that the transition zone which had stronger water and sediment inputs had a relatively lower ba ibi the fluvial inputs put a relatively higher influence on the transition zone than the major lake region which was consistent with the selection of reference sites as discussed in section 2 3 1 the model also revealed the pathways in which the hydrological parameters affected the ecological status of dongting lake the hydrological parameters had a significant positive direct effect r 0 513 on the water nutrients the hydrological parameters mainly affected the lake ecological status by altering the distribution of water nutrients which contributed a significant negative indirect effect r 0 337 on the ba ibi another significant pathway with regard to the effects of the hydrological parameters on the ba ibi r 0 037 was to alter the water physicochemical properties the water physicochemical properties had a relatively weak indirect effect r 0 107 on the ba ibi water nutrients was the controlling group of factors for the ba ibi it had a significant negative total effect r 0 658 which was the sum of the direct r 0 538 and indirect effects r 0 12 the results of path model showed that the direct effects r 0 538 of the water nutrients on the ba ibi were considerably higher than the indirect effects r 0 120 mediated through the sediment characteristics the pearson s correlation test showed that the first principal component of water nutrients group was significantly p 0 05 related to total nitrogen tn and nitrate no3 as shown in table s4 the tn and no3 could be considered as the two main factors of the first principal component of water nutrients group the average tn concentrations showed a reduced tendency from river inlets w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 w10 and w11 to the central lake area w13 w14 w18 w20 and w21 which is from 1 58 mg l to 1 18 mg l the spatial distribution of tn concentration was correlated to the distance from upstream inflows to the lake tian et al 2017 which showed a consistent trend with ecological influence gradient from estuaries to the central lake area furthermore water organics group also played an important role in driving the lake ecological status which showed a significant negative direct effect r 0 324 on the ba ibi the inputs of the water nutrients and water organics from the rivers into the lake had a direct effect on the dongting lake ecosystem the result of path model indicated that the water heavy metals group did not show a significant effect on ba ibi all of the water heavy metals elements were better than the second grade a total of five of the surface water quality standards of china gb3838 2002 the concentrations of hg as cr cd pb and cu were even below the detection limits such low concentrations of water heavy metals in dongting lake were consistent with the studies of bi et al 2018 and chen et al 2019 hence it was reasonable that water heavy metals had less effects on ba ibi because of the rapidly changing hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions between the river and the lake dongting lake has a complex ecosystem with frequent exchange of nutrients at the sediment water interface as the most important intermediaries of the water properties and hydrological parameters affecting the ba ibi the sediment of dongting lake has many unique characteristics the sediment characteristics had a direct effect r 0 271 on the ba ibi after path analysis the hydrological parameters water nutrients and water physicochemical properties had significant effects on the sediment characteristics and indirect effects on the ba ibi via the sediment characteristics therefore this study revealed ways to control the impacts of fluvial inputs on the ecological status of different lake regions in dongting lake firstly by controlling the water nutrients and the water organic inputs and secondly by regulating the hydrological inputs 3 4 implications for ba ibi and path model in the river lake system rivers bring diverse materials into the lake these fluvial inputs have complex synergistic effects on the lake ecosystems this study introduced sediment bacteria communities which have a rapid response to environmental changing to indicate the lake ecosystem integrity by developing a ba ibi the ecological status of different lake regions affected by fluvial inputs were evaluated quantitatively furthermore the use of path model illuminated the direct and indirect effects of fluvial inputs on the ba ibi and revealed the main pathway of each fluvial input that affects the ecological status of different lake region in summary our study fills the knowledge gap in how well we understand the direct and indirect effects of the fluvial inputs on the ecological status of different lake regions and provides thoughtful insights into the intrinsic relationship between fluvial inputs and ecological status moreover the combination of ba ibi and path model makes it possible to recognize the dominant influence factors extracted from the fluvial inputs on the lake ecological status by altering and controlling the influence factors this method provides a new insight to regulate the lake ecological status which is beneficial to effectively maintain the ecological balance of the lake therefore this novel bio assessment framework could afford a valuable and effective alternative approach for the management and protection of lake ecosystems and provide a reference for the quantitative assessment in other similar water intersection regions 4 conclusions this study provided a novel bio assessment framework which combined the ba ibi and path model to assess and explain the ecological status of different lake regions the ba ibi was developed to quantitatively evaluate the ecological status of different lake regions under the influence of fluvial inputs from the results of pca the first principal components cv was nearly or 50 of each group of fluvial inputs were used into the establishment of path model a path model was used to clarify the causal relationship between the ba ibi and fluvial inputs the distribution of ba ibi showed that fluvial inputs exerted greater influence on the estuaries than on the major lake regions the ba ibi at the transition zone showed a clear gradient distribution from estuaries to major lake region according to the results of the path model the water nutrients group played the most important role in determining the ba ibi including direct r 0 538 p 0 002 and indirect effect r 0 12 p 0 1 water organics and sediment characteristics groups exerted direct effects with coefficients of 0 324 p 0 015 and 0 271 p 0 089 respectively hydrological parameters exerted indirect effects with coefficients of 0 3 p 0 1 this study provided new insights on how to improve the ecological management of lakes by quantifying the ecological influence pathways of fluvial inputs to lakes this study may also serve as a

5799,streamflow is the result of complex climatic and hydrological interactions that are driven by atmosphere ocean circulation teleconnection analysis of streamflow is significant for identifying the atmosphere and climate related indices of hydrology series to mine the physical information of streamflow series more effectively ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd was employed to decompose streamflow series into inherent stationary components with different periodic oscillations and a trend in this study important climate indices were identified based on the correlation coefficients which were calculated using cross correlation according to the selected indicators the decomposed and streamflow series were regressed using an artificial neural network ann and support vector regression svr in total 130 climate phenomenon indices pre runoff and 1 12 month time lags were considered as teleconnection variables the results show that eemd can be used to extract the period and trend of streamflow and that the decomposed hydrology components have much stronger correlations than the original runoff with the climate phenomenon indices the original streamflow was the most closely correlated with the series from the previous month which is an autocorrelation however more physical information was obtained through the teleconnection of the sub streamflow series the periodic oscillations was explained by relatively diverse atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature indices with different time lags the low frequency periodic series were better represented than the high frequency series by the climate phenomenon indices in addition nino 3 4 nino 4 the warm pool enso index and the enso modoki index were representative of the high frequency component the mid frequency signals were sensitive to the solar flux index total sunspot number index pacific decadal oscillation index and southern oscillation index the low frequency series were influenced by the atlantic multi decadal oscillation index north african subtropical high area index north atlantic triple index etc and the indian ocean basin wide index atlantic multi decadal oscillation index western pacific warm pool strength index and east pacific 850 mb trade wind index expressed well the long term trend of monthly streamflow meanwhile the regression results of the decomposed series obtained by the ann and svr exhibited better statistical performance than those of the original series especially for the eemd svr keywords teleconnection ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd climate phenomenon information monthly streamflow support vector regression svr artificial neural network ann 1 introduction streamflow is an immediately accessible source of water for river basins and its analysis is useful for judicious water allocation and scheduling of multipurpose reservoirs the regional trends and variations in hydrological processing can be represented using regional and global climate changes déry 2004 a successful regression model of the hydrologic time series needs to consider numerous local and global climate input variables and to address the underlying physical mechanisms using a holistic approach coulibaly and baldwin 2005 variations of water resources are related to climate changes by atmospheric heat and moisture fluxes in teleconnection patterns bergström et al 2001 evans et al 1998 and interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans bazrkar and eslamian 2017 the concept of teleconnection was first proposed by ångström 1935 and describes the correlations between remote atmospheric circulation ac variations and anomalies due to some kinds of interactions or couplings teleconnection can be more rigorously defined as the adjustment of rhythms of different oscillation systems which is connected with the definition of phase synchronization rosenblum et al 1996 teleconnection analysis can reveal the cause of the streamflow phenomenon and elucidate the physical mechanism in recent decades teleconnection techniques have become increasingly popular in hydrological fields for streamflow prediction or analysis dracup and kahya 1994 peters et al 2013 snow mass calculation sobolowski and frei 2007 precipitation analysis or forecasting he and guan 2013 kirono et al 2010 mekanik et al 2015 examination of global atmospheric co2 guan et al 2015 drought forecasting chiew et al 1998 and so on this hydro meteorological teleconnection is a new concept based on deep understanding of the physical mechanism of the hydrological process and is a type of cause analysis method usually the correlations between meteorological and hydrological elements are extracted by establishing mathematical correlation models which can be applied for hydrologic series regression analysis numerous climate variables influence streamflow to varying degrees in both space and time maity and kashid 2011 hydrologic processing due to natural and anthropogenic climate variations involves information about hydrology meteorology human activities and so on and is coupled with different frequencies and time series trends therefore time series are highly dynamic and even chaotic in nature as well as nonlinear and non stationary chang et al 2017 traditionally relevant factors are selected by ranking the correlations between climate indices and the original hydrological time series then regression analysis of the series can be performed based on the chosen factors however the factors selected based on the correlation between only a single factor and a complex sequence are not representative and cannot be employed to analyze and explain comprehensive geophysical series moreover the original non stationary series is not suitable for regression analysis by conventional statistical methods tan et al 2018 hydrological processes are complex and resemble chaotic motion having the same characteristics as the signal as well as frequency amplitude and phase therefore the signal method has been introduced for processing hydrological time series which are considered to consist of multiple signal series this method is used to extract the trends and harmonics of signals as well as to eliminate noise from the series by comparison with the traditional signal decomposition techniques such as fourier and wavelet decomposition ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd was recently proposed by wu and huang 2009 eemd is a self adaptive data processing method employed to retrieve local characteristic information especially from non linear and non stationary series there have been many successful applications of this decomposition method in hydrology wang et al 2015b ouyang et al 2016 and bai et al 2016 combined regression methods and eemd for runoff monthly rainfall and reservoir inflow forecasting or analysis respectively however eemd has rarely been utilized to analyze the relationships between streamflow and climate phenomenon indices in hydro meteorological teleconnection the main purpose of this paper is to extract the oscillation period and trend of runoff series by data decomposition method and then analyze the influence of meteorological indices on different components of inflow series in this study eemd was employed to transform non stationary original streamflow to stationary sub time series which is suitable for streamflow regression model on the other hand different time scales and periodic oscillations tendency can be identified by the decomposed sub series moreover the combination of teleconnection and the decomposition method can enhance the expression of the meteorological index on hydrological series while more meaningful physical mechanisms can also be investigated finally regression modeling of streamflow series has strong physical mechanism and satisfactory results can also be obtained by an artificial intelligence algorithm which is based on the relationship between strong correlation factors and decomposed sub series the rest of this paper was organized as follows section 2 briefly introduced the statistical methods used in this study namely eemd cross correlation analysis the artificial neural network ann and support vector regression svr the relevant information about the study area climate phenomenon indices inputs parameter settings establishment and verification of the model were given in section 3 section 4 presented the results and a discussion of the streamflow series decomposition selection of relevant factors and monthly streamflow regression analysis finally the conclusion and topics for future work were summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 teleconnection framework based on decomposed series the purposes of this research were to analyze the multi layer signals contained in hydrological series effectively and to elucidate the corresponding physical mechanism thus a decomposition analysis regression framework was developed as shown in fig 1 unlike the conventional teleconnection analysis method this approach is based on the analysis of streamflow series generated by multiple factors climate phenomenon indices the streamflow itself and the lag time and multiple signals the signal decomposition method was applied in this study to decompose streamflow series and to elucidate the physical meanings of the decomposed signal series the developed method consists of the following steps step 1 data processing this method is suitable for non stationary series and the original streamflow time series can be processed by eemd which decomposes the series into several stationary sub series and one residue trend series step 2 teleconnection analysis the teleconnections between the climate phenomenon indices and sub hydrological series are calculated using cross correlation analysis by comparing the correlations between the climate factors and series the representativeness of the indices for different series original and sub streamflow series can be judged it is worth noting that these selected correlation indices should be analyzed for significance by t test which set the significance level to 0 1 and they passing the hypothesis test are considered to be significantly correlated simultaneously the potential for elucidating the physical mechanisms of hydro climate variables is investigated by assessing the lag correlations between the inflow and climate streamflow indices over the previous 1 12 months step 3 regression analysis the minimum root mean square error rmse is employed to select five relevant factors of the decomposed series from the top 15 correlation factors in step 2 by stochastic combination of five arbitrary factors the five selected factors are employed as inputs of the ann and svr models to regress the decomposed series and then all regressed sub series are summed to obtain the final regression of the original series using the eemd ann and eemd svr lastly the regression results of the framework are assessed based on the taylor diagram and three statistical measures nse kge and re in this framework non stationary streamflow is decomposed into stationary series with various frequencies by eemd the teleconnections between the sub series and factors are assessed by cross correlation climate phenomenon indices streamflow autocorrelation and 1 12 month lags are considered and regression analysis of the sub series are performed using ann and svr 2 2 eemd eemd is an improved version of empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1998 huang and wu 2008 and effectively overcomes the shortcomings of mode mixing in emd the objectives of decomposition are to identify various oscillatory modes that coexist and to divide the original data into a series of modes namely finite intrinsic mode functions imfs and a trend term in eemd noise is employed to relieve the frequency mixing phenomenon of emd based on the theory that additional white noise is uniformly distributed across the entire time frequency space so that the signal regions of various scales can be mapped automatically to appropriate scales related to the background white noise huang and wu 2008 wang et al 2015a the amalgamation of the added white noise and true time series produces noisy results although the noise can be eliminated by employing ensemble means and the corresponding imfs the specific procedures of eemd can be summarized as follows step 1 input the target data as the original signal x t step 2 set the eemd parameters including the noise standard deviation nstd number of realizations nr and maximum number of sifting iterations allowed maxiter step 3 conduct the i th decomposition add a normally distributed white noise series wi t with finite amplitude to the given signal x t and reconstruct a new set of series yi t using equation 1 1 y i t x t w i t step 4 decompose yi t into n levels of imfs cij t and a trend term ri t for the i th decomposition by emd using equation 2 2 y i t j 1 n c ij t r i t where cij t is the j th imf after the i th decomposition step 5 repeat steps 2 and 3 with different white noise series until the maximum number of realizations nr is achieved for i step 6 obtain imfs by calculating the ensemble means of the corresponding imfs to eliminate mode mixing the final results are given by eqs 3 and 4 3 c j t i 1 nr c ij t n r 4 x t j 1 n c j t r t where cj t is the j th imf and r t is the trend term 2 3 cross correlation analysis in teleconnection analysis the pearson cross correlation method is employed to identify the climate correlations based on the empirical correlations constructed using the climate phenomenon and hydrological data tatli 2007 cross correlation analysis is a method of assessing the similarity correlation and linear dependency between two time series and is also a signal processing method roux et al 2012 the correlation coefficient is defined as 5 ρ x x y y x x 2 y y 2 where x and y denote the sample means of the sub series of the streamflow and index series respectively and x x 2 and y y 2 are the classical sample variance estimates of these series kim et al 2018 the cross correlation coefficient ρ ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 and describes the strength of the linear relationship between the two series if ρ is close to 1 0 or 1 0 then there is a strong negative or positive correlation respectively between the series 2 4 ann an ann is a machine learning algorithm inspired by the functions and structures of biological neural networks hecht nielsen 1988 maier and dandy 1996 as an information system an ann has a powerful ability to identify nonlinear and densely interconnected neurons and to take them as hidden layers sudheer et al 2002 it is an efficient method of extracting the explicit relationship between input and output data therefore this artificial intelligence technique has been widely used in hydrology time series simulation and forecasting such as in precipitation prediction luk et al 2000 mislan et al 2015 reservoir operation coulibaly et al 2000 rainfall runoff analysis dounia et al 2014 hsu et al 1995 sajikumar and thandaveswara 1999 water quality parameter prediction maier and dandy 1996 and flood forecasting elsafi 2014 zhang et al 2018 a back propagation neural network bpnn developed by rumelhart et al 1986 is one type of ann kuo et al 2004 and is the most suitable for forecasting and regression applications the architecture of bpnn is simple and easy to implement and bpnns are closely related to statistical models lee 2004 in this study a three layer bpnn model was used to analyze the inflow time series the model consists of an input layer where the data are introduced into the model a hidden layer where the input and output data are connected by a transfer function and an output layer where the processed results of the given input data are produced the function f is used to connect the inputs to hidden neurons as shown in eq 6 6 h j f i 1 n w ij x i b j where hj is the j th neuron of the hidden layer n is the total number of inputs m is the number of neurons xi is the i th input wij is the weight assigned

menhaj 1994 2 5 svr support vector regression svr is developed on the support vector machine svm vapnik 1995 which is used to regression scheme liu et al 2014 generally svr and svm have the identical methodology but with a slight difference svm is one type of supervised classification technique which belongs to the linear classifier base on convex optimization vapnik 1999 svr is the method of projecting inputs to a high dimensional feature space by a linear function to simplify the classification task and training by an optimal hyperplane to split dataset by offset svr is dedicated to finding a regression function f x which could describe the relationship between the given inputs dataset x x 1 x 2 x n and target value y y 1 y 2 y n as follows 8 f x w φ x b where w and b are weight vector and offset factor respectively φ x is the nonlinear mapping function by transforming input vector into a high dimensional feature space maity et al 2010 the optimization and constrained form

user defined regularization constant means influence the trade off between dispersion of weights and objective function the ξi and ξi are called the positive slack variables that are employed to

lyx reservoir which was built in 1987 is the headwater reservoir for the yellow river bai et al 2015 the reservoir is located at 36 07 n and 107 47 e with dam crest altitude 2610 m above mean sea level located in the town of gonghe qinghai province the province is in the east of the qinghai tibet plateau lyx is 1684 km from the source of the upper yellow river and 3376 km from the mouth of the lower yellow river as shown in fig 2 the first large cascade reservoir serves as the main source of water for the yellow river and has an annual mean inflow of 650 m3 s accounting for 35 of the inflow for the entire yellow river watershed and 42 of the water discharge to the sea fu et al 2004 yan et al 2009 its annual runoff mainly comes from the flood season may october comprising 60 of the total runoff and the rest from the non flood season november april zhang et al 2008 the total storage capacity of lyx is 24 7 108 m3 and corresponds to a water level is 2607 m storage water is primarily employed for hydropower generation it also has comprehensive benefits of flood control irrigation ice control aquaculture and tourism the monthly streamflow which is the inflow data of the lyx reservoir covers the period of january 1956 december 2016 732 months and was retrieved from the bureau of hydrology yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources 3 2 climate phenomenon indices there are 130 climate phenomenon indices 88 ac indices 26 sea surface temperature sst indices and 16 other indices that serve as optional indices describing the inflow for analyzing lyx their monthly values were obtained from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration http cmdp ncc cma net monitoring cn index 130 php the datasets have been updated continually from at least the 1950s to the present and the selected temporal coverage corresponds with the hydrological time series from 1956 to 2016 appendix a lists detailed information about these indices including the definitions of the abbreviations employed in this paper generally these climate phenomenon indices are associated with the atmosphere climate sst etc 3 3 model inputs and parameter settings the popular regression analysis methods employed for hydrological time series are autocorrelation and teleconnection the difference between autocorrelation and teleconnection regression methods is that in the inflow processing the inflow and climate phenomenon indices from the previous month are analyzed separately however the inflow is a comprehensive result of meteorological and hydrological processes hejazi and cai 2009 yang et al 2017 therefore the inflow and climate phenomenon indices from the previous month were taken as candidate factors to analyze the correlation with the inflow and to enhance the model performance in addition to physical characteristics the hydrological series also contain temporal information and the different lag times should be considered when representing the inflow characteristics in this study lag times from 1 to 12 time steps months were considered the model inputs consider past inflow and 130 monthly climate phenomenon indices with 1 12 month lags accordingly 131 12 model inputs were included in the regression model in the eemd model nr was set to 100 the maximum number of sifting iterations was set to 500 and the amplitude of white noise was set to 0 2 times the standard deviation of the sample data these settings are similar to those employed by wu and huang 2009 a unique ann and svr model was developed for each decomposed sub series each month therefore c 15 5 n i 12 ann models were needed where n i is the number of decomposed sub series of the i th month to save time the parameters of ann and svr were assumed to be the same for the sub series seasons and inputs in the ann the number of hidden neurons was determined by trial and error which was selected to be nine through the simulation experiments of svr which set linear polynomial and rbf kernel functions with several different parameters penalty coefficients and gamma it was determined that the ideal fit was when the kernel function was rfb with 500 and 0 1 as the penalty coefficient and gamma respectively 3 4 establishment and verification of regression models the establishment of the regression models were based on the selected strong correlation indictors which can not violate the physical significance of hydrological meteorological teleconnection it is worth mentioning that the final regression factors were selected by randomly choosing five indices from the top 15 and the group of indices with the smallest square root error was identified this method was employed to avoid incomplete consideration of signal factors ann and svr models take 1956 2004 as the training period and the data from 2005 to 2016 were used for testing to quantify the regression performances of the different models a taylor diagram taylor 2001 and three mathematical measures were selected the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and relative error re he et al 2017 which can be computed using eqs 13 14 and 15 respectively the taylor diagram is a visual framework which provides a reference for comparing model results and observations it is useful for evaluating complex models with different parameter sets or the relative skill of different models model performance is quantified in terms of a correlation coefficient standard deviation and centered root mean square error the nse indicates the relative magnitude of residual variance and observation data variance the kge is an enhanced statistical measure of the nse which avoids some of the limitations of nse the re is valuable for estimating over or under regression i e bias and contributes to performance analysis the closer nse and kge are to 1 and the closer re is to 0 indicates less bias and a better fit according to previous investigations the model performance be considered satisfactory when nse 0 5 kge 0 5 and re 0 2 13 nse 1 i 1 n q ori i q reg i 2 i 1 n q ori i q ori a v e 2 14 kge 1 1 r 2 1 σ r σ o 2 1 μ r μ o 2 15 re 1 n i 1 n q ori i q reg i q ori i 100 where qori i and qreg i represent the original and regression inflow series respectively during the i th year for january december qori ave and qreg ave are the means of the original and regression values respectively and n is the total number of original observations as well as the number of years r is called the linear correlation coefficient between simulated and observed value σ r and μ r are mean and standard deviations of regressed value respectively and σ o μ o are mean and standard deviations of the original observed values respectively 4 results and discussion to analyze the characteristics of the teleconnection information relative to the monthly inflow of lyx the 732 month inflow series was divided into 12 sub series with one sub series corresponding to each month from january to december since the time lag is considered to be 12 months the data of the first year 1956 are used as the time lag factor and the months sequence of 1957 2016 are used as the regression sequence 4 1 eemd results eemd was employed to decompose the integrated 12 monthly inflow time series into five independent levels namely imf1 imf4 and one residue level with different frequencies and amplitudes these components were ordered from highest to lowest frequency imf1 to imf4 are also became more regular and stable and among the lowest frequencies the residue level was the slowest change trend of the original time series due to space constraints only the decomposition results corresponding to the high and low water periods september and april respectively are presented in fig 3 as fig 3 shows the frequencies of the decomposed series decreases gradually with obvious periodic processes see fig 3 providing cleaner inputs for the regression model the inflow series for april in fig 3 a shows different characteristic cycles the amplitude and fluctuation range of imf1 are the largest of all the decomposed series for imf1 the amplitude fluctuated greatly in the 1960s and slowed down from the 1970s to the 1980s then began to fluctuate again in the late 1980s until the beginning of the 21st century imf2 has a more obvious six year cycle its fluctuation is more intense in the 1970s 1980s and the rest of the time period changes more smoothly there is a 20 year period in imf3 before the 1960s the change of imf3 was stable and the fluctuation was relatively small fluctuations intensified after the 1960s and continued into the 21st century imf4 is characterized over a periodic period of 30 years the fluctuation amplitude was stable before the 1970s and then increased substantially the trends reveal that the inflow increased from 1956 to 1979 and then declined in the following decades in the decomposed series for september fig 3 b there are obvious periodic variations with 3 year 5 6 year 13 15 year and 25 year periods and a downward trend is evident for all 60 years in the high frequency series imf1 imf3 the changes are stable and the fluctuations are small after the 1990s because the length of the time series is limited there is no obvious periodic component in the trend term runoff data from a longer period of time is needed to study the change characteristics of the time scale the remaining 10 months have similar periodic rules with an increase of order the amplitude of imf components decreases and the wavelength increases which indicates that the lyx inflow series contains multiple time scales with different characteristics the result is similar the pekárová et al 2003 study which analyzed the runoff oscillation of main rivers of the world during 19th 20th centuries bourrel et al 2015 found ei nino has periodic variations of 3 5 and 4 8 years whether ei nino is strong or weak it will cause global atmospheric circulation and weather and climate anomalies the fluctuation period of high frequency series are consistent with the periodic variation of ei nino phenomena which indicates that ei nino phenomena are closely related to the variation of lyx inflow runoff williams 1961 investigated 11 year hale cycles which are the most frequently studied cycles related to runoff variability and are considered to be the main cycles affecting the nature and causes of cyclical changes in hydrological conditions of the world according to the 12 trend components the inflow of lyx decreased gradually over the most recent 40 years 1978 2016 which are consistent with the trend of actual runoff situation 4 2 correlations between related factors and original decomposed components the correlation coefficients of the input variables climate phenomenon indices and previous inflow with 1 12 month lags and object time series original and decomposed series were estimated by cross correlation analysis the correlation coefficients of the strongest cross correlation indices of the original and decomposed series the ones with the greatest correlations are shown in table 1 due to length limitations only a few significant indices are presented the absolute value of the correlation coefficient was used to represent the magnitude of the correlation where the closer the value is to 1 the stronger the correlation is and values close to 0 indicate that there is no correlation table 1 demonstrates that most of the input series have greater correlations with the decomposed inflow series than the original series except the past inflow series itself the previous inflow is highly correlated with the original inflow series with an average correlation coefficient of 0 70 besides the factors of the previous inflow a few individual indices perform slightly better in describing the original inflow information such as emi in february june and november wptw in february and tsa tpr1 and tpr2 in april the maximum minimum and average correlation coefficients between the sub inflow series and climate phenomenon indices are 0 89 0 22 and 0 50 respectively which are all considerably greater than those between the original sequences and relevant indices 0 48 0 06 and 0 22 respectively for the same index the correlation of any of the sub series is at most 0 77 more than that of the original series and the correlation of the original series is at most only 0 07 more than that of any of the sub series in summary three conclusions can be drawn 1 similar to the original series the previous inflow series contains a variety of information due to complex physical factors and mechanisms therefore the correlation between the past inflow and original runoff is relatively high 2 in the sub signal sequence the meteorological factors have strong abilities to express the inflow information and high correlations with the hydrological time series the original signal is influenced by various meteorological factors so the meteorological factors related to the influence on the hydrology series can be extracted by decomposing the inflow original series via eemd 3 the signal expression has a hysteretic effect different meteorological factors have different lag times in the process of ac and water vapor migration transformation 4 3 signals of climate phenomenon indices teleconnection analysis mainly addresses the effects of meteorological indices on hydrological elements on a two dimensional scale of time and space it is necessary to analyze the effects of different physical indices and their time lags on the decomposed streamflow series figs 4 and 5 are correlation graphs of the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between the model input variables and the sub inflow series for april and september where the x and y axes correspond to the 15 indices with the highest correlations and 1 12 month lag times in figs 4 and 5 the redder the color the stronger the representativeness of the factors while bluer colors indicate factors that are less related to the sub inflow series according to fig 4 a qbo with a 1 month lag and tna with a 2 month lag are significantly correlated with the high frequency imf1 series in april the correlation coefficients of apvi with an 8 month lag and the inflow with a 12 month lag are the highest reaching 0 37 and 0 34 for imf2 and imf3 respectively in april as shown in fig 4 b and 4 c for the low frequency series imf4 the previous inflow is the most relevant factor shown in fig 4 d amo plays a decisive role in the inflow trend in april shown in fig 4 f in fig 5 a cptw is the significant index for imf1 in september for imf2 in september napva with a 3 month lag is the most relevant as shown in fig 5 b besides the inflow with a 12 month lag time the amm series also affects imf3 in september in fig 5 d amo has an impact on the low frequency series imf4 in september for several months many ac indices are highly correlated with the trend term of the september runoff however the sst indices iop and wpwps are not only correlated with the trend but also have continuous impacts on the series throughout the year fig 5 f considering the different indices and their lag times the variables most closely related to the original and decomposed monthly inflow series were selected as shown in table 2 the original inflow series has strong autocorrelations within a single time step for the decomposed inflow series the previous inflow series with time lags of 1 and 12 months both have strong correlations with some subsequences the inflow from the previous month has a strong autocorrelation with the current inflow the 12 month delay is the effect of the previous year on the current inflow which is a seasonal long term effect related to ac according to the correlation the most relevant index was defined to verify the representativeness of the variables the selected indices were compared with the corresponding decomposed series april and september as depicted in fig 6 the results show that these indices are consistent with the periodicity of the corresponding imf1 imf4 components the residues represent the long term trends which appear as fluctuations a rise followed by a fall in april and a steady downward trend over the entire period which are similar to the general tendencies of amo 6 month lag and nfsa 1 month lag respectively for april qbo 1 and amo 6 are negatively correlated with imf1 and the residue for september amo 9 and ngsa 1 are negatively correlated with imf4 and the residue and the other indices for these two months are positively correlated these results demonstrate that the method of selecting relevant factors is reliable and further confirm that the hydro meteorological teleconnection is basically valid as mentioned above the climate phenomenon indices have strong correlations with the decomposed series due to their similar physical meanings from figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that the correlation coefficients of some climate phenomenon indices are not the highest but the 12 variables of the indices with 1 12 month lags have significant effects on the decomposition series inspection of the results in table 3 the top three climate phenomenon indices in terms of the mean absolute values of the correlations with the different decomposed components reveals some important characteristics the highest frequency components in imf1 are sensitive to the enso phenomenon with the related indices including nino 3 4 nino 4 and wei followed by ac and other indices qbo nao tpr etc especially from september to march in half of each year december march and june august imf2 is controlled by nino 4 wei and emi which are sst indices whwp sst and mpzw ac are meaningful for april and may for september and october imf2 is also greatly affected by nino 3 4 in addition to nino 4 and wei for the mid frequency component the extended index is dominant sfi and tsn have substantial effects on the mid frequency component imf3 of the series from january to july for august and december pdo and soi are important in addition the component of the series for each month has its own individual indices the correlation indices of the low frequency series imf4 are relatively diverse april november and december have common decisive indices nfsa nfsi and ftmsi the components of the other months are mainly influenced by amo nat kcs nas pdo and so on which is consistent with gonzález et al 2017 notably there are high correlations with the trend items for example iob amo wpwps and eptw play significant roles in the trend terms iob represents the indian ocean basin wide variability mode which is characterized by basin wide warming or cooling amo indicates the basin scale oceanic phenomena with decadal variations in the north atlantic region which is an interdecadal sst variation it influences the hydro climatic variables of the area and provides information about the monthly streamflow trends wpwps and eptw are the western pacific warm pool strength index and east pacific 850mb trade wind index respectively which are closely related to the enso cycle process therefore the trend of the monthly series is determined by sst and enso lü et al 2010 summarized that nino indices and soi have stronger correlations with reservoir discharge in headwaters region of the yellow river yuan 2015 found that the source region of the hydrological condition of the yellow river positively related to nao wp and soi and inversely related to p ep in another study that investigated the california basin in the usa which is same type of semiarid region as yellow river yang et al 2017 identified that there were significant correlations between nino tni qbo and whwp and the inflow of trinity lake a similar conclusion was reached by wang et al 2006 that enso sst and soi are key indicators influencing the interannual and seasonal variation of the yellow river water discharge however previous studies have not shown that the impact of these indicators has any influence on the different periodic components of streamflow from table 2 it can be concluded that the non flood season is greatly affected by the previous streamflow especially previous streamflow in the same period compared with the non flood season the flood season is mainly affected by complex and diverse meteorological indices for high frequency series the non flood season is mainly influenced by nino 3 4 nino 4 wei and mei for the flood season nao tpr and qbo also have great influence on runoff for sub series with longer cycles there are many factors affecting flood season besides sei pdo soi tsn they are also related to amo nat tsa kcs and so on and for trend items the flood season and non flood season are similar 4 4 regression of monthly inflow the stateed results show that the meteorological teleconnection indices have strong abilities to express different periodic sub inflow time series therefore it is significant to analyze the regression results of the decomposed and original series using the representative characteristics of the climate phenomenon series and to verify the teleconnection between the hydrological and meteorological information the selected comprehensive regression indices for the monthly inflow series are shown in table 4 in this study ann and svr were employed to compare the regression performance before and after the decomposition of the inflow series of the lxy reservoir at the same time the use of the two methods avoids the influence of the method itself on the fitting effect as can be seen from table 4 the original inflow is mainly teleconnected with the previous inflow autocorrelation followed by wei and nino 4 the regression of the teleconnections of the decomposed signal series not only yields better performance but also provides a variety of physically meaningful information about streamflow for example amo and wpwps play significant roles in the trend term and emi tpr esi tsn and apva have considerable effects on the low frequency signals amo indicates basin scale oceanic phenomena with decadal variations in the north atlantic region which is an interdecadal variation of sst it influences the hydroclimatic variables for the area and provides information about the trend of monthly inflow wpwps stands for the western pacific warm pool strength index which is the intensity index of abnormal sst variations and is closely related to the enso cycle process emi and tsn are typical sst indices and apva tpr and esi are ac indices the calculated values of nse kge and re between the original series and inflow simulated using the ann svr eemd ann and eemd svr approaches are presented in table 5 the regression performance of the monthly and annual inflow series obtained using teleconnection information in these methods for the lyx reservoir are shown in fig 7 in table 5 the bold and underlined values indicate the best performance of the regression model for the independent and consecutive months from this table it can be concluded that except in may and september the eemd svr teleconnection regression model yielded the most satisfactory regression performance in comparison with the ann and single svr methods for the reservoir inflow series for may and september the svr teleconnection method is slightly better than the eemd svr method overall it is shown that the regression performance of the decomposed series is better than the original runoff regression and compared to svr model it has obtained more satisfactory results than ann in fig 7 the distance between each point and the origin indicats the performance of different models the same conclusion can be drawn from this figure as that from table 5 the evaluation of entirety consecutive month of different method are much better than the monthly evaluation and svr methods show more satisfactory results than ann furthermore both two ann methods produce better statistics during the non flood season than during the flood season but there is little difference between the svr methods according to figs 8 and 9 the eemd ann and eemd svr teleconnection method have a stronger ability to simulate the fluctuations and to obtain the peak and valley values of the inflow series accurately this conclusion is consistent with the study of tan et al 2018 and wu et al 2010 which showed that the decomposition forecast ensemble method has better performance in the regression and forecast of hydrological series furthermore based on these results this study explored the physical indices related to streamflow 5 conclusion in this study climate phenomenon indices as well as lagged information were identified as effective indicators of the monthly inflow of the lyx reservoir in the yellow river basin using approximately 60 years of historical records eemd cross correlation ann and svr were employed for data processing correlation analysis and regression verification respectively the results show that more physical information related to hydrology could be obtained by teleconnection analysis of the data processed by eemd most of the climate indices were more closely correlated with the decomposed series than with the original inflow the selected relevant indices could reasonably be used to interpret the periodic oscillations and long term trends in the monthly inflow of lyx the examined eemd ann and eemd svr regression model exhibited better performance than ann and svr regression model alone especially eemd svr it is expected that the series decomposed by eemd can help decision makers understand the implications of climate phenomena on streamflow and provide operators with more flexibility to add desired decision variables according to the results of this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the monthly inflow series could be decomposed into a finite number of sub series with different frequencies by eemd by utilizing these decomposed components with inherent cycles it was possible to identify oscillatory patterns and the long term trends of the monthly streamflow the climate phenomenon indices had the greatest correlations with the residue trend term followed by the low frequency series imf4 2 the climate phenomenon indices were more significant for the decomposed components than for the original inflow series the average correlation coefficient between the climate phenomenon indices and sub inflow series was 0 3 greater than that between the climate factors and original flow the sub series could be expressed by the nature and time lags of these indices 3 the inflow with a 1 month lag was the most relevant explanatory variable for the original inflow series whose correlation was an autocorrelation however for the decomposed series the previous inflow affected only a few components and was not the decisive variable the inflow from the previous month was mainly related to the high frequency component and the inflow from the previous year was associated with the low frequency component which was influenced by ac 4 the periodic oscillations were explained by relatively diverse ac and sst indices with different time lags the low frequency periodic series were better represented than the high frequency series by the climate phenomenon indices the el nino indices including nino 3 4 nino 4 and emi were significant for the high frequency component the sst indices such as iob amo wpwps and eptw were representative of the long term trend of monthly streamflow 5 the eemd is benefit to teleconnection model for streamflow regression but also could identify more reasonable and relevant physical indices moreover eemd svr can significantly improve regression performance than ann and single svr models for the ann method as the fitted model underestimated the large peak flows during the flood season may october the regression performance was better during the non flood season than during the flood season november to the next april for the inflow of the lyx reservoir however the identified indices were suitable for fitting the general periodic oscillations and monthly inflow variations the decomposition based teleconnection method in this study is novel in that it incorporates large scale meteorological and climatic information with regional hydrological processes to assess the physical interactions between climatic phenomena and streamflow however regression models are not limited to ann and svr methods but can be customized according to the characteristics of watershed and the applicability of regression methods secondly this study is limited by the time scale of meteorological data and could only analyze the physical impact factors of monthly scale streamflow if the time scale of the data is appropriate the physical mechanism of short term streamflow can be analyzed thirdly the cross correlation method employed in this study is not suitable for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary natural series in future research it will be

5799,streamflow is the result of complex climatic and hydrological interactions that are driven by atmosphere ocean circulation teleconnection analysis of streamflow is significant for identifying the atmosphere and climate related indices of hydrology series to mine the physical information of streamflow series more effectively ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd was employed to decompose streamflow series into inherent stationary components with different periodic oscillations and a trend in this study important climate indices were identified based on the correlation coefficients which were calculated using cross correlation according to the selected indicators the decomposed and streamflow series were regressed using an artificial neural network ann and support vector regression svr in total 130 climate phenomenon indices pre runoff and 1 12 month time lags were considered as teleconnection variables the results show that eemd can be used to extract the period and trend of streamflow and that the decomposed hydrology components have much stronger correlations than the original runoff with the climate phenomenon indices the original streamflow was the most closely correlated with the series from the previous month which is an autocorrelation however more physical information was obtained through the teleconnection of the sub streamflow series the periodic oscillations was explained by relatively diverse atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature indices with different time lags the low frequency periodic series were better represented than the high frequency series by the climate phenomenon indices in addition nino 3 4 nino 4 the warm pool enso index and the enso modoki index were representative of the high frequency component the mid frequency signals were sensitive to the solar flux index total sunspot number index pacific decadal oscillation index and southern oscillation index the low frequency series were influenced by the atlantic multi decadal oscillation index north african subtropical high area index north atlantic triple index etc and the indian ocean basin wide index atlantic multi decadal oscillation index western pacific warm pool strength index and east pacific 850 mb trade wind index expressed well the long term trend of monthly streamflow meanwhile the regression results of the decomposed series obtained by the ann and svr exhibited better statistical performance than those of the original series especially for the eemd svr keywords teleconnection ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd climate phenomenon information monthly streamflow support vector regression svr artificial neural network ann 1 introduction streamflow is an immediately accessible source of water for river basins and its analysis is useful for judicious water allocation and scheduling of multipurpose reservoirs the regional trends and variations in hydrological processing can be represented using regional and global climate changes déry 2004 a successful regression model of the hydrologic time series needs to consider numerous local and global climate input variables and to address the underlying physical mechanisms using a holistic approach coulibaly and baldwin 2005 variations of water resources are related to climate changes by atmospheric heat and moisture fluxes in teleconnection patterns bergström et al 2001 evans et al 1998 and interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans bazrkar and eslamian 2017 the concept of teleconnection was first proposed by ångström 1935 and describes the correlations between remote atmospheric circulation ac variations and anomalies due to some kinds of interactions or couplings teleconnection can be more rigorously defined as the adjustment of rhythms of different oscillation systems which is connected with the definition of phase synchronization rosenblum et al 1996 teleconnection analysis can reveal the cause of the streamflow phenomenon and elucidate the physical mechanism in recent decades teleconnection techniques have become increasingly popular in hydrological fields for streamflow prediction or analysis dracup and kahya 1994 peters et al 2013 snow mass calculation sobolowski and frei 2007 precipitation analysis or forecasting he and guan 2013 kirono et al 2010 mekanik et al 2015 examination of global atmospheric co2 guan et al 2015 drought forecasting chiew et al 1998 and so on this hydro meteorological teleconnection is a new concept based on deep understanding of the physical mechanism of the hydrological process and is a type of cause analysis method usually the correlations between meteorological and hydrological elements are extracted by establishing mathematical correlation models which can be applied for hydrologic series regression analysis numerous climate variables influence streamflow to varying degrees in both space and time maity and kashid 2011 hydrologic processing due to natural and anthropogenic climate variations involves information about hydrology meteorology human activities and so on and is coupled with different frequencies and time series trends therefore time series are highly dynamic and even chaotic in nature as well as nonlinear and non stationary chang et al 2017 traditionally relevant factors are selected by ranking the correlations between climate indices and the original hydrological time series then regression analysis of the series can be performed based on the chosen factors however the factors selected based on the correlation between only a single factor and a complex sequence are not representative and cannot be employed to analyze and explain comprehensive geophysical series moreover the original non stationary series is not suitable for regression analysis by conventional statistical methods tan et al 2018 hydrological processes are complex and resemble chaotic motion having the same characteristics as the signal as well as frequency amplitude and phase therefore the signal method has been introduced for processing hydrological time series which are considered to consist of multiple signal series this method is used to extract the trends and harmonics of signals as well as to eliminate noise from the series by comparison with the traditional signal decomposition techniques such as fourier and wavelet decomposition ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd was recently proposed by wu and huang 2009 eemd is a self adaptive data processing method employed to retrieve local characteristic information especially from non linear and non stationary series there have been many successful applications of this decomposition method in hydrology wang et al 2015b ouyang et al 2016 and bai et al 2016 combined regression methods and eemd for runoff monthly rainfall and reservoir inflow forecasting or analysis respectively however eemd has rarely been utilized to analyze the relationships between streamflow and climate phenomenon indices in hydro meteorological teleconnection the main purpose of this paper is to extract the oscillation period and trend of runoff series by data decomposition method and then analyze the influence of meteorological indices on different components of inflow series in this study eemd was employed to transform non stationary original streamflow to stationary sub time series which is suitable for streamflow regression model on the other hand different time scales and periodic oscillations tendency can be identified by the decomposed sub series moreover the combination of teleconnection and the decomposition method can enhance the expression of the meteorological index on hydrological series while more meaningful physical mechanisms can also be investigated finally regression modeling of streamflow series has strong physical mechanism and satisfactory results can also be obtained by an artificial intelligence algorithm which is based on the relationship between strong correlation factors and decomposed sub series the rest of this paper was organized as follows section 2 briefly introduced the statistical methods used in this study namely eemd cross correlation analysis the artificial neural network ann and support vector regression svr the relevant information about the study area climate phenomenon indices inputs parameter settings establishment and verification of the model were given in section 3 section 4 presented the results and a discussion of the streamflow series decomposition selection of relevant factors and monthly streamflow regression analysis finally the conclusion and topics for future work were summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 teleconnection framework based on decomposed series the purposes of this research were to analyze the multi layer signals contained in hydrological series effectively and to elucidate the corresponding physical mechanism thus a decomposition analysis regression framework was developed as shown in fig 1 unlike the conventional teleconnection analysis method this approach is based on the analysis of streamflow series generated by multiple factors climate phenomenon indices the streamflow itself and the lag time and multiple signals the signal decomposition method was applied in this study to decompose streamflow series and to elucidate the physical meanings of the decomposed signal series the developed method consists of the following steps step 1 data processing this method is suitable for non stationary series and the original streamflow time series can be processed by eemd which decomposes the series into several stationary sub series and one residue trend series step 2 teleconnection analysis the teleconnections between the climate phenomenon indices and sub hydrological series are calculated using cross correlation analysis by comparing the correlations between the climate factors and series the representativeness of the indices for different series original and sub streamflow series can be judged it is worth noting that these selected correlation indices should be analyzed for significance by t test which set the significance level to 0 1 and they passing the hypothesis test are considered to be significantly correlated simultaneously the potential for elucidating the physical mechanisms of hydro climate variables is investigated by assessing the lag correlations between the inflow and climate streamflow indices over the previous 1 12 months step 3 regression analysis the minimum root mean square error rmse is employed to select five relevant factors of the decomposed series from the top 15 correlation factors in step 2 by stochastic combination of five arbitrary factors the five selected factors are employed as inputs of the ann and svr models to regress the decomposed series and then all regressed sub series are summed to obtain the final regression of the original series using the eemd ann and eemd svr lastly the regression results of the framework are assessed based on the taylor diagram and three statistical measures nse kge and re in this framework non stationary streamflow is decomposed into stationary series with various frequencies by eemd the teleconnections between the sub series and factors are assessed by cross correlation climate phenomenon indices streamflow autocorrelation and 1 12 month lags are considered and regression analysis of the sub series are performed using ann and svr 2 2 eemd eemd is an improved version of empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1998 huang and wu 2008 and effectively overcomes the shortcomings of mode mixing in emd the objectives of decomposition are to identify various oscillatory modes that coexist and to divide the original data into a series of modes namely finite intrinsic mode functions imfs and a trend term in eemd noise is employed to relieve the frequency mixing phenomenon of emd based on the theory that additional white noise is uniformly distributed across the entire time frequency space so that the signal regions of various scales can be mapped automatically to appropriate scales related to the background white noise huang and wu 2008 wang et al 2015a the amalgamation of the added white noise and true time series produces noisy results although the noise can be eliminated by employing ensemble means and the corresponding imfs the specific procedures of eemd can be summarized as follows step 1 input the target data as the original signal x t step 2 set the eemd parameters including the noise standard deviation nstd number of realizations nr and maximum number of sifting iterations allowed maxiter step 3 conduct the i th decomposition add a normally distributed white noise series wi t with finite amplitude to the given signal x t and reconstruct a new set of series yi t using equation 1 1 y i t x t w i t step 4 decompose yi t into n levels of imfs cij t and a trend term ri t for the i th decomposition by emd using equation 2 2 y i t j 1 n c ij t r i t where cij t is the j th imf after the i th decomposition step 5 repeat steps 2 and 3 with different white noise series until the maximum number of realizations nr is achieved for i step 6 obtain imfs by calculating the ensemble means of the corresponding imfs to eliminate mode mixing the final results are given by eqs 3 and 4 3 c j t i 1 nr c ij t n r 4 x t j 1 n c j t r t where cj t is the j th imf and r t is the trend term 2 3 cross correlation analysis in teleconnection analysis the pearson cross correlation method is employed to identify the climate correlations based on the empirical correlations constructed using the climate phenomenon and hydrological data tatli 2007 cross correlation analysis is a method of assessing the similarity correlation and linear dependency between two time series and is also a signal processing method roux et al 2012 the correlation coefficient is defined as 5 ρ x x y y x x 2 y y 2 where x and y denote the sample means of the sub series of the streamflow and index series respectively and x x 2 and y y 2 are the classical sample variance estimates of these series kim et al 2018 the cross correlation coefficient ρ ranges from 1 0 to 1 0 and describes the strength of the linear relationship between the two series if ρ is close to 1 0 or 1 0 then there is a strong negative or positive correlation respectively between the series 2 4 ann an ann is a machine learning algorithm inspired by the functions and structures of biological neural networks hecht nielsen 1988 maier and dandy 1996 as an information system an ann has a powerful ability to identify nonlinear and densely interconnected neurons and to take them as hidden layers sudheer et al 2002 it is an efficient method of extracting the explicit relationship between input and output data therefore this artificial intelligence technique has been widely used in hydrology time series simulation and forecasting such as in precipitation prediction luk et al 2000 mislan et al 2015 reservoir operation coulibaly et al 2000 rainfall runoff analysis dounia et al 2014 hsu et al 1995 sajikumar and thandaveswara 1999 water quality parameter prediction maier and dandy 1996 and flood forecasting elsafi 2014 zhang et al 2018 a back propagation neural network bpnn developed by rumelhart et al 1986 is one type of ann kuo et al 2004 and is the most suitable for forecasting and regression applications the architecture of bpnn is simple and easy to implement and bpnns are closely related to statistical models lee 2004 in this study a three layer bpnn model was used to analyze the inflow time series the model consists of an input layer where the data are introduced into the model a hidden layer where the input and output data are connected by a transfer function and an output layer where the processed results of the given input data are produced the function f is used to connect the inputs to hidden neurons as shown in eq 6 6 h j f i 1 n w ij x i b j where hj is the j th neuron of the hidden layer n is the total number of inputs m is the number of neurons xi is the i th input wij is the weight assigned to xi to calculate the j th hidden neuron bj is the bias of j th hidden layer i 1 2 n and j 1 2 m similarly the outputs are connected to the hidden layer by function g as follows 7 o k g j 1 m v jk h j c k where ok is the k th result of the output layer vjk is the weight assigned to hi ck is the bias of the k th output layer l is the number of outputs j 1 2 m and k 1 2 l in this study the activation functions f and g were tangent sigmoid and linear functions respectively moreover the levenberg marquardt algorithm was used in the training model by adjusting the weight and bias hagan and menhaj 1994 2 5 svr support vector regression svr is developed on the support vector machine svm vapnik 1995 which is used to regression scheme liu et al 2014 generally svr and svm have the identical methodology but with a slight difference svm is one type of supervised classification technique which belongs to the linear classifier base on convex optimization vapnik 1999 svr is the method of projecting inputs to a high dimensional feature space by a linear function to simplify the classification task and training by an optimal hyperplane to split dataset by offset svr is dedicated to finding a regression function f x which could describe the relationship between the given inputs dataset x x 1 x 2 x n and target value y y 1 y 2 y n as follows 8 f x w φ x b where w and b are weight vector and offset factor respectively φ x is the nonlinear mapping function by transforming input vector into a high dimensional feature space maity et al 2010 the optimization and constrained form are defined by the following function vapnik 1995 9 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n ξ i ξ i subject to 10 y i w φ x b ε ξ i w φ x b y i ε ξ i ξ i 0 ξ i 0 i 1 n where c is a penalty coefficient which is a user defined regularization constant means influence the trade off between dispersion of weights and objective function the ξi and ξi are called the positive slack variables that are employed to measure the degree to which data exceed the tolerance error ɛ the optimization equation is a quadratic programming problem which can be estimated by a lagrangian multiplier and the regression function of svr as follows 11 f x i 1 n α i α i k x x i b where αi and αi are greater than 0 and called the lagrangian multipliers that satisfy αi αi 0 liu et al 2014 and k represents the kernel function and is used to change the dimensionality of the input space which is critical to performance of svr the commonly used kernel functions include the linear polynomial and radial basis function rbf as shown

lyx reservoir which was built in 1987 is the headwater reservoir for the yellow river bai et al 2015 the reservoir is located at 36 07 n and 107 47 e with dam crest altitude 2610 m above mean sea level located in the town of gonghe qinghai province the province is in the east of the qinghai tibet plateau lyx is 1684 km from the source of the upper yellow river and 3376 km from the mouth of the lower yellow river as shown in fig 2 the first large cascade reservoir serves as the main source of water for the yellow river and has an annual mean inflow of 650 m3 s accounting for 35 of the inflow for the entire yellow river watershed and 42 of the water discharge to the sea fu et al 2004 yan et al 2009 its annual runoff mainly comes from the flood season may october comprising 60 of the total runoff and the rest from the non flood season november april zhang et al 2008 the total storage capacity of lyx is 24 7 108 m3 and corresponds to a water level is 2607 m storage water is primarily employed for hydropower generation it also has comprehensive benefits of flood control irrigation ice control aquaculture and tourism the monthly streamflow which is the inflow data of the lyx reservoir covers the period of january 1956 december 2016 732 months and was retrieved from the bureau of hydrology yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources 3 2 climate phenomenon indices there are 130 climate phenomenon indices 88 ac indices 26 sea surface temperature sst indices and 16 other indices that serve as optional indices describing the inflow for analyzing lyx their monthly values were obtained from the national climate center of the china meteorological administration http cmdp ncc cma net monitoring cn index 130 php the datasets have been updated continually from at least the 1950s to the present and the selected temporal coverage corresponds with the hydrological time series from 1956 to 2016 appendix a lists detailed information about these indices including the definitions of the abbreviations employed in this paper generally these climate phenomenon indices are associated with the atmosphere climate sst etc 3 3 model inputs and parameter settings the popular regression analysis methods employed for hydrological time series are autocorrelation and teleconnection the difference between autocorrelation and teleconnection regression methods is that in the inflow processing the inflow and climate phenomenon indices from the previous month are analyzed separately however the inflow is a comprehensive result of meteorological and hydrological processes hejazi and cai 2009 yang et al 2017 therefore the inflow and climate phenomenon indices from the previous month were taken as candidate factors to analyze the correlation with the inflow and to enhance the model performance in addition to physical characteristics the hydrological series also contain temporal information and the different lag times should be considered when representing the inflow characteristics in this study lag times from 1 to 12 time steps months were considered the model inputs consider past inflow and 130 monthly climate phenomenon indices with 1 12 month lags accordingly 131 12 model inputs were included in the regression model in the eemd model nr was set to 100 the maximum number of sifting iterations was set to 500 and the amplitude of white noise was set to 0 2 times the standard deviation of the sample data these settings are similar to those employed by wu and huang 2009 a unique ann and svr model was developed for each decomposed sub series each month therefore c 15 5 n i 12 ann models were needed where n i is the number of decomposed sub series of the i th month to save time the parameters of ann and svr were assumed to be the same for the sub series seasons and inputs in the ann the number of hidden neurons was determined by trial and error which was selected to be nine through the simulation experiments of svr which set linear polynomial and rbf kernel functions with several different parameters penalty coefficients and gamma it was determined that the ideal fit was when the kernel function was rfb with 500 and 0 1 as the penalty coefficient and gamma respectively 3 4 establishment and verification of regression models the establishment of the regression models were based on the selected strong correlation indictors which can not violate the physical significance of hydrological meteorological teleconnection it is worth mentioning that the final regression factors were selected by randomly choosing five indices from the top 15 and the group of indices with the smallest square root error was identified this method was employed to avoid incomplete consideration of signal factors ann and svr models take 1956 2004 as the training period and the data from 2005 to 2016 were used for testing to quantify the regression performances of the different models a taylor diagram taylor 2001 and three mathematical measures were selected the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and relative error re he et al 2017 which can be computed using eqs 13 14 and 15 respectively the taylor diagram is a visual framework which provides a reference for comparing model results and observations it is useful for evaluating complex models with different parameter sets or the relative skill of different models model performance is quantified in terms of a correlation coefficient standard deviation and centered root mean square error the nse indicates the relative magnitude of residual variance and observation data variance the kge is an enhanced statistical measure of the nse which avoids some of the limitations of nse the re is valuable for estimating over or under regression i e bias and contributes to performance analysis the closer nse and kge are to 1 and the closer re is to 0 indicates less bias and a better fit according to previous investigations the model performance be considered satisfactory when nse 0 5 kge 0 5 and re 0 2 13 nse 1 i 1 n q ori i q reg i 2 i 1 n q ori i q ori a v e 2 14 kge 1 1 r 2 1 σ r σ o 2 1 μ r μ o 2 15 re 1 n i 1 n q ori i q reg i q ori i 100 where qori i and qreg i represent the original and regression inflow series respectively during the i th year for january december qori ave and qreg ave are the means of the original and regression values respectively and n is the total number of original observations as well as the number of years r is called the linear correlation coefficient between simulated and observed value σ r and μ r are mean and standard deviations of regressed value respectively and σ o μ o are mean and standard deviations of the original observed values respectively 4 results and discussion to analyze the characteristics of the teleconnection information relative to the monthly inflow of lyx the 732 month inflow series was divided into 12 sub series with one sub series corresponding to each month from january to december since the time lag is considered to be 12 months the data of the first year 1956 are used as the time lag factor and the months sequence of 1957 2016 are used as the regression sequence 4 1 eemd results eemd was employed to decompose the integrated 12 monthly inflow time series into five independent levels namely imf1 imf4 and one residue level with different frequencies and amplitudes these components were ordered from highest to lowest frequency imf1 to imf4 are also became more regular and stable and among the lowest frequencies the residue level was the slowest change trend of the original time series due to space constraints only the decomposition results corresponding to the high and low water periods september and april respectively are presented in fig 3 as fig 3 shows the frequencies of the decomposed series decreases gradually with obvious periodic processes see fig 3 providing cleaner inputs for the regression model the inflow series for april in fig 3 a shows different characteristic cycles the amplitude and fluctuation range of imf1 are the largest of all the decomposed series for imf1 the amplitude fluctuated greatly in the 1960s and slowed down from the 1970s to the 1980s then began to fluctuate again in the late 1980s until the beginning of the 21st century imf2 has a more obvious six year cycle its fluctuation is more intense in the 1970s 1980s and the rest of the time period changes more smoothly there is a 20 year period in imf3 before the 1960s the change of imf3 was stable and the fluctuation was relatively small fluctuations intensified after the 1960s and continued into the 21st century imf4 is characterized over a periodic period of 30 years the fluctuation amplitude was stable before the 1970s and then increased substantially the trends reveal that the inflow increased from 1956 to 1979 and then declined in the following decades in the decomposed series for september fig 3 b there are obvious periodic variations with 3 year 5 6 year 13 15 year and 25 year periods and a downward trend is evident for all 60 years in the high frequency series imf1 imf3 the changes are stable and the fluctuations are small after the 1990s because the length of the time series is limited there is no obvious periodic component in the trend term runoff data from a longer period of time is needed to study the change characteristics of the time scale the remaining 10 months have similar periodic rules with an increase of order the amplitude of imf components decreases and the wavelength increases which indicates that the lyx inflow series contains multiple time scales with different characteristics the result is similar the pekárová et al 2003 study which analyzed the runoff oscillation of main rivers of the world during 19th 20th centuries bourrel et al 2015 found ei nino has periodic variations of 3 5 and 4 8 years whether ei nino is strong or weak it will cause global atmospheric circulation and weather and climate anomalies the fluctuation period of high frequency series are consistent with the periodic variation of ei nino phenomena which indicates that ei nino phenomena are closely related to the variation of lyx inflow runoff williams 1961 investigated 11 year hale cycles which are the most frequently studied cycles related to runoff variability and are considered to be the main cycles affecting the nature and causes of cyclical changes in hydrological conditions of the world according to the 12 trend components the inflow of lyx decreased gradually over the most recent 40 years 1978 2016 which are consistent with the trend of actual runoff situation 4 2 correlations between related factors and original decomposed components the correlation coefficients of the input variables climate phenomenon indices and previous inflow with 1 12 month lags and object time series original and decomposed series were estimated by cross correlation analysis the correlation coefficients of the strongest cross correlation indices of the original and decomposed series the ones with the greatest correlations are shown in table 1 due to length limitations only a few significant indices are presented the absolute value of the correlation coefficient was used to represent the magnitude of the correlation where the closer the value is to 1 the stronger the correlation is and values close to 0 indicate that there is no correlation table 1 demonstrates that most of the input series have greater correlations with the decomposed inflow series than the original series except the past inflow series itself the previous inflow is highly correlated with the original inflow series with an average correlation coefficient of 0 70 besides the factors of the previous inflow a few individual indices perform slightly better in describing the original inflow information such as emi in february june and november wptw in february and tsa tpr1 and tpr2 in april the maximum minimum and average correlation coefficients between the sub inflow series and climate phenomenon indices are 0 89 0 22 and 0 50 respectively which are all considerably greater than those between the original sequences and relevant indices 0 48 0 06 and 0 22 respectively for the same index the correlation of any of the sub series is at most 0 77 more than that of the original series and the correlation of the original series is at most only 0 07 more than that of any of the sub series in summary three conclusions can be drawn 1 similar to the original series the previous inflow series contains a variety of information due to complex physical factors and mechanisms therefore the correlation between the past inflow and original runoff is relatively high 2 in the sub signal sequence the meteorological factors have strong abilities to express the inflow information and high correlations with the hydrological time series the original signal is influenced by various meteorological factors so the meteorological factors related to the influence on the hydrology series can be extracted by decomposing the inflow original series via eemd 3 the signal expression has a hysteretic effect different meteorological factors have different lag times in the process of ac and water vapor migration transformation 4 3 signals of climate phenomenon indices teleconnection analysis mainly addresses the effects of meteorological indices on hydrological elements on a two dimensional scale of time and space it is necessary to analyze the effects of different physical indices and their time lags on the decomposed streamflow series figs 4 and 5 are correlation graphs of the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between the model input variables and the sub inflow series for april and september where the x and y axes correspond to the 15 indices with the highest correlations and 1 12 month lag times in figs 4 and 5 the redder the color the stronger the representativeness of the factors while bluer colors indicate factors that are less related to the sub inflow series according to fig 4 a qbo with a 1 month lag and tna with a 2 month lag are significantly correlated with the high frequency imf1 series in april the correlation coefficients of apvi with an 8 month lag and the inflow with a 12 month lag are the highest reaching 0 37 and 0 34 for imf2 and imf3 respectively in april as shown in fig 4 b and 4 c for the low frequency series imf4 the previous inflow is the most relevant factor shown in fig 4 d amo plays a decisive role in the inflow trend in april shown in fig 4 f in fig 5 a cptw is the significant index for imf1 in september for imf2 in september napva with a 3 month lag is the most relevant as shown in fig 5 b besides the inflow with a 12 month lag time the amm series also affects imf3 in september in fig 5 d amo has an impact on the low frequency series imf4 in september for several months many ac indices are highly correlated with the trend term of the september runoff however the sst indices iop and wpwps are not only correlated with the trend but also have continuous impacts on the series throughout the year fig 5 f considering the different indices and their lag times the variables most closely related to the original and decomposed monthly inflow series were selected as shown in table 2 the original inflow series has strong autocorrelations within a single time step for the decomposed inflow series the previous inflow series with time lags of 1 and 12 months both have strong correlations with some subsequences the inflow from the previous month has a strong autocorrelation with the current inflow the 12 month delay is the effect of the previous year on the current inflow which is a seasonal long term effect related to ac according to the correlation the most relevant index was defined to verify the representativeness of the variables the selected indices were compared with the corresponding decomposed series april and september as depicted in fig 6 the results show that these indices are consistent with the periodicity of the corresponding imf1 imf4 components the residues represent the long term trends which appear as fluctuations a rise followed by a fall in april and a steady downward trend over the entire period which are similar to the general tendencies of amo 6 month lag and nfsa 1 month lag respectively for april qbo 1 and amo 6 are negatively correlated with imf1 and the residue for september amo 9 and ngsa 1 are negatively correlated with imf4 and the residue and the other indices for these two months are positively correlated these results demonstrate that the method of selecting relevant factors is reliable and further confirm that the hydro meteorological teleconnection is basically valid as mentioned above the climate phenomenon indices have strong correlations with the decomposed series due to their similar physical meanings from figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that the correlation coefficients of some climate phenomenon indices are not the highest but the 12 variables of the indices with 1 12 month lags have significant effects on the decomposition series inspection of the results in table 3 the top three climate phenomenon indices in terms of the mean absolute values of the correlations with the different decomposed components reveals some important characteristics the highest frequency components in imf1 are sensitive to the enso phenomenon with the related indices including nino 3 4 nino 4 and wei followed by ac and other indices qbo nao tpr etc especially from september to march in half of each year december march and june august imf2 is controlled by nino 4 wei and emi which are sst indices whwp sst and mpzw ac are meaningful for april and may for september and october imf2 is also greatly affected by nino 3 4 in addition to nino 4 and wei for the mid frequency component the extended index is dominant sfi and tsn have substantial effects on the mid frequency component imf3 of the series from january to july for august and december pdo and soi are important in addition the component of the series for each month has its own individual indices the correlation indices of the low frequency series imf4 are relatively diverse april november and december have common decisive indices nfsa nfsi and ftmsi the components of the other months are mainly influenced by amo nat kcs nas pdo and so on which is consistent with gonzález et al 2017 notably there are high correlations with the trend items for example iob amo wpwps and eptw play significant roles in the trend terms iob represents the indian ocean basin wide variability mode which is characterized by basin wide warming or cooling amo indicates the basin scale oceanic phenomena with decadal variations in the north atlantic region which is an interdecadal sst variation it influences the hydro climatic variables of the area and provides information about the monthly streamflow trends wpwps and eptw are the western pacific warm pool strength index and east pacific 850mb trade wind index respectively which are closely related to the enso cycle process therefore the trend of the monthly series is determined by sst and enso lü et al 2010 summarized that nino indices and soi have stronger correlations with reservoir discharge in headwaters region of the yellow river yuan 2015 found that the source region of the hydrological condition of the yellow river positively related to nao wp and soi and inversely related to p ep in another study that investigated the california basin in the usa which is same type of semiarid region as yellow river yang et al 2017 identified that there were significant correlations between nino tni qbo and whwp and the inflow of trinity lake a similar conclusion was reached by wang et al 2006 that enso sst and soi are key indicators influencing the interannual and seasonal variation of the yellow river water discharge however previous studies have not shown that the impact of these indicators has any influence on the different periodic components of streamflow from table 2 it can be concluded that the non flood season is greatly affected by the previous streamflow especially previous streamflow in the same period compared with the non flood season the flood season is mainly affected by complex and diverse meteorological indices for high frequency series the non flood season is mainly influenced by nino 3 4 nino 4 wei and mei for the flood season nao tpr and qbo also have great influence on runoff for sub series with longer cycles there are many factors affecting flood season besides sei pdo soi tsn they are also related to amo nat tsa kcs and so on and for trend items the flood season and non flood season are similar 4 4 regression of monthly inflow the stateed results show that the meteorological teleconnection indices have strong abilities to express different periodic sub inflow time series therefore it is significant to analyze the regression results of the decomposed and original series using the representative characteristics of the climate phenomenon series and to verify the teleconnection between the hydrological and meteorological information the selected comprehensive regression indices for the monthly inflow series are shown in table 4 in this study ann and svr were employed to compare the regression performance before and after the decomposition of the inflow series of the lxy reservoir at the same time the use of the two methods avoids the influence of the method itself on the fitting effect as can be seen from table 4 the original inflow is mainly teleconnected with the previous inflow autocorrelation followed by wei and nino 4 the regression of the teleconnections of the decomposed signal series not only yields better performance but also provides a variety of physically meaningful information about streamflow for example amo and wpwps play significant roles in the trend term and emi tpr esi tsn and apva have considerable effects on the low frequency signals amo indicates basin scale oceanic phenomena with decadal variations in the north atlantic region which is an interdecadal variation of sst it influences the hydroclimatic variables for the area and provides information about the trend of monthly inflow wpwps stands for the western pacific warm pool strength index which is the intensity index of abnormal sst variations and is closely related to the enso cycle process emi and tsn are typical sst indices and apva tpr and esi are ac indices the calculated values of nse kge and re between the original series and inflow simulated using the ann svr eemd ann and eemd svr approaches are presented in table 5 the regression performance of the monthly and annual inflow series obtained using teleconnection information in these methods for the lyx reservoir are shown in fig 7 in table 5 the bold and underlined values indicate the best performance of the regression model for the independent and consecutive months from this table it can be concluded that except in may and september the eemd svr teleconnection regression model yielded the most satisfactory regression performance in comparison with the ann and single svr methods for the reservoir inflow series for may and september the svr teleconnection method is slightly better than the eemd svr method overall it is shown that the regression performance of the decomposed series is better than the original runoff regression and compared to svr model it has obtained more satisfactory results than ann in fig 7 the distance between each point and the origin indicats the performance of different models the same conclusion can be drawn from this figure as that from table 5 the evaluation of entirety consecutive month of different method are much better than the monthly evaluation and svr methods show more satisfactory results than ann furthermore both two ann methods produce better statistics during the non flood season than during the flood season but there is little difference between the svr methods according to figs 8 and 9 the eemd ann and eemd svr teleconnection method have a stronger ability to simulate the fluctuations and to obtain the peak and valley values of the inflow series accurately this conclusion is consistent with the study of tan et al 2018 and wu et al 2010 which showed that the decomposition forecast ensemble method has better performance in the regression and forecast of hydrological series furthermore based on these results this study explored the physical indices related to streamflow 5 conclusion in this study climate phenomenon indices as well as lagged information were identified as effective indicators of the monthly inflow of the lyx reservoir in the yellow river basin using approximately 60 years of historical records eemd cross correlation ann and svr were employed for data processing correlation analysis and regression verification respectively the results show that more physical information related to hydrology could be obtained by teleconnection analysis of the data processed by eemd most of the climate indices were more closely correlated with the decomposed series than with the original inflow the selected relevant indices could reasonably be used to interpret the periodic oscillations and long term trends in the monthly inflow of lyx the examined eemd ann and eemd svr regression model exhibited better performance than ann and svr regression model alone especially eemd svr it is expected that the series decomposed by eemd can help decision makers understand the implications of climate phenomena on streamflow and provide operators with more flexibility to add desired decision variables according to the results of this study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the monthly inflow series could be decomposed into a finite number of sub series with different frequencies by eemd by utilizing these decomposed components with inherent cycles it was possible to identify oscillatory patterns and the long term trends of the monthly streamflow the climate phenomenon indices had the greatest correlations with the residue trend term followed by the low frequency series imf4 2 the climate phenomenon indices were more significant for the decomposed components than for the original inflow series the average correlation coefficient between the climate phenomenon indices and sub inflow series was 0 3 greater than that between the climate factors and original flow the sub series could be expressed by the nature and time lags of these indices 3 the inflow with a 1 month lag was the most relevant explanatory variable for the original inflow series whose correlation was an autocorrelation however for the decomposed series the previous inflow affected only a few components and was not the decisive variable the inflow from the previous month was mainly related to the high frequency component and the inflow from the previous year was associated with the low frequency component which was influenced by ac 4 the periodic oscillations were explained by relatively diverse ac and sst indices with different time lags the low frequency periodic series were better represented than the high frequency series by the climate phenomenon indices the el nino indices including nino 3 4 nino 4 and emi were significant for the high frequency component the sst indices such as iob amo wpwps and eptw were representative of the long term trend of monthly streamflow 5 the eemd is benefit to teleconnection model for streamflow regression but also could identify more reasonable and relevant physical indices moreover eemd svr can significantly improve regression performance than ann and single svr models for the ann method as the fitted model underestimated the large peak flows during the flood season may october the regression performance was better during the non flood season than during the flood season november to the next april for the inflow of the lyx reservoir however the identified indices were suitable for fitting the general periodic oscillations and monthly inflow variations the decomposition based teleconnection method in this study is novel in that it incorporates large scale meteorological and climatic information with regional hydrological processes to assess the physical interactions between climatic phenomena and streamflow however regression models are not limited to ann and svr methods but can be customized according to the characteristics of watershed and the applicability of regression methods secondly this study is limited by the time scale of meteorological data and could only analyze the physical impact factors of monthly scale streamflow if the time scale of the data is appropriate the physical mechanism of short term streamflow can be analyzed thirdly the cross correlation method employed in this study is not suitable for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary natural series in future research it will be necessary to consider using a nonlinear analysis method such as one utilizing mutual information to overcome the limitations of the linear correlation method in addition the nonstationarity of climate phenomenon should be taken into consideration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
