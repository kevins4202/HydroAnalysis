8830,to trial the concept of in plant real time manufacturing water content characterisation a commercial optical system for measuring light absorption and backscatter intensity was used with samples of food industry wastewater and the results compared with conventional laboratory based water analysis it is shown that the instrumentation is capable of coping with the range of turbidities presented by the wastewater and that there is some correlation between the absorption and backscatter measurements with the conventional parameters cod and tss it is suggested that combining backscatter and absorption data may provide an optical fingerprint of effluent that can be used as a management parameter for example to identify unexpected contamination events potential uses of the instrumentation are discussed including to provide rapid feedback on effects of system changes on effluent production and in a feedback control loop to allow reuse of water without compromising product safety keywords industrial water sustainability food industry water quality in line instrumentation turbidity optical fingerprint 1 introduction the pressure on fresh water availability for human use is exacerbated by the changing climate and increasing population particularly where this results in a mismatch between water demand and availability on a local scale this is because water is not easily transportable in large volume and unlike energy there are no sustainable large scale new sources for example the energy cost of distillation of saline water is prohibitively high at 2 4 kwh per cubic metre 23 in high income countries industry is the majority user of limited water supplies see fig 1 11 as the economies of mid to low income countries develop this pattern is likely to be reproduced thus with significant growth in global manufacturing activities manufacturing water consumption is set to increase by a factor of more than 5 by 2050 over a year 2000 baseline from 245 to 1552 billion m3 20 and it has been estimated that global demand for fresh water by 2030 will be 40 above current water supplies 1 therefore the lack of freshwater supply is predicated to act as a restriction on sustainable economic development and improvement in living standards simultaneously disposal of industrial wastewater is becoming increasingly costly due to tightened legislation for example the european directives on a european water policy framework 9 and on integrated pollution prevention and control 10 against this background use of water has become an important part of commercial sustainability strategies along with use of energy and materials water management measures were classified by puigjaner et al 2000 21 into reactive which they termed specific actions and proactive which they termed general methodologies low risk low cost reactive measures involving little change to process or product are generally the first port of call for manufacturing companies seeking to improve their water profile examples include automatic taps in employee facilities use of grey water hygiene processes such as vehicle washing and detection and reduction of leaks however proactive measures involving more fundamental changes are essential for long term gains see for example seneviratne 26 more generally a radical approach to resource management in industry and society will be required to achieve long term sustainable economic development 22 proactive measures include process redesign product redesign and process substitution examples include air cleaning instead of water cleaning re use of water with single unit processes with and without treatment or recycling of water effluent from one process as input to another process with and without treatment because such proactive measures may have longer payback periods and are more costly analysis and decision support tools are required to target areas for intervention and manage the investment risk in previous work it was identified that a fundamental barrier to achieving a long term and sustained water reduction and efficiency programme is lack of transparency on water use and waste management within manufacturing plants 24 this has two aspects lack of enterprise level engineering understanding of how and why water is used in processes and lack of numerical data on actual water use and wastewater production the lack of data is due to the historical view of water as an inexpensive resource to be drawn down and discarded as required the ability to visualize utility usage within manufacturing facilities is at a more advanced stage for energy than for water this capability for energy has allowed the development of concepts of efficiency of energy use by various researchers 15 27 31 8 the efficiency concept is used to help prioritise energy using processes areas of plant and ideas in energy reduction initiatives and hence promote improvements in industrial sustainability to apply a similar approach to water the added complexity must be dealt with that while energy usage can be described by a single parameter i e joules water is described not only by volume but by content i e the identity and concentrations of dissolved or suspended species both at input and at output thus the concept of efficiency of use for water must take into account input water quality and contaminants introduced into the water flow by manufacturing process steps 24 25 and measurements of both water flow volumes and water content are required in this work we have concentrated on process water quality characterisation because this the more significant gap in current capability by contrast there are a number of off the shelf products available for automated volume monitoring 2 this paper deals with initial steps towards the development of in line instrumentation for continuous monitoring of water content within a manufacturing plant and hence determination of the effects of individual process steps on individual flows the requirement for a continuous data stream arises from the need to capture the time variations in water content related to the batch nature of production and varying manufacturing schedules the requirement to resolve the effects of individual process steps arises from the need to identify opportunities for structural changes to the manufacturing process chain to improve water usage efficiency note that the potential of continuous monitoring of wastewater outside factories for example for the management of wastewater treatment plants has been recognised in the literature 19 5 a major issue is in defining what the instrumentation should measure in addressing this question we first briefly outline some of the parameters most commonly measured when talking about industrial water content and then the sensor principles available for in line characterisation we then propose repurposing equipment that is already in use for process monitoring in food for wastewater monitoring the novelty of this approach lies not only in the application i e wastewater monitoring but also in combining simultaneous measurements from different sensors next we present the results of a trial consisting of application of a prototype set of instrumentation to process water samples taken from a food manufacturing plant finally we discuss the trial results and the implications for further development of the concept of in plant real time manufacturing water content characterisation including specific applications 2 factors determining choice of instrumentation 2 1 water content monitoring applications we briefly review here some water content monitoring applications for drinking water quality assurance or environmental monitoring of water courses wetted sensors are generally used the most common measurands are driven by legislative or administrative limits on water quality for example for drinking water typically measurements are required of free chlorine total chlorine temperature ph oxidation reduction potential orp specific conductivity dissolved oxygen do total organic carbon toc nitrogen nitrate nitrite and ammonia turbidity and particle counts 14 effluent content at plant outflow is not generally monitored in line to prove compliance with water company discharge consents a composite sampler may be employed this machine automatically withdraws samples from the outflow at programmed intervals with the sample being later analysed in a laboratory the major parameters of interest in the uk are chemical oxygen demand cod and suspended solids ss as these are used to determine the disposal costs 32 sensors are used for effluent plant control 30 for example to respond to variation in effluent strength and to ensure it falls within the designed operational parameters in the past lack of online monitoring capability has meant that plants were over specified in order to operate safely with only manual sampling to provide control feedback the increasingly availability of sensors offers the possibility for such plants to be operated adaptively and hence more efficiently turning to current applications within the process chain water content sensing is used in specific applications for process control an example is cleaning in place cip for food manufacturing where cleansing and sanitation agents and rinse water are flushed through processing vessels in some automated systems conductivity sensors are used to ensure that the concentrations of cleaning chemistry are correct and that the chemistry has been completely removed by rinsing 3 4 sensors in this application also have a role of improving resource efficiency by reducing consumption of water chemicals and energy and wastage of product 28 another application is detection of when product transitions have gone to completion in pipework for example in fruit juice processors or breweries 18 in both these cases the direct detection of endpoints as part of a control feedback loop improves resource usage efficiency over relying on predetermined protocols established during process setup a further water efficiency application is use of conductivity sensors for feedback control of blowdown intervals in cooling tower systems thus reducing the amount of top up water required 26 all these examples have in common that the choice of measurand s is driven by the specific application and the system created around the sensor is limited to that application the aim of the proposed instrumentation is to be more broad i e to support the management of water use within a factory this presents a challenge to identify appropriate measurands and associated instrumentation as the possible content of water can vary so widely 2 2 characteristics required of instrumentation the ideal set of instrumentation would have the following attributes be capable of continuous monitoring so as to capture process related changes in water content e g due to process parameter variation batch production and product changeovers be low cost to make use in multiple areas of a factory economically viable be sensitive to a wide range of contaminants to reduce the need to customise for specific applications be non or minimally invasive meaning that the instrumentation does not interfere with the flow of water or plant operations have low maintenance and associated staff training requirements maintenance factors to be considered are fouling and cleaning requirements calibration requirement and the use and replenishment of reagents insight into the required capability can be gained by referring to the categorisation formulated by callis et al 6 for process analytical instrumentation used in chemical engineering i e off line at line on line in line and non invasive off line and at line refers to highly capable laboratory instrumentation aimed at identifying and quantifying the chemical constituents of a mixture but requiring manual sampling with on line similar instruments are used but the sampling is automated whereas with in line no sampling is required as the sensitive element is a probe in direct contact with the process fluid flow finally non invasive refers to measurement techniques requiring no direct access to the fluid off line and at line can provide highly detailed data but suffer from the time delay between sampling and analysis making it difficult to capture variations in water content 5 on line automated sampling improves the response time but requires a separate fluid line and potentially complex sample pre conditioning with associated maintenance requirements the best matches to the required capability are therefore in line and non invasive the chemical analytical power of techniques fitting these categories is less than for off line and at line but the usefulness of the techniques for process control of production is greater thus we consider that for the present purpose the task of the instrumentation is not primarily to identify species but to indicate variation of contaminant concentrations with time it would also be useful to capture and flag up the presence of unexpected contaminants even if these are not immediately chemically identified 2 3 available sensor types in line sensing principles have been categorised as optical electrical electromagnetic and acoustic optical and electrical techniques provide the best fit to the characteristics in section 2 1 as these require no reagents and little maintenance optical sensors are not in direct contact with fluid although optical windows into process pipework are required optical path length considerations may require that the window elements protrude into the fluid flow space electrodes for conductivity measurement are in contact with fluid but can be made of the similar materials as the pipework i e stainless steel and designed to not protrude into the fluid flow an alternative is an inductive probe which does not have wetted electrodes but which requires the sensing element to protrude into the middle of the flow stream potential non invasive measurement techniques which do not require wetted elements are ultrasonics and electromagnetic and impedance sensing ultrasonic transducers have the advantage that they can be attached to the exterior of standard pipework but the interpretation of data is more complex than for other techniques for example ultrasound studies of colloids rely on theoretical models for relating particle properties such as the size distribution to the propagation of ultrasound through the fluid 13 some a priori knowledge of these properties is therefore generally required electromagnetic sensing does not yield useful information with all fluids and requires non metallic pipework using outputs from two or more sensors simultaneously is known as sensor fusion sensor fusion is not just about calculating the value of a desired property of the liquid from calibrated relationships but by including more sensors than the minimum number required non standard conditions such as sensor failure can be detected in the application under discussion the non standard condition of interest is a fluid with properties falling outside the expected range 12 3 prototype set of instrumentation the food industry was chosen as a first application for continuous monitoring of water content within a manufacturing plant food manufacturing is a major consumer of water for many different purposes including raw ingredient washing the flushing through cleaning and sterilisation of processing equipment cleaning and sterilisation of processing facilities cooking heating cooling and fluming 16 improving the efficiency of water use along with energy use was nominated by the uk food industry as one of the top ten pre competitive areas for research 29 in 2008 a large number of uk food manufacturing companies signed the federation house commitment committing them to reduce water consumption over a 2007 baseline by 20 by 2020 33 a prototype set of instrumentation consisting of commercial sensors already used in the food industry for process control was selected the optical sensor was a mettler toledo inpro 8300 rams unit capable of measuring transmitted and back scattered light 180 intensities for light emission from four differently coloured led sources red green blue and infra red turbidity values can be calculated if necessary by calibration with a formazin suspension for conductivity a four point probe with ss316l electrodes designed to fit flush to the pipe wall was included the probe includes a pt1000 thermometer finally a liquid electrolyte ph sensor was included this last requires regular calibration and so violates the low maintenance requirement but was included for its high temperature robustness a gel electrolyte version ph sensor could be substituted instead the sensors are capable of withstanding typical food industry corrosive cleaning in place conditions such as 1 4 wt naoh at 137 c for 50 min the capability of the instruments according to the manufacturers data sheets is summarised in table 1 although the instruments are already used for process control in the food industry the novelty of the current work is to combine the sensors and apply them for in plant effluent content characterisation and monitoring 4 trial of prototype instrumentation set 4 1 methodology in order to trial the concept of in plant real time manufacturing water content characterisation the prototype instrumentation set was tested with samples of food industry wastewater it was specifically not the purpose of the trial to take the approach of calibrating the sensor outputs to enable calculation of wastewater quality parameters but rather to identify whether different water types can be distinguished a test rig for the prototype set was constructed from food standard hygienic pipework connectors and a valve and takes the form of a column as shown in fig 2 wastewater samples were obtained from a manufacturing plant making frozen pre cooked filled and unfilled pastry products individual samples were taken from different areas of the plant during the weekly deep clean as listed in table 2 the deep clean takes place at the weekend after all production is stopped and involves partial disassembly and mostly manual washing of equipment and pipework using a sequence of fluids including caustic cleaners acid cleaners disinfectant and rinse steps floors are washed manually using hoses with automated dosing of chemical into the flow the samples were processed within 48 h of being obtained each sample was allowed to settle and then decanted into the test rig readings were taken and the equipment rinsed with de ionised water before the next sample was processed readings of de ionised water were used as a control and to ensure there was no measurement drift due to residue build up within the equipment simultaneously portions of the samples were passed to a commercial effluent analysis service to carry out conventional laboratory based analyses the protocols used by the service are described in method statements available from their website turbidity was066 colour was065 17 the parameters measured were cod and tss chosen because they determine the cost of wastewater disposal in the uk 32 4 2 results of trial and discussion the values of each measurement made on the samples are listed in table 2 scat nir scat r scat g and scat b are backscatter values and abs nir abs r abs g and abs b are absorption values all measured using the optical sensor on the test rig the values for turbidity cod tss conductivity cond and ph were measured by the commercial effluent analysis service the optical absorption and backscatter measurements are in arbitrary units such that a measurement on de ionised water corresponds to a value of zero and a value of one corresponds to the maximum signal output from the equipment the entries in the table are arranged in order of increasing turbidity it can be seen that sample 13 is anomalous as it exhibits a very high cod value but a low turbidity the cod content is probably the cleaning agent consistent with the highly alkaline ph value of 13 2 ph units compared to the range of 4 0 7 8 ph units exhibited by the other samples and high conductivity at 9 12 104 s cm compared to values on the order of 103 s cm for the other samples the data in the table is plotted in various ways in fig 3 in fig 3 a the back scattered light intensity for the four led colours are plotted on a logarithmic scale against turbidity measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu in general the backscatter signal increases roughly linearly with the log of turbidity and then saturates the saturation occurs at different turbidity values for the different led colours blue around 10 ntu green and red around 200 ntu infra red not saturated at highest turbidity seen the variation in behaviour with colour allows the equipment to probe fluids with turbidity ranging over three orders of magnitude the absorption signal variation with turbidity fig 3 b shows a different functional dependence to that of backscatter with no saturation behaviour although there is still a general rise in signal with increasing turbidity the difference between the graphs is an indication that there is information to be gleaned from comparison of the backscatter and absorption signals this point is further illustrated by comparing graphs of backscatter and absorption versus tss figs 3 c and 3 d the backscatter plot again shows saturation behaviour while the absorption trend is more complex plots against cod show similar behaviour not shown the difference in behaviour between plots is probably because the backscatter signal is more sensitive to suspended matter than the absorption signal in the light of these results we discuss how such general purpose instrumentation could be used for both reduction and active management of water and effluent with reference to fig 4 illustrating three potential system configurations fig 4 a shows characterisation of variation in water effluent production of an individual manufacturing process step for different operational conditions for example product mix and sequencing batch sizes and machine operation parameters the diagram shows two process steps numbered i and i 1 water quality is monitored using sensors at both the inlets and outlets allowing the contribution of each process step to effluent water content to be characterised the data obtained can then be used for process or system redesign to improve water sustainability as illustrated in the diagram by connection of the sensors to an industrial network and a computer running system analysis and optimisation software the inline nature of the instrumentation would allow taking a trial and error approach with instant feedback on the effects of changes the instrumentation could be permanently installed or used only for optimisation of a facility and then removed by contrast an active management use requiring permanent installation of the instrumentation is shown in fig 4 b in this case the water quality is assessed only on the outlet side of a process software then decides whether the water can be reused as an input to another process or should be rejected and subsequently operates a valve to direct the wastewater stream appropriately data and control signals are passed over an industrial network the software could run on a computer connected to the industrial network or as embedded software in an industrial controller neither shown on the diagram in fig 4 c the instrumentation takes a similar role on the input side of a process to ensure that water input from an alternative source to potable town water is of acceptable quality again software processes the data and if water quality falls below a required threshold operates a valve to cut off the supply and illuminates a warning light to alert production staff to the issue in this case the instrumentation acts as a safeguard to ameliorate the risk to production of using a variable quality water source in fact variability in quality is a barrier to wastewater re use particularly in food manufacturing 16 7 such variability can arise from variation in raw material streams to manufacturing for example fresh produce or from process factors such as personnel non compliance with procedures active management of water as in figs 4 b and c can therefore promote both water sustainability and food safety for operation in the applications in fig 4 b and c detection of a change in the character of the water stream is the desired capability a possible approach to this is presented in fig 5 this shows how an optical fingerprint for each fluid can be defined by plotting the scatter signal against the absorption signal at each colour in this plot sample 2 is not obviously anomalous however further work may show that the combination of a large range in scatter signal over the colour spectrum combined with a small range in absorption is characteristic of for example the middle part of a cleaning regime a possible limitation to this formulation of an optical fingerprint is saturation in the backscatter signal as can be seen in fig 3 a the backscatter signal appears to be saturated i e there is no variation with turbidity for turbidity over most of the range sampled i e 10 ntu this means that the fingerprints for all the samples in the saturation regime would be distorted at least in the blue to investigate this effect follow up work to that reported here is concentrating on exploring the signal state space through controlled variation of the content of samples of industrial effluents using dilution and filtering 5 conclusions lack of data on water flows and water quality within factories is a major barrier to radical progress in improving industrial water sustainability while water volume data can be obtained by installing sub metering water quality data is much more difficult to obtain and instrumentation dedicated to this application is not available we have argued that instrumentation to provide such data should be of in line type i e where no sampling is required in order to provide continuous monitoring capability while presenting minimum interference with factory water flows we have also identified that optical and electrical sensor principles are the most suited to providing the required capability while the proposed instrumentation would not provide chemical specificity we consider that the actual task of the instrumentation is to be sensitive to variation of contaminant concentrations in real time as a trial of this concept we have carried out measurements using a commercial optical system with samples of food industry wastewater absorbance and backscatter intensity results were compared with conventional laboratory based water analysis the instrumentation was shown to be capable of coping with the range of turbidities presented by the wastewater and also that there is some correlation between the absorption and backscatter measurements with the conventional parameters cod and tss we have suggested that combining backscatter and absorption data may provide an optical fingerprint of effluent that can be used as a management parameter for example to identify unexpected contamination events this idea is the subject of follow up work exploring the signal state space with further industrial samples potential uses of the instrumentation has been discussed including providing rapid feedback on effectiveness of system changes to reduce effluent production and in a feedback control loop to allow reuse of effluent water without compromising product safety acknowledgements this work was part funded by the engineering and physical sciences research council

and a valve and takes the form of a column as shown in fig 2 wastewater samples were obtained from a manufacturing plant making frozen pre cooked filled and unfilled pastry products individual samples were taken from different areas of the plant during the weekly deep clean as listed in table 2 the deep clean takes place at the weekend after all production is stopped and involves partial disassembly and mostly manual washing of equipment and pipework using a sequence of fluids including caustic cleaners acid cleaners disinfectant and rinse steps floors are washed manually using hoses with automated dosing of chemical into the flow the samples were processed within 48 h of being obtained each sample was allowed to settle and then decanted into the test rig readings were taken and the equipment rinsed with de ionised water before the next sample was processed readings of de ionised water were used as a control and to ensure there was no measurement drift due to residue build up within the equipment simultaneously portions of the samples were passed to a commercial effluent analysis service to carry out conventional laboratory based analyses the protocols used by the service are described in method statements available from their website turbidity was066 colour was065 17 the parameters measured were cod and tss chosen because they determine the cost of wastewater disposal in the uk 32 4 2 results of trial and discussion the values of each measurement made on the samples are listed in table 2 scat nir scat r scat g and scat b are backscatter values and abs nir abs r abs g and abs b are absorption values all measured using the optical sensor on the test rig the values for turbidity cod tss conductivity cond and ph were measured by the commercial effluent analysis service the optical absorption and backscatter measurements are in arbitrary units such that a measurement on de ionised water corresponds to a value of zero and a value of one corresponds to the maximum signal output from the equipment the entries in the table are arranged in order of increasing turbidity it can be seen that sample 13 is anomalous as it exhibits a very high cod value but a low turbidity the cod content is probably the cleaning agent consistent with the highly alkaline ph value of 13 2 ph units compared to the range of 4 0 7 8 ph units exhibited by the other samples and high conductivity at 9 12 104 s cm compared to values on the order of 103 s cm for the other samples the data in the table is plotted in various ways in fig 3 in fig 3 a the back scattered light intensity for the four led colours are plotted on a logarithmic scale against turbidity measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu in general the backscatter signal increases roughly linearly with the log of turbidity and then saturates the saturation occurs at different turbidity values for the different led colours blue around 10 ntu green and red around 200 ntu infra red not saturated at highest turbidity seen the variation in behaviour with colour allows the equipment to probe fluids with turbidity ranging over three orders of magnitude the absorption signal variation with turbidity fig 3 b shows a different functional dependence to that of backscatter with no saturation behaviour although there is still a general rise in signal with increasing turbidity the difference between the graphs is an indication that there is information to be gleaned from comparison of the backscatter and absorption signals this point is further illustrated by comparing graphs of backscatter and absorption versus tss figs 3 c and 3 d the backscatter plot again shows saturation behaviour while the absorption trend is more complex plots against cod show similar behaviour not shown the difference in behaviour between plots is probably because the backscatter signal is more sensitive to suspended matter than the absorption signal in the light of these results we discuss how such general purpose instrumentation could be used for both reduction and active management of water and effluent with reference to fig 4 illustrating three potential system configurations fig 4 a shows characterisation of variation in water effluent production of an individual manufacturing process step for different operational conditions for example product mix and sequencing batch sizes and machine operation parameters the diagram shows two process steps numbered i and i 1 water quality is monitored using sensors at both the inlets and outlets allowing the contribution of each process step to effluent water content to be characterised the data obtained can then be used for process or system redesign to improve water sustainability as illustrated in the diagram by connection of the sensors to an industrial network and a computer running system analysis and optimisation software the inline nature of the instrumentation would allow taking a trial and error approach with instant feedback on the effects of changes the instrumentation could be permanently installed or used only for optimisation of a facility and then removed by contrast an active management use requiring permanent installation of the instrumentation is shown in fig 4 b in this case the water quality is assessed only on the outlet side of a process software then decides whether the water can be reused as an input to another process or should be rejected and subsequently operates a valve to direct the wastewater stream appropriately data and control signals are passed over an industrial network the software could run on a computer connected to the industrial network or as embedded software in an industrial controller neither shown on the diagram in fig 4 c the instrumentation takes a similar role on the input side of a process to ensure that water input from an alternative source to potable town water is of acceptable quality again software processes the data and if water quality falls below a required threshold operates a valve to cut off the supply and illuminates a warning light to alert production staff to the issue in this case the instrumentation acts as a safeguard to ameliorate the risk to production of using a variable quality water source in fact variability in quality is a barrier to wastewater re use particularly in food manufacturing 16 7 such variability can arise from variation in raw material streams to manufacturing for example fresh produce or from process factors such as personnel non compliance with procedures active management of water as in figs 4 b and c can therefore promote both water sustainability and food safety for operation in the applications in fig 4 b and c detection of a change in the character of the water stream is the desired capability a possible approach to this is presented in fig 5 this shows how an optical fingerprint for each fluid can be defined by plotting the scatter signal against the absorption signal at each colour in this plot sample 2 is not obviously anomalous however further work may show that the combination of a large range in scatter signal over the colour spectrum combined with a small range in absorption is characteristic of for example the middle part of a cleaning regime a possible limitation to this formulation of an optical fingerprint is saturation in the backscatter signal as can be seen in fig 3 a the backscatter signal appears to be saturated i e there is no variation with turbidity for turbidity over most of the range sampled i e 10 ntu this means that the fingerprints for all the samples in the saturation regime would be distorted at least in the blue to investigate this effect follow up work to that reported here is concentrating on exploring the signal state space through controlled variation of the content of samples of industrial effluents using dilution and filtering 5 conclusions lack of data on water flows and water quality within factories is a major barrier to radical progress in improving industrial water sustainability while water volume data can be obtained by installing sub metering water quality data is much more difficult to obtain and instrumentation dedicated to this application is not available we have argued that instrumentation to provide such data should be of in line type i e where no sampling is required in order to provide continuous monitoring capability while presenting minimum interference with factory water flows we have also identified that optical and electrical sensor principles are the most suited to providing the required capability while the proposed instrumentation would not provide chemical specificity we consider that the actual task of the instrumentation is to be sensitive to variation of contaminant concentrations in real time as a trial of this concept we have carried out measurements using a commercial optical system with samples of food industry wastewater absorbance and backscatter intensity results were compared with conventional laboratory based water analysis the instrumentation was shown to be capable of coping with the range of turbidities presented by the wastewater and also that there is some correlation between the absorption and backscatter measurements with the conventional parameters cod and tss we have suggested that combining backscatter and absorption data may provide an optical fingerprint of effluent that can be used as a management parameter for example to identify unexpected contamination events this idea is the subject of follow up work exploring the signal state space with further industrial samples potential uses of the instrumentation has been discussed including providing rapid feedback on effectiveness of system changes to reduce effluent production and in a feedback control loop to allow reuse of effluent water without compromising product safety acknowledgements this work was part funded by the engineering and physical sciences research council

8831,we obtained dye decolorizing bacteria from the hands of ordinary people with an efficiency of approximately 40 the bacteria were classified into the azo dye decolorizing group and anthraquinone dye decolorizing group the former were capable of decolorizing real textile wastewater whereas the latter could achieve only partial decolorization these bacterial strains can potentially be applied to assess the major types of dyes in textile wastewater and dye polluted rivers the azo dye decolorizing bacterial strain degraded congo red into its intermediates and then further degraded phenyl compounds interestingly the azo dye decolorizing bacterial strain produced a significant amount of protein 20 60 mg l 1 which correlated with the dye decolorization rate we further identified cell density as the main factor affecting stabilization of the dye decolorization reaction in summary human hands are a readily accessible source from which to collect dye decolorizing bacteria that can be used to treat textile wastewater and to remediate environmental pollution sites graphical abstract fx1 keywords human skin bacteria human hands decolorization azo dye anthraquinone dye textile wastewater 1 introduction the wastewater produced by the textile and dyeing industries is a global source of water pollution 1 2 dye contaminants in wastewater are recalcitrant and remain in treated water after conventional biological wastewater treatment not surprisingly the effluent of the wastewater treatment process is generally strongly colored with residual dyes 3 besides their color some dyes and their degradation products are known to be carcinogenic 4 5 our previous study revealed that it took three years or more for textile dyes to be degraded in a river sediment after wastewater discharge from a dyehouse was terminated 2 therefore decolorization of dye containing wastewater is a necessary measure to lessen the impact on water environments biological dye decolorization treatment represents a promising technology which is inexpensive and produces less sludge than conventional coagulation flocculation 6 7 although many bacteria are able to decolorize dyes suitable strains for industrial applications need to be obtained many studies have described dye decolorizing bacteria reviewed in imran et al 8 and singh et al 9 and their isolation mostly from sludge discharged by textile wastewater treatment plants and textile effluent contaminated soils 10 18 as well as lake mud and sludge from sewage treatment plants and petrochemical industrial wastewater treatment plants 19 21 moreover some bacteria inhabiting human skin have also been reported to metabolize azo dyes 22 24 human skin is an easily accessible and safer site from which to isolate bacteria than soil sludge or wastewater moreover commensal bacteria on human skin are also much easier to cultivate targeting people with a diverse background occupation and age may yield dye decolorizing bacteria that are effective for textile wastewater treatment however no study so far has looked into the ability of human skin bacteria to decolorize dyes the present study focused on human hands as the most accessible site for collecting dye decolorizing bacteria we investigated the characteristics of such bacteria including specificity to a type of dye and real textile wastewater as well as their phylogeny based on the 16s rrna gene sequence results indicate that the dye decolorization rate correlated with dye concentration cell density and protein production by the most efficient bacteria these findings provide an insight into the availability and applicability of bacteria found on human hands for textile dye decolorization 2 material and methods 2 1 bacteria and dyes bacteria were collected from nine high school students each student touched two luria bertani lb agar plates by pressing all their fingertips the agar plates were incubated at room temperature 25 c for several days a total of 45 bacterial colonies were randomly selected from the incubated agar plates individually transferred onto new plates and stored in a refrigerator until further use three azo dyes congo red acid red 114 and acid orange 7 and three anthraquinone dyes alizarin red s nuclear fast red and carmine were used to assess the dye decolorization activity congo red and alizarin red s were purchased from wako pure chemical corporation osaka japan acid red 114 acid orange 7 nuclear fast red and carmine were purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan azo dyes are the most widely used dyes as they are suitable for dyeing cotton fibers anthraquinone dyes are also widespread and are effective for dyeing synthetic fibers 2 2 textile wastewater raw untreated textile wastewater was collected at a dyehouse at which approximately 2000 m3 of wastewater were discharged daily the raw textile wastewater had a dark red purple color due to the hundreds of dyes that remained unbound during dyeing of cotton or synthetic fibers the collected textile wastewater was centrifuged at 5000 rpm to remove suspended matters and bacteria and then filtered with a 0 2 μm pore size membrane filter quality of the textile wastewater was described elsewhere 2 2 3 dye decolorization activity a total of 45 strains were collected and examined for their dye decolorization activities using the azo dye congo red and anthraquinone dye alizarin red s as initial references two strains were selected for further testing on the other two azo acid red 114 and acid orange 7 and anthraquinone nuclear fast red and carmine dyes dye decolorization activity was assessed based on a study by ito 25 with slight modifications to the medium for liquid cultivation bacteria were streaked on lb agar plates and these were incubated at 37 c for a few days the bacteria were then collected and washed three times with m9 liquid medium without glucose next the washed culture was transferred into three 15 ml tubes containing 10 ml of m9 liquid medium w o glucose and 0 2 ml of a dye stock solution 1 g l 1 was added for a final dye concentration of 20 mg l 1 bacterial turbidity was adjusted to 1 mcfarland standard for anthraquinone dye decolorization the 15 ml tubes were incubated aerobically at 37 c on a rotator at 50 rpm for azo dye decolorization 0 1 ml of na2s stock solution 10 g l 1 was added to the 15 ml tubes and the gas phase of the tubes was then flushed with nitrogen gas for a few minutes prior to incubation at 37 c on a rotator at 50 rpm dissolved oxygen in the tube was around 0 2 0 5 mg l 1 i e micro oxic condition tubes were observed and assessed every 12 h for 3 weeks the incubation was terminated when the liquid phase became colorless and no dye precipitate was observed on the cells indicating that the dye had been degraded by the inoculated bacteria dye decolorization rate μg day 1 was calculated as the total mass of dye divided by the incubation time required for decolorization 2 4 decolorization of raw textile wastewater decolorization activity of the two selected strains 24 m and 37b was examined using raw textile wastewater as described in section 2 3 each strain was grown on lb agar plates collected washed and transferred to tubes containing 10 ml of raw textile wastewater tubes containing strain 24 m were incubated statically at 37 c those containing strain 37b were incubated aerobically at 37 c on a rotator at 50 rpm the liquid phase and the color of the cells in the tubes were visually observed every 12 h for 6 days on day 6 the tubes were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and visible absorption spectra of the supernatant were measured spectrophotometrically the experiment was repeated with other raw textile wastewater collected on a different day 2 5 dye decolorization rate dye decolorization rates for strain 24 m were determined as described in section 2 3 with some modifications specifically congo red was added to a final concentration of 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 and 200 mg l 1 triplicate samples were prepared for each dye concentration bacterial turbidity was adjusted to an optical density od at 605 nm of 20 in a different experiment cell turbidities were adjusted from od 3 to od 35 triplicate samples were prepared for each cell concentration congo red was added to attain a final concentration of 20 mg l 1 2 6 measurements of dissolved organic carbon doc protein and aromatic amines doc was measured using a toc cell test merck darmstadt germany protein content was determined with a pierce 660 nm protein assay kit thermo fisher scientific waltham ma aromatic amines were monitored using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector shimadzu kyoto japan and an ulbon hr 1 capillary column shinwa chemical industries ltd kyoto japan all measurements were performed following pretreatment whereby the incubated tubes were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 3 min and the supernatant was then filtered through a 0 2 µm filter or a 0 45 µm filter for the doc measurement 2 7 16s rrna gene analysis bacterial strains were identified following phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence total dna was extracted with the dneasy blood tissue kit qiagen hilden germany the extracted dna was amplified with the kapa2g robust pcr kit kapa biosystems wilmington ma using the bacterial primer pair 8f and 1492r 26 the pcr product was purified with the exosap kit thermo fisher scientific sequencing of the purified pcr product was carried out at eurofins genomics tokyo japan sequence data were analyzed using the blast search tool on the ncbi web site phylogenetic analysis was performed using the mega5 software package 27 and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor joining method 3 results and discussion 3 1 dye decolorization ability and phylogenetic identification of bacteria collected from human hands seventeen of the initially collected 45 strains were capable of decolorizing either congo red or alizarin red s table 1 of these the three strains displaying the highest decolorization rate for congo red were phylogenetically affiliated to micrococcus luteus some bacillus related strains exhibited lower decolorization rates for congo red four strains showed the highest or second highest decolorization rates for alizarin red s and they were all phylogenetically affiliated to the genus bacillus thus various gram positive bacteria related to the bacillus and micrococcus genera were capable of decolorizing congo red and alizarin red micrococcus species are commonly found on human skin as revealed by both culture dependent assays e g kloos and musselwhite 28 and by culture independent 16s rrna based analyses e g grice et al 29 bacillus species are not predominant on human skin but have been isolated from human hands 30 moreover bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus have been reported to decolorize anthraquinone dyes 31 32 and azo dyes 25 33 respectively therefore it is not surprising that the collected skin bacteria decolorized those dyes however it should be noted that the probability of obtaining dye decolorizing bacteria was as high as 38 even though we targeted only cultivable bacteria collected from human hands moreover the probability of obtaining congo red decolorizing bacteria with the highest decolorization rate remained high at 7 generally when collecting functional bacteria from the environment enrichment and dilution methods are employed for the isolation of the bacteria 34 37 therefore identifying one desirable bacterium out of fifteen colonies on the agar plates after the direct touching is surprising it is notable that dye degrading bacteria could be collected from human hands with such high efficiencies as no comparable values have been reported previously based on its high congo red decolorization fig 1 a strain 24m was selected as a superior azo dye decolorizing strain and its ability to decolorize the other two azo dyes was tested both acid orange 7 and acid red 114 were successfully degraded fig 1b c adsorption of the dye on cells was observed at the beginning of the decolorization experiment but the color on stained cells then disappeared within a week e g two days for acid orange 7 and four days for acid red 114 at the other end strain 37b was selected as a superior anthraquinone dye decolorizing strain based on its decolorization of alizarin red s fig 1d its ability to decolorize the other two anthraquinone dyes nuclear fast red and carmine was seemingly successful fig 1e f however it should be noted that carmine decolorization was incomplete as 26 of the initial carmine concentration persisted after a week these results suggest that strains 24m and 37b are capable of decolorizing a wide range of azo and anthraquinone dyes respectively moreover the two bacteria could provide an effective combination for treating textile wastewater containing both azo and anthraquinone dyes degradation products resulting from the decolorization of congo red by strain 24m were investigated by gas chromatography the azo dye decolorizing bacterial strain degraded congo red into its intermediates and those containing a phenyl group were degraded even further table 2 after 11 days when 99 of congo red was reduced the following products could be detected diamino biphenyl 38 3 4 diamino naphthalene 1 sulfonate 1 2 and aniline 0 5 cleavage of the azo bonds of congo red to form amino naphthalene sulfonate and biphenyl compounds has been described previously 18 38 40 in particular olukanni et al 39 suggested further cleavage of amino naphthalene compounds the low concentration of diamino naphthalene sulfonate indicates that most of it was further degraded by strain 24m this is not surprising as micrococcus luteus phylogenetically the closest relative to strain 24m is capable of degrading naphthalene compounds kegg pathway mlu00626 naphthalene degradation on the contrary degradation of diamino biphenyl was less conspicuous resulting in a small amount of aniline after 11 days strain 24m degraded 30 mg c l 1 aniline in 7 days when aniline served as the sole carbon source data not shown these results suggest that degradation of the biphenyl compound was the rate limiting step in the degradation of congo red by strain 24m 3 2 assessment of the major chemical types of dyes in textile wastewater using bacteria isolated from human hands the major type of dye in textile wastewaters was assessed using strains 24m and 37b dyehouse textile wastewater contains miscellaneous dyes whose chemical structure is not usually revealed by manufacturers cotton was the major textile for dyeing in the dyehouse where the textile wastewater was collected in this study accordingly the wastewater was expected to contain azo dyes indeed when strain 24m was applied absorbance values for the visible light spectrum of raw textile wastewater dropped and the wastewater was decolorized fig 2 strain 24m successfully decolorized the colorants adsorbed on the cells fig 2a as the spectrum of raw textile wastewater resulted from the presence of a variety of dyes used at the dyehouse absorbance of the peak wavelength remained at 25 fig 2b and 24 fig 2c even after incubation with strain 24m when strain 37b was applied the colorants remained adsorbed to the cells fig 2a while absorbance values were reduced fig 2b c thus the result of this assay was in agreement with the decolorization characteristics of strains 24m and 37b the combined use of strains 24m and 37b could become a novel easy to use tool for assessing the presence of major types of dyes in textile wastewater and dye polluted rivers 3 3 decolorization rates at different cell densities dye decolorization rates by strain 24m were determined at different cell concentrations in the range between od 3 and od 35 the maximum dye decolorization rate was 29 µg day 1 fig 3a which was estimated from the michaelis menten type kinetics cell density was applied instead of substrate concentration in the michaelis menten equation because we hypothesized that some substrates necessary for dye decolorization were produced by strain 24m and that substrate production was relative to cell density the hanes woolf plot revealed that the data were in good agreement with the michaelis menten equation thus supporting our hypothesis some decolorization rates measured at od 13 were much lower though whereas in other cases a very high decolorization rate was obtained at od 3 as shown in fig 3b decolorization rates at ods below 18 could vary substantially whereas at an od above 18 they could be closer to the expected rates biomass volume given by cell concentration or inoculum size represents an important factor for dye decolorization 41 several studies have investigated the optimum biomass volume with the aim of maximizing decolorization rate e g kahn et al 42 pourbabaee et al 43 importantly our results suggest that biomass volume affects also the stability of the decolorization reaction and that this effect is probably more important than the one exerted on decolorization rate dye decolorization rates of strain 24m were then investigated at od 20 and at different dye concentrations ranging between 20 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 the decolorization rate increased with increasing dye concentration fig 4 and followed a nearly straight line between 20 and 100 mg l 1 of dye this was in spite of the fact that dye loads per cell i e µg dye cell 1 increased as dye concentration increased these results indicate that dye concentrations of up to 100 mg l 1 were not toxic for strain 24m and the decolorization reaction was further stabilized by high cell density the inhibitory effect of dyes on bacterial cells has been reported previously e g dave et al 6 grag and tripathi 41 however while high concentrations of dyes inhibited the decolorization rate fig 4 clearly shows that within a certain range progressively higher amounts of dye also enhanced such rate therefore we propose that optimum decolorization can be attained by knowing 1 the maximum concentration of dye that does not cause inhibition 2 the concentration of the dye at which decolorization rate is highest and 3 the cell density that stabilizes the dye decolorization reaction 3 4 protein production and decolorization high concentrations of doc approximately 400 mg c l 1 were detected in the incubation solution after decolorization of congo red at an initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 fig 5a the initial organic carbon concentration of the incubation solution was 62 mg c l 1 as there was no difference in biomass volume measured in terms of od the doc increase was not likely attributed to cell disruption the result indicates that incubation with congo red resulted in a significant production of organic carbon the increased organic matter might have contributed to the decolorization when strain 24m was incubated without congo red doc did not increase moreover when strain 24m was incubated with congo red at 4 c only a slight increase in doc was observed data not shown therefore we believe that the doc increase resulted from the bacterial activity necessary to decolorize congo red finally total protein of the solution was measured following incubation at different dye concentrations of between 20 and 70 mg l 1 significant high protein concentrations in the order of mg l 1 were detected in all incubation solutions and protein concentration correlated well with the decolorization rate fig 5b therefore we concluded that total protein contained dye decolorizing enzymes such as azo reductase which strain 24m probably excreted to the outer membrane in response to the increased amount of dye this in turn caused an increase in doc and total protein if strain 24m is introduced in a textile wastewater treatment reactor the fixed bacterial biofilm reactor would prevent the excreted enzymes from washing out from the reactor 3 5 future studies needed human hands are easily accessible and the bacteria that inhabit them are easier to cultivate than those found in polluted sites e g river sediments which facilitates the collection of dye decolorizing bacteria for textile wastewater treatment as textile wastewater usually contains a limited amount of nutrients for bacteria decolorization of textile wastewater by these bacterial strains should be conducted under continuous operation in future studies moreover understanding and establishing bacterial community associated with these dye decolorizing bacterial strains will also be necessary for ensuring continual stability of textile wastewater 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the potential ability of bacteria present on human hands to be used for dye decolorization treatment the followings points summarize the findings from this study dye decolorizing bacteria were obtained from the hands of ordinary people with an efficiency of approximately 40 two types of bacterial strains presented superior activity in decolorizing azo dyes and anthraquinone dyes the azo dye decolorizing bacterial strain was capable of decolorizing real textile wastewater whereas the anthraquinone dye decolorizing bacterial strain achieved only partial decolorization these bacterial strains can be applied to assess the presence of major types of dyes in textile wastewater and dye polluted rivers cell density of the azo dye decolorizing bacterial strain was the factor that mostly contributed to stabilizing the decolorization reaction acknowledgments this study was funded in part by jsps

congo red was added to a final concentration of 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 and 200 mg l 1 triplicate samples were prepared for each dye concentration bacterial turbidity was adjusted to an optical density od at 605 nm of 20 in a different experiment cell turbidities were adjusted from od 3 to od 35 triplicate samples were prepared for each cell concentration congo red was added to attain a final concentration of 20 mg l 1 2 6 measurements of dissolved organic carbon doc protein and aromatic amines doc was measured using a toc cell test merck darmstadt germany protein content was determined with a pierce 660 nm protein assay kit thermo fisher scientific waltham ma aromatic amines were monitored using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector shimadzu kyoto japan and an ulbon hr 1 capillary column shinwa chemical industries ltd kyoto japan all measurements were performed following pretreatment whereby the incubated tubes were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 3 min and the supernatant was then filtered through a 0 2 µm filter or a 0 45 µm filter for the doc measurement 2 7 16s rrna gene analysis bacterial strains were identified following phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence total dna was extracted with the dneasy blood tissue kit qiagen hilden germany the extracted dna was amplified with the kapa2g robust pcr kit kapa biosystems wilmington ma using the bacterial primer pair 8f and 1492r 26 the pcr product was purified with the exosap kit thermo fisher scientific sequencing of the purified pcr product was carried out at eurofins genomics tokyo japan sequence data were analyzed using the blast search tool on the ncbi web site phylogenetic analysis was performed using the mega5 software package 27 and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor joining method 3 results and discussion 3 1 dye decolorization ability and phylogenetic identification of bacteria collected from human hands seventeen of the initially collected 45 strains were capable of decolorizing either congo red or alizarin red s table 1 of these the three strains displaying the highest decolorization rate for congo red were phylogenetically affiliated to micrococcus luteus some bacillus related strains exhibited lower decolorization rates for congo red four strains showed the highest or second highest decolorization rates for alizarin red s and they were all phylogenetically affiliated to the genus bacillus thus various gram positive bacteria related to the bacillus and micrococcus genera were capable of decolorizing congo red and alizarin red micrococcus species are commonly found on human skin as revealed by both culture dependent assays e g kloos and musselwhite 28 and by culture independent 16s rrna based analyses e g grice et al 29 bacillus species are not predominant on human skin but have been isolated from human hands 30 moreover bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus have been reported to decolorize anthraquinone dyes 31 32 and azo dyes 25 33 respectively therefore it is not surprising that the collected skin bacteria decolorized those dyes however it should be noted that the probability of obtaining dye decolorizing bacteria was as high as 38 even though we targeted only cultivable bacteria collected from human hands moreover the probability of obtaining congo red decolorizing bacteria with the highest decolorization rate remained high at 7 generally when collecting functional bacteria from the environment enrichment and dilution methods are employed for the isolation of the bacteria 34 37 therefore identifying one desirable bacterium out of fifteen colonies on the agar plates after the direct touching is surprising it is notable that dye degrading bacteria could be collected from human hands with such high efficiencies as no comparable values have been reported previously based on its high congo red decolorization fig 1 a strain 24m was selected as a superior azo dye decolorizing strain and its ability to decolorize the other two azo dyes was tested both acid orange 7 and acid red 114 were successfully degraded fig 1b c adsorption of the dye on cells was observed at the beginning of the decolorization experiment but the color on stained cells then disappeared within a week e g two days for acid orange 7 and four days for acid red 114 at the other end strain 37b was selected as a superior anthraquinone dye decolorizing strain based on its decolorization of alizarin red s fig 1d its ability to decolorize the other two anthraquinone dyes nuclear fast red and carmine was seemingly successful fig 1e f however it should be noted that carmine decolorization was incomplete as 26 of the initial carmine concentration persisted after a week these results suggest that strains 24m and 37b are capable of decolorizing a wide range of azo and anthraquinone dyes respectively moreover the two bacteria could provide an effective combination for treating textile wastewater containing both azo and anthraquinone dyes degradation products resulting from the decolorization of congo red by strain 24m were investigated by gas chromatography the azo dye decolorizing bacterial strain degraded congo red into its intermediates and those containing a phenyl group were degraded even further table 2 after 11 days when 99 of congo red was reduced the following products could be detected diamino biphenyl 38 3 4 diamino naphthalene 1 sulfonate 1 2 and aniline 0 5 cleavage of the azo bonds of congo red to form amino naphthalene sulfonate and biphenyl compounds has been described previously 18 38 40 in particular olukanni et al 39 suggested further cleavage of amino naphthalene compounds the low concentration of diamino naphthalene sulfonate indicates that most of it was further degraded by strain 24m this is not surprising as micrococcus luteus phylogenetically the closest relative to strain 24m is capable of degrading naphthalene compounds kegg pathway mlu00626 naphthalene degradation on the contrary degradation of diamino biphenyl was less conspicuous resulting in a small amount of aniline after 11 days strain 24m degraded 30 mg c l 1 aniline in 7 days when aniline served as the sole carbon source data not shown these results suggest that degradation of the biphenyl compound was the rate limiting step in the degradation of congo red by strain 24m 3 2 assessment of the major chemical types of dyes in textile wastewater using bacteria isolated from human hands the major type of dye in textile wastewaters was assessed using strains 24m and 37b dyehouse textile wastewater contains miscellaneous dyes whose chemical structure is not usually revealed by manufacturers cotton was the major textile for dyeing in the dyehouse where the textile wastewater was collected in this study accordingly the wastewater was expected to contain azo dyes indeed when strain 24m was applied absorbance values for the visible light spectrum of raw textile wastewater dropped and the wastewater was decolorized fig 2 strain 24m successfully decolorized the colorants adsorbed on the cells fig 2a as the spectrum of raw textile wastewater resulted from the presence of a variety of dyes used at the dyehouse absorbance of the peak wavelength remained at 25 fig 2b and 24 fig 2c even after incubation with strain 24m when strain 37b was applied the colorants remained adsorbed to the cells fig 2a while absorbance values were reduced fig 2b c thus the result of this assay was in agreement with the decolorization characteristics of strains 24m and 37b the combined use of strains 24m and 37b could become a novel easy to use tool for assessing the presence of major types of dyes in textile wastewater and dye polluted rivers 3 3 decolorization rates at different cell densities dye decolorization rates by strain 24m were determined at different cell concentrations in the range between od 3 and od 35 the maximum dye decolorization rate was 29 µg day 1 fig 3a which was estimated from the michaelis menten type kinetics cell density was applied instead of substrate concentration in the michaelis menten equation because we hypothesized that some substrates necessary for dye decolorization were produced by strain 24m and that substrate production was relative to cell density the hanes woolf plot revealed that the data were in good agreement with the michaelis menten equation thus supporting our hypothesis some decolorization rates measured at od 13 were much lower though whereas in other cases a very high decolorization rate was obtained at od 3 as shown in fig 3b decolorization rates at ods below 18 could vary substantially whereas at an od above 18 they could be closer to the expected rates biomass volume given by cell concentration or inoculum size represents an important factor for dye decolorization 41 several studies have investigated the optimum biomass volume with the aim of maximizing decolorization rate e g kahn et al 42 pourbabaee et al 43 importantly our results suggest that biomass volume affects also the stability of the decolorization reaction and that this effect is probably more important than the one exerted on decolorization rate dye decolorization rates of strain 24m were then investigated at od 20 and at different dye concentrations ranging between 20 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 the decolorization rate increased with increasing dye concentration fig 4 and followed a nearly straight line between 20 and 100 mg l 1 of dye this was in spite of the fact that dye loads per cell i e µg dye cell 1 increased as dye concentration increased these results indicate that dye concentrations of up to 100 mg l 1 were not toxic for strain 24m and the decolorization reaction was further stabilized by high cell density the inhibitory effect of dyes on bacterial cells has been reported previously e g dave et al 6 grag and tripathi 41 however while high concentrations of dyes inhibited the decolorization rate fig 4 clearly shows that within a certain range progressively higher amounts of dye also enhanced such rate therefore we propose that optimum decolorization can be attained by knowing 1 the maximum concentration of dye that does not cause inhibition 2 the concentration of the dye at which decolorization rate is highest and 3 the cell density that stabilizes the dye decolorization reaction 3 4 protein production and decolorization high concentrations of doc approximately 400 mg c l 1 were detected in the incubation solution after decolorization of congo red at an initial concentration of 100 mg l 1 fig 5a the initial organic carbon concentration of the incubation solution was 62 mg c l 1 as there was no difference in biomass volume measured in terms of od the doc increase was not likely attributed to cell disruption the result indicates that incubation with congo red resulted in a significant production of organic carbon the increased organic matter might have contributed to the decolorization when strain 24m was incubated without congo red doc did not increase moreover when strain 24m was incubated with congo red at 4 c only a slight increase in doc was observed data not shown therefore we believe that the doc increase resulted from the bacterial activity necessary to decolorize congo red finally total protein of the solution was measured following incubation at different dye concentrations of between 20 and 70 mg l 1 significant high protein concentrations in the order of mg l 1 were detected in all incubation solutions and protein concentration correlated well with the decolorization rate fig 5b therefore we concluded that total protein contained dye decolorizing enzymes such as azo reductase which strain 24m probably excreted to the outer membrane in response to the increased amount of dye this in turn caused an increase in doc and total protein if strain 24m is introduced in a textile wastewater treatment reactor the fixed bacterial biofilm reactor would prevent the excreted enzymes from washing out from the reactor 3 5 future studies needed human hands are easily accessible and the bacteria that inhabit them are easier to cultivate than those found in polluted sites e g river sediments which facilitates the collection of dye decolorizing bacteria for textile wastewater treatment as textile wastewater usually contains a limited amount of nutrients for bacteria decolorization of textile wastewater by these bacterial strains should be conducted under continuous operation in future studies moreover understanding and establishing bacterial community associated with these dye decolorizing bacterial strains will also be necessary for ensuring continual stability of textile wastewater 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the potential ability of bacteria present on human hands to be used for dye decolorization treatment the followings points summarize the findings from this study dye decolorizing bacteria were obtained from the hands of ordinary people with an efficiency of approximately 40 two types of bacterial strains presented superior activity in decolorizing azo dyes and anthraquinone dyes the azo dye decolorizing bacterial strain was capable of decolorizing real textile wastewater whereas the anthraquinone dye decolorizing bacterial strain achieved only partial decolorization these bacterial strains can be applied to assess the presence of major types of dyes in textile wastewater and dye polluted rivers cell density of the azo dye decolorizing bacterial strain was the factor that mostly contributed to stabilizing the decolorization reaction acknowledgments this study was funded in part by jsps

heavy metals and dyes has become a major environmental problem and a threat to the well being of living organisms 1 3 heavy metals are non biodegradable persistent carcinogenic and toxic in nature and are widely distributed in the environment they bioaccumulate in living organisms through food chain and their accumulation causes different diseases and malfunctions cadmium chromium and copper are among few heavy metals that are discharged from several industrial effluents cadmium is liberated into the environment from steel production cement manufacture ni cd battery manufacture cadmium electroplating phosphate fertilizers etc 4 according to the world health organization who 5 guidelines the maximum concentration for cadmium in drinking water was set at 0 003 mg l 1 in 2010 zaini et al 6 reported that bivalent cadmium causes several deformities in humans such as muscular cramps pulmonary problems renal degradation proteinuria skeletal deformity testicular atrophy etc hexavalent chromium is another heavy metal in the environment released from various sources like electroplating leather tanning mining textile and fertilizer industries it is toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic to human beings and animals 7 8 it causes cancer in digestive tract and lungs epigastric pain nausea diarrhea vomiting and hemorrhage as stated by mohanty group 9 the maximum permissible limit for hexavalent chromium in drinking water is 0 05 mg l 1 10 copper is another essential element that is required for the synthesis of enzymes tissues and bone development the sources of copper from various industries include smelting mining electroplating surface finishing electric appliances electrolysis and electrical components 11 it is toxic and carcinogenic when ingested in large amounts and causes headache vomiting nausea liver and kidney failure respiratory problems and abdominal pain 12 13 the maximum permissible limit set by usepa for the release of copper in industrial effluents is 1 3 mg l 1 thus the effluents containing such kind of heavy metals which are harmful to the living organisms must be treated before discharging into ambient environment in this regard nanotechnology has been the focus of researchers since a couple of years iron oxide nanotechnology has been gaining the attraction of research society in solving the environment related problems 14 15 this is because iron oxide is very useful in removing various kinds of air water and soil contaminants through adsorption and photo degradation in addition to this the deteriorating quality of water has led the researchers to use iron oxide nanoparticles as new generation adsorbents for water treatment 16 iron oxide is great adsorbent as it has high surface area to volume ratio its surface can be modified excellent magnetic properties great biocompatibility ease of separation using external magnetic field reusability and comparatively low cost 17 18 also it can coordinate with other elements due to variable oxidation states despite the above iron oxide has one disadvantage that its particles aggregate due to their large surface to volume ratio and low surface energy 19 20 to control this surface modification is required to ensure the stability of particles surface modification of iron oxide nanoparticles can be performed through coating stabilization and functionalization in surface coating iron oxide attracts water molecules hydrophilicity and doesn t form clusters due to the dispersion of particles 21 the surface modification of iron oxide by activated carbon using coating technique improves their sorption capability because surface coating phenomenon helps in converting the closely packed cubic geometry of magnetic nanoparticles into compact and strong 20 few examples can be found in the literature wherein the surface coated iron oxide nanoparticles have been utilized for the removal of heavy metals and dyes tailored edta di anhydride treated magnetic fe3o4 baker s yeast biomass efb was investigated by xu et al 22 for the removal of pb ii and cd ii ions from aqueous solution wannahari et al 23 reported that sugarcane bagasse derived nanomagnetic adsorbent

wastewater in the similar way it has also been found that 28 34 activated carbon iron oxide composite is useful in removing different kinds of contaminants like trinitrophenol phosphate atrazine lead arsenic mercury and methylene blue dye from aqueous solutions it is well documented that agricultural waste has huge scientific social and economic significance as it is abundantly available at no or little cost require simple processing easy to handle and no regeneration is required in 2013 our group 35 treated deseeded sunflower heads with formaldehyde to inhibit leaching of soluble organic matter from lignocellulosic materials these treated sunflower heads fsh were then used for sequestering chromium ions from synthetic and steel industry wastewater the adsorption capacity of fsh was found to be 7 9 mg g 1 for cr vi at ph 2 0 and a temperature of 25 c from synthetic wastewater while the percent removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii from steel industry wastewater was 45 40 8 and 35 1 respectively at their optimum ph i e 2 0 5 0 and 6 0 a review of literature on using sunflower and its parts seed husk seed hull dried leaves stalks for the removal of heavy metals and dyes from wastewater revealed that very limited information is available some of the studies carried out by various researchers are given here in brief sun and xu 36 investigated sunflower stalks for the removal of methylene blue basic red 9 congo red and direct blue 71 from aqueous solutions benaissa and elouchdi 37 evaluated the potential of dried sunflower leaves for removing copper ions from single metal ion solution in a well stirred batch reactor thinakaran et al 38 explored the adsorption of acid violet 17 using activated carbons prepared from sunflower seed hull ssh treated with sulphuric acid at three different temperatures the adsorption efficiency of crushed and uncrushed sunflower husks for removal of methylene blue from aqueous solution was investigated by soldatkina et al 39 sunflower stalks modified by nitric acid activation were used by hussein 40 for the removal of copper from wastewater in batch and fixed bed mode activated carbon via microwave induced k2co3 activation was prepared by foo and hameed 41 from sunflower seed oil residue which is a by product of sunflower seed oil refining industry they utilized it for the removal of methylene blue and acid blue 15 from aqueous solution the sunflower hulls are a waste material that originates from food industry these hulls were used by witek krowiak 42 for the biosorption of cu ii ions from aqueous solution zou et al 43 demonstrated that the activated carbon prepared from sunflower seed hull an abundant agriculture byproduct was highly porous inexpensive and efficient adsorbent for the removal of cr vi feizi and jalali 44 explored sunflower stalks and leaves for the removal of cd cu ni zn mn fe in single and competitive batch mode from aqueous solution saleh and gupta 3 prepared biochar from sunflower seed husk and found its adsorption potential in removing copper ions from wastewater srisorrachatr 45 prepared activated carbons from sunflower seed husks ssh by chemical activation with potassium carbonate and zinc chloride solution followed by carbonization and used them for removal of pb ii ni ii zn ii and cd ii from aqueous solution as it is clear from the review of literature that less research work has been carried out on unmodified sunflower head and stem waste besides this only few studies have been reported on surface modification of iron oxide by using sunflower activated carbon for developing magnetic activated carbon nanocomposite this combination has transformed the sunflower waste into useful magnetic activated carbon sorbents for removing toxic ions from wastewater another advantage is that the loaded adsorbents could be easily separated from the aqueous solution using magnet instead of centrifugation thus conserving energy based on the aforementioned properties agricultural waste sunflower head waste was chosen as a raw material which was combined with iron oxide nanoparticles as it was anticipated that this twofold combination of adsorption and magnetic separation would make the wastewater treatment process ecofriendly effective and economically more attractive in this study material preparation characterization and batch type removal experiments were carried out wherein the feasibility of the above described composite for the removal of heavy metals cr vi cu ii and cd ii from aqueous solution were investigated by varying the process conditions 2 material and methodology 2 1 chemicals all the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade sigma aldrich finland stock solutions of 1000 mg l 1 concentration of cd

inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes model icap 6000 thermo electron corporation uk at a wavelength of 283 563 nm for cr vi 324 75 nm for cu ii and 228 802 nm for cd ii 2 2 preparation of nanoparticles 2 2 1 preparation of activated carbon by sunflower head waste chemical activation method chemical activation can be carried by any of the mineral acids like hcl hno3 h2so4 phosphoric acid as it increases the porosity of the carbon structure during the acid treatment impregnation ratio also strongly affects the characteristics of activated carbon ac as our s was an agricultural waste so it contained large amount of lignin and if the percentage of lignin is more then sulphuric acid activation leads to an increase in bet surface area 46 table 1 depicts that the surface area pore volume and pore width all increased after activation with sulphuric acid as this process leads to an extensive increase in the porosity of the material fig 5 if we compare the surface area of the acs prepared by sulphuric acid phosphoric acid zinc chloride then it was found that the surface area of sulphuric acid treated ac was highest 47 high surface area and pore structure are the basic parameters for an effective adsorbent and these parameters are introduced by chemical activating agents like sulphuric acid activated carbon prepared from sunflower head waste was synthesized as per the method reported by 48 sunflower head waste biomass was crushed into fine powder in a steel mill crushed powder was boiled in distilled water and cooled the procedure of boiling and cooling was repeated till the supernatant was colorless the washed crushed powder was rinsed with 1 hcl washed again with distilled water till the wash water became colorless the powder was dried at 80 c for 24 h in a hot air oven to get rid of moisture and volatiles pretreated sunflower head waste powder was treated with concentrated sulphuric acid in the ratio of 1 2 w v it was then washed with distilled water continuously to remove free acid and soaked in 1 sodium bicarbonate solution overnight to neutralize the acid it was then washed with distilled water and dried at 80 c

in n2 atmosphere washed with ultra pure water and dried at same conditions as mentioned above the activated carbon namely ac was sieved from the standard mesh of size 250 µm and stored in a vacuum desiccator for further use 2 2 2 preparation of iron oxide activated carbon nanocomposite fe3o4 ac and iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 the iron oxide activated carbon nanocomposite fe3o4 ac was prepared as reported by 14 with some modification a required amount of ac was dispersed in 400 ml solution of 7 8 g of fecl3 6h2o 28 mm and 3 8 g of feso4 7h2o 14 mm with vigorous stirring on a magnetic stirrer at 700 rpm at 70 80 c the naoh 5 0 m solution was added drop wise into the above suspension under vigorous stirring at 80 c until ph raised to 10 11 to precipitate the hydrated iron oxide the suspension was stirred further on a magnetic stirrer at 80 c for 1 0 h next it was aged at room temperature for 24 h the fe3o4 ac nanocomposite were separated by a magnet and washed repeatedly with distilled water and ethanol till neutral ph they were then dried in hot air oven at 80 c for 12 h after drying the nanoparticles were crushed in mortar and pastel and stored in air tight plastic containers for further use in addition the procedure for synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 was similar as mentioned above except that no ac was added 2 3 characterization of

head waste shw has a very small surface area 0 99 m2 g 1 with a pore volume of 0 0007 cm3 g 1 table 1 while when shw was converted into activated carbon ac the surface area increased to 25 07 m2 g 1 the surface area of fe3o4 was found to be 47 87 m2 g 1 that further increased to 51 1 m2 g 1 when fe3o4 was coated with ac the phpzc ph at point of zero charge of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was found to be 5 2 and 7 04 respectively adsorbents with diverse type of chemical groups like carboxyl hydroxyl ester aldehyde ketone etc have the ability to bind with metal ions their affinity for metal uptake depends on factors like the number of sites their accessibility chemical form affinity between binding sites and metal ions etc 49 the functional groups and their corresponding frequencies are shown in the ft ir spectra of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac and metal loaded fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac p fig 1 ftir analysis indicated the presence of several strong absorption peaks the presence of infrared absorption peaks at about 530 35 528 42 522 64 568 21 cm 1 in fe3o4 cr cu and cd loaded fe3o4 and 536 14 534 29 538 07 530 67 cm 1 in fe3o4 ac cr cu and cd loaded fe3o4 ac respectively confirmed the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles with respect to characteristic stretching band of fe o onto their surface 24 no other peak was found in fe3o4 thus indicating that it comprised of iron oxide only on the other hand in fe3o4 ac the peak at 2341 29 cm 1 is attributed to aromatic c c the strong c o band at 1037 57 cm 1 due to och3 group indicated the presence of lignin group in the sunflower head which is the characteristic peak of polysaccharides the band at 1585 28 cm 1 in chromium loaded fe3o4 ac may be due to asymmetric stretching of c o bond stretching of aromatic c c bond or due to amide stretching in copper loaded fe3o4 ac the absorption peak at 3423 22 cm 1 may be attributed to nh oh stretching indicating the existence of free and intermolecular bonded hydroxyl group due to alcoholic or phenolic functions and amine group the peak around 1612 28 cm 1 corresponds to c o stretching that may be attributed to lignin aromatic group similarly in cadmium loaded fe3o4 ac the peaks shifted as compared to native nanoparticles p fig 1 the additional peaks at 869 78 cm 1 and 781 07 cm 1 in fe3o4 ac and cr vi loaded fe3o4 ac 862 5 cm 1 in cu ii loaded fe3o4 ac 875 57 cm 1 and 767 57 cm 1 in cd ii loaded fe3o4 ac may be assigned to bending modes of aromatic compounds these changes indicated that the carboxyl amino hydroxyl groups present on the surface of native and metal loaded fe3o4 ac are mainly involved in the adsorption of metal ions the possible adsorption on these nanoparticles may be due to physical adsorption complexation with functional groups 18 50 ion exchange 51 surface precipitation or chemical reaction with surface sites the changes in ftir spectra confirm the complexation of cr vi cu ii and cd ii with functional groups present on the nanoparticles comparison of powder x ray diffraction pxrd patterns of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac q fig 1 samples revealed that the iron oxide nanoparticles in both samples are crystalline in nature and represent the cubic structure modification of fe3o4 magnetite the characteristic diffraction peaks with corresponding miller indices can be observed at 2θ of 30 18 220 35 54 311 43 21 400 54 00 422 57 16 511 and 62 78 440 respectively table 2 as all the observed peaks were assigned to the magnetite phase no peaks for the potential hematite phase could be seen in either of the patterns in addition a very weak broad diffraction hump at 2θ range of 23 was observed in case of fe3o4 ac sample confirming presence of activated carbon on the surfaces of magnetic nanoparticles 35 the crystal size analysis with scherrer equation indicated nearly the same crystal size of both the magnetite nanoparticles 15 21 nm in diameter depending on the direction of the view of the crystal lattice the sem micrographs of fe3o4 fe3o4 ac cr cu cd loaded fe3o4 and cr cu cd loaded fe3o4 ac are shown in fig 2 sem images give an idea about the shape and structure of the nanoparticles under study ac has a tubular and porous structure fig 5a b with smooth surface while images of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac fig 2a and e reveal that the nanoparticles are agglomerated and stuck to each other thus making the surface rough and coarse the surface of the nanosorbents after loading with heavy metals fig 2b c d f g and h became smooth and shiny as visible in the images the adsorption of heavy metals on the surface of nanoparticles was further confirmed by eds detailed morphology and structure of the nanoparticles was further investigated by tem as can be seen in the eds spectra of fe3o4 sample fig 3a it does not contain carbon and weight fraction of iron is 63 8 whereas in fe3o4 ac fig 3e the weight fraction of carbon is 50 9 and iron content is only 18 4 confirmed by the sharp peaks of carbon and iron thus indicating that the activated carbon content was significantly higher than fe3o4 nps moreover e ds spectrum of fe3o4 ac sample showed an additional peak that could be assigned to silicon that might have originated from the plant material partial images of b c d f g and h in fig 3 corresponds to the eds spectra of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac after loading with cr cu and cd respectively the characteristic peaks of cr cu and cd in the spectra revealed that the metal ions bonded well with the surface of the nanoparticles tem images of synthesized fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac nanoparticles along with the particle size distribution in the inset i e selected area diffraction pattern are given in fig 4a b c and d the nanoparticles synthesized by co precipitation method are nearly spherical in shape with an average particle size of 12 9 nm fe3o4 and 12 3 nm fe3o4 ac the particle size of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was in the range of 7 19 nm and 9 18 nm respectively thereby being consistent with xrd analysis see earlier paragraph of same section the magnetic hysteresis loop of iron oxide nanoparticles fig 6 was plotted between field strength t and ratio of magnetic moment to mass j a m2 kg 1 the saturation magnetization i e js a m2 kg 1 that measures the maximum magnetic strength was found to be 59 3 and 52 2 a m2 kg respectively for fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac table 3 js values obtained for both the nanoparticles were lesser than the pure magnetite fe3o4 i e 92 a m2 kg 1 52 although both the nanoparticles are quite similar in their magnetic properties but fe3o4 ac has less saturation magnetization due to the presence of plant biomass in it table 3 however this reduction in magnetization did not affect the attraction by external magnet as fe3o4 ac was still strongly attracted by the external magnet the coercivities hc mt of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac are 5 2 and 3 6 t respectively indicating that the nanoparticles are of ferromagnetic nature table 3 the remnant magnetization jr a measure of the remaining magnetization when the driving field is dropped to zero is 5 3 and 4 0 a m2 kg 1 for fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac respectively table 3 thus fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac with high saturation magnetization values can quickly respond to the external magnetic field thereby leading to their fast separation from the aqueous solution of heavy metal the data indicated that both the specimens show similar hysteresis parameters table 3 and fig 6 the tga dtg analysis was performed to identify the thermal behavior and stability of the nanoparticles in the nitrogen atmosphere tga was used to determine the thermal stability of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac by monitoring the weight change that occurred when the samples were heated in an inert atmosphere of n2 fig 7 showed the mass loss tga and derivative mass loss dtg curves of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac in fig 7 fe3o4 showed two step degradation as indicated by the dtg peaks the observed maximum weight loss occurred at first peak i e at around 65 c which was attributed to the loss of moisture the second peak at 270 c in the temperature range of 175 400 c with a further weight loss of 1 7 corresponded to the removal of chemically bound moisture above 400 c only negligible change in mass 0 55 was observed indicating that no further reactions occurred until 1000 c thereby iron oxide being the sole residue with residual mass of 96 at the end of the degradation on the other hand the degradation of fe3o4 ac occurred in four distinct stages as indicated by the dtg peaks the first weight loss below 175 c was mainly due to the loss of moisture a second peak at around 276 c with very low weight loss within 175 387 c was found due to the thermal degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose 53 between 387 and 787 c a third peak with a loss of 8 4 was due to the devolatilization of more thermally stable heavy volatiles present in fe3o4 ac 54 the fourth stage was from 787 to 969 c in which the slow weight loss was due to the pyrolysis of lignin in biomass 55 57 at the end of temperature 999 2 c the final residual mass of 77 7 was identified which might be the representative of materials including iron oxide and some other carbonaceous residuals 4 2 batch adsorption studies 4 2 1 ph dependent studies the effect of ph fig 8a b c and d on the adsorption of cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was studied in order to determine the optimum adsorption ph of the above said ions in the ph range of 2 0 7 0 while screening the ph values all the other process variables such as initial metal ion concentration 50 mg l 1 nanoparticle dose 50 mg 10 ml temperature 26 1 c shaking speed 180 rpm and contact time 3 h were kept constant a control experiment was also run in the absence of nanoparticles for the removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii to explore the effect of chemical precipitation fig 8c performed control experiment revealed that there was no removal of cr vi cd ii up to ph 7 0 and cu ii up to ph 6 0 but when the ph was 6 0 for cu ii and 7 0 for cd ii and cr vi all the three ions precipitated as hydroxides cr oh 2 cu oh 2 and cd oh 2 in the solution thus leading to their complete removal keeping this in view the adsorption studies were conducted in the ph range of 2 0 7 0 for cr vi and cd ii and 2 0 6 0 for cu ii as cu ii precipitated at ph 7 0 and cr vi and cd ii precipitated at ph 8 0 fig 8a and b display that maximum removal of cr vi was achieved at ph 2 0 and that of cu ii and cd ii was at ph 6 0 in case of fe3o4 it was observed that cr vi removal decreased 58 5 11 6 as ph was increased from 2 0 to 7 0 whereas cu ii and cd ii removal increased from 0 to 26 2 and 2 6 to 8 4 respectively when the ph was increased from 2 0 to 6 0 while the percentage removal decreased from 95 3 to 10 3 in case of cr vi it increased from 0 to 85 6 and from 5 5 to 96 5 for cu ii and cd ii respectively when fe3o4 ac was used in the given ph range indicating higher removal efficiency of fe3o4 ac over fe3o4 it can be assumed that it was the presence of different functional groups on the surface of activated carbon that led to the increased binding of more ions as suggested by jain et al 49 one way to explain the mechanism of cr vi removal is that at lower ph the surface of the nanoparticle is positively charged due to adsorption of h ions from the aqueous solution the chromium ions co exist in different forms viz hcro4 cr2o7 2 cr3o10 2 cr4o13 2 of which hcro4 predominates in the ph range of 1 0 6 0 and chromate ions cro4 2 exists at ph 6 0 58 this leads to an electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nanoparticles surface and negatively charged chromate ions thus leading to an increase in the removal at lower ph ph 2 0 scheme 1 the decrease in the removal at higher ph may be due to competition between chromate cro4 2 and hydroxyl ions oh for adsorption on the surface of the nanoparticles so the most probable mechanism for adsorption of chromium on the surface of nanoparticles is electrostatic attraction repulsion 59 the adsorption was highest at ph 2 0 for cr vi on both the nanoparticle specimens and therefore ph 2 0 was chosen as the optimum ph for forthcoming experiments the adsorption of cu ii and cd ii was less at lower ph but increased with the increase in ph this behavior may be due to the reason that lower ph leads to an abundance of hydronium ions h3o in the solution that causes competition between hydronium ions and cu ii or cd ii ions copper and cadmium ions are present as cu2 cu oh cd2 and cd oh at lower ph for adsorption onto nanoparticles thereby lowering the overall adsorption efficiency of these metal ions at lower ph 60 similar kind of results were reported by ianos et al 61 who synthesized iron oxide carbon nanocomposite for the removal of acid blue 129 dyes from simulated wastewater they found that the adsorption capacity of acid blue at ph 2 3 was 4 mg g 1 on the other hand at higher ph values the functional groups present on the surface of the nanoparticles like carboxylic acid hydroxyls phenol are deprotonated thus creating negative sites on the nanoparticles this leads to an electrostatic attraction between these negatively charged adsorption sites and positively charged cu2 and cd2 ions thus increasing their adsorption 62 since the adsorption was highest at ph 6 0 for both cu2 and cd2 it was chosen as the optimum ph for both these ions the point zero charge ph phpzc plays an important role while studying the effect of ph fig 8d at ph phpzc the surface of the nanoparticles is positively charged and at ph phpzc the surface of the nanoparticles is negatively charged because the phpzc values were found to be 5 2 and 7 04 respectively for fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac it can be stated that the surface of these nanoparticles was positively charged below phpzc 5 2 and 7 04 this confirmed that the hydrogen chromate ions were adsorbed through electrostatic attraction and cu2 and cd2 were repelled due to electrostatic repulsion between the two while the surface of the nanoparticles was negatively charged above phpzc 5 2 and 7 04 this led to the electrostatic repulsion between the nanoparticles surface and chromate ions and electrostatic attraction between nanoparticles surface and cu2 and cd2 ions 4 2 2 metal ion concentration dependent studies the effect of initial metal ion concentration by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac at concentration varying from 10 to 500 mg l 1 keeping all other process variables constant see details in ph dependent studies is depicted in fig 8 e and f the figures revealed that the metal removal by both the nanoparticles decreased as the metal ion concentration in the solution was increased from 10 to 500 mg l 1 in the solution the metal removal efficiency decreased from 74 7 to 20 8 for cr vi 60 0 10 5 for cu ii and 27 4 0 for cd ii in case of fe3o4 and 98 9 31 7 for cr vi 99 9 12 5 for cu ii and 99 9 8 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 ac our results are in agreement with kera et al 63 who fabricated magnetic polypyrrole ppy polyaniline pani iron oxide fe3o4 nanocomposite for the removal of cr vi this nanocomposite was efficient in removing 99 of cr vi from aqueous solution at ph 2 0 initial metal ion concentration of 100 mg l 1 and a nanocomposite dose of 0 05 g however overall adsorption capacity of all the three metal ions increased on both the nanoparticles with an increase in concentration it increased from 0 4 to 5 2 mg g 1 for cr vi 0 3 2 6 mg g 1 for cu ii but no adsorption capacity for cd ii in case of fe3o4 whereas a similar trend was observed by fe3o4 ac i e 0 5 8 0 mg g 1 for cr vi 0 5 3 0 mg g 1 for cu ii and 0 5 2 0 mg g 1 for cd ii this could be explained on the basis that the ionic radii 0 95 å of cd ii was high among the three ions moreover fe3o4 doesn t contain any of the functional groups present on fe3o4 ac thus cd ii couldn t have access to the pores of the adsorbent so it couldn t be removed the decrease in removal efficiency with an increase in metal ion concentration may be due to the fact that as the concentration of metal ion increases increasingly more surface sites are covered and hence at higher metal ion concentration the adsorption capacity of the nanoparticles get exhausted due to non availability of free binding sites thus resulting in a decrease in the overall removal efficiency 64 it is therefore evident that at low concentration ranges the percentage of adsorption is high because of the availability of more active sites on the surface of nanoparticles the increase in adsorption capacity can be explained on the basis that an increase in initial metal ion concentration led to an increase in diffusion of cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions from the solution phase to the surface of the nanoparticles due to an increase in the driving force of the metal ions which lead to the collisions between metal ions and the nanoparticles surface thus resulting in an increase in adsorption capacity 22 4 2 3 contact time dependent studies next the effect of contact time on the removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was investigated to determine the optimum time taken to attain the equilibrium fig 8g and h the adsorption experiments were carried out by varying the contact time between 2 and 240 min keeping all other process variables constant fig 8g and h depicts that removal percentage increased with an increase in the contact time the equilibrium was achieved within 60 120 and 30 min for cr vi cu ii and cd ii respectively by fe3o4 the removal efficiency increased from 30 4 to 58 3 for cr vi 17 7 to 26 4 for cu ii and 4 4 to 8 2 for cd ii by fe3o4 after which it became constant and further removal of these metal ions was not observed while in case of fe3o4 ac removal of cr vi reached 95 5 within 45 min from the start of the experiment after which it became constant with no further removal similarly 85 5 cu ii was removed within 90 min whereas 96 5 cd ii was removed within 120 min in case of cr vi and cd ii ions high removal efficiencies were achieved at early stage of the experiment as 89 4 and 74 5 removal reached within first 2 0 min after which there was gradual increase till equilibrium time despite the short equilibrium time the experiments were run for 240 min in order to ensure complete adsorption of ions from the solution similar kind of results were reported by wannahari et al 23 who combined activated carbon generated from sugarcane bagasse with magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for the removal of cu ii ions they interpreted that 77 of cu ii was removed at ph 4 0 within 60 min at 50 c and would solve the problem of waste disposal it was observed that the rate of cr vi cu ii and cd ii binding with fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was faster at initial stages which slowed down with the progress of time and remained almost constant after an optimum period or attainment of equilibrium this may be attributed to the quick uptake of ions onto the large surface area of nanoparticles with an increase in the contact time but after equilibrium was achieved the removal efficiency of the metal ions slowed down as the free surface of the nanoparticles decreased due to the increased coverage by the bound ions 65 overall the trend for both the nanoparticles is same i e with the increase in contact time there is an increase in adsorption percentage 4 2 4 temperature dependent studies the effect of temperature on the removal of metal ions by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was studied by varying the temperature in the range of 288 328 k again keeping all other process variables constant the results revealed that the adsorption of ions increased with an increase in temperature fig 9 the adsorption efficiency increased from 42 7 to 72 3 for cr vi 19 to 46 8 for cu ii and 3 3 to 24 4 for cd ii by fe3o4 while in case of fe3o4 ac the increase in adsorption efficiency was observed from 69 7 to 99 9 for cr vi 58 2 to 99 8 for cu ii and 65 4 to 99 8 for cd ii respectively aigbe et al 66 reported that the polypyrolle iron oxide magnetic nanocomposite prepared by them was useful in removing cr vi ions from wastewater the authors found that the highest cr vi removal was 99 2 at following process conditions magnetic field 18 99 mt cr vi concentration 50 mg l 1 ph 2 0 contact time 150 min and temperature 25 c the results indicated that the maximum removal percentage was recorded at 328 k thus suggesting that the adsorption process was endothermic in nature this may be due to the fact that increase in temperature leads to an increase in mobility of the ions which in turn increases the interaction between the ions and the nanoparticles surface 67 although highest removal percentage was obtained at 328 k but 298 k was chosen as the optimum temperature for all the experiments as this temperature is suitable for practical application under field conditions on the basis of the results obtained from sections 4 2 1 to 4 2 4 a table table 4 has been prepared mentioning the conditions required for the highest removal efficiency of synthesized nanocomposites for removal of heavy metals cr vi cu ii and cd ii 4 2 5 thermodynamic studies thermodynamic studies help in predicting whether the adsorption mechanism is physical or chemical in nature the thermodynamic parameters viz standard gibb s free energy δg standard enthalpy δh and standard entropy δs for the removal of cr vi cu ii cd ii by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac were calculated by applying following equations 68 4 δ g r t l n k 5 δ h 0 r t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 ln k 2 k 1 6 δ s 0 δ h 0 δ g 0 t 7 k q e c e where r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the universal gas constant k is the equilibrium constant at temperature t t is the absolute temperature k ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration and qe is the amount of cr vi cu ii cd ii adsorbed on the surface of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac tables 5 and 6 gives the thermodynamic parameters for adsorption of cr vi cu ii cd ii adsorbed on the surface of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac at different temperatures tables 5 and 6 reveals that the negative value of δg signifies that the adsorption process is feasible and spontaneous in nature this is in agreement with the results obtained from the langmuir separation factor rl where the rl values were found between 0 and 1 i e 0 rl 1 and the freundlich exponent n was also greater than 1 with the increase in temperature the value of δg decreased indicating that the increase in temperature was favorable for the adsorption process 69 the positive value of δh signifies that the adsorption process is endothermic and irreversible in nature the positive value of δs signifies that the adsorption process is a combination of the two simple processes i e gibb s free energy δg and standard enthalpy δh moreover the positive values of δs also indicated that the adsorbent surface had the affinity for cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions and the degrees of disorder and randomness was high at the solid solution interface 70 4 2 6 adsorption isotherms batch adsorption data was described using langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson models langmuir adsorption model assumes that an adsorbent contains fixed number of binding sites all the binding sites have same affinity for the adsorbate each site adsorbs only one molecule thus forming a single monolayer the linear form of langmuir model and its separation factor rl is expressed in eqs 8 and 9 8 c e q e 1 q 0 b c e q 0 9 r l 1 1 b c i where qo mg g 1 is the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity and b l mg 1 is the langmuir constant related to free energy the langmuir constants qo and b were calculated from the slope and intercept of the langmuir plot of ce versus ce qe table 4 the value of qo was highest for cr vi by both the nanoparticles i e 8 06 mg g 1 for cr vi 3 2 mg g 1 for cu ii and 2 15 mg g 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 ac while it was 5 5 mg g 1 for cr vi 2 7 mg g 1 for cu ii and 0 09 mg g 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 r2 regression coefficient values were very high being almost unity for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 ac as compared to fe3o4 0 9660 for cr vi 0 8179 for cu ii and 0 7331 for cd ii table 8 the values of langmuir r2 for cd ii by fe3o4 cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 ac were higher than freundlich model thus indicating that langmuir model fitted the data in good congruence thereby indicating monolayer adsorption the tea waste biomass loaded with nano fe3o4 particles tw fe3o4 composite was synthesized by fan et al 71 for the removal of cr vi from aqueous solution the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity was found to be 62 1 mg g 1 by the authors at ph 2 0 contact time 10 h and temperature 25 c the langmuir separation factor rl which is a dimensionless constant indicates whether the adsorption process is favorable or not rl was calculated for the nanoparticles under study using eq 5 where b l mg 1 and ci mg l 1 have already been explained the criterion for favorable adsorption was chosen on the basis of rl values if rl values are greater than 1 0 adsorption is unfavorable if rl values are equal to 1 0 adsorption is linear if rl values are between 0 and 1 adsorption is favorable and if rl values are equal to 0 adsorption is irreversible for the present system the rl values were between 0 and 1 0 01 0 919 for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by both the nanoparticles indicating favorable adsorption process table 8 freundlich adsorption model assumes that adsorbents have a heterogeneous surface having sites with different adsorption potential it also assumes that stronger binding sites are occupied first and the binding strength decreases with the increasing degree of occupation the freundlich adsorption model in its linear form is given in eq 10 10 log 10 q e log 10 k f 1 n log c e 10 where kf mg g 1 is the freundlich constant indicating adsorption capacity n l mg 1 is the adsorption intensity that is the measure of the change in affinity of the adsorbate with the change in adsorption density the freundlich constants kf and n were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ce versus log10 qe table 7 when n 1 freundlich isotherm becomes linear and indicates that all the sites on the nanoparticles have equal affinity for the adsorbate the adsorption intensity n 1 indicates that affinity decreases with the increase in adsorption density and n 1 indicates poor adsorption the adsorption intensity n values were found to be greater than 1 for all the three metal ions under study by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac table 7 the values of r2 in freundlich model for cr vi and cu ii by fe3o4 viz 0 9774 and 0 9483 were higher as compared to langmuir model thus indicating that freundlich model fitted the data well confirming multilayer adsorption the redlich peterson isotherm given by redlich and peterson is a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherms the numerator is from langmuir isotherm and denominator has both langmuir and freundlich forms this model includes three parameters into an empirical equation therefore it can be applied to both homogenous and heterogeneous systems this model does not follow ideal monolayer adsorption the redlich peterson model in its linear form is expressed in eq 11 72 11 ln k r p c e 1 q e ln α r p β ln c e where krp l g 1 and αrp l mg 1 are the redlich peterson constants and β is the exponent which lies between 0 and 1 ce mg l 1 and qe mgg 1 are same as mentioned in eqs 2 and 3 respectively in the langmuir model when the exponent β approaches zero eq 7 converts to henry s law equation i e r p equation approaches to freundlich model at higher concentration and when exponent β approaches one eq 9 converts to langmuir form the value of β lied between 0 and 1 indicating favorable adsorption table 7 4 2 7 adsorption kinetics the rate of reaction and reaction pathways are described by adsorption kinetics which depends upon the physical and chemical characteristics of the adsorbent the adsorption kinetics was described using three models viz pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion model the adsorption in solid liquid system was described by pseudo first order kinetic model lagergren s equation eq 12 this model assumes that one metal ion is sorbed onto one sorption site on the surface of the adsorbent 12 log 10 q e q t log 10 q e k 1 2 303 t where qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium time and qt mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity at time t min and k1 min 1 is the equilibrium rate constant for pseudo first order model the value of k1 is derived from the slope of the linear plots of log qe qt versus time min the values of qe experimental mg g 1 qe calculated mg g 1 k1 min 1 and r2 for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by both the nanosorbents are given in table 9 the table indicates that the values of regression coefficient r2 for pseudo first order model are poor and the calculated qe values are not near to experimental qe values thus indicating a poor fit of this model to our data therefore the adsorption of cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was examined using pseudo second order model the pseudo second order model eq 13 assumes that one metal ion is sorbed onto two sorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent this model has been used for analyzing chemisorption kinetics from liquid solutions k2 g mg 1 min 1 is the equilibrium rate constant and k2qe is the initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min 1 for pseudo second order model the values of 1 k2qe 2 and 1 qe are derived from the intercept and slope of the linear plots of t qt versus time min which leads to calculation of the values of k2 and qe calculated 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t the values of qe experimental mg g 1 qe calculated mg g 1 k2 g mg 1 min 1 and r2 for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac are given in table 9 the table indicates that the values of regression coefficient are near to unity for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by both the nanosorbents and values of qe experimental and qe calculated are almost near to each other thus revealing that pseudo second order model fits the data well as compared to pseudo first order model weber morris model 1963 is employed to further analyze the adsorption kinetics and to assess the importance of diffusion during the adsorption process this model eq 14 describes the movement of ions from bulk solution to the solid phase it assumes that the adsorption process occurs in two steps the first straight portion depicts macropore diffusion i e diffusion of heavy metals from the solution to the exterior surface of the nanosorbent which can be regarded as the external diffusion and the second one represents micropore diffusion diffusion from the surface of the nanosorbent into the pores 14 q t k i d t 0 5 b l where qt is same as above kid is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 which can be obtained from the slope of the straight line slope of the plots between qt and t1 2 and bl is the thickness of the boundary layer obtained from the intercept of the plots between qt and time min the values of kid and bl are given in table 9 larger the value of bl greater is the boundary layer effect if intra particle diffusion occurs then qt against t1 2 will be linear and the line will pass through the origin but in our case the line didn t pass through the origin that means some other process is also involved in the adsorption the intra particle diffusion rate constants calculated from this model are not zero which indicates that the adsorption process may not be controlled by intra particle diffusion model 73 4 2 8 desorption studies the regeneration and reuse of adsorbents has become economically important because of the high cost incurred in wastewater purification systems thus it becomes necessary to check the reusability of the adsorbent for successive sorption desorption cycles for desorption experiments cr cu and cd loaded nanoparticles were first washed three times with deionized water in order to remove any loosely attached metal ion from their surface they were then dried in hot air oven at 80 c for 2 h desorption was done using 0 1 m hcl volume of desorbing agent 10 ml for 60 min in 15 ml disposable capped tubes at 26 1 c and agitation speed of 180 rpm on a rotary shaker hydrochloric acid is commonly used for eluting metal ions from adsorbents because of its frequent use in industry relatively low cost and solubility of metal ions in it 74 the nanoparticles were separated by a strong magnet and the supernatant was collected for measuring of metal concentration in the solution residual concentration of metal ions in the solution was determined in a similar way as in the adsorption experiments the reusability of the nanoparticles was tested by following the above adsorption desorption process up to four cycles for cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions fig 10 the metal recovery was calculated by the following eq 15 15 desorption efficiency amount of metal ion desorbed amount of metal ion sorbed 100 fig 10 depicted that desorption efficiency decreased with each sorption desorption cycle desorption efficiency of cu ii and cd ii was found to be fairly high for first cycle i e 80 6 and 83 9 respectively but quiet low for cr vi i e 21 3 by fe3o4 ac which reduced gradually with the proceeding cycles while the desorption efficiency was high for cu ii and cd ii it was substantially low for cr vi this may be due to the reason that cr vi might be chemically bonded with the fe3o4 ac thus restricting its desorption it was found that 0 1 m hcl was quite effective in desorbing cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions from the surface of nanosorbents the obtained results verified that the fe3o4 nanoparticles synthesized with co precipitation process can be recovered effectively for the re adsorption of the metal ions the regeneration of fe3o4 ac also indicated that adsorption of cr vi cu ii and cd ii on to the fe3o4 ac was a reversible process and the nanoparticles were quiet stable even after four adsorption desorption cycles 4 2 9 comparison of adsorption capacity with other adsorbents the maximum adsorption capacity of fe3o4 ac nanocomposite for the removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii was compared with other adsorbents reported in the literature and the values are given in table 10 it is clear from table 10 that the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 ac nanocomposite is comparable with other nanomaterials suggesting that it is effective in removing cr vi cu ii and cd ii from aqueous solutions 62 75 85 5 conclusion in this article the adsorption potential of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac nanoparticles was investigated for the removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions tem analysis revealed that the synthesized nanoparticles were spherical in nature with an average particle size of 12 9 nm for fe3o4 and 12 3 nm for fe3o4 ac the xrd analysis of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac confirmed the presence of magnetite phase exhibiting average crystal size similar to that indicated by the tem analysis the maximum magnetic strength was found to be 59 3 and 52 2 a m2 kg 1 respectively of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac the optimum adsorption ph was found to be 2 0 for cr vi and 6 0 for cu ii and cd ii respectively the removal efficiency of nanoparticles decreased with an increase in the concentration i e 74 7 20 8 for cr vi 60 0 10 5 for cu ii and 27 4 0 for cd ii by fe3o4 and 98 9 31 7 for cr vi 99 9 12 5 for cu ii and 99 9 8 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 ac the adsorption efficiency for cr vi and cd ii was high in the beginning of the experiments as indicated by 89 4 and 74 5 removal in the first 2 0

heavy metals and dyes has become a major environmental problem and a threat to the well being of living organisms 1 3 heavy metals are non biodegradable persistent carcinogenic and toxic in nature and are widely distributed in the environment they bioaccumulate in living organisms through food chain and their accumulation causes different diseases and malfunctions cadmium chromium and copper are among few heavy metals that are discharged from several industrial effluents cadmium is liberated into the environment from steel production cement manufacture ni cd battery manufacture cadmium electroplating phosphate fertilizers etc 4 according to the world health organization who 5 guidelines the maximum concentration for cadmium in drinking water was set at 0 003 mg l 1 in 2010 zaini et al 6 reported that bivalent cadmium causes several deformities in humans such as muscular cramps pulmonary problems renal degradation proteinuria skeletal deformity testicular atrophy etc hexavalent chromium is another heavy metal in the environment released from various sources like electroplating leather tanning mining textile and fertilizer industries it is toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic to human beings and animals 7 8 it causes cancer in digestive tract and lungs epigastric pain nausea diarrhea vomiting and hemorrhage as stated by mohanty group 9 the maximum permissible limit for hexavalent chromium in drinking water is 0 05 mg l 1 10 copper is another essential element that is required for the synthesis of enzymes tissues and bone development the sources of copper from various industries include smelting mining electroplating surface finishing electric appliances electrolysis and electrical components 11 it is toxic and carcinogenic when ingested in large amounts and causes headache vomiting nausea liver and kidney failure respiratory problems and abdominal pain 12 13 the maximum permissible limit set by usepa for the release of copper in industrial effluents is 1 3 mg l 1 thus the effluents containing such kind of heavy metals which are harmful to the living organisms must be treated before discharging into ambient environment in this regard nanotechnology has been the focus of researchers since a couple of years iron oxide nanotechnology has been gaining the attraction of research society in solving the environment related problems 14 15 this is because iron oxide is very useful in removing various kinds of air water and soil contaminants through adsorption and photo degradation in addition to this the deteriorating quality of water has led the researchers to use iron oxide nanoparticles as new generation adsorbents for water treatment 16 iron oxide is great adsorbent as it has high surface area to volume ratio its surface can be modified excellent magnetic properties great biocompatibility ease of separation using external magnetic field reusability and comparatively low cost 17 18 also it can coordinate with other elements due to variable oxidation states despite the above iron oxide has one disadvantage that its particles aggregate due to their large surface to volume ratio and low surface energy 19 20 to control this surface modification is required to ensure the stability of particles surface modification of iron oxide nanoparticles can be performed through coating stabilization and functionalization in surface coating iron oxide attracts water molecules hydrophilicity and doesn t form clusters due to the dispersion of particles 21 the surface modification of iron oxide by activated carbon using coating technique improves their sorption capability because surface coating phenomenon helps in converting the closely packed cubic geometry of magnetic nanoparticles into compact and strong 20 few examples can be found in the literature wherein the surface coated iron oxide nanoparticles have been utilized for the removal of heavy metals and dyes tailored edta di anhydride treated magnetic fe3o4 baker s yeast biomass efb was investigated by xu et al 22 for the removal of pb ii and cd ii ions from aqueous solution wannahari et al 23 reported that sugarcane bagasse derived nanomagnetic adsorbent

aqueous solution using fe3o4 activated carbon nanocomposite was studied by gholamvaisi et al 26 affam et al 27 found that the iron oxide activated carbon composite can remove boron and organics from wastewater in the similar way it has also been found that 28 34 activated carbon iron oxide composite is useful in removing different kinds of contaminants like trinitrophenol phosphate atrazine lead arsenic mercury and methylene blue dye from aqueous solutions it is well documented that agricultural waste has huge scientific social and economic significance as it is abundantly available at no or little cost require simple processing easy to handle and no regeneration is required in 2013 our group 35 treated deseeded sunflower heads with formaldehyde to inhibit leaching of soluble organic matter from lignocellulosic materials these treated sunflower heads fsh were then used for sequestering chromium ions from synthetic and steel industry wastewater the adsorption capacity of fsh was found to be 7 9 mg g 1 for cr vi at ph 2 0 and a temperature of 25 c from synthetic wastewater while the percent removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii from steel industry wastewater was 45 40 8 and 35 1 respectively at their optimum ph i e 2 0 5 0 and 6 0 a review of literature on using sunflower and its parts seed husk seed hull dried leaves stalks for the removal of heavy metals and dyes from wastewater revealed that very limited information is available some of the studies carried out by various researchers are given here in brief sun and xu 36 investigated sunflower stalks for the removal of methylene blue basic red 9 congo red and direct blue 71 from aqueous solutions benaissa and elouchdi 37 evaluated the potential of dried sunflower leaves for removing copper ions from single metal ion solution in a well stirred batch reactor thinakaran et al 38 explored the adsorption of acid violet 17 using activated carbons prepared from sunflower seed hull ssh treated with sulphuric acid at three different temperatures the adsorption efficiency of crushed and uncrushed sunflower husks for removal of methylene blue from aqueous solution was investigated by soldatkina et al 39 sunflower stalks modified by nitric acid activation were used by hussein 40 for the removal of copper from wastewater in batch and fixed bed mode activated carbon via microwave induced k2co3 activation was prepared by foo and hameed 41 from sunflower seed oil residue which is a by product of sunflower seed oil refining industry they utilized it for the removal of methylene blue and acid blue 15 from aqueous solution the sunflower hulls are a waste material that originates from food industry these hulls were used by witek krowiak 42 for the biosorption of cu ii ions from aqueous solution zou et al 43 demonstrated that the activated carbon prepared from sunflower seed hull an abundant agriculture byproduct was highly porous inexpensive and efficient adsorbent for the removal of cr vi feizi and jalali 44 explored sunflower stalks and leaves for the removal of cd cu ni zn mn fe in single and competitive batch mode from aqueous solution saleh and gupta 3 prepared biochar from sunflower seed husk and found its adsorption potential in removing copper ions from wastewater srisorrachatr 45 prepared activated carbons from sunflower seed husks ssh by chemical activation with potassium carbonate and zinc chloride solution followed by carbonization and used them for removal of pb ii ni ii zn ii and cd ii from aqueous solution as it is clear from the review of literature that less research work has been carried out on unmodified sunflower head and stem waste besides this only few studies have been reported on surface modification of iron oxide by using sunflower activated carbon for developing magnetic activated carbon nanocomposite this combination has transformed the sunflower waste into useful magnetic activated carbon sorbents for removing toxic ions from wastewater another advantage is that the loaded adsorbents could be easily separated from the aqueous solution using magnet instead of centrifugation thus conserving energy based on the aforementioned properties agricultural waste sunflower head waste was chosen as a raw material which was combined with iron oxide nanoparticles as it was anticipated that this twofold combination of adsorption and magnetic separation would make the wastewater treatment process ecofriendly effective and economically more attractive in this study material preparation characterization and batch type removal experiments were carried out wherein the feasibility of the above described composite for the removal of heavy metals cr vi cu ii and cd ii from aqueous solution were investigated by varying

preparation of nanoparticles 2 2 1 preparation of activated carbon by sunflower head waste chemical activation method chemical activation can be carried by any of the mineral acids like hcl hno3 h2so4 phosphoric acid as it increases the porosity of the carbon structure during the acid treatment impregnation ratio also strongly affects the characteristics of activated carbon ac as our s was an agricultural waste so it contained large amount of lignin and if the percentage of lignin is more then sulphuric acid activation leads to an increase in bet surface area 46 table 1 depicts that the surface area pore volume and pore width all increased after activation with sulphuric acid as this process leads to an extensive increase in the porosity of the material fig 5 if we compare the surface area of the acs prepared by sulphuric acid phosphoric acid zinc chloride then it was found that the surface area of sulphuric acid treated ac was highest 47 high surface area and pore structure are the basic parameters for an effective adsorbent and these parameters are introduced by chemical activating agents like sulphuric acid activated carbon prepared from sunflower head waste

boiling and cooling was repeated till the supernatant was colorless the washed crushed powder was rinsed with 1 hcl washed again with distilled water till the wash water became colorless the powder

in n2 atmosphere washed with ultra pure water and dried at same conditions as mentioned above the activated carbon namely ac was sieved from the standard mesh of size 250 µm and stored in a vacuum desiccator for further use 2 2 2 preparation of iron oxide activated carbon nanocomposite fe3o4 ac and iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 the iron oxide activated carbon nanocomposite fe3o4 ac was prepared as reported by 14 with some modification a required amount of ac was dispersed in 400 ml solution of 7 8 g of fecl3 6h2o 28 mm and 3 8 g of feso4 7h2o 14 mm with vigorous stirring on a magnetic stirrer at 700 rpm at 70 80 c the naoh 5 0 m solution was added drop wise into the above suspension under vigorous stirring at 80 c until ph raised to 10 11 to precipitate the hydrated iron oxide the suspension was stirred further on a magnetic stirrer at 80 c for 1 0 h next it was aged at room temperature for 24 h the fe3o4 ac nanocomposite were separated by a magnet and washed repeatedly with distilled water and ethanol till neutral ph they were then dried in hot air oven at 80 c for 12 h after drying the nanoparticles were crushed in mortar and pastel and stored in air tight plastic containers for further use in addition the procedure for synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles fe3o4 was similar as mentioned above except that no ac was added 2 3 characterization of nanoparticles 2 3 1 surface area analysis the bet surface area and pore volume of the nanoparticles were measured by bjh desorption method in n2 atmosphere at 77 k in a quantachrome surface area

and ce are same as above v is the volume of solution l and m is the mass of nanoparticles in g used 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of nanoparticles the data indicated that the sunflower head waste shw has a very small surface area 0 99 m2 g 1 with a pore volume of 0 0007 cm3 g 1 table 1 while when shw was converted into activated carbon ac the surface area increased to 25 07 m2 g 1 the surface area of fe3o4 was found to be 47 87 m2 g 1 that further increased to 51 1 m2 g 1 when fe3o4 was coated with ac the phpzc ph at point of zero charge of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was found to be 5 2 and 7 04 respectively adsorbents with diverse type of chemical groups like carboxyl hydroxyl ester aldehyde ketone etc have the ability to bind with metal ions their affinity for metal uptake depends on factors like the number of sites their accessibility chemical form affinity between binding sites and metal ions etc 49 the functional groups and their corresponding frequencies are shown in the ft ir spectra of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac and metal loaded fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac p fig 1 ftir analysis indicated the presence of several strong absorption peaks the presence of infrared absorption peaks at about 530 35 528 42 522 64 568 21 cm 1 in fe3o4 cr cu and cd loaded fe3o4 and 536 14 534 29 538 07 530 67 cm 1 in fe3o4 ac cr cu and cd loaded fe3o4 ac respectively confirmed the presence of iron oxide nanoparticles with respect to characteristic stretching band of fe o onto their surface 24 no other peak was found in fe3o4 thus indicating that it comprised of iron oxide only on the other hand in fe3o4 ac the peak at 2341 29 cm 1 is attributed to aromatic c c the strong c o band at 1037 57 cm 1 due to och3 group indicated the presence of lignin group in the sunflower head which is the characteristic peak of polysaccharides the band at 1585 28 cm 1 in chromium loaded fe3o4 ac may be due to asymmetric stretching of c o bond stretching of aromatic c c bond or due to amide stretching in copper loaded fe3o4 ac the absorption peak at 3423 22 cm 1 may be attributed to nh oh stretching indicating the existence of free and intermolecular bonded hydroxyl group due to alcoholic or phenolic functions and amine group the peak around 1612 28 cm 1 corresponds to c o stretching that may be attributed to lignin aromatic group similarly in cadmium loaded fe3o4 ac the peaks shifted as compared to native nanoparticles p fig 1 the additional peaks at 869 78 cm 1 and 781 07 cm 1 in fe3o4 ac and cr vi loaded fe3o4 ac 862 5 cm 1 in cu ii loaded fe3o4 ac 875 57 cm 1 and 767 57 cm 1 in cd ii loaded fe3o4 ac may be assigned to bending modes of aromatic compounds these changes indicated that the carboxyl amino hydroxyl groups present on the surface of native and metal loaded fe3o4 ac are mainly involved in the adsorption of metal ions the possible adsorption on these nanoparticles may be due to physical adsorption complexation with functional groups 18 50 ion exchange 51 surface precipitation or chemical reaction with surface sites the changes in ftir spectra confirm the complexation of cr vi cu ii and cd ii with functional groups present on the nanoparticles comparison of powder x ray diffraction pxrd patterns of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac q fig 1 samples revealed that the iron oxide nanoparticles in both samples are crystalline in nature and represent the cubic structure modification of fe3o4 magnetite the characteristic diffraction peaks with corresponding miller indices can be observed at 2θ of 30 18 220 35 54 311 43 21 400 54 00 422 57 16 511 and 62 78 440 respectively table 2 as all the observed peaks were assigned to the magnetite phase no peaks for the potential hematite phase could be seen in either of the patterns in addition a very weak broad diffraction hump at 2θ range of 23 was observed in case of fe3o4 ac sample confirming presence of activated carbon on the surfaces of magnetic nanoparticles 35 the crystal size analysis with scherrer equation indicated nearly the same crystal size of both the magnetite nanoparticles 15 21 nm in diameter depending on the direction of the view of the crystal lattice the sem micrographs of fe3o4 fe3o4 ac cr cu cd loaded fe3o4 and cr cu cd loaded fe3o4 ac are shown in fig 2 sem images give an idea about the shape and structure of the nanoparticles under study ac has a tubular and porous structure fig 5a b with smooth surface while images of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac fig 2a and e reveal that the nanoparticles are agglomerated and stuck to each other thus making the surface rough and coarse the surface of the nanosorbents after loading with heavy metals fig 2b c d f g and h became smooth and shiny as visible in the images the adsorption of heavy metals on the surface of nanoparticles was further confirmed by eds detailed morphology and structure of the nanoparticles was further investigated by tem as can be seen in the eds spectra of fe3o4 sample fig 3a it does not contain carbon and weight fraction of iron is 63 8 whereas in fe3o4 ac fig 3e the weight fraction of carbon is 50 9 and iron content is only 18 4 confirmed by the sharp peaks of carbon and iron thus indicating that the activated carbon content was significantly higher than fe3o4 nps moreover e ds spectrum of fe3o4 ac sample showed an additional peak that could be assigned to silicon that might have originated from the plant material partial images of b c d f g and h in fig 3 corresponds to the eds spectra of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac after loading with cr cu and cd respectively the characteristic peaks of cr cu and cd in the spectra revealed that the metal ions bonded well with the surface of the nanoparticles tem images of synthesized fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac nanoparticles along with the particle size distribution in the inset i e selected area diffraction pattern are given in fig 4a b c and d the nanoparticles synthesized by co precipitation method are nearly spherical in shape with an average particle size of 12 9 nm fe3o4 and 12 3 nm fe3o4 ac the particle size of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was in the range of 7 19 nm and 9 18 nm respectively thereby being consistent with xrd analysis see earlier paragraph of same section the magnetic hysteresis loop of iron oxide nanoparticles fig 6 was plotted between field strength t and ratio of magnetic moment to mass j a m2 kg 1 the saturation magnetization i e js a m2 kg 1 that measures the maximum magnetic strength was found to be 59 3 and 52 2 a m2 kg respectively for fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac table 3 js values obtained for both the nanoparticles were lesser than the pure magnetite fe3o4 i e 92 a m2 kg 1 52 although both the nanoparticles are quite similar in their magnetic properties but fe3o4 ac has less saturation magnetization due to the presence of plant biomass in it table 3 however this reduction in magnetization did not affect the attraction by external magnet as fe3o4 ac was still strongly attracted by the external magnet the coercivities hc mt of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac are 5 2 and 3 6 t respectively indicating that the nanoparticles are of ferromagnetic nature table 3 the remnant magnetization jr a measure of the remaining magnetization when the driving field is dropped to zero is 5 3 and 4 0 a m2 kg 1 for fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac respectively table 3 thus fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac with high saturation magnetization values can quickly respond to the external magnetic field thereby leading to their fast separation from the aqueous solution of heavy metal the data indicated that both the specimens show similar hysteresis parameters table 3 and fig 6 the tga dtg analysis was performed to identify the thermal behavior and stability of the nanoparticles in the nitrogen atmosphere tga was used to determine the thermal stability of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac by monitoring the weight change that occurred when the samples were heated in an inert atmosphere of n2 fig 7 showed the mass loss tga and derivative mass loss dtg curves of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac in fig 7 fe3o4 showed two step degradation as indicated by the dtg peaks the observed maximum weight loss occurred at first peak i e at around 65 c which was attributed to the loss of moisture the second peak at 270 c in the temperature range of 175 400 c with a further weight loss of 1 7 corresponded to the removal of chemically bound moisture above 400 c only negligible change in mass 0 55 was observed indicating that no further reactions occurred until 1000 c thereby iron oxide being the sole residue with residual mass of 96 at the end of the degradation on the other hand the degradation of fe3o4 ac occurred in four distinct stages as indicated by the dtg peaks the first weight loss below 175 c was mainly due to the loss of moisture a second peak at around 276 c with very low weight loss within 175 387 c was found due to the thermal degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose 53 between 387 and 787 c a third peak with a loss of 8 4 was due to the devolatilization of more thermally stable heavy volatiles present in fe3o4 ac 54 the fourth stage was from 787 to 969 c in which the slow weight loss was due to the pyrolysis of lignin in biomass 55 57 at the end of temperature 999 2 c the final residual mass of 77 7 was identified which might be the representative of materials including iron oxide and some other carbonaceous residuals 4 2 batch adsorption studies 4 2 1 ph dependent studies the effect of ph fig 8a b c and d on the adsorption of cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was studied in order to determine the optimum adsorption ph of the above said ions in the ph range of 2 0 7 0 while screening the ph values all the other process variables such as initial metal ion concentration 50 mg l 1 nanoparticle dose 50 mg 10 ml temperature 26 1 c shaking speed 180 rpm and contact time 3 h were kept constant a control experiment was also run in the absence of nanoparticles for the removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii to explore the effect of chemical precipitation fig 8c performed control experiment revealed that there was no removal of cr vi cd ii up to ph 7 0 and cu ii up to ph 6 0 but when the ph was 6 0 for cu ii and 7 0 for cd ii and cr vi all the three ions precipitated as hydroxides cr oh 2 cu oh 2 and cd oh 2 in the solution thus leading to their complete removal keeping this in view the adsorption studies were conducted in the ph range of 2 0 7 0 for cr vi and cd ii and 2 0 6 0 for cu ii as cu ii precipitated at ph 7 0 and cr vi and cd ii precipitated at ph 8 0 fig 8a and b display that maximum removal of cr vi was achieved at ph 2 0 and that of cu ii and cd ii was at ph 6 0 in case of fe3o4 it was observed that cr vi removal decreased 58 5 11 6 as ph was increased from 2 0 to 7 0 whereas cu ii and cd ii removal increased from 0 to 26 2 and 2 6 to 8 4 respectively when the ph was increased from 2 0 to 6 0 while the percentage removal decreased from 95 3 to 10 3 in case of cr vi it increased from 0 to 85 6 and from 5 5 to 96 5 for cu ii and cd ii respectively when fe3o4 ac was used in the given ph range indicating higher removal efficiency of fe3o4 ac over fe3o4 it can be assumed that it was the presence of different functional groups on the surface of activated carbon that led to the increased binding of more ions as suggested by jain et al 49 one way to explain the mechanism of cr vi removal is that at lower ph the surface of the nanoparticle is positively charged due to adsorption of h ions from the aqueous solution the chromium ions co exist in different forms viz hcro4 cr2o7 2 cr3o10 2 cr4o13 2 of which hcro4 predominates in the ph range of 1 0 6 0 and chromate ions cro4 2 exists at ph 6 0 58 this leads to an electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nanoparticles surface and negatively charged chromate ions thus leading to an increase in the removal at lower ph ph 2 0 scheme 1 the decrease in the removal at higher ph may be due to competition between chromate cro4 2 and hydroxyl ions oh for adsorption on the surface of the nanoparticles so the most probable mechanism for adsorption of chromium on the surface of nanoparticles is electrostatic attraction repulsion 59 the adsorption was highest at ph 2 0 for cr vi on both the nanoparticle specimens and therefore ph 2 0 was chosen as the optimum ph for forthcoming experiments the adsorption of cu ii and cd ii was less at lower ph but increased with the increase in ph this behavior may be due to the reason that lower ph leads to an abundance of hydronium ions h3o in the solution that causes competition between hydronium ions and cu ii or cd ii ions copper and cadmium ions are present as cu2 cu oh cd2 and cd oh at lower ph for adsorption onto nanoparticles thereby lowering the overall adsorption efficiency of these metal ions at lower ph 60 similar kind of results were reported by ianos et al 61 who synthesized iron oxide carbon nanocomposite for the removal of acid blue 129 dyes from simulated wastewater they found that the adsorption capacity of acid blue at ph 2 3 was 4 mg g 1 on the other hand at higher ph values the functional groups present on the surface of the nanoparticles like carboxylic acid hydroxyls phenol are deprotonated thus creating negative sites on the nanoparticles this leads to an electrostatic attraction between these negatively charged adsorption sites and positively charged cu2 and cd2 ions thus increasing their adsorption 62 since the adsorption was highest at ph 6 0 for both cu2 and cd2 it was chosen as the optimum ph for both these ions the point zero charge ph phpzc plays an important role while studying the effect of ph fig 8d at ph phpzc the surface of the nanoparticles is positively charged and at ph phpzc the surface of the nanoparticles is negatively charged because the phpzc values were found to be 5 2 and 7 04 respectively for fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac it can be stated that the surface of these nanoparticles was positively charged below phpzc 5 2 and 7 04 this confirmed that the hydrogen chromate ions were adsorbed through electrostatic attraction and cu2 and cd2 were repelled due to electrostatic repulsion between the two while the surface of the nanoparticles was negatively charged above phpzc 5 2 and 7 04 this led to the electrostatic repulsion between the nanoparticles surface and chromate ions and electrostatic attraction between nanoparticles surface and cu2 and cd2 ions 4 2 2 metal ion concentration dependent studies the effect of initial metal ion concentration by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac at concentration varying from 10 to 500 mg l 1 keeping all other process variables constant see details in ph dependent studies is depicted in fig 8 e and f the figures revealed that the metal removal by both the nanoparticles decreased as the metal ion concentration in the solution was increased from 10 to 500 mg l 1 in the solution the metal removal efficiency decreased from 74 7 to 20 8 for cr vi 60 0 10 5 for cu ii and 27 4 0 for cd ii in case of fe3o4 and 98 9 31 7 for cr vi 99 9 12 5 for cu ii and 99 9 8 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 ac our results are in agreement with kera et al 63 who fabricated magnetic polypyrrole ppy polyaniline pani iron oxide fe3o4 nanocomposite for the removal of cr vi this nanocomposite was efficient in removing 99 of cr vi from aqueous solution at ph 2 0 initial metal ion concentration of 100 mg l 1 and a nanocomposite dose of 0 05 g however overall adsorption capacity of all the three metal ions increased on both the nanoparticles with an increase in concentration it increased from 0 4 to 5 2 mg g 1 for cr vi 0 3 2 6 mg g 1 for cu ii but no adsorption capacity for cd ii in case of fe3o4 whereas a similar trend was observed by fe3o4 ac i e 0 5 8 0 mg g 1 for cr vi 0 5 3 0 mg g 1 for cu ii and 0 5 2 0 mg g 1 for cd ii this could be explained on the basis that the ionic radii 0 95 å of cd ii was high among the three ions moreover fe3o4 doesn t contain any of the functional groups present on fe3o4 ac thus cd ii couldn t have access to the pores of the adsorbent so it couldn t be removed the decrease in removal efficiency with an increase in metal ion concentration may be due to the fact that as the concentration of metal ion increases increasingly more surface sites are covered and hence at higher metal ion concentration the adsorption capacity of the nanoparticles get exhausted due to non availability of free binding sites thus resulting in a decrease in the overall removal efficiency 64 it is therefore evident that at low concentration ranges the percentage of adsorption is high because of the availability of more active sites on the surface of nanoparticles the increase in adsorption capacity can be explained on the basis that an increase in initial metal ion concentration led to an increase in diffusion of cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions from the solution phase to the surface of the nanoparticles due to an increase in the driving force of the metal ions which lead to the collisions between metal ions and the nanoparticles surface thus resulting in an increase in adsorption capacity 22 4 2 3 contact time dependent studies next the effect of contact time on the removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was investigated to determine the optimum time taken to attain the equilibrium fig 8g and h the adsorption experiments were carried out by varying the contact time between 2 and 240 min keeping all other process variables constant fig 8g and h depicts that removal percentage increased with an increase in the contact time the equilibrium was achieved within 60 120 and 30 min for cr vi cu ii and cd ii respectively by fe3o4 the removal efficiency increased from 30 4 to 58 3 for cr vi 17 7 to 26 4 for cu ii and 4 4 to 8 2 for cd ii by fe3o4 after which it became constant and further removal of these metal ions was not observed while in case of fe3o4 ac removal of cr vi reached 95 5 within 45 min from the start of the experiment after which it became constant with no further removal similarly 85 5 cu ii was removed within 90 min whereas 96 5 cd ii was removed within 120 min in case of cr vi and cd ii ions high removal efficiencies were achieved at early stage of the experiment as 89 4 and 74 5 removal reached within first 2 0 min after which there was gradual increase till equilibrium time despite the short equilibrium time the experiments were run for 240 min in order to ensure complete adsorption of ions from the solution similar kind of results were reported by wannahari et al 23 who combined activated carbon generated from sugarcane bagasse with magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for the removal of cu ii ions they interpreted that 77 of cu ii was removed at ph 4 0 within 60 min at 50 c and would solve the problem of waste disposal it was observed that the rate of cr vi cu ii and cd ii binding with fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was faster at initial stages which slowed down with the progress of time and remained almost constant after an optimum period or attainment of equilibrium this may be attributed to the quick uptake of ions onto the large surface area of nanoparticles with an increase in the contact time but after equilibrium was achieved the removal efficiency of the metal ions slowed down as the free surface of the nanoparticles decreased due to the increased coverage by the bound ions 65 overall the trend for both the nanoparticles is same i e with the increase in contact time there is an increase in adsorption percentage 4 2 4 temperature dependent studies the effect of temperature on the removal of metal ions by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was studied by varying the temperature in the range of 288 328 k again keeping all other process variables constant the results revealed that the adsorption of ions increased with an increase in temperature fig 9 the adsorption efficiency increased from 42 7 to 72 3 for cr vi 19 to 46 8 for cu ii and 3 3 to 24 4 for cd ii by fe3o4 while in case of fe3o4 ac the increase in adsorption efficiency was observed from 69 7 to 99 9 for cr vi 58 2 to 99 8 for cu ii and 65 4 to 99 8 for cd ii respectively aigbe et al 66 reported that the polypyrolle iron oxide magnetic nanocomposite prepared by them was useful in removing cr vi ions from wastewater the authors found that the highest cr vi removal was 99 2 at following process conditions magnetic field 18 99 mt cr vi concentration 50 mg l 1 ph 2 0 contact time 150 min and temperature 25 c the results indicated that the maximum removal percentage was recorded at 328 k thus suggesting that the adsorption process was endothermic in nature this may be due to the fact that increase in temperature leads to an increase in mobility of the ions which in turn increases the interaction between the ions and the nanoparticles surface 67 although highest removal percentage was obtained at 328 k but 298 k was chosen as the optimum temperature for all the experiments as this temperature is suitable for practical application under field conditions on the basis of the results obtained from sections 4 2 1 to 4 2 4 a table table 4 has been prepared mentioning the conditions required for the highest removal efficiency of synthesized nanocomposites for removal of heavy metals cr vi cu ii and cd ii 4 2 5 thermodynamic studies thermodynamic studies help in predicting whether the adsorption mechanism is physical or chemical in nature the thermodynamic parameters viz standard gibb s free energy δg standard enthalpy δh and standard entropy δs for the removal of cr vi cu ii cd ii by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac were calculated by applying following equations 68 4 δ g r t l n k 5 δ h 0 r t 1 t 2 t 2 t 1 ln k 2 k 1 6 δ s 0 δ h 0 δ g 0 t 7 k q e c e where r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the universal gas constant k is the equilibrium constant at temperature t t is the absolute temperature k ce mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration and qe is the amount of cr vi cu ii cd ii adsorbed on the surface of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac tables 5 and 6 gives the thermodynamic parameters for adsorption of cr vi cu ii cd ii adsorbed on the surface of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac at different temperatures tables 5 and 6 reveals that the negative value of δg signifies that the adsorption process is feasible and spontaneous in nature this is in agreement with the results obtained from the langmuir separation factor rl where the rl values were found between 0 and 1 i e 0 rl 1 and the freundlich exponent n was also greater than 1 with the increase in temperature the value of δg decreased indicating that the increase in temperature was favorable for the adsorption process 69 the positive value of δh signifies that the adsorption process is endothermic and irreversible in nature the positive value of δs signifies that the adsorption process is a combination of the two simple processes i e gibb s free energy δg and standard enthalpy δh moreover the positive values of δs also indicated that the adsorbent surface had the affinity for cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions and the degrees of disorder and randomness was high at the solid solution interface 70 4 2 6 adsorption isotherms batch adsorption data was described using langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson models langmuir adsorption model assumes that an adsorbent contains fixed number of binding sites all the binding sites have same affinity for the adsorbate each site adsorbs only one molecule thus forming a single monolayer the linear form of langmuir model and its separation factor rl is expressed in eqs 8 and 9 8 c e q e 1 q 0 b c e q 0 9 r l 1 1 b c i where qo mg g 1 is the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity and b l mg 1 is the langmuir constant related to free energy the langmuir constants qo and b were calculated from the slope and intercept of the langmuir plot of ce versus ce qe table 4 the value of qo was highest for cr vi by both the nanoparticles i e 8 06 mg g 1 for cr vi 3 2 mg g 1 for cu ii and 2 15 mg g 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 ac while it was 5 5 mg g 1 for cr vi 2 7 mg g 1 for cu ii and 0 09 mg g 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 r2 regression coefficient values were very high being almost unity for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 ac as compared to fe3o4 0 9660 for cr vi 0 8179 for cu ii and 0 7331 for cd ii table 8 the values of langmuir r2 for cd ii by fe3o4 cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 ac were higher than freundlich model thus indicating that langmuir model fitted the data in good congruence thereby indicating monolayer adsorption the tea waste biomass loaded with nano fe3o4 particles tw fe3o4 composite was synthesized by fan et al 71 for the removal of cr vi from aqueous solution the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity was found to be 62 1 mg g 1 by the authors at ph 2 0 contact time 10 h and temperature 25 c the langmuir separation factor rl which is a dimensionless constant indicates whether the adsorption process is favorable or not rl was calculated for the nanoparticles under study using eq 5 where b l mg 1 and ci mg l 1 have already been explained the criterion for favorable adsorption was chosen on the basis of rl values if rl values are greater than 1 0 adsorption is unfavorable if rl values are equal to 1 0 adsorption is linear if rl values are between 0 and 1 adsorption is favorable and if rl values are equal to 0 adsorption is irreversible for the present system the rl values were between 0 and 1 0 01 0 919 for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by both the nanoparticles indicating favorable adsorption process table 8 freundlich adsorption model assumes that adsorbents have a heterogeneous surface having sites with different adsorption potential it also assumes that stronger binding sites are occupied first and the binding strength decreases with the increasing degree of occupation the freundlich adsorption model in its linear form is given in eq 10 10 log 10 q e log 10 k f 1 n log c e 10 where kf mg g 1 is the freundlich constant indicating adsorption capacity n l mg 1 is the adsorption intensity that is the measure of the change in affinity of the adsorbate with the change in adsorption density the freundlich constants kf and n were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot of ce versus log10 qe table 7 when n 1 freundlich isotherm becomes linear and indicates that all the sites on the nanoparticles have equal affinity for the adsorbate the adsorption intensity n 1 indicates that affinity decreases with the increase in adsorption density and n 1 indicates poor adsorption the adsorption intensity n values were found to be greater than 1 for all the three metal ions under study by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac table 7 the values of r2 in freundlich model for cr vi and cu ii by fe3o4 viz 0 9774 and 0 9483 were higher as compared to langmuir model thus indicating that freundlich model fitted the data well confirming multilayer adsorption the redlich peterson isotherm given by redlich and peterson is a combination of langmuir and freundlich isotherms the numerator is from langmuir isotherm and denominator has both langmuir and freundlich forms this model includes three parameters into an empirical equation therefore it can be applied to both homogenous and heterogeneous systems this model does not follow ideal monolayer adsorption the redlich peterson model in its linear form is expressed in eq 11 72 11 ln k r p c e 1 q e ln α r p β ln c e where krp l g 1 and αrp l mg 1 are the redlich peterson constants and β is the exponent which lies between 0 and 1 ce mg l 1 and qe mgg 1 are same as mentioned in eqs 2 and 3 respectively in the langmuir model when the exponent β approaches zero eq 7 converts to henry s law equation i e r p equation approaches to freundlich model at higher concentration and when exponent β approaches one eq 9 converts to langmuir form the value of β lied between 0 and 1 indicating favorable adsorption table 7 4 2 7 adsorption kinetics the rate of reaction and reaction pathways are described by adsorption kinetics which depends upon the physical and chemical characteristics of the adsorbent the adsorption kinetics was described using three models viz pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion model the adsorption in solid liquid system was described by pseudo first order kinetic model lagergren s equation eq 12 this model assumes that one metal ion is sorbed onto one sorption site on the surface of the adsorbent 12 log 10 q e q t log 10 q e k 1 2 303 t where qe is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium time and qt mg g 1 is the adsorption capacity at time t min and k1 min 1 is the equilibrium rate constant for pseudo first order model the value of k1 is derived from the slope of the linear plots of log qe qt versus time min the values of qe experimental mg g 1 qe calculated mg g 1 k1 min 1 and r2 for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by both the nanosorbents are given in table 9 the table indicates that the values of regression coefficient r2 for pseudo first order model are poor and the calculated qe values are not near to experimental qe values thus indicating a poor fit of this model to our data therefore the adsorption of cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac was examined using pseudo second order model the pseudo second order model eq 13 assumes that one metal ion is sorbed onto two sorption sites on the surface of the adsorbent this model has been used for analyzing chemisorption kinetics from liquid solutions k2 g mg 1 min 1 is the equilibrium rate constant and k2qe is the initial adsorption rate mg g 1 min 1 for pseudo second order model the values of 1 k2qe 2 and 1 qe are derived from the intercept and slope of the linear plots of t qt versus time min which leads to calculation of the values of k2 and qe calculated 13 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 1 q e t the values of qe experimental mg g 1 qe calculated mg g 1 k2 g mg 1 min 1 and r2 for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac are given in table 9 the table indicates that the values of regression coefficient are near to unity for cr vi cu ii and cd ii by both the nanosorbents and values of qe experimental and qe calculated are almost near to each other thus revealing that pseudo second order model fits the data well as compared to pseudo first order model weber morris model 1963 is employed to further analyze the adsorption kinetics and to assess the importance of diffusion during the adsorption process this model eq 14 describes the movement of ions from bulk solution to the solid phase it assumes that the adsorption process occurs in two steps the first straight portion depicts macropore diffusion i e diffusion of heavy metals from the solution to the exterior surface of the nanosorbent which can be regarded as the external diffusion and the second one represents micropore diffusion diffusion from the surface of the nanosorbent into the pores 14 q t k i d t 0 5 b l where qt is same as above kid is the intra particle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 which can be obtained from the slope of the straight line slope of the plots between qt and t1 2 and bl is the thickness of the boundary layer obtained from the intercept of the plots between qt and time min the values of kid and bl are given in table 9 larger the value of bl greater is the boundary layer effect if intra particle diffusion occurs then qt against t1 2 will be linear and the line will pass through the origin but in our case the line didn t pass through the origin that means some other process is also involved in the adsorption the intra particle diffusion rate constants calculated from this model are not zero which indicates that the adsorption process may not be controlled by intra particle diffusion model 73 4 2 8 desorption studies the regeneration and reuse of adsorbents has become economically important because of the high cost incurred in wastewater purification systems thus it becomes necessary to check the reusability of the adsorbent for successive sorption desorption cycles for desorption experiments cr cu and cd loaded nanoparticles were first washed three times with deionized water in order to remove any loosely attached metal ion from their surface they were then dried in hot air oven at 80 c for 2 h desorption was done using 0 1 m hcl volume of desorbing agent 10 ml for 60 min in 15 ml disposable capped tubes at 26 1 c and agitation speed of 180 rpm on a rotary shaker hydrochloric acid is commonly used for eluting metal ions from adsorbents because of its frequent use in industry relatively low cost and solubility of metal ions in it 74 the nanoparticles were separated by a strong magnet and the supernatant was collected for measuring of metal concentration in the solution residual concentration of metal ions in the solution was determined in a similar way as in the adsorption experiments the reusability of the nanoparticles was tested by following the above adsorption desorption process up to four cycles for cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions fig 10 the metal recovery was calculated by the following eq 15 15 desorption efficiency amount of metal ion desorbed amount of metal ion sorbed 100 fig 10 depicted that desorption efficiency decreased with each sorption desorption cycle desorption efficiency of cu ii and cd ii was found to be fairly high for first cycle i e 80 6 and 83 9 respectively but quiet low for cr vi i e 21 3 by fe3o4 ac which reduced gradually with the proceeding cycles while the desorption efficiency was high for cu ii and cd ii it was substantially low for cr vi this may be due to the reason that cr vi might be chemically bonded with the fe3o4 ac thus restricting its desorption it was found that 0 1 m hcl was quite effective in desorbing cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions from the surface of nanosorbents the obtained results verified that the fe3o4 nanoparticles synthesized with co precipitation process can be recovered effectively for the re adsorption of the metal ions the regeneration of fe3o4 ac also indicated that adsorption of cr vi cu ii and cd ii on to the fe3o4 ac was a reversible process and the nanoparticles were quiet stable even after four adsorption desorption cycles 4 2 9 comparison of adsorption capacity with other adsorbents the maximum adsorption capacity of fe3o4 ac nanocomposite for the removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii was compared with other adsorbents reported in the literature and the values are given in table 10 it is clear from table 10 that the adsorption capacity of fe3o4 ac nanocomposite is comparable with other nanomaterials suggesting that it is effective in removing cr vi cu ii and cd ii from aqueous solutions 62 75 85 5 conclusion in this article the adsorption potential of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac nanoparticles was investigated for the removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii ions tem analysis revealed that the synthesized nanoparticles were spherical in nature with an average particle size of 12 9 nm for fe3o4 and 12 3 nm for fe3o4 ac the xrd analysis of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac confirmed the presence of magnetite phase exhibiting average crystal size similar to that indicated by the tem analysis the maximum magnetic strength was found to be 59 3 and 52 2 a m2 kg 1 respectively of fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac the optimum adsorption ph was found to be 2 0 for cr vi and 6 0 for cu ii and cd ii respectively the removal efficiency of nanoparticles decreased with an increase in the concentration i e 74 7 20 8 for cr vi 60 0 10 5 for cu ii and 27 4 0 for cd ii by fe3o4 and 98 9 31 7 for cr vi 99 9 12 5 for cu ii and 99 9 8 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 ac the adsorption efficiency for cr vi and cd ii was high in the beginning of the experiments as indicated by 89 4 and 74 5 removal in the first 2 0 min the conditions for the highest removal efficiency of synthesized nanocomposite for the removal of cr vi cu ii and cd ii were ph 2 0 and 6 0 temperature 25 1 c initial metal ion concentration 50 mg l 1 contact time 60 and 45 min for cr vi by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac 120 and 90 min for cu ii and cd ii by fe3o4 and fe3o4 ac the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity was 8 06 mg g 1 for cr vi 3 2 mg g 1 for cu ii and 2 15 mg g 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 ac while it was 5 5 mg g 1 for cr vi 2 7 mg g 1 for cu ii and 0 09 mg g 1 for cd ii by fe3o4 the desorption efficiency was fairly high in first cycle i e 80 and 83 for cu ii and cd ii which decreased gradually till the fourth cycle in case of cr vi substantially lower desorption efficiency of 23 2 was determined acknowledgement the authors would like

8833,this work investigates the use of a commercial optical product monitor to achieve in line real time water content analysis test fluids were used and optical measurements of attenuation of light intensity at four colours were made these measurements were used to identify any relationship between these and the water quality parameters of turbidity and colour variation in light attenuation for turbidities up to 1700 ntu was successfully resolved by the instrument with optical data for turbidities 20 ntu fitting well the beer lambert model the sensor was also able to clearly identify the effect of filtering out suspended solids with unfiltered samples apparent colour exhibiting significantly higher attenuation coefficients than filtered samples true colour further studies will concentrate on whether the instrument can analyse samples with turbidities higher than 1700 ntu together with further investigating the variation in the attenuation coefficient seen with turbidity and colour of light keywords food manufacturing water consumption water content optical sensor turbidity colour 1 introduction water as a resource has often been neglected when it comes to considering its consumption with many manufacturing companies failing to explore less obvious measures for optimizing their water operations this is usually shown by ad hoc water efficiency efforts based on information that is only monitored on a factory level and assigned to respective process chains via allocation rules 10 however fresh water is a limited resource and increasing pressure on its supplies continued supply uncertainties and costs linked to legislative compliance such as costs relating to wastewater treatment have nowadays led manufacturers to start adding water use reduction in their agendas 14 22 as such water as an industrial commodity must start being increasingly considered as a valuable material that requires a rational and systematic approach for its careful use this is more critical to the food industry where water is widely used as it is involved in many processing methods and unit operations e g for soaking washing rinsing fluming blanching scalding heating pasteurising chilling cooling steam production as an ingredient for general cleaning and sanitation and disinfection purposes 3 18 in fresh water management water quality monitoring is a key tool with water quality being a generic term used to define the general suitability of the water for a specific purpose 9 11 however off line assessment based on application of standard laboratory based methods is typically laborious requiring extensive samples preparation with potential for sample corruption time consuming requiring one to three days to return results as well as involving hazardous reagents 2 4 8 to overcome this in line monitoring no sampling and immediate analysis by means of a rapid and reliable technique that can provide instant feedback would be most beneficial 4 one of the most promising advances in the recent years for in line monitoring is the availability of commercial optical product monitoring equipment the sensors used in this equipment rely on the absorbance fluorescence or scattering properties of materials that are either dissolved or suspended in water 19 a non exclusive list of such sensors is as follows optical density probes in situ microscopes optical biosensors fibre optic sensors surface plasmon sensors refractometers near infrared sensors fluorescence sensors and ultra violet sensors 9 12 24 monitoring technologies within the food industry mainly concentrate on process control ph and conductivity measurements sugar content determination food freshness and detection of microbes and toxins ingredient freshness and food quality including taste focusing especially on quality management during food processing operations this management appears to be one of most critical processes to prevent contamination and improve product safety quality and production hygiene 1 in addition it becomes an even more challenging field when minor components such as flavours vitamins antioxidants natural toxins more or less unwanted toxic heavy metals from soil herbicide or pesticide residues etc have to be detected or in the case of some special clinical problems e g allergies detection of even traces of cross contaminants is required 20 optical sensors e g optical chemical sensors optical biosensors optodes have already been widely used in food industries for food quality measurements e g for detection of glucose and urea bio optodes heavy metal ions optodes utilising immobilised chelating ligands humidity optical humidity sensors multi analysis e g simultaneous determination of humidity and nh3 using single optodes food safety related analytes like chemical contaminants pesticides and drug residues foodborne pathogens and toxins optical fluoro immunosensors surface plasmon resonance spr biosensors optical fibre biosensors 16 17 in such applications optical sensors and bio sensors are suitable as highly selective devices have already been constructed 20 as such optical sensors can indeed be useful in food factories however it may be worth mentioning that some in situ optical sensors may require further characterisation for interferences and correction schemes prior to their widespread use 19 the overall aim of this study was to characterise the capability of optical instrumentation intended to be used together with other sensors in the final implementation for in line characterisation of factory wastewater streams the instrumentation consists of a commercial optical product monitor optical measurements of the attenuation of luminous intensity were carried out and the relationship between this bulk optical property and two fundamental water quality parameters relating to food manufacturing that is turbidity and colour e g olive oil classification by 13 or determination of sunflower oil colour by 15 was investigated to this end the following questions were addressed question 1 what is the range of turbidities the instrument can handle question 2 can it distinguish between true turbidity free samples and apparent turbid samples colour the study was carried out on two test fluids synthetic high turbidity water prepared in the laboratory and used process water collected in different places within a brickyard 2 materials and methods 2 1 beer lambert law when a beam of light falls on a material incident light can be absorbed by its volume scattered light emerging in a different direction from the incident light or transmitted light emerging in the same direction as the incident light the attenuation of light intensity due to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling is summarised as follows 1 i i 0 e α l ln i i 0 α l where i0 initial light intensity and i light intensity after travelling through the material both expressed as radiant intensity or power per unit area l the optical path length depth in mm and α the attenuation coefficient in mm 1 eq 1 is one of the ways of expressing what is known as beer lambert law in the case of water samples attenuation may be due to both scattering and absorption by suspended matter and absorption by dissolved matter 2 2 optical sensor and test rig the commercial optical product monitor in use in the food industry is a mettler toledo inpro 8300 rams unit that is capable of measuring transmitted and back scattered light 180 intensities at four different wavelengths visible red visible green visible blue and near infrared using light emission from eight light emitting diodes led sources and a detector the instrument manual does not identify the exact wavelengths but these are comparable with the wavelengths specified for standard measurement of turbidity and colour for example turbidity measurement standards require a broad spectrum source such as a tungsten lamp emitting in the visible range 400 680 nm violet to red or a narrowband source emitting in the near infrared at 860 nm 23 colour measurement wavelength ranges depend on application such as 465 nm blue for pulp and paper effluent 7 the commercial optical product monitor is directly integrated into a test rig that is constructed from food standard hygienic pipework in the form of a column see fig 1 for the tests the column was filled with static test fluid because of the current structure of the instrument only static fluids can be tested for now however the fact that measurements take place immediately after the sample preparation or collection the samples are shaken well before being emptied into the pipework and the results are taken within seconds the samples do not undertake any alteration eight values in total four relating to back scatter one per wavelength and four relating to transmission at the same four wavelengths were able to be recorded however this work will concentrate only on measurements relating to transmitted light 2 3 test fluids and measurements test fluid 1 was a milk water solution made of commercial full fat milk 0 036 grfat ml 1 and de ionised water stock solution the final concentration was equal to 16 mlmilk l 1 this sample had a turbidity value almost equal to 1700 ntu which was selected to be the highest value to be tested during this experiment based on this stock solution a range of dilutions using de ionised water was made such as 0 de ionised water only 0 5 mlmilk l 1 1 mlmilk l 1 2 mlmilk l 1 4 mlmilk l 1 8 mlmilk l 1 16 mlmilk l 1 stock solution only this fluid was prepared to characterise the dynamic range and sensitivity of the equipment with respect to turbidity and consequently to address question 1 milk water solutions are quite turbid solutions that are very common in food factories in particular in the dairy industry more dilute milk solutions than 0 5 mlmilk l 1 were prepared but rams unit measurements on these are not reported here as the signal to noise ratio was too low due to the low turbidity 20 ntu the second test fluid was surface water that had already been used for cleaning purposes within a brick yard i e used process water even though this clay based sample is not directly related to the food industry it is characterised by a large number of suspended solids that can easily be filtered out together with little dissolved organic contamination it was then ideal to deal with question 2 in particular during these experiments which aim to assess the capability of the instrument samples of this kind of water were collected from different areas within the brickyard prior to their analysis the samples had been left to stabilise for at least one hour and then the supernatant was collected through this procedure the settleable fraction of the suspended solids was removed this fluid was then used to conclude whether the instrument can identify the effect of filtering out suspended solids or whether it can distinguish between true colour turbidity free filtered sample and apparent colour turbid unfiltered sample and consequently to address question 2 measurements had first been made on unfiltered samples then the samples were filtered using a glass microfiber filter a standard one for removal of suspended solids and the tests were repeated the optical measurements were performed at a range of optical path lengths achieved by inserting different window holders into the optical sensor assembly different combinations of the window holders were used to create path lengths of 12 23 31 46 54 and 64 mm each window holder combination could be inserted in two orientations both giving the same path length measurements for each path length reported in this paper were carried out using both orientations as described in the results section regarding off line measurements turbidity was measured using a hach 2100 n turbidimeter and colour was measured using a hazen lovibond pccheckit colorimeter regarding the turbidity values presented in this paper measurements were made and the confidence intervals for 95 confidence level were calculated as follows after allowing readings to settle the nominal reading was taken the confidence interval was calculated assuming standard deviation in the measurement equal to the instrumental accuracy and one degree of freedom i e worst case the instrumental accuracy used was that quoted by the manufacturer 2 of reading plus 0 01 ntu from 0 to 1000 ntu with ratio on regarding colour values presented in this paper only one reading was shown by the instrument and that reading was taken the confidence interval was calculated based on what we did for turbidity values once again the confidence interval used was that quoted by the manufacturer 2 from 0 to 500 hazen 3 results and discussion the inpro 8300 rams unit outputs a current proportional to the light intensity measured by the incorporated optical sensor in the study this current was determined by measuring the voltage across a 500 ω current sensing resistor to calculate the quotient i i 0 for a given fluid under test measurements of current for the fluid under test and deionised water were made and eq 2 applied 2 i i 0 10 om sample 10 om dw where omsample voltage measured with the fluid under test and omdw voltage measured with de ionized water at the same wavelength the figure of 10 v in the equation arises from the operational design of the rams unit 3 1 determination of the dynamic range of turbidity the natural logarithm of i i 0 was calculated and was plotted against the optical path length l at all four wavelengths see fig 2a to d in these figures the measurements appear in pairs for each path length and dilution the two data points of the pair correspond to the two orientations of the optical windows associated with the path length as described in the methodology section the figures show that changing the orientation has little effect on the measured absorption the same is not the case for scatter measurements due to geometric effects associated with the optical assembly and is the reason the scatter measurements have not been analysed in this work the dilution series reported yields turbidity values 20 ntu for which the data fits the beer lambert model very well mostly r2 0 9 the non zero intercept can be attributed to instrumental noise the values of the attenuation coefficient α were then calculated from the slope of the fit for each dilution and led all calculated α values together with off line turbidity values are presented in table 1 as a conclusion it can be said that variation in attenuation of light intensity for turbidity values up to 1700 ntu was successfully resolved by the optical sensor and the more turbid the sample the higher the calculated α value turbidity values are next plotted against α values see fig 3 turbidity is in general the measure of the collective optical properties of a water sample that cause the light to be scattered and absorbed rather than transmitted in straight lines 26 its measurements are then based either on the transmitted light turbidimetry or on the scattered light nephelometry in this work the turbidity values as provided by the bench top turbidimeter are nephelometric nephelometry which relies on measurements of the intensity of scattered light usually of 90 scatter as this detection angle is considered to be very sensitive to particle scatter 23 is the most widely used technique with respect to laboratory turbidimeters on the other hand the attenuation coefficient α as determined by transmission is strongly affected by absorption as well as scatter the subject of the variation of α with turbidity is not further pursued in this work as the aim of the research was to determine the capability of the sensor within a range of concentration of suspended solids and determine its mathematical dynamic range in terms of turbidity however the variation in α value seen with turbidity and colour of light will be subject to further investigation with nephelometric measurements of 180 scatter perhaps able to help with this from table 1 and fig 3 it can additionally be concluded that although the degree of absorption is within the dynamic range of the equipment at all four light colours for turbidity values up to 1700 ntu the variation of α with turbidity in the visible green and visible blue is larger this may be expected as in the blue and green region of the visible spectrum suspended solids absorb larger portions of the incident radiation 21 on the other hand the near infrared range is characterised by low reflectivity and absorptivity and may be more suitable for the analysis of samples that are strongly light scattering 5 to investigate this future work will cover samples with turbidity greater than 1700 ntu for these turbidities it may at some point be seen that long optical paths may not be capable of providing values within the dynamic range even for the green and blue leds so in the future a decision on the correct choice of an optical path based on the concentrations of suspended solids will be made as well as mentioned in the methodology section for very high dilution low turbidity samples 0 5 mlmilk l 1 20 ntu the effect of instrumental noise on absorption measurements was significant as a result if the measurements on high dilution samples are included in the data in fig 2a to d the r2 values are less than 0 9 and for this reason they have been excluded from the plots 3 2 distinguishing between apparent and true colour to address question 2 the attenuation coefficient α was determined both for filtered and unfiltered test fluid 2 samples as expected turbidity after filtration is negligible because of the suspended solids having been removed leaving only the dissolved component indeed as seen in table 2 the bench top turbidimeter detects only noise it can also be seen in table 2 that even before filtration recorded turbidity values are low 20 ntu as the settleable fraction of the suspended solids has been removed due to the consequent high scatter in the measured transmission data in particular for the near infrared and the red only the plots for visible green and visible blue are presented below in fig 4a to d however in general the tests showed that the effect of filtering out suspended solids was clearly identified at all four colours with the turbid unfiltered samples exhibiting significantly higher α values than the turbidity free filtered samples finally the α values obtained in the green and the blue are compared to measurements of true and apparent colour in table 3 true colour includes colour from dissolved matter turbidity has been removed by filtration or centrifugation and apparent colour includes colour both from suspended and dissolved matter 6 as can be seen in the table the turbid unfiltered samples apparent colour exhibit significantly higher α values than the turbidity free filtered true colour samples true colour in water samples is in general attributed to dissolved matter derived from certain organic and inorganic sources for these samples it is mainly due to coloured dissolved organic matter cdom e g humic and fulvic acids from soil which strongly absorbs short wavelengths like visible green and visible blue consequently α values can be resolved in the filtered samples albeit at the limit of experimental resolution at these two colours the ability of the optical instrumentation to deal with colour is quite beneficial considering that foods outside the range of acceptable colour run the risk of being rejected by consumers as colour is not only related to the physical and chemical properties of the product but also to the consumer s perception of what product quality is acceptable 15 3 3 potential uses of the instrumentation the capability of in line sensors to characterise water samples chemically cannot be expected to match that of off line laboratory based methods this drawback is offset by the speed of response and hence the capability of indicating variation of contaminant concentrations with time the potential uses of the optical instrumentation are therefore in managing water usage and in characterising the effects of changes to manufacturing processes and systems designed to improve water efficiency an example would be monitoring the quality of a wastewater stream destined for reuse to ensure it does not exceed safety limits this would help overcome one of the barriers to wastewater reuse particularly in food manufacturing 3 which is variability in the content of the stream for a more detailed discussion of applications see the work by webb et al 25 4 conclusions the capability of optical instrumentation to give in line real time water turbidity and colour analysis was investigated two types of test fluid i e synthetic high turbidity water prepared in the laboratory and used process water collected in different places within a brickyard were used in line measurements of the attenuation of the intensity of light were made at four colours visible red visible green and visible blue and near infrared with a commercial optical product monitor in use in the food industry these measurements were supported by off line water quality parameter measurements turbidity and colour variation in attenuation of the light intensity with optical path length for turbidity values up to 1700 ntu was successfully resolved by the in line instrument for turbidity values 20 ntu the optical data fits the beer lambert model well r2 0 9 so the values of the attenuation coefficient α were calculated from the fits for each dilution and colour the effect of filtering out suspended solids in the used process water was also clearly identified in optical measurements the attenuation coefficient could be resolved in the filtered samples albeit at the limit of experimental resolution for the two colours visible green and visible blue this is consistent with true colour absorption in the used process water being from coloured dissolved organic matter which strongly absorbs short wavelengths the optical instrumentation appears then to have the potential to be extensively used within the food industry where rapid water content measurements of colour and turbidity are required as a measure that will help it to enhance its water sustainability strategy future work will concentrate on further investigating the variation in α value seen with turbidity and colour of light on attempts to increase the dynamic range of the instrument on contractual improvements so that the behaviour of running fluids is tested

8833,this work investigates the use of a commercial optical product monitor to achieve in line real time water content analysis test fluids were used and optical measurements of attenuation of light intensity at four colours were made these measurements were used to identify any relationship between these and the water quality parameters of turbidity and colour variation in light attenuation for turbidities up to 1700 ntu was successfully resolved by the instrument with optical data for turbidities 20 ntu fitting well the beer lambert model the sensor was also able to clearly identify the effect of filtering out suspended solids with unfiltered samples apparent colour exhibiting significantly higher attenuation coefficients than filtered samples true colour further studies will concentrate on whether the instrument can analyse samples with turbidities higher than 1700 ntu together with further investigating the variation in the attenuation coefficient seen with turbidity and colour of light keywords food manufacturing water consumption water content optical sensor turbidity colour 1 introduction water as a resource has often been neglected when it comes to considering its consumption with many manufacturing companies failing to explore less obvious measures for optimizing their water operations this is usually shown by ad hoc water efficiency efforts based on information that is only monitored on a factory level and assigned to respective process chains via allocation rules 10 however fresh water is a limited resource and increasing pressure on its supplies continued supply uncertainties and costs linked to legislative compliance such as costs relating to wastewater treatment have nowadays led manufacturers to start adding water use reduction in their agendas 14 22 as such water as an industrial commodity must start being increasingly considered as a valuable material that requires a rational and systematic approach for its careful use this is more critical to the food industry where water is widely used as it is involved in many processing methods and unit operations e g for soaking washing rinsing fluming blanching scalding heating pasteurising chilling cooling steam production as an ingredient for general cleaning and sanitation and disinfection purposes 3 18 in fresh water management water quality monitoring is a key tool with water quality being a generic term used to define the general suitability of the water for a specific purpose 9 11 however off line assessment based on application of standard laboratory based methods is typically laborious requiring extensive samples preparation with potential for sample corruption time consuming requiring one to three days to return results as well as involving hazardous reagents 2 4 8 to overcome this in line monitoring no sampling and immediate analysis by means of a rapid and reliable technique that can provide instant feedback would be most beneficial 4 one of the most promising advances in the recent years for in line monitoring is the availability of commercial optical product monitoring equipment the sensors used in this equipment rely on the absorbance fluorescence or scattering properties of materials that are either dissolved or suspended in water 19 a non exclusive list of such sensors is as follows optical density probes in situ microscopes optical biosensors fibre optic sensors surface plasmon sensors refractometers near infrared sensors fluorescence sensors and ultra violet sensors 9 12 24 monitoring technologies within the food industry mainly concentrate on process control ph and conductivity measurements sugar content determination food freshness and detection of microbes and toxins ingredient freshness and food quality including taste focusing especially on quality management during food processing operations this management appears to be one of most critical processes to prevent contamination and improve product safety quality and production hygiene 1 in addition it becomes an even more challenging field when minor components such as flavours vitamins antioxidants natural toxins more or less unwanted toxic heavy metals from soil herbicide or pesticide residues etc have to be detected or in the case of some special clinical problems e g allergies detection of even traces of cross contaminants is required 20 optical sensors e g optical chemical sensors optical biosensors optodes have already been widely used in food industries for food quality measurements e g for detection of glucose and urea bio optodes heavy metal ions optodes utilising immobilised chelating ligands humidity optical humidity sensors multi analysis e g simultaneous determination of humidity and nh3 using single optodes food safety related analytes like chemical contaminants pesticides and drug residues foodborne pathogens and toxins optical fluoro immunosensors surface plasmon resonance spr biosensors optical fibre biosensors 16 17 in such applications optical sensors and bio sensors are suitable as highly selective devices have already been constructed 20 as such optical sensors can indeed be useful in food factories however it may be worth mentioning that some in situ optical sensors may require further characterisation for interferences and correction schemes prior to their widespread use 19 the overall aim of this study was to characterise the capability of optical instrumentation intended to be used together with other sensors in the final implementation for in line characterisation of factory wastewater streams the instrumentation consists of a commercial optical product monitor optical measurements of the attenuation of luminous intensity were carried out and the relationship between this bulk optical property and two fundamental water quality parameters relating to food manufacturing that is turbidity and colour e g olive oil classification by 13 or determination of sunflower oil colour by 15 was investigated to this end the following questions were addressed question 1 what is the range of turbidities the instrument can handle question 2 can it distinguish between true turbidity free samples and apparent turbid samples colour the study was carried out on two test fluids synthetic high turbidity water prepared in the laboratory and used process water collected in different places within a brickyard 2 materials and methods 2 1 beer lambert law when a beam of light falls on a material incident light can be absorbed by its volume scattered light emerging in a different direction from the incident light or transmitted light emerging in the same direction as the incident light the attenuation of light intensity due to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling is summarised as follows 1 i i 0 e α l ln i i 0 α l where i0 initial light intensity and i light intensity after travelling through the material both expressed as radiant intensity or power per unit area l the optical path length depth in mm and α the attenuation coefficient in mm 1 eq 1 is one of the ways of expressing what is known as beer lambert law in the case of water samples attenuation may be due to both scattering and absorption by suspended matter and absorption by dissolved matter 2 2 optical sensor and test rig the commercial optical product monitor in use in the food industry is a mettler toledo inpro 8300 rams unit that is capable of measuring transmitted and back scattered light 180 intensities at four different wavelengths visible red visible green visible blue and near infrared using light emission from eight light emitting diodes led sources and a detector the instrument manual does not identify the exact wavelengths but these are comparable with the wavelengths specified for standard measurement of turbidity and colour for example turbidity measurement standards require a broad spectrum source such as a tungsten lamp emitting in the visible range 400 680 nm violet to red or a narrowband source emitting in the near infrared at 860 nm 23 colour measurement wavelength ranges depend on application such as 465 nm blue for pulp and paper effluent 7 the commercial optical product monitor is directly integrated into a test rig that is constructed from food standard hygienic pipework in the form of a column see fig 1 for the tests the column was filled with static test fluid because of the current structure of the instrument only static fluids can be tested for now however the fact that measurements take place immediately after the sample preparation or collection the samples are shaken well before being emptied into the pipework and the results are taken within seconds the samples do not undertake any alteration eight values in total four relating to back scatter one per wavelength and four relating to transmission at the same four wavelengths were able to be recorded however this work will concentrate only on measurements relating to transmitted light 2 3 test fluids and measurements test fluid 1 was a milk water solution made of commercial full fat milk 0 036 grfat ml 1 and de ionised water stock solution the final concentration was equal to 16 mlmilk l 1 this sample had a turbidity value almost equal to 1700 ntu which was selected to be the highest value to be tested during this experiment based on this stock solution a range of dilutions using de ionised water was made such as 0 de ionised water only 0 5 mlmilk l 1 1 mlmilk l 1 2 mlmilk l 1 4 mlmilk l 1 8 mlmilk l 1 16 mlmilk l 1 stock solution only this fluid was prepared to characterise the dynamic range and sensitivity of the equipment with respect to turbidity and consequently to address question 1 milk water solutions are quite turbid solutions that are very common in food factories in particular in the dairy industry more dilute milk solutions than 0 5 mlmilk l 1 were prepared but rams unit measurements on these are not reported here as the signal to noise ratio was too low due to the low turbidity 20 ntu the second test fluid was surface water that had already been used for cleaning purposes within a brick yard i e used process water even though this clay based sample is not directly related to the food industry it is characterised by a large number of suspended solids that can easily be filtered out together with little dissolved organic contamination it was then ideal to deal with question 2 in particular during these experiments which aim to assess the capability of the instrument samples of this kind of water were collected from different areas within the brickyard prior to their analysis the samples had been left to stabilise for at least one hour and then the supernatant was collected through this procedure the settleable fraction of the suspended solids was removed this fluid was then used to conclude whether the instrument can identify the effect of filtering out suspended solids or whether it can distinguish between true colour turbidity free filtered sample and apparent colour turbid unfiltered sample and consequently to address question 2 measurements had first been made on unfiltered samples then the samples were filtered using a glass microfiber filter a standard one for removal of suspended solids and the tests were repeated the optical measurements were performed at a range of optical path lengths achieved by inserting different window holders into the optical sensor assembly different combinations of the window holders were used to create path lengths of 12 23 31 46 54 and 64 mm each window holder combination could be inserted in two orientations both giving the same path length measurements for each path length reported in this paper were carried out using both orientations as described in the results section regarding off line measurements turbidity was measured using a hach 2100 n turbidimeter and colour was measured using a hazen lovibond pccheckit colorimeter regarding the turbidity values presented in this paper measurements were made and the confidence intervals for 95 confidence level were calculated as follows after allowing readings to settle the nominal reading was taken the confidence interval was calculated assuming standard deviation in the measurement equal to the instrumental accuracy and one degree of freedom i e worst case the instrumental accuracy used was that quoted by the manufacturer 2 of reading plus 0 01 ntu from 0 to 1000 ntu with ratio on regarding colour values presented in this paper only one reading was shown by the instrument and that reading was taken the confidence interval was calculated based on what we did for turbidity values once again the confidence interval used was that quoted by the manufacturer 2 from 0 to 500 hazen 3 results and discussion the inpro 8300 rams unit outputs a current proportional to the light intensity measured by the incorporated

8834,in the present study the process parameters affecting biosorption were optimized by adopting analysis of mean anom approach for maximizing the percentage removal of copper and nickel by growing aspergillus sp in batch reactor using taguchi method the process parameters include inoculum concentration initial metal concentration ph and temperature the optimized conditions were found to be 15 v

analysis of variance anova method followed the order concentration of copper nickel inoculum concentration ph temperature the percentage removal of copper and nickel realized in the confirmatory experiments carried out at optimized conditions was found to be higher than that obtained in all the test runs of taguchi design thereby supporting the accuracy of optimization of process parameters under the given set of experimental conditions keywords heavy metal biosorption aspergillus sp optimization taguchi design 1 introduction wastewater generated from various industries such as metal plating storage batteries alloys dying textile fertilizers smelting mining pigment metallurgical etc is a major source of heavy metals the uncontrolled discharge of this wastewater enriched with heavy metals beyond the prescribed standards leads to serious environmental pollution and results in severe health hazards for plants humans and animals 1 4 thus the increased awareness of toxicity of heavy metal and the stringent environmental safety regulations demand the removal of them from the various discharges to avoid contamination of the biological ecosystem several methods such as chemical precipitation ion exchange adsorption and reverse osmosis are the commonly used processes for heavy metal removal from wastewater however these methods suffer from several setbacks in the form of technological and or economic constraints 5 6 among these methods biosorption is considered to be an alternative to the conventional methods for heavy metal removal from industrial wastewater and sewage sludge 7 8 the process offers several advantages such as low operating cost minimal chemical and or biological sludge generation and a higher efficiency in detoxifying dilute effluents 9 of all the micro organisms fungi are well suited for the biosorption process as they exhibit remarkable tolerance towards heavy metals therefore the ability of fungi as biosorbents for heavy metals has been extensively investigated 10 15 the biosorption process has been found to be affected by various factors like ph temperature initial metal concentration of solution type of microorganisms and their functional groups structure etc 15 17 among the various heavy metals copper is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms including humans whereas nickel is an essential trace element present in many species copper occurs naturally in rocks soils sediments water as well as in plants and animals and is involved in biochemical processes such as detoxification and oxidation 18 beyond the permissible levels both the heavy metals are known to be toxic and carcinogenic having serious impact on human health as well as on the ambient environment 19 21 prolonged exposures to copper can cause irritation of the nose mouth and eyes headache stomach ache dizziness vomiting and diarrhea atrophic changes in nasal mucous membranes are diagnosed resulting in metal fume fever because of severe exposure to copper fumes dusts or mists in industries chronic copper poisoning may also result in wilson s disease intentional high uptakes of copper may cause liver and kidney failure resulting in death excessive levels of copper in copper rich soils adversely affect the survival rate of plant life as well as deteriorate the health of animals 22 however the other heavy metal nickel occurs naturally in the molten core of earth sea water and tea leaves etc nickel is an essential element to all the biotic life at lower concentrations however excessive levels of exposure make it quite carcinogenic in addition to various ailments related to heart and thyroid 23 direct contact of nickel may sometimes cause nickel dermatitis with symptoms of skin rashes nickel emissions from various industrial activities become air borne affecting the public health 24 large scale usage of both the heavy metals cu ni in large number of industries manufacturing products ranging electroplated goods electrical appliances metal alloys etc shows the pollution potential of these metals thereby affecting the ambient environment and public health therefore the need of the hour is to alleviate the pollution effects by removal of these heavy metals from heavy metal contaminated wastewaters conventional optimization studies involving variation of one parameter while keeping the other parameters constant is often considered an exhaustive and expensive ordeal however statistical design of experimental methods provide an easier and equally efficient approach to optimize several operational variables the frequently applied experimental design methods include the evolutionary operation response surface methodology 25 27 and taguchi method 28 29 taguchi s optimization technique is a unique and powerful optimization discipline that allows optimization with minimum number of experiments the taguchi experimental design reduces cost improves quality and provides robust design solutions the advantages of taguchi method over the other methods are that numerous factors can be simultaneously optimized and more quantitative information can be extracted from fewer experimental trials taguchi methods have been used for optimization in various fields of wastewater treatment barrado et al 30 have reported application of taguchi method for optimizing the conditions for treatment of metal contaminated wastewater studies were also reported on optimization of process parameters for color removal from textile dye effluents 31 the optimization of experimental conditions for recovery of coal fines from the wastewater generated in coal cleaning operation has been reported by chary and dastidar 32 using taguchi method this method can also be applied to designing factorial experiments and analyzing their outcomes 33 therefore we investigate for the remove of copper and nickel ions by growing aspergillus sp was optimized using taguchi method in the present study the biosorption of copper and nickel by the growing aspergillus sp isolated from industrial wastewater was investigated in a batch bioreactor using taguchi experimental design with l9 orthogonal array the study is primarily aimed at statistical optimization of various controllable factors like inoculum concentration initial concentration of heavy metals ph and temperature for maximizing the removal of copper and nickel using analysis of mean anom approach the percentage contribution of each parameter on percentage removal of copper and nickel by biosorption is analyzed by adopting analysis of variance anova approach a confirmation experiment was also carried out at the optimized conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 media and growth condition aspergillus sp used in the present study was cultured over potato dextrose agar pda plates the pda plates of the stock culture were then stored at 4 c the fungal biomass was cultivated in 250ml erlenmeyer flask containing 100ml of growth media of the following composition g l 1 k2hpo4 0 5 nacl 0 5 mgso4 0 5 nh4no3 0 5 yeast extract 5 0 the aspergillus sp was cultivated in 250ml erlenmeyer flask with 100ml working volume at 30 c with shaking at 180rpm a one day old culture 10 v v was used for all the batch biosorption experiments the ph of the growth media was adjusted by using 1n h2so4 and 1n naoh 2 2 batch biosorption experiments 2 2 1 preparation of solutions of copper and nickel stock solutions of cu 1000mgl 1 and ni 1000mgl 1 were prepared by dissolving appropriate quantities of pure metal salt powders cuso4

analytical grade 2 2 2 batch biosorption batch biosorption studies were carried out in 250ml erlenmeyer flasks with working volume of 100ml containing sterile growth media supplemented with heavy

c and 40 c with shaking at 180rpm the samples were drawn at regular time intervals 12h and subsequently centrifuged at 4000rpm for 3min the supernatant fraction from the centrifuging process was then analyzed for residual concentration of metals cu ni using atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer a analyst 200 the settled biomass was separated out and gravimetric analysis was carried out to determine the biomass concentration the process was monitored for 7 days beyond which equilibrium was found to be attained in the metal removal all the experiments were carried out in triplicates 2 3 optimization studies by anom approach in the present experimental investigation four controllable factors were considered with each factor at three levels as shown in table 1 an l 9 orthogonal array designed by taguchi has been used to determine the optimum experimental conditions for maximum removal of heavy metal and the designed experimental runs are given in table 2 to achieve a statistical measure of the process performance signal to noise s n ratio was evaluated in every statistical approach depending on the desired output quality characteristics three types of signal to noise s n ratios are available 1 smaller is better 2 nominal is best and 3 bigger is better 34 since the present study involves maximizing the removal of heavy metal the s n ratio for the case of bigger is better was evaluated as per the formula given below 1 s n 10 log 1 n i 1 n 1 r i 2 where n represents total number of replications of each test run and y i represents the percentage removal of heavy metal realized in replication experiment i carried out under the same experimental conditions of each test run analysis of mean anom statistical approach was adopted to optimize the process parameters in this approach the average value of s n ratio of each parameter at a certain level is evaluated and is mathematically represented as given below 2 m l e v e l i f a c t o r f 1 n f i j 1 n f i s n l e v e l i f a c t o r f j where m l e v e l i f a c t o r f represents the mean of the s n ratio with factor f at level i s n l e v e l i f a c t o r f j represents the value of s n ratio with factor f at level i in its jth appearance in table 3 and is the jth value in table 4 where j 1 2 3 n fi and n fi represents the number of appearances of factor f in level i the mean of the s n ratios of various factors at various levels were determined to construct the s n response table table 4 the optimum process conditions for maximum removal of cu ni were determined from table 4 by identifying the level at which a process parameter has maximum value of s n ratio 2 4 percentage contribution of various factors by anova approach analysis of variance anova statistical method has been used in the present study to determine the percentage contribution of each controllable factor on percentage removal of heavy metal 1 the percentage contribution of each factor ρ f is given by 3 ρ f s s f d o f f v e r s s t x 100 where ss f is the factorial sum of squares and is given by eq 4 4 s s f m n l k 1 l r k f r t in the above equation r t represents the cumulative average of heavy metal removal achieved in the present study and is mathematically represented as 5 r t j 1 m i 1 n r i j m n m in eq 5 represents the number of experiments carried out in the present study and n represents the number of replications of each experiment r i represents the percentage heavy metal removal realized in replication experiment i carried out under the same experimental conditions of each test run in eq 4 r k f is the cumulative average of percentage removal of heavy metal with a certain factor f at k th level and is mathematically represented as 6 r k f 1 n f k j 1 n f k a l e v e l k f a c t o r f j in eq 6 a l e v e l k f a c t o r f j represents the average percentage removal of heavy metal a with a factor f at level k in its jth appearance sequence in table 3 and is the jth value in the percentage heavy metal removal response table shown in table 5 where j 1 2 3 n fk n fk represents number of appearances of factor f at level k in eq 3 doff represents the degrees of freedom for each factor which is obtained by subtracting one from the number of levels of each factor l v er used in eq 3 is the variance of error and is evaluated by eq 7 7 v e r s s t f a d s s f m n 1 ss t appearing in eq 3 eq 7 represents total sum of squares which is given by 8 s s t j 1 m i 1 n r i 2 j m n r t 2 3 results and discussion the average removal of heavy metal r i was determined by taking the average of the heavy metal removal r i realized in experimental runs replicated thrice under the same experimental conditions in the order shown in table 2 the s n ratio in table 3 was evaluated by using eq 1 the average value of s n ratio with a certain parameter at a certain level i e m f a c t o r l e v e l was calculated using eq 2 the evaluated mean s n ratios with various factors at various levels are summarized in the s n ratio response table given in table 4 the heavy metal removal response table table 5 was also constructed in a similar fashion after calculating the cumulative average heavy metal removal with a particular factor at a particular level r k f using eq 6 the above procedure was followed for cu ni separately figs 1 4 show the percentage removal of heavy metal and s n ratio response graphs for copper and nickel at various levels of different parameters under study 3 1 analysis of experimental data fig 1 shows the effect of inoculum concentration v v on percentage removal of cu and ni s n ratio lower percentage removal observed at l1 5 v v inoculum concentration could be due to lower microbial population higher percentage metal removals observed at higher inoculum concentrations of 10 v v l2 and 15 v v l3 might be an outcome of increased microbial colonies similar results were observed for the metal removal by fungal biomass 17 35 the effect of initial metal concentration mg l on percentage removal of cu and ni is shown in fig 2 with an increase in initial metal concentration from l1 50mg l to l3 100mg l the percentage removal of metal decreased due to the inhibitory effect of metal on the growth of the fungal biomass at higher initial metal concentrations the availability of the binding sites present on the surface of the biomass is also reduced because of reduced growth of the fungal biomass the other reason for lower metal removal is the reduced accessibility of available binding sites by metal ions due to the presence of excessive metal ions in the liquid at higher metal concentrations açikel and alp 15 also reported that bioaccumulation of cu and ni depends upon initial concentration of metal as it affects the growth of the rhizopus delemar similar findings were observed for the cu and ni removal by fungal biomass 16 19 fig 3 shows the effect of ph on the percentage removal of cu and ni at lower ph 3 l1 some of the functional groups present on the outer most layer of the fungal biomass may be positively charged and may not interact with metal ions resulting in lower metal removal 35 in a study reported on biosorption of zinc cadmium and lead using living fungal biomass it was also observed that metal biosorption was inhibited below ph 3 0 due to the repulsion between metal cations with the positively charged metal binding ligands on the surface of fungal biomass 36 similarly tian wei et al 37 also reported lower metal removal at lower ph range by penicillium chrysogenum with an increase in ph from l1 ph 3 to l2 ph 4 the percentage metal removal increased due to an increase in the number of surface negative charges at higher ph yakup 38 also attributed the higher metal removal at higher ph to the strong relations of biosorption on the number of surface negative charges which depends on the dissociation of functional groups the decrease in removal of metal above ph 5 is due to the formation of metal hydroxide dönmez and aksu 17 also reported that ph value 4 0 was the optimum condition for maximum growth of kluyveromyces marxianus and copper removal by the organism which is in close agreement with the findings of the present study fig 4 shows the effect of temperature on percentage removal of cu and ni with an increase in temperature from l1 20 c to l3 40 c no significant difference was observed in the percentage metal removal the temperature is an important factor affecting the growth of the organism at lower temperatures enzymatic reactions get affected above certain temperature the proteins are irreversibly damaged and thereby decrease the microbial growth and metabolic activities the minimum and maximum temperatures for the microbial growth reflecting the optimum temperature range vary widely among microorganisms the optimum temperature range for the growth of edible fungi was reported to be 25 35 c 39 sharma and sharma 40 reported 28 30 c as the most favorable temperature range for the growth of trichophyton mentagrophytes and chrysosporium tropicum srivastava and thakur 41 reported that aspergillus sp can grow between 10 and 40 c temperatures similar observations have been reported by other researchers 42 44 in the present study no significant change in the metal removal was observed in the temperature range 20 40 c although 30 c appears to be the optimum temperature for maximum removal of heavy metal 3 2 optimization of process parameters by anom approach according to anom approach the factor level combination at which the s n ratio has the highest value is the optimum condition the factor level combination at which removal of copper is optimum is a3 b1 c2 and d2 i e inoculum concentration 15 initial metal concentration 50mgl 1 ph 4 and temperature 30 c a similar trend is observed for optimum removal of nickel as well 3 3 determination of percentage contribution by analysis of variance for evaluation of the percentage contribution of each factor towards the removal of heavy metal r t was calculated using eq 5 which is found to be 93 30 for copper and 89 44 for nickel the values of r k f and r t were substituted in eq 4 to obtain the factorial sum of squares ssf for each factor and these values were listed in table 6 for copper and nickel the total sum of squares i e ss t was calculated from eq 5 and is found to be 521 89 for copper and 850 67 for nickel the calculated values of ss f and ss t were used in the calculation of variance of error v er using eq 7 the calculated variance of error for copper and nickel is 3 093 and 1 667 respectively the percentage contribution of each factor ρ f was obtained by substituting doff 2 ver ssf and sst in eq 3 the values of which are tabulated in table 6 for copper and nickel separately from the table 6 the percentage influence of the parameters on the removal of copper was found to be in the following order initial metal concentration 45 62 concentration of inoculum 30 40 ph 7 75 temperature 0 83 and on the removal on nickel was found to be in following order initial metal concentration 49 concentration of inoculum 38 4 ph 7 45 temperature 0 10 respectively the initial metal concentration is an important parameter in biosorption as it affects the growth of the organisms 15 16 19 the extent of heavy metal removal is mainly determined by the growth of the organism and therefore the prime importance of initial metal concentration is evident from its higher percentage contribution value inoculum concentration occupies the second place in the order of percentage contribution as the microbial population also determines the extent of metal removal which is evident from a number of studies 17 33 the importance of ph on heavy metal removal by biosorption process has been highlighted by a number of studies 16 17 however the percentage contribution of ph range under examination would come only next to initial metal concentration and inoculum concentration evident from its third place in the order the copper uptake was independent of temperature in the range of 20 45 c 45 in the present study significant change in the heavy metal removal was not observed with changes in temperature the above observation is supported by a lower percentage contribution of temperature towards heavy metal removal a confirmatory experiment carried out under the optimized conditions showed a higher removal of heavy metals cu 98 8 ni 97 9 than that was achieved in all the test runs thereby supporting the accuracy of optimization the table 7 shows the summary of percentage removal of heavy metals realized in all test conditions and that during the confirmation experiment 4 conclusions taguchi experimental design with l9 orthogonal array was used to optimize the process parameters for maximum percentage removal of heavy metals cu ni the optimized experimental parameters were inoculum concentration 15 initial metal cu ni concentration 50mgl 1 ph 4 0 and temperature 30 c the contribution of each parameter towards the percentage removal of copper is of the following order initial metal concentration 45 62 inoculum concentration 30 40 ph 7 75 temperature 0 83 and the contribution of each parameter towards the percentage removal of nickel is of the following order initial metal concentration 49 concentration of inoculum 38 4 ph 7 45 temperature 0 10 the percentage removal of heavy metal realized in the confirmation experiment is higher than all the test runs thus the accuracy of the optimization of process parameters carried out to maximize the percentage removal of heavy metal cu ni is ascertained however a more comprehensive design of experiment technique with more number of experimental runs and more parameters would provide a better understanding of the process of biosorption in addition to the above optimization using a different set of process parameters may further help in the enhancement of process efficacy

8834,in the present study the process parameters affecting biosorption were optimized by adopting analysis of mean anom approach for maximizing the percentage removal of copper and nickel by growing aspergillus sp in batch reactor using taguchi method the process parameters include inoculum concentration initial metal concentration ph and temperature the optimized conditions were found to be 15 v

analysis of variance anova method followed the order concentration of copper nickel inoculum concentration ph temperature the percentage removal of copper and nickel realized in the confirmatory experiments carried out at optimized conditions was found to be higher than that obtained in all the test runs of taguchi design thereby supporting the accuracy of optimization of process parameters under the given set of experimental conditions keywords heavy metal biosorption aspergillus sp optimization taguchi design 1 introduction wastewater generated from various industries such as metal plating storage batteries alloys dying textile fertilizers smelting mining pigment metallurgical etc is a major source of heavy metals the uncontrolled discharge of this wastewater enriched with heavy metals beyond the prescribed standards leads to serious environmental pollution and results in severe health hazards for plants humans and animals 1 4 thus the increased awareness of toxicity of heavy metal and the stringent environmental safety regulations demand the removal of them from the various discharges to avoid contamination of the biological ecosystem several methods such as chemical precipitation ion exchange adsorption and reverse osmosis are the commonly used processes for heavy metal removal from wastewater however these methods suffer from several setbacks in the form of technological and or economic constraints 5 6 among these methods biosorption is considered to be an alternative to the conventional methods for heavy metal removal from industrial wastewater and sewage sludge 7 8 the process offers several advantages such as low operating cost minimal chemical and or biological sludge generation and a higher efficiency in detoxifying dilute effluents 9 of all the micro organisms fungi are well suited for the biosorption process as they exhibit remarkable tolerance towards heavy metals therefore the ability of fungi as biosorbents for heavy metals has been extensively investigated 10 15 the biosorption process has been found to be affected by various factors like ph temperature initial metal concentration of solution type of microorganisms and their functional groups structure etc 15 17 among the various heavy metals copper is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms including humans whereas nickel is an essential trace element present in many species copper occurs naturally in rocks soils sediments water as well as in plants and animals and is involved in biochemical processes such as detoxification and oxidation 18 beyond the permissible levels both the heavy metals are known to be toxic and carcinogenic having serious impact on human health as well as on the ambient environment 19 21 prolonged exposures to copper can cause irritation of the nose mouth and eyes headache stomach ache dizziness vomiting and diarrhea atrophic changes in nasal mucous membranes are diagnosed resulting in metal fume fever because of severe exposure to copper fumes dusts or mists in industries chronic copper poisoning may also result in wilson s disease intentional high uptakes of copper may cause liver and kidney failure resulting in death excessive levels of copper in copper rich soils adversely affect the survival rate of plant life as well as deteriorate the health of animals 22 however the other heavy metal nickel occurs naturally in the molten core of earth sea water and tea leaves etc nickel is an essential element to all the biotic life at lower concentrations however excessive levels of exposure make it quite carcinogenic in addition to various ailments related to heart and thyroid 23 direct contact of nickel may sometimes cause nickel dermatitis with symptoms of skin rashes nickel emissions from various industrial activities become air borne affecting the public health 24 large scale usage of both the heavy metals cu ni in large number of industries manufacturing products ranging electroplated goods electrical appliances metal alloys etc shows the pollution potential of these metals thereby affecting the ambient environment and public health therefore the need of the hour is to alleviate the pollution effects by removal of these heavy metals from heavy metal contaminated wastewaters conventional optimization studies involving variation of one parameter while keeping the other parameters constant is often considered an exhaustive and expensive ordeal however statistical design of experimental methods provide an easier and equally efficient approach to optimize several operational variables the frequently applied experimental design methods include the evolutionary operation response surface methodology 25 27 and taguchi method 28 29 taguchi s optimization technique is a unique and powerful optimization discipline that allows optimization with minimum number of experiments the taguchi experimental design reduces cost improves quality and provides robust design solutions the advantages of taguchi method over the other methods are that numerous factors can be simultaneously optimized and more quantitative information can be extracted from fewer experimental trials taguchi methods have been used for optimization in various fields of wastewater treatment barrado et al 30 have reported application of taguchi method for optimizing the conditions for treatment of metal contaminated wastewater studies were also reported on optimization of process parameters for color removal from textile dye effluents 31 the optimization of experimental conditions for recovery of coal fines from the wastewater generated in coal cleaning operation has been reported by chary and dastidar 32 using taguchi method this method can also be applied to designing factorial experiments and analyzing their outcomes 33 therefore we investigate for the remove of copper and nickel ions by growing aspergillus sp was optimized using taguchi method in the present study the biosorption of copper and nickel by the growing aspergillus sp isolated from industrial wastewater was investigated in a batch bioreactor using taguchi experimental design with l9 orthogonal array the study is primarily aimed at statistical optimization of various controllable factors like inoculum concentration initial concentration of heavy metals ph and temperature for maximizing the removal of copper and nickel using analysis of mean anom approach the percentage contribution of each parameter on percentage removal of copper and nickel by biosorption is analyzed by adopting analysis of variance anova approach a confirmation experiment was also carried out at the optimized conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 media and growth condition aspergillus sp used in the present study was cultured over potato dextrose agar pda plates the pda plates of the stock culture were then stored at 4 c the fungal biomass was cultivated in 250ml erlenmeyer flask containing 100ml of growth media of the following composition g l 1 k2hpo4 0 5 nacl 0 5 mgso4 0 5 nh4no3 0 5 yeast extract 5 0 the aspergillus sp was cultivated in 250ml erlenmeyer flask with 100ml working volume at 30 c with shaking at 180rpm a one day old culture 10 v v was used for all the batch biosorption experiments the ph of the growth media was adjusted by using 1n h2so4 and 1n naoh 2 2 batch biosorption experiments 2 2 1 preparation of solutions of copper and nickel stock solutions of cu 1000mgl 1 and ni 1000mgl 1 were prepared by dissolving appropriate quantities of pure metal salt powders cuso4 7h2o and nicl2 6h2o respectively in double distilled water the solutions of different concentrations were obtained by adequate dilution of the respective stock solutions all the chemicals used were of analytical grade 2 2 2 batch biosorption batch biosorption studies were carried out in 250ml erlenmeyer flasks with working volume of 100ml containing sterile growth media supplemented with heavy metals 50 75 and 100mgl 1 the media was inoculated with one day old culture 5 10 and 15 v v the ph 3 4 and 5 was adjusted by using 1n h2so4 and 1n naoh each flask was incubated at temperature 20 c 30 c and 40 c with shaking at 180rpm the samples were drawn at regular time intervals 12h and subsequently centrifuged at 4000rpm for 3min the supernatant fraction from the centrifuging process was then analyzed for residual concentration of metals cu ni using atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer a analyst 200 the settled biomass was separated out and gravimetric analysis was carried out to determine the biomass concentration the process was monitored for 7 days beyond which equilibrium was found to be attained in the metal removal all the experiments were carried out in triplicates 2 3 optimization studies by anom approach in the present experimental investigation four controllable factors were considered with each factor at three levels as shown in table 1 an l 9 orthogonal array designed by taguchi has been used to determine the optimum experimental conditions for maximum removal of heavy metal and the designed experimental runs are given in table 2 to achieve a statistical measure of the process performance signal to noise s n ratio was evaluated in every statistical approach depending on the desired output quality characteristics three types of signal to noise s n ratios are available 1 smaller is better 2 nominal is best and 3 bigger is better 34 since the present study involves maximizing the removal of heavy metal the s n ratio for the case of bigger is better was evaluated as per the formula given below 1 s n 10 log 1 n i 1 n 1 r i 2 where n represents total number of replications of each test run and y i represents the percentage removal of heavy metal realized in replication experiment i carried out under the same experimental conditions of each test run analysis of mean anom statistical approach was adopted to optimize the process parameters in this approach the average value of s n ratio of each parameter at a certain level is evaluated and is mathematically represented as given below 2 m l e v e l i f a c t o r f 1 n f i j 1 n f i s n l e v e l i f a c t o r f j where m l e v e l i f a c t o r f represents the mean of the s n ratio with factor f at level i s n l e v e l i f a c t o r f j represents the value of s n ratio with factor f at level i in its jth appearance in table 3 and is the jth value in table 4 where j 1 2 3 n fi and n fi represents the number of appearances of factor f in level i the mean of the s n ratios of various factors at various levels were determined to construct the s n response table table 4 the optimum process conditions for maximum removal of cu ni were determined from table 4 by identifying the level at which a process parameter has maximum value of s n ratio 2 4 percentage contribution of various factors by anova approach analysis of variance anova statistical method has been used in the present study to determine the percentage contribution of each controllable factor on percentage removal of heavy metal 1 the percentage contribution of each factor ρ f is given by 3 ρ f s s f d o f f v e r s s t x 100 where ss f is the factorial sum of squares and is given by eq 4 4 s s f m n l k 1 l r k f r t in the above equation r t represents the cumulative average of heavy metal removal achieved in the present study and is mathematically represented as 5 r t j 1 m i 1 n r i j m n m in eq 5 represents the number of experiments carried out in the present study and n represents the number of replications of each experiment r i represents the percentage heavy metal removal realized in replication experiment i carried out under the same experimental conditions of each test run in eq 4 r k f is the cumulative average of percentage removal of heavy metal with a certain factor f at k th level and is mathematically represented as 6 r k f 1 n f k j 1 n f k a l e v e l k f a c t o r f j in eq 6 a l e v e l k f a c t o r f j represents the average percentage removal of heavy metal a with a factor f at level k in its jth appearance sequence in table 3 and is the jth value in the percentage heavy metal removal response table shown in table 5 where j 1 2 3 n fk n fk represents number of appearances of factor f at level k in eq 3 doff represents the degrees of freedom for each factor which is obtained by subtracting one from the number of levels of each factor l v er used in eq 3 is the variance of error and is evaluated by eq 7 7 v e r s s t f a d s s f m n 1 ss t appearing in eq 3 eq 7 represents total sum of squares which is given by 8 s s t j 1 m i 1 n r i 2 j m n r t 2 3 results and discussion the average removal of heavy metal r i was determined by taking the average of the heavy metal removal r i realized in experimental runs replicated thrice under the same experimental conditions in the order shown in table 2 the s n ratio in table 3 was evaluated by using eq 1 the average value of s n ratio with a certain parameter at a certain level i e m f a c t o r l e v e l was calculated using eq 2 the evaluated mean s n ratios with various factors at various levels are summarized in the s n ratio response table given in table 4 the heavy metal removal response table table 5 was also constructed in a similar fashion after calculating the cumulative average heavy metal removal with a particular factor at a particular level r k f using eq 6 the above procedure was followed for cu ni separately figs 1 4 show the percentage removal of heavy metal and s n ratio response graphs for copper and nickel at various levels of different parameters under study 3 1 analysis of experimental data fig 1 shows the effect of inoculum concentration v v on percentage removal of cu and ni s n ratio lower percentage removal observed at l1 5 v v inoculum concentration could be due to lower microbial population higher percentage metal removals observed at higher inoculum concentrations of 10 v v l2 and 15 v v l3 might be an outcome of increased microbial colonies similar results were observed for the metal removal by fungal biomass 17 35 the effect of initial metal concentration mg l on percentage removal of cu and ni is shown in fig 2 with an increase in initial metal concentration from l1 50mg l to l3 100mg l the percentage removal of metal decreased due to the inhibitory effect of metal on the growth of the fungal biomass at higher initial metal concentrations the availability of the binding sites present on the surface of the biomass is also reduced because of reduced growth of the fungal biomass the other reason for lower metal removal is the reduced accessibility of available binding sites by metal ions due to the presence of excessive metal ions in the liquid at higher metal concentrations açikel and alp 15 also reported that bioaccumulation of cu and ni depends upon initial concentration of metal as it affects the growth of the rhizopus delemar similar findings were observed for the cu and ni removal by fungal biomass 16 19 fig 3 shows the effect of ph on the percentage removal of cu and ni at lower ph 3 l1 some of the functional groups present on the outer most layer of the fungal biomass may be positively charged and may not interact with metal ions resulting in lower metal removal 35 in a study reported on biosorption of zinc cadmium and lead using living fungal biomass it was also observed that metal biosorption was inhibited below ph 3 0 due to the repulsion between metal cations with the positively charged metal binding ligands on the surface of fungal biomass 36 similarly tian wei et al 37 also reported lower metal removal at lower ph range by penicillium chrysogenum with an increase in ph from l1 ph 3 to l2 ph 4 the percentage metal removal increased due to an increase in the number of surface negative charges at higher ph yakup 38 also attributed the higher metal removal at higher ph to the strong relations of biosorption on the number of surface negative charges which depends on the dissociation of functional groups the decrease in removal of metal above ph 5 is due to the formation of metal hydroxide dönmez and aksu 17 also reported that ph value 4 0 was the optimum condition for maximum growth of kluyveromyces marxianus and copper removal by the organism which is in close agreement with the findings of the present study fig 4 shows the effect of temperature on percentage removal of cu and ni with an increase in temperature from l1 20 c to l3 40 c no significant difference was observed in the percentage metal removal the temperature is an important factor affecting the growth of the organism at lower temperatures enzymatic reactions get affected above certain temperature the proteins are irreversibly damaged and thereby decrease the microbial growth and metabolic activities the minimum and maximum temperatures for the microbial growth reflecting the optimum temperature range vary widely among microorganisms the optimum temperature range for the growth of edible fungi was reported to be 25 35 c 39 sharma and sharma 40 reported 28 30 c as the most favorable temperature range for the growth of trichophyton mentagrophytes and chrysosporium tropicum srivastava and thakur 41 reported that aspergillus sp can grow between 10 and 40 c temperatures similar observations have been reported by other researchers 42 44 in the present study no significant change in the metal removal was observed in the temperature range 20 40 c although 30 c appears to be the optimum temperature for maximum removal of heavy metal 3 2 optimization of process parameters by anom approach according to anom approach the factor level combination at which the s n ratio has the highest value is the optimum condition the factor level combination at which removal of copper is optimum is a3 b1 c2 and d2 i e inoculum concentration 15 initial metal concentration 50mgl 1 ph 4 and temperature 30 c a similar trend is observed for optimum removal of nickel as well 3 3 determination of percentage contribution by analysis of variance for evaluation of the percentage contribution of each factor towards the removal of heavy metal r t was calculated using eq 5 which is found to be 93 30 for copper and 89 44 for nickel the values of r k f and r t were substituted in eq 4 to obtain the factorial sum of squares ssf for each factor and these values were listed in table 6 for copper and nickel the total sum of squares i e ss t was calculated from eq 5 and is found to be 521 89 for copper and 850 67 for nickel the calculated values of ss f and ss t were used in the calculation of variance of error v er using eq 7 the calculated variance of error for copper and nickel is 3 093 and 1 667 respectively the percentage contribution of each factor ρ f was obtained by substituting doff 2 ver ssf and sst in eq 3 the values of which are tabulated in table 6 for copper and nickel separately from the table 6 the percentage influence of the parameters on the removal of copper was found to be in the following order initial metal concentration 45 62 concentration of inoculum 30 40 ph 7 75 temperature 0 83 and on the removal on nickel was found to be in following order initial metal concentration 49 concentration of inoculum 38 4 ph 7 45 temperature 0 10 respectively the initial metal concentration is an important parameter in biosorption as it affects the growth of the organisms 15 16 19 the extent of heavy metal removal is mainly determined by the growth of the organism and therefore the prime importance of initial metal concentration is evident from its higher percentage contribution value inoculum concentration occupies the second place in the order of percentage contribution as the microbial population also determines the extent of metal removal which is evident from a number of studies 17 33 the importance of ph on heavy metal removal by biosorption process has been highlighted by a number of studies 16 17 however the percentage contribution of ph range under examination would come only next to initial metal concentration and inoculum concentration evident from its third place in the order the copper uptake was independent of temperature in the range of 20 45 c 45 in the present study significant change in the heavy metal removal was not observed with changes in temperature the above observation is supported by a lower percentage contribution of temperature towards heavy metal removal a confirmatory experiment carried out under the optimized conditions showed a higher removal of heavy metals cu 98 8 ni 97 9 than that was achieved in all the test runs thereby supporting the accuracy of optimization the table 7 shows the summary of percentage removal of heavy metals realized in all test conditions and that during the confirmation experiment 4 conclusions taguchi experimental design with l9 orthogonal array was used to optimize the process parameters for maximum percentage removal of heavy metals cu ni the optimized experimental parameters were inoculum concentration 15 initial metal cu ni concentration 50mgl 1 ph 4 0 and temperature 30 c the contribution of each parameter towards the percentage removal of copper is of the following order initial metal concentration 45 62 inoculum concentration 30 40 ph 7 75 temperature 0 83 and the contribution of each parameter towards the percentage removal of nickel is of the following order initial metal concentration 49 concentration of inoculum 38 4 ph 7 45 temperature 0 10 the percentage removal of heavy metal realized in the confirmation experiment is higher than all the test runs thus the accuracy of the optimization of process parameters carried out to maximize the percentage removal of heavy metal cu ni is ascertained however a more comprehensive design of experiment technique with more number of experimental runs and more parameters would provide a better understanding of the process of biosorption in addition to the above optimization using a different set of process parameters may further help in the enhancement of process efficacy
