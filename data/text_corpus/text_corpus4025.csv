20125,there is considerable empirical evidence that using nature based solutions to restore and enhance hydrological processes such as infiltration interception floodplain re connection and water storage is effective at small scales for low to medium probability floods however the performance of systems of spatially distributed nature based solutions at larger scales or under the more extreme flooding expected with climate change has mainly been assessed using modelling the mechanism by which carefully designed nature based solutions can provide naturally adaptive pathways to divert higher flood flows into expandable areas of storage in the landscape has been less formally investigated this paper reports on new hydrometric data collected from one of eighteen small scale accurately monitored micro catchments in cumbria uk to study the effect in more detail the micro catchments have been set up by lancaster environment centre as part of the q nfm project attempting to quantify changes in hydrological responses due to a range of natural flood management measures that have been installed by catchment partners a direct runoff 2d inundation model was setup and calibrated using accurate flow measurements upstream and downstream of new river restoration project in the lowther catchment 2 5 km2 for two large storm events storms ciara and dennis february 2020 it was used to analyse how the storage on the floodplain can expand with flood magnitude and can be enhanced with appropriately designed natural flood management model evidence was then assessed for the same mechanism in the larger uk catchments of eddleston water 70 km2 and culm 280 km2 using the same whole catchment direct runoff modelling approach for both of these large catchments the same expandable field storage is evident and we highlight how this latent property of well designed nature based solutions can complement traditional strategies and provide significant economic benefits over a thirty year appraisal period of the order of 0 7 m keywords nature based solution natural flood management floodplain reconnection climate resilience 1 introduction nature based solutions are considered to provide natural resilience to climate change extremes 25 helping to reduce further warming supporting biodiversity and securing ecosystem services 3 4 8 23 however with little empirical evidence specifically for flood risk reduction at larger scales 6 it is difficult to understand the limits of effectiveness of nbs in combination with other traditional risk reduction measures without relying upon broadscale modelling evidence 11 12 this stems from the difficulty in detecting changes to large catchment responses due to land use management change 9 with environmental variability and uncertainties in modelling hydrological processes as we move from the small scale of 10 km2 where there is stronger supporting evidence for their effectiveness to 100 km2 and 1000 km2 or above 6 16 that is not to say that more accurate measurements of hydrological processes cannot be used to reduce parameter uncertainties and the uncertainties and in the shift in parameter values that we might use in larger scale models to represent changes in hydrological processes resulting from nbs 11 17 this approach is being taken in on going research 24 13 20 and there are now collations of evidence for example of the effective parameter shifts in relation to the additional channel friction represented by manning s n effective parameter incurred through engineered log jams or large woody material 2 that said in recent modelling studies it has been noted that certain types of nbs keep working at higher and higher flows providing landscape storage and additional resilience to climate change 15 this is unlike embankments or defences which provide a design standard of protection which as the loading increases beyond this it could be argued do not keep on working to reduce risk if the phenomenon holds true there are potentially several beneficial impacts on the economics of nbs notably a reduction albeit small across all event magnitudes or probabilities based on the rarity of the event magnitude can lead to a significant long term net present value npv which can complement traditional risk reduction strategies natural adaptation pathways develop from using leaky barriers woody material bunds and floodplain reconnection techniques in order to connect flows of increasing magnitude to field storage 19 but the fact these areas are often expandable is overlooked their integrated impact on attenuating peak flows is complex and there are strong benefits from whole system modelling it can help understand the in combination effects on the performance of a network of nbs taking into account dynamic utilisation of storage synchronisation and also failure 14 21 for the quantum of nbs that is typically being installed in the uk as pilots the peak flow reduction is typically small yet it can be consistent across a wide range of probabilities this results in relatively small reduction in expected average annual flood damages but on integrating the damage versus probability curve and extrapolating into the future with a suitable discounting rate the net present value npv of nbs can be considerable given the assumptions associated with these simulations given parameter uncertainty and model equifinality it is acknowledged that the simulations used for this analysis are one set of many valid ones that will be explored with further work in addition pushing more and more water into expandable areas of storage on the floodplain can help with other integrated measures for example water resources if the areas of new storage are above permeable geology then this can promote additional recharge 2 method 2 1 study area lowther estate working with the eden rivers trust and natural england have developed a series of nbs in some of the small tributaries of the lowther which flows to eamont bridge ny523281 near penrith cumbria and eventually into the eden 2 300 km2 fig 1 shows the location of the stream diversion undertaken in summer 2019 the catchment has an area of 2 5 km2 and an average annual rainfall of approximately 1230 mm with a relatively low base flow index bfihost 0 35 0 55 and variable percentage runoff 27 38 using the flood estimation handbook ih 1999 in addition to the diversion the stream has been allowed to establish its own pathway along the old floodplain similar to a stage zero experiment a a for example see https www jbaconsulting com knowledge hub one of the first restoration schemes of its kind in the uk although here the marshland landscape has not been altered in this unique experiment the lancaster q nfm project has installed at either end of the diversion accurate venturi low obstruction micro flumes and telemetered levels and rainfall sensors shown in figs 2 and 3 the flumes were constructed of fibreglass using the original moulds of the forth river purification board and are pre calibrated to a channel discharge of 430 l s rainfall was measured with an rg3 raingauge connected to an rx3000 telemetry unit onset

be simulated using hec ras 2d b b https www hec usace army mil software hec ras download aspx using the gauges and estimates of hydrological losses to calibrate the model at the upstream end back greenriggs fig 2 and downstream bessy gill fig 3 the locations of which are shown in fig 3 2 2 calibration and validation the rainfall recorded at back greenriggs station was adjusted for hydrological losses using a simple multiplicative factor or runoff coefficient of 0 22 to generate an effective rainfall rainfall generating streamflow rather than being lost to storage and deep seepage into the permeable yoredale geology from the recorded rainfall for storms ciara and dennis which occurred several days apart in february 2020 these were large events in cumbria with 151 8 mm of rainfall in the county in 24 h for storm ciara and flooding in the town of appleby which is also in the wider eden valley a split record calibration validation was undertaken using the calibration of storm ciara and storm dennis for validation the channel newly connected floodplain and wooded areas were given realistic values of the manning s roughness n based on the typical ranges e g 1 5 the input errors and parameter uncertainties will be investigated by the q nfm project in a further paper where thousands of model simulations are undertaken so that the uncertainty in the predictions and hypothesis testing made here can be estimated in more detail the manning s n roughness value for the newly connected floodplain marsh area was initially set at 0 05 including the ponded area in fig 4 with 0 065 for the woodland area at bessy gill having a relatively smooth and open terrain with signs of significant flow movement and ponding these values may change seasonally and through time it would be expected that roughness will increase given the large number of trees that are also being planted on the lowther estate this combination of rainfall losses and roughness provided a reasonable manual calibration at the two gauges fig 5 with an nse performance measure of 0 68 at the more important downstream site providing confidence that the direct rainfall and losses model is a reasonable simulator of the system between the flow gauges it should also be noted that both flow gauges are partially bypassed at very high flows and for this reason the hec ras 2d mesh is queried directly across the location of the flumes in the ras mapper post processing interface as opposed to calibrating against the total flows emerging from the downstream boundary the calibration parameters rainfall loss and manning s n were then used to simulate storm dennis which occurred several days later under similar conditions fig 6 there is an under prediction of the bulge to the main hydrograph at bessy gill downstream and this has been observed in other recorded hydrographs and is likely to be due to greater groundwater influence than currently modelled although the nse was 0 64 and the peak flows were modelled within 6 at the more important downstream site a model cascade has also been setup for this catchment using dynamic topmodel feeding predicted runoff into a hec ras 2d model with suitably adjusted internal inflow boundaries see 13 for modelling framework based on fig 6 it is likely that the lateral sub surface transmissivity requires better representation to account for the groundwater influence 2 3 experimental design rather than using the flow diversion to make use of the old channel the example of nbs per se we take this a step further to look to the future scenario where the trees planted on the re connected meadows mature and create greater roughness in the flow pathway this is the situation that we are modelling in the larger catchments discussed in section 3 we then simulate a series of five storms of increasing rainfall and explore how the water stored on the floodplain area increases with rainfall and with nbs measures designed to connect the new channel with the floodplain fig 7 shows the hydrographs at bessy gill with and without nfm for 5 events of different magnitude these are the calibrated effective rainfall factor 0 22 and larger and larger factors up to 1 2 times the rainfall recorded at back greenriggs for storm ciara rainfall these being 0 22 0 5 0 75 1 0 and 1 2 these correspond to a range of increasingly rare probabilities or storms that are increasingly larger than storm ciara the percentage increase between two largest modelled storms 100 rainfall and 120 is also the expected increase in rainfall intensity between 2020 and 2040 assuming 4 degrees of global heating environment agency 10 the volumes on the floodplain were also computed using zonal statistics in gis and we see how the volume keeps increasing with an expanding area of wet floodplain at higher and higher flows table 1 it should be noted that even without assuming any additional floodplain roughness the volume stored on the floodplain increases with storm magnitude so the stream diversion at lowther is already exhibiting resilience when we consider how that volume increases and provides approximately 20 increased storage if we do assume the floodplain increases in roughness over time the increase in storage on the floodplain is visible in fig 8 in the fringes of flooding coloured with red future roughness or nbs scenario around the blue flooding current roughness here we see the link again between peak flow reduction and additional peak flow stored on the floodplain that we are trying to re connect by the simple floodplain re connection action of roughening up the channel and creating a backwater 3 scaling to larger catchments having explored this effect at the detailed micro scale we now compare with

designed encourage out of bank flow and hold back water in the headwaters in total nine different return periods were simulated with and without the distributed nbs measures represented in the mesh either through the use of increased friction or a change in storage in the dtm fig 9 shows how there is a small 5 reduction in each of the simulated design events dashed lines of same colour as solid lines looking for a physical explanation of this a range of plots were made in the upper headwaters such as fig 10 where it is evident that with more rainfall and flows more areas of the floodplain come into play as storage especially where re meandering is concerned fig 11 fig 11 shows the re meandering work at cringletie where the additional floodplain storage before 8700 m3 and after 9216 m3 restoration was estimated using zonal statistics giving an increase in 6 of the original storage for the same event scaling up to the culm catchment 280 km2 a similar story plays out this time when we increase the riparian friction in areas identified in the ea wwnp maps h h https www gov uk government publications working with natural processes to reduce flood risk fig 12 shows the reduction in peak flows with and without climate change for a baseline 100 year return period event and the same event with an increase in rainfall intensity of 20 to represent climate change looking in other headwaters and shading the before and after nfm depth grids the expanding areas of flooding on fields is visible again in the culm landscape fig 13 4 economic analysis returning to the eddleston water catchment the summary of the peak flow reduction fig 9 before and after nbs is given in table 2 with an average of about 5 peak flow reduction based on all the measures in the catchment the depth grids were exported and used to compute the damages with and without the nbs table 3 using vulnerability curves based on the multi coloured manual 22 giving a reduction in 3 5 in the average annual damages this equates to 32 k which may seem small but integrated over a 30 year scheme lifetime and using current acceptable discounting rates over this period this equates to 0 6 m or 0 7 m this is a significant contribution to reducing risk in the long term that comes about by the consistent reduction in the hydrograph across all the probabilities modelled 5 summary and conclusions nature based solutions could help us plan more resilient flood risk management strategies at large scales and for the larger floods expected with climate change considering the expandable nature of upstream field storage present in many catchments it is possible to divert high flows and improve floodplain reconnection to these areas enhancing natural adaptation pathways to climate change the modelling reported in this investigation shows that if designed correctly nbs such as increased riparian roughness or careful use of large woody material can enhance this connection across a wide range of scales understanding the integrated impact of distributed nbs on a whole catchment response is complex and benefits from a whole system modelling approach where different performance issues including performance failure can be properly explored 14 18 the peak flow reduction is often small 5 10 but can occur across a wide range of probabilities this consistent but small reduction also results in relatively small reduction in expected average annual flood damages but on integrating the damage versus probability curve and extrapolating into the future 30 years the net present value of nbs can be significant in relation to other benefits such as carbon sequestration and inline with long term government planning for resilience 7 we have attempted to demonstrate how accurate small scale micro catchment measurements used to calibrate a whole catchment direct rainfall and losses model can add confidence to the hypothesis that expandable areas of floodplain act as adaptation pathways and deliver a degree of climate change resilience we have then demonstrated the implications of this at the larger scale for a 70 km2 and a 280 km2 catchment using the same whole catchment modelling approach for the larger catchments the same resilient properties and expandable field storage are evident when nbs is designed to connect watercourses with the floodplain whether through using lateral

environment have led to rapidly increasing water demands in china however the cost of water supply augmentation by developing engineering infrastructures becomes hardly affordable due to its negative environment impacts in this circumstance china shifted to implement water rights and water market to manage available water resources more efficient in the past decades 1 water rights a prerequisite for water markets are considered as key management instruments to mitigate water shortages by incentivizing water use efficiency 2 4 an effective water rights system not only lays the foundation for a number of strategies in water demand management such as water permitting and withdrawal rights but also helps to provide a level of flexibility to water users and other stakeholders to trade water in a market 5 6 a system of tradable water rights can induce water users to consider the full opportunity cost of water including its value in alternative uses thus providing incentives to efficiently use water and to gain additional income through the sale of saved water 2 finally the develop of water right and water market will enhance the water security by avoiding unsustainable water resources development and providing ecological water release through capping the total water use volume of societies and stimulating their water saving water rights system is becoming increasingly important for world s agricultural productions in the context of recent rising attentions on global food security claiming and materializing the water rights for smallholder irrigators provides a critical basis for a defense of smallholders water uses on food productions against the large scale capitalist plantations which tend to occupy most of the water available during the drought for exported cash crops rather than local food productions 7 9 water rights are also the basis for equitably transferring water from farmers to industries through maintaining equitable compensations to the farmers who have to reduce irrigation water use 10 moreover a water rights system is able to optimize the water energy food nexus through facilitating the constructions of water storage infrastructures for energy and food production it is found that careful negotiation on water use rights downstream of the dams all riparian can be better off with dams than without them permitting all to achieve priority economic development goals 11 12 the most common systems of defining water rights are riparian or overlying rights prior appropriation rights and public allocation or adjudication 13 14 for example water use in the eastern u s has historically been managed by the riparian doctrine to benefit all users adjacent to watercourses conversely the prior appropriation rights were accepted by the water users who were first in time to exercise a water right in the western u s this system provides senior users with their full allocation before junior users are allowed to exercise their rights as a result the risk of curtailment and thus reliability of water supply varies enormously by vintage of water rights although this approach instills security among senior users it is often inefficient as the more effective water users cannot always get water due to their priorities meanwhile senior appropriators have little incentive to develop more efficient uses because they rarely are threatened by a denial of water 15 while in a public allocation system government agencies can decide on the appropriate level of allocation for each use basin wide 14 the rules of the allocation can be based on historical facts such as prior rights on equal shares in available water volumes on individual requirements or even based on political pressure 16 it has to be point out that above are the most common water rights but not an exhaustive list the systems of water rights and market vary across countries duo to the differences on water resources situations legal systems and social backgrounds 17 19 in china the process of water allocation is underpinned by top down water resources planning in which the yields of catchments and the water demands of various stakeholders are defined by hydrological assessments and demand supply balances in a certain period the water allocation in china follows its water management hierarchy from the ministry of water resources mwr to the basin management commissions and then to the provincial and prefectural water resources bureaus with the priority on domestic and industrial water uses over agricultural water demands 20 in times of scarcity during droughts water supply is reduced according to the water use priorities there is a difference between water rights and private ownership in china where a person with a water right does not own the water but owns the right to use the water as the water use is centrally planned formal water markets were rare in china before 2000 s after 2000 china initialized a nationwide program for water rights reform through proposing that china s water resources development starts to transfer from infrastructural constructions by hard engineering way to resources conservancy by soft governance methods 21 23 numerous studies were conducted in the past 20 years to implement a modern water rights system in china through establishing integrated approaches for water rights allocation and trading in the context of the chinese social and economic reality 24 30 robert speed discussed the opportunities for china in implementing a water transfer system through proposing a water rights framework in terms of regional water rights abstractor rights and user level rights 31 wang et al provided an analysis of key factors affecting the formation of a modern water rights system in china basing on a hierarchical framework consisting of decision making entities the entitlement system and mechanisms for adjusting allocations 32 jiang made reform proposals for china to define tradable water rights with adequate security through analyzing the pattern of government involvement in water market including the initialization of tradable water rights and administration of water trading 33 moore scott identified the distinctive features of water policy in china that limit the integration of market mechanisms with administrative and supply augmentation approaches through surveying the status of current water rights trading projects in china 34 zheng et al evaluated the performance of public water rights allocation systems in china through comparing the water rights among 11 river basins of china 35 liu et al summarized the key information of 10 local water markets in china since 2003 and assessed the market resilience 36 despite above studies a practical framework able to clarify the critical elements of a water rights system and to explain the interactions among those elements is still undeveloped in china due to its distinctive social and economic reality and corresponding water policies the relationships among water rights water entitlements water allocation and water withdraw permission water use quota and volume of tradable water are not well understood this is a knowledge gap for china s water management despite the scattered pilot experiences on water rights allocation and trading in the country 37 38 this paper presents a systemic framework and an overall picture of the water rights systems and trading in china the relationships among the shares of annual mean runoff in a catchment the water withdrawal permission the water use cap and the seasonal allocated water quota as well as the tradable water rights are explained for better understating the water reform experiences in china during the past 20 years 2 water rights system and water markets in china 2 1 water rights a water rights system is fundamentally one that identifies the total available resource and divides it via the grant of water rights amongst different users 39 in china water rights are defined by bureaucratic prescription in a public allocation system 4 the annual mean runoff of a river is assessed and shared by the administrative regions within the river basin each region is allocated a volume of water as its annual mean water use quota the water that the regions have rights to use should be limited to their quota the quota can also be divided and allocated to sub regions or individual users within a region to provide sub quotas or water use permits for water use by the sub regions or individual users 40 regional water rights allocation is the most critical part of the current chinese water rights reform it is also the foundation for issuing water use permits to individual users 35 the development of a modern water rights and trading system has been considered as one of china s top strategic priorities since the turn of the century 41 the current progresses of this system are shown in table 1 and fig 1 in which the regional water use quotas of 31 provinces and cities in china are given in table 1 all these quotas were issued and administratively implemented by the state council in 2013 according china s state council in the planning year of 2030 the volumetric water uses of provinces and cities cannot exceed the water use quotas listed in table 1 the geographical distribution of these water use quotas across china is shown in fig 1 these quotas are applied as the red line indicators to control the total water consumptions of china following its recent strictest water resources management system furthermore these water use quotas can also be regarded as the volumetric tradable water rights of regions if a series of conditions are met for example the water withdraw is permitted the source of the withdraw is identified and the water use is monitored etc 2 2 water abstraction permits as mentioned above water rights in china are regarded as a volumetric water use quota or cap for a region down to the county level water rights are entitled to a region such as a province a city or a county through a river basin scale water resources plan the water use of a region is not allowed to exceed its cap represented by the water rights the water uses of water abstractors i e individuals or legal entities in a region are managed through a water abstraction permit system water abstractors including industries and bulk water users such as urban water supply plants and irrigation districts that take water directly from rivers lakes or underground sources must apply for water abstraction permits from local governments exemptions from this requirement exist such as for taking a small quantity of water for domestic purposes and for watering livestock 20 water abstraction permits consist of two elements including 1 the permit documentation this is the material submitted by the applicant and considered by the decision maker the material within the permit documentation will form some of the conditions under which water can be taken it can for example include information on how long the activity and hence the water use will continue which becomes the expiry date for the permit and 2 the abstraction license this is a short simple document and is required before water abstraction can commence licenses are generally granted for between 5 and 10 years their renewal is usually a formality 20 water abstractors are enforced to install water monitoring equipment by themselves and report their abstraction volumes to the administrations a water use unit will be charged according to its maximum daily water abstraction capacity and a penalty such as 5 000 20 000 rmb will be applied if its abstraction is not monitored the mwr and local water departments issue detailed technical guidelines for governing the application and assessment of abstraction permits the terms that must be included in an abstraction license include volume location purpose duration between 5 and 10 years water source and discharge conditions in addition in the process of grating water abstraction permits to stakeholders domestic supply is given the highest priority it is required that the development and utilization of water resources should first satisfy the demands of the urban and rural domestic users and give overall consideration to the agricultural industrial and ecological environment demands for water as well as to the demand of navigation 20 within an irrigation district the permit is usually held by the government agency responsible for administering the district farmers are then supplied their share of the available water under the permit in some areas in northern china a district plan is developed which identifies each farmer or village s share of available water in this process the water rights certificates are granted to famers identifying each farmer s share of the resource this is coupled with a water ticket system 42 under which farmers pre pay for the water they want in a particular year season or watering the surface water rights and water abstraction permits in china are both based on the annual mean runoff of the river the water resources that are actually available in any given year are allocated against water shares water rights and permits in a certain year are not carried over to the next year in irrigation districts in china due to limited reservoir storage the technical capacity for enforcing regulations in the context of hydrologic uncertainty is necessary in water rights systems in particular with regard to addressing fluctuations in supply and curtailment of rights 43 the seasonal allocation is the percentage of users water share volume available under current resource conditions as determined by the resource managers currently the measures of seasonal water allocation are only applied in some arid rivers in china such as the yellow river and the hei river in the gansu province in 2006 regulation on water allocation in the yellow river basin was issued by china s state council this regulation policy initialized a system of season water allocation and authorized the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc to implement the unified operation of all the reservoirs along the main course of the river for seasonal allocations to the riparian regions basing on their entitlement sharing plan of 1987 2 3 water markets 2 3 1 spatial and temporal rules for trading in china water rights water abstraction permits and allocated water are allowed to be traded among regions water use sectors and individual users stakeholders can trade their water rights permanently or for an appointed duration over which the trading contract is applicable for example the validity period of the water entitlements trades between famers and industries in the inner mongolia china is 25 years besides the water rights trading water allocations from permits can be leased or traded for one year that is to say stakeholders can sell their allocated water volume in a given year and revert to their previous water allocations the following year in addition both surface water and groundwater can be traded in china however there is no trad between surface water and groundwater it is not allowed that a stakeholder withdraws a volume of groundwater from its aquifer equaling to the volume of surface water he bought if he was not able to receive the surface water from the reservoirs and channels 2 3 2 trading among regions water entitlement trading between dongyang city and yiwu city in zhejiang province in 2000 was deemed as the first water trading between regions in china in november 2000 two cities dongyang and yiwu in zhejiang province came to an agreement in which yiwu purchased the water supplies of about 50 million cubic meters per year from dongyang s hengjiang reservoir by paying dongyang rmb 200 million yuan the conditions of this trade include 1 the water transfer does not change the original ownership of the reservoir which implies dongyang is still responsible for the reservoir s operation and maintenance 2 yiwu pays rmb 0 1 yuan per cubic meter as a comprehensive management fee to dongyang the fee covers the taxation to government and the cost of the reservoir operation and maintenance 3 yiwu is responsible for the planning and investment of the construction of the water delivery channel from hengjin reservoir to yiwu following the case of water trading between dongyang and yiwu formal water rights trades between regions continuously happened in the past decades including the trades among cities along the middle route of the south to north water diversion project and the trades between beijing and hebei province however this kind of trading is still rare due to the complexity of transferring policies and the high cost of water delivery 2 3 3 trading between sectors in china there are cases of water entitlement trading between agricultural users and industries users concentrated in the ningxia and inner mongolia provinces along the yellow river the trades are conducted between irrigating famers who are able to withdraw water from the yellow river and newly established electricity and core mining factories that do not have water abstraction permits from the yellow river the water transferred to the industries is mainly the volumes of evaporations and leakages saved along the channels from the reservoirs to the fields through lining the earth canals to concrete ones the water consumptions of the famers within the fields are not reduced industries pay for the channel lining and maintaining rather than paying cash to the individual famers the validity period of these trades is 25 years after which the water saving constructions such as concrete lined channel will be expired for use the volume of water saved is calculated by engineering works comparing the water consumptions of the irrigation district before and after channel lining for example in hangjin irrigation district of inner mongolia water entitlement of the district from the yellow river was 375 million cubic meters which was a share from the water entitlement of inner mongolia at 5 86 billion cubic meters since 2003 dozens of industries of electricity and core mining invested rmb 0 7 billion yuan for channels lining and earth leveling in the irrigation district 130 million cubic water was calculated to be saved and transferred to the industries because of these water saving projects after the water trading the water abstraction permit of the district was reduced to 245 million cubic meters in 2007 as the water delivery channels were improved and the water supplies reached the field more rapidly the irrigation consumption in the field was not increased after the water transfer this is the major mode for entitlement trading between agriculture and industry in china according to the china water exchange http cwex org cn 77 trades from agriculture to industry were conducted by the platform of china water exchange from 2016 to 2019 in inner mongolia the total volume of these 77 trades is 2352 million cubic meters all these trades happened in the inner mongolia as the core mining industries expanded dramatically in this area in 2010 s the newly development coal mining enterprises have no water abstraction permission from the yellow river but they are rich enough to invest the agricultural water savings in addition one of the major sellers of these trades is the centre for water rights collection storage and transfer of inner mongolia http www nmgsqjyw com this center is a public company for water trading brokering in the inner mongolia it is to invest the water saving infrastructures or engineering projects of the irrigation districts along the yellow river using the capitals from the government or private investors after implementing the water saving projects the center will collect the saved water from different irrigation districts or small farms and store these water rights to its account intensively finally the center will sell the collected water rights to the industries at a price which is higher than its water saving investments this institute in the inner mongolia is the first regional water rights trading broker in china which is similar to the water bank in the u s industries obtained extra water from irrigation districts by investing in concrete channels and highly efficient irrigating technologies however more efforts are still required to sustain these transfers by identifying whether the transferred water comes from real lasing savings and relevant third party impacts 2 3 4 trading among farmers according to china s state council water users who have saved water under their water entitlements or abstraction permits can sell the water in the market at the individual level an irrigation water market emerged in the shiyang river basin northwestern china in the market a group of famers form a water users association wua and sell the bulk water entitlement or allocation of the wua s to other wuas in the shiyang river basin the area of farm lands of each farmer household is about 2 5 mu per capita about 0 16 ha per capita 44 the location of an individual famer s lands tends to be scattered along the channels of the irrigation district these small and scattered areas of irrigation lands lead to high cost of monitoring water use and quantifying water savings and thus low exchange amounts of irrigation water trading among individual famers in order to reduce the transaction cost the minimum unit for water trading is adopted as a wua in which the numbers of the farmer households are normally equal to a village in the shiyang river basin the water rights granted to the district have been allocated to all the villages since 2008 thus a certain water volume is allocated to each village in the district as its annual water use cap in this case several villages that tended to irrigate more farmlands bought water from other villages other villages with excess water sold water for profits the leaders of wuas in the villages on the behalf of farmers sell water that is saved by group farming plant adjustment and drip irrigation each village normally has one wua the trading activity was spontaneous without supervision from the local governments in early 2008 as more and more villages were involved in the market the water management authority of the irrigation district started to regulate the market to relieve the third party effects of the trades currently the authority checks the applicants water availability canal condition and the price of their bid before approving their trades the price of selling water among villages is limited to three times the price at which the villages paid the authority for annual water at the beginning of the year the purpose of this limitation is to address the unevenness of water supply reliabilities between upstream and downstream users along the channel due to the physical structure of the channel system and the sedimentation users at upstream generally access to water source more easily and thus possess higher supply reliability than downstream it is unfair to the downstream that upstream users sell water to them at an improper high price because the water sold is not only from the savings but also supported by the inherent high supply reliability of the upstream although strong administrative interference exists a preliminary water market has been established in the district villages traded water with each other according to their own willingness if someone does not want to sell the water the government will not force him her if the villages did not use their entire quota and did not sell the excess water to others then the unused water will be removed from their accounts at the end of year different from the use it or lose it policy in the u s wuas water entitlements will not be reduced in the years moving forward if they have unused or unsold water left in the current year for example in xiying irrigation district which is a gravity surface water irrigation area in the shiyang river basin the accumulated volume of surface water traded in the district from 2008 to 2014 was up to 29 194 million cubic meters the cultivated area of the district was 444 900 mu 1 mu 666 67 m2 238 000 of which were active irrigated areas a total of 70 villages were located below the branch canals average price of the water trades in the xiying irrigation district was 0 186 yuan m3 during the aforementioned period around 30 70 trades were conducted each year in the district the average volume of each trade among wuas was approximately 83 7 thousand cubic meters the validity period of all transactions was one year which means that all trades were effective only before the end of the year when they were made long term water entitlement trading was not conducted in the district 40 one of the problems is that the particular farmers who gain or lose water are not the ones paying for or profiting from the trade because the farms are so small and the water trade are kept at the level of wuas rather than individual farmers 38 these may cause the inequity on water allocations among famers within the wua during the water trading it is important to connect the profits as far as possible to the individuals who get more water or less water for their farms 38 moreover the transaction cost also rises in the process of negotiations among farmers to sell their group water rights the democracy within a wua and its cost should be balanced when trading water between wuas information technology was used in the shiyang river basin to increase the transparency of trades and to reduce the transaction cost through developing an online platform for formalizing and publishing the process of offers and bids 2 3 5 trading platforms or brokers water trading platforms or broker institutes are encouraged by the china state government at the national level china launched its national water exchange in beijing in 2016 jointly founded by the ministry of water resources and the beijing government china water exchange cwex is expected to facilitate water rights trading by providing services such as trading consultations market evaluations intermediary services and public services 45 by the end of 2019 a total of 329 transactions involving 2889 million cubic meters were recorded on the china water exchange http cwex org cn of which 88 transactions of 2872 million cubic meters were trans regional and inter sectoral water rights trades the remaining 241 trades of 17 million cubic meters were trades between irrigators furthermore most of the trans regional and inter sectoral transactions occurred along the yellow river and the middle line of the south to north water transfer project as shown in fig 2 including 77 transactions of 2352 million cubic meters 81 of the total transitions at cwex from agricultural water users to the industries in the inner mongolia along the yellow river 4 transactions of 152 million cubic meters from shanxi and hebei provinces to beijing and 3 transactions of 324 million cubic meters between the cities along the middle line of the south to north water transfer project cwex currently seems to be a government dominated platform for displaying water exchanges across the country the registration of the website is just available to the organizations or institutes which hold the bulk water rights rather than the publics or individual water users furthermore water buyers and sellers currently tend to conduct trades through local trading brokers such as the centre for water rights collection storage and transfer of inner mongolia rather than directly making the bids and offers through the cwex the trading results are only published by cwex on its website this is mainly because that most of current water trades in china occurred at local level such as the trades between agriculture and industry along the yellow river and the trades among farmers in the irrigation districts there is a preference of the stakeholders to trade water through local water agencies which directly provide the water allocation and monitor the usage these are different from the trading platforms used in other countries such as the waterpool https www waterpool org au of water partners aust ltd victoria australia the waterpool platform uses the allocation bank account in the victorian water register that provides water entitlement available water allocation and usage volume of the user it trades allocation water through a pooled exchange at a price driven by the market the registration of the platform remains open to anyone in sum current framework of water rights system in china consisting of water rights water abstraction permits and water market is shown in fig 3 3 lessons for improving china s water rights and water market system 3 1 detailing entitlement sharing from catchment and regional levels down to the individual users water entitlement sharing in china means sharing the annual mean runoff among the riparian regions in a river basin the volumetric shares of the regions are recognized as their long term water rights which are demonstrated in their water abstraction permissions the shares are equal to the water use quotas of the regions which are used to cap their water withdraws in addition each region is required to allocate its share to sub regions such as provinces to cities cities to towns and towns to factories and individual users currently china s mwr has identified the water entitlement shares of 31 provinces in the country in some provinces the water entitlement has been allocated down to the individual users for example in the shiyang river basin of gansu province the annual runoff of the river has been shared by the riparian regions since 2007 afterwards the regions allocated their water shares down to the individual farmers through suppling the irrigation demands of about 2 5 mu 1 mu 666 67 m2 farmland per capita in the basin however most of the provinces have not allocated the shares down to cities and towns not even mention of individual users it is necessary to further allocate the provinces bulk water entitlements to the sub regions and individual users only in this way the water rights system can be well established for water market of actual users rather than the trading between regional governments 3 2 expanding the application of seasonal water allocation at national wide water entitlement sharing is not enough to regulate the water withdraws without seasonal allocation according to the experiences of the yellow river basin the seasonal water allocation plays an essential role in regulating the water use quotas for users in a given year otherwise the users tend to maximize their water withdraws up to their shares of the annual mean runoff this leads to the shortage of supply in dry seasons however only few basins have season water allocation systems that are recognized by the mwr such as in the yellow river and hei river basin in gansu provinces in which the state council has issued the regulations and political documents to implement the seasonal water allocation there are few regulations from state level on seasonal water allocations in other basins a framework or national wide policy for season water allocation in china is required for improving its water rights system 3 3 better design of the water market 3 3 1 removing the barriers on water pricing in the market there are still barriers on water pricing or biding in current water market of china for example in the yellow river basin the industries obtained water from irrigation districts through lining the channels from the reservoirs to the fields rather than paying cash to the farmers in this case the price of water trading was calculated on the base of the cost of channel lining the famers were not involved in the market and did not have the chance for biding on the other hand in the irrigation water trading among wuas in the shiyang river basin the irrigation authority checked the applicants water availability canal condition and the price of their bid before approving their trades the price of selling water among villages was limited to three times the price at which the villages paid the authority for annual water at the beginning of the year the stakeholders price and biding activate are currently heavily influenced by the china s governments causing the reduction of the trading benefits it is important to reduce the interference from the governments and remove the barriers on water price to further develop more active and beneficial water market in china 3 3 2 accounting for the third party impacts the third party impacts of water trading are not fully recognized in china s water market for example in the yellow river basin the water trading was conducted between agricultural users and industrial users through channel lining and water saving in the irrigation districts since 2003 most of the channels of the irrigation district in the inner mongolia along the yellow river have been lined from the earth canals to the concrete canals the water leakage to the groundwater was dramatically reduced because of the channel lining this will definitely impact the ecosystems such as the trees and the downstream lakes relying on the groundwater supplied by the leakage flows from the channels this impact is poorly understood in the water trading of the yellow river there are insufficient insights on the impacts on ecological system sustainability in the irrigation district due to the limited observations and researches the third party impacts of water trading are required to be assessed in current water market of china third party impacts of water trading are generally considered in the u s under no injury or no harm rules such rules require that trades do not result in injury or harm to third party uses such as impairing habitat function or the quantity or timing of flows to existing water rights holders while these rules are necessary and well intentioned they are sometimes applied in such a manner that makes it difficult to trade water in practice lengthy environmental impact reviews or case by case evaluation can cause significant delay in reviewing and approving transfers because many water transfers are time sensitive such delays can thwart trades altogether programs that have transparent trading rules appear to strike the appropriate balance between evaluating third party impacts and approving trades in a timely manner the trading rules will typically be codified and publicly available for anyone to understand under what conditions a trade will be approved or denied 3 3 3 improving democracy and public involvement in bulk water trading among regional governments currently the major water trades in china are between the regional governments or between the irrigation districts and industries such as one government of a region sells its bulk water entitlement to another regional government there are rare democracy process and relevant public involvements in these trading actives the governments should publish the details of the water trading and let the public know that the bulk water entitlements belong to them has been traded by the government on the behalf of them and the benefits from water selling is fairly used by the government 4 conclusion a framework for describing water rights systems and trading programs are presented in this paper there are three key elements in the framework including 1 water rights sharing 2 water abstraction permits water rights certificates and seasonal allocations and 3 water markets the water rights and trading systems in china are presented basing on this framework in china a person with a water right does not own the water but owns the right to use the water the relevant government agency can decide on the appropriate level of water allocation for each use basin wide generally prioritize domestic and industrial water demands over agricultural water demands this is known as public allocation in the chinese context the public allocation is the major system of defining water rights in china basing on this water rights are defined by bureaucratic prescription in which transboundary water resources are allocated to riparian regions through a top down planning process dominated by catchment authorities and regional governments moreover water rights and allocations are not carried over to the next year in irrigation districts due to limited reservoir storage in china formal water market was established after 2000 through a series of water rights allocation and trading pilot projects which were regulated top down by the central government water market reform now has become a national initiative led by ministry of water resources currently a majority of water trading cases is between agricultural users and industries users along the yellow river the water transferred to the industries is mainly the volumes of evaporations and leakages saved along the channels from the reservoirs to the fields through lining the earth canals to concrete ones by contrast the exchange amounts of irrigation water trading among individual famers is quite low due to the small and scattered areas of irrigation lands leading to high cost of monitoring water use and quantifying tradable water savings the third party impacts of water trading are generally not well considered in china s water market because lengthy environmental impact reviews or case by case evaluation can cause significant delay in reviewing and approving transfers it is necessary that transparent trading rules should be used to strike the appropriate balance between evaluating third party impacts and approving trades in a timely manner in sum the water rights and market system in china has made significant progress during the past decade managing water resources sustainability based on the water rights has become a national wide consensus in china although there are still many difficulties in establishing a national water rights system the main concern is how to deal with the relationship between the market and the government under china s administrative context in other word it is how to stimulate the market enthusiasm and reduce transaction costs under the water abstraction permits and trading administrative supervision there are two points that china s existing practices on dealing with above questions are meaningful for the other countries one is to encourage water rights trading between industry and agriculture because the larger trading profits can offset the transaction costs second internet technology and online trading platform is useful to assist in internal agricultural water rights transactions to reduce the transaction cost among farmers several suggestions for improving china s water rights and trading systems are provided including 1 detailing entitlement sharing from catchment and regional levels down to the individual users 2 expanding the application of seasonal water allocation at national wide 3 removing the barriers on water pricing in the market 4 accounting for the third party impacts and 5 improving democracy and public involvement in bulk water trading among regional governments credit authorship contribution statement hang

world s agricultural productions in the context of recent rising attentions on global food security claiming and materializing the water rights for smallholder irrigators provides a critical basis for a defense of smallholders water uses on food productions against the large scale capitalist plantations which tend to occupy most of the water available during the drought for exported cash crops rather than local food productions 7 9 water rights are also the basis for equitably transferring water from farmers to industries through maintaining equitable compensations to the farmers who have to reduce irrigation water use 10 moreover a water rights system is able to optimize the water energy food nexus through facilitating the constructions of water storage infrastructures for energy and food production it is found that careful negotiation on water use rights downstream of the dams all riparian can be better off with dams than without them permitting all to achieve priority economic development goals 11 12 the most common systems of defining water rights are riparian or overlying rights prior appropriation rights and public allocation or adjudication 13 14 for example water use in the eastern u s has historically been managed by the riparian doctrine to benefit all users adjacent to watercourses conversely the prior appropriation rights were accepted by the water users who were first in time to exercise a water right in the western u s this system provides senior users with their full allocation before junior users are allowed to exercise their rights as a result the risk of curtailment and thus reliability of water supply varies enormously by vintage of water rights although this approach instills security among senior users it is often inefficient as the more effective water users cannot always get water due to their priorities meanwhile senior appropriators have little incentive to develop more efficient uses because they rarely are threatened by a denial of water 15 while in a public allocation system government agencies can decide on the appropriate level of allocation for each use basin wide 14 the rules of the allocation can be based on historical facts such as prior rights on equal shares in available water volumes on individual requirements or even based on political pressure 16 it has to be point out that above are the most common water rights but not an exhaustive list the systems of water rights and market vary across countries duo to the differences on water resources situations legal systems and social backgrounds 17 19 in china the process of water allocation is underpinned by top down water resources planning in which the yields of catchments and the water demands of various stakeholders are defined by hydrological assessments and demand supply balances in a certain period the water allocation in china follows its water management hierarchy from the ministry of water resources mwr to the basin management commissions and then to the provincial and prefectural water resources bureaus with the priority on domestic and industrial water uses over agricultural water demands 20 in times of scarcity during droughts water supply is reduced according to the water use priorities there is a difference between water rights and private ownership in china where a person with a water right does not own the water but owns the right to use the water as the water use is centrally planned formal water markets were rare in china before 2000 s after 2000 china initialized a nationwide program for water rights reform through proposing that china s water resources development starts to transfer from infrastructural constructions by hard engineering way to resources conservancy by soft governance methods 21 23 numerous studies were conducted in the past 20 years to implement a modern water rights system in china through establishing integrated approaches for water rights allocation and trading in the context of the chinese social and economic reality 24 30 robert speed discussed the opportunities for china in implementing a water transfer system through proposing a water rights framework in terms of regional water rights abstractor rights and user level rights 31 wang et al provided an analysis of key factors affecting the formation of a modern water rights system in china basing on a hierarchical framework consisting of decision making entities the entitlement system and mechanisms for adjusting allocations 32 jiang made reform proposals for china to define tradable water rights with adequate security through analyzing the pattern of government involvement in water market including the initialization of tradable water rights and administration of water trading 33 moore scott identified the distinctive features of water policy in china that limit the integration of market mechanisms with administrative and supply augmentation approaches through surveying the status of current water rights trading projects in china 34 zheng et al evaluated the performance of public water rights allocation systems in china through comparing the water rights among 11 river basins of china 35 liu et al summarized the key information of 10 local water markets in china since 2003 and assessed the market resilience 36 despite above studies a practical framework able to clarify the critical elements of a water rights system and to explain the interactions among those elements is still undeveloped in china due to its distinctive social and economic reality and corresponding water policies the relationships among water rights water entitlements water allocation and water withdraw permission water use quota and volume of tradable water are not well understood this is a knowledge gap for china s water management despite the scattered pilot experiences on water rights allocation and trading in the country 37 38 this paper presents a systemic framework and an overall picture of the water rights systems and trading in china the relationships among the shares of annual mean runoff in a catchment the water withdrawal permission the water use cap and the seasonal allocated water quota as well as the tradable water rights are explained for better understating the water reform experiences in china during the past 20 years 2 water rights system and water markets in china 2 1 water rights a water rights system is fundamentally one that identifies the total available resource and divides it via the grant of water rights amongst different users 39 in china water rights are defined by bureaucratic prescription in a public allocation system 4 the annual mean runoff of a river is assessed and shared by the administrative regions within the river basin each region is allocated a volume of water as its annual mean water use quota the water that the regions have rights to use should be limited to their quota the quota can also be divided and allocated to sub regions or individual users within a region to provide sub quotas or water use permits for water use by the sub regions or individual users 40 regional water rights allocation is the most critical part of the current chinese water rights reform it is also the foundation for issuing water use permits to individual users 35 the development of a modern water rights and trading system has been considered as one of china s top strategic priorities since the turn of the century 41 the current progresses of this system are shown in table 1 and fig 1 in which the regional water use quotas of 31 provinces and cities in china are given in table 1 all these quotas were issued and administratively implemented by the state council in 2013 according china s state council in the planning year of 2030 the volumetric water uses of provinces and cities cannot exceed the water use quotas listed in table 1 the geographical distribution of these water use quotas across china is shown in fig 1 these quotas are applied as the red line indicators to control the total water consumptions of china following its recent strictest water resources management system furthermore these water use quotas can also be regarded as the volumetric tradable water rights of regions if a series of conditions are met for example the water withdraw is permitted the source of the withdraw is identified and the water use is monitored etc 2 2 water abstraction permits as mentioned above water rights in china are regarded as a volumetric water use quota or cap for a region down to the county level water rights are entitled to a region such as a province a city or a county through a river basin scale water resources plan the water use of a region is not allowed to exceed its cap represented by the water rights the water uses of water abstractors i e individuals or legal entities in a region are managed through a water abstraction permit system water abstractors including industries and bulk water users such as urban water supply plants and irrigation districts that take water directly from rivers lakes or underground sources must apply for water abstraction permits from local governments exemptions from this requirement exist such as for taking a small quantity of water for domestic purposes and for watering livestock 20 water abstraction permits consist of two elements including 1 the permit documentation this is the material submitted by the applicant and considered by the decision maker the material within the permit documentation will form some of the conditions under which water can be taken it can for example include information on how long the activity and hence the water use will continue which becomes the expiry date for the permit and 2 the abstraction license this is a short simple document and is required before water abstraction can commence licenses are generally granted for between 5 and 10 years their renewal is usually a formality 20 water abstractors are enforced to install water monitoring equipment by themselves and report their abstraction volumes to the administrations a water use unit will be charged according to its maximum daily water abstraction capacity and a penalty such as 5 000 20 000 rmb will be applied if its abstraction is not monitored the mwr and local water departments issue detailed technical guidelines for governing the application and assessment of abstraction permits the terms that must be included in an abstraction license include volume location purpose duration between 5 and 10 years water source and discharge conditions in addition in the process of grating water abstraction permits to stakeholders domestic supply is given the highest priority it is required that the development and utilization of water resources should first satisfy the demands of the urban and rural domestic users and give overall consideration to the agricultural industrial and ecological environment demands for water as well as to the demand of navigation 20 within an irrigation district the permit is usually held by the government agency responsible for administering the district farmers are then supplied their share of the available water under the permit in some areas in northern china a district plan is developed which identifies each farmer or village s share of available water in this process the water rights certificates are granted to famers identifying each farmer s share of the resource this is coupled with a water ticket system 42 under which farmers pre pay for the water they want in a particular year season or watering the surface water rights and water abstraction permits in china are both based on the annual mean runoff of the river the water resources that are actually available in any given year are allocated against water shares water rights and permits in a certain year are not carried over to the next year in irrigation districts in china due to limited reservoir storage the technical capacity for enforcing regulations in the context of hydrologic uncertainty is necessary in water rights systems in particular with regard to addressing fluctuations in supply and curtailment of rights 43 the seasonal allocation is the percentage of users water share volume available under current resource conditions as determined by the resource managers currently the measures of seasonal water allocation are only applied in some arid rivers in china such as the yellow river and the hei river in the gansu province in 2006 regulation on water allocation in the yellow river basin was issued by china s state council this regulation policy initialized a system of season water allocation and authorized the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc to implement the unified operation of all the reservoirs along the main course of the river for seasonal allocations to the riparian regions basing on their entitlement sharing plan of 1987 2 3 water markets 2 3 1 spatial and temporal rules for trading in china water rights water abstraction permits and allocated water are allowed to be traded among regions water use sectors and individual users stakeholders can trade their water rights permanently or for an appointed duration over which the trading contract is applicable for example the validity period of the water entitlements trades between famers and industries in the inner mongolia china is 25 years besides the water rights trading water allocations from permits can be leased or traded for one year that is to say stakeholders can sell their allocated water volume in a given year and revert to their previous water allocations the following year in addition both surface water and groundwater can be traded in china however there is no trad between surface water and groundwater it is not allowed that a stakeholder withdraws a volume of groundwater from its aquifer equaling to the volume of surface water he bought if he was not able to receive the surface water from the reservoirs and channels 2 3 2 trading among regions water entitlement trading between dongyang city and yiwu city in zhejiang province in 2000 was deemed as the first water trading between regions in china in november 2000 two cities dongyang and yiwu in zhejiang province came to an agreement in which yiwu purchased the water supplies of about 50 million cubic meters per year from dongyang s hengjiang reservoir by paying dongyang rmb 200 million yuan the conditions of this trade include 1 the water transfer does not change the original ownership of the reservoir which implies dongyang is still responsible for the reservoir s operation and maintenance 2 yiwu pays rmb 0 1 yuan per cubic meter as a comprehensive management fee to dongyang the fee covers the taxation to government and the cost of the reservoir operation and maintenance 3 yiwu is responsible for the planning and investment of the construction of the water delivery channel from hengjin reservoir to yiwu following the case of water trading between dongyang and yiwu formal water rights trades between regions continuously happened in the past decades including the trades among cities along the middle route of the south to north water diversion project and the trades between beijing and hebei province however this kind of trading is still rare due to the complexity of transferring policies and the high cost of water delivery 2 3 3 trading between sectors in china there are cases of water entitlement trading between agricultural users and industries users concentrated in the ningxia and inner mongolia provinces along the yellow river the trades are conducted between irrigating famers who are able to withdraw water from the yellow river and newly established electricity and core mining factories that do not have water abstraction permits from the yellow river the water transferred to the industries is mainly the volumes of evaporations and leakages saved along the channels from the reservoirs to the fields through lining the earth canals to concrete ones the water consumptions of the famers within the fields are not reduced industries pay for the channel lining and maintaining rather than paying cash to the individual famers the validity period of these trades is 25 years after which the water saving constructions such as concrete lined channel will be expired for use the volume of water saved is calculated by engineering works comparing the water consumptions of the irrigation district before and after channel lining for example in hangjin irrigation district of inner mongolia water entitlement of the district from the yellow river was 375 million cubic meters which was a share from the water entitlement of inner mongolia at 5 86 billion cubic meters since 2003 dozens of industries of electricity and core mining invested rmb 0 7 billion yuan for channels lining and earth leveling in the irrigation district 130 million cubic water was calculated to be saved and transferred to the industries because of these water saving projects after the water trading the water abstraction permit of the district was reduced to 245 million cubic meters in 2007 as the water delivery channels were improved and the water supplies reached the field more rapidly the irrigation consumption in the field was not increased after the water transfer this is the major mode for entitlement trading between agriculture and industry in china according to the china water exchange http cwex org cn 77 trades from agriculture to industry were conducted by the platform of china water exchange from 2016 to 2019 in inner mongolia the total volume of these 77 trades is 2352 million cubic meters all these trades happened in the inner mongolia as the core mining industries expanded dramatically in this area in 2010 s the newly development coal mining enterprises have no water abstraction permission from the yellow river but they are rich enough to invest the agricultural water savings in addition one of the major sellers of these trades is the centre for water rights collection storage and transfer of inner mongolia http www nmgsqjyw com this center is a public company for water trading brokering in the inner mongolia it is to invest the water saving infrastructures or engineering projects of the irrigation districts along the yellow river using the capitals from the government or private investors after implementing the water saving projects the center will collect the saved water from different irrigation districts or small farms and store these water rights to its account intensively finally the center will sell the collected water rights to the industries at a price which is higher than its water saving investments this institute in the inner mongolia is the first regional water rights trading broker in china which is similar to the water bank in the u s industries obtained extra water from irrigation districts by investing in concrete channels and highly efficient irrigating technologies however more efforts are still required to sustain these transfers by identifying whether the transferred water comes from real lasing savings and relevant third party impacts 2 3 4 trading among farmers according to china s state council water users who have saved water under their water entitlements or abstraction permits can sell the water in the market at the individual level an irrigation water market emerged in the shiyang river basin northwestern china in the market a group of famers form a water users association wua and sell the bulk water entitlement or allocation of the wua s to other wuas in the shiyang river basin the area of farm lands of each farmer household is about 2 5 mu per capita about 0 16 ha per capita 44 the location of an individual famer s lands tends to be scattered along the channels of the irrigation district these small and scattered areas of irrigation lands lead to high cost of monitoring water use and quantifying water savings and thus low exchange amounts of irrigation water trading among individual famers in order to reduce the transaction cost the minimum unit for water trading is adopted as a wua in which the numbers of the farmer households are normally equal to a village in the shiyang river basin the water rights granted to the district have been allocated to all the villages since 2008 thus a certain water volume is allocated to each village in the district as its annual water use cap in this case several villages that tended to irrigate more farmlands bought water from other villages other villages with excess water sold water for profits the leaders of wuas in the villages on the behalf of farmers sell water that is saved by group farming plant adjustment and drip irrigation each village normally has one wua the trading activity was spontaneous without supervision from the local governments in early 2008 as more and more villages were involved in the market the water management authority of the irrigation district started to regulate the market to relieve the third party effects of the trades currently the authority checks the applicants water availability canal condition and the price of their bid before approving their trades the price of selling water among villages is limited to three times the price at which the villages paid the authority for annual water at the beginning of the year the purpose of this limitation is to address the unevenness of water supply reliabilities between upstream and downstream users along the channel due to the physical structure of the channel system and the sedimentation users at upstream generally access to water source more easily and thus possess higher supply reliability than downstream it is unfair to the downstream that upstream users sell water to them at an improper high price because the water sold is not only from the savings but also supported by the inherent high supply reliability of the upstream although strong administrative interference exists a preliminary water market has been established in the district villages traded water with each other according to their own willingness if someone does not want to sell the water the government will not force him her if the villages did not use their entire quota and did not sell the excess water to others then the unused water will be removed from their accounts at the end of year different from the use it or lose it policy in the u s wuas water entitlements will not be reduced in the years moving forward if they have unused or unsold water left in the current year for example in xiying irrigation district which is a gravity surface water irrigation area in the shiyang river basin the accumulated volume of surface water traded in the district from 2008 to 2014 was up to 29 194 million cubic meters the cultivated area of the district was 444 900 mu 1 mu 666 67 m2 238 000 of which were active irrigated areas a total of 70 villages were located below the branch canals average price of the water trades in the xiying irrigation district was 0 186 yuan m3 during the aforementioned period around 30 70 trades were conducted each year in the district the average volume of each trade among wuas was approximately 83 7 thousand cubic meters the validity period of all transactions was one year which means that all trades were effective only before the end of the year when they were made long term water entitlement trading was not conducted in the district 40 one of the problems is that the particular farmers who gain or lose water are not the ones paying for or profiting from the trade because the farms are so small and the water trade are kept at the level of wuas rather than individual farmers 38 these may cause the inequity on water allocations among famers within the wua during the water trading it is important to connect the profits as far as possible to the individuals who get more water or less water for their farms 38 moreover the transaction cost also rises in the process of negotiations among farmers to sell their group water rights the democracy within a wua and its cost should be balanced when trading water between wuas information technology was used in the shiyang river basin to increase the transparency of trades and to reduce the transaction cost through developing an online platform for formalizing and publishing the process of offers and bids 2 3 5 trading platforms or brokers water trading platforms or broker institutes are encouraged by the china state government at the national level china launched its national water exchange in beijing in 2016 jointly founded by the ministry of water resources and the beijing government china water exchange cwex is expected to facilitate water rights trading by providing services such as trading consultations market evaluations intermediary services and public services 45 by the end of 2019 a total of 329 transactions involving 2889 million cubic meters were recorded on the china water exchange http cwex org cn of which 88 transactions of 2872 million cubic meters were trans regional and inter sectoral water rights trades the remaining 241 trades of 17 million cubic meters were trades between irrigators furthermore most of the trans regional and inter sectoral transactions occurred along the yellow river and the middle line of the south to north water transfer project as shown in fig 2 including 77 transactions of 2352 million cubic meters 81 of the total transitions at cwex from agricultural water users to the industries in the inner mongolia along the yellow river 4 transactions of 152 million cubic meters from shanxi and hebei provinces to beijing and 3 transactions of 324 million cubic meters between the cities along the middle line of the south to north water transfer project cwex currently seems to be a government dominated platform for displaying water exchanges across the country the registration of the website is just available to the organizations or institutes which hold the bulk water rights rather than the publics or individual water users furthermore water buyers and sellers currently tend to conduct trades through local trading brokers such as the centre for water rights collection storage and transfer of inner mongolia rather than directly making the bids and offers through the cwex the trading results are only published by cwex on its website this is mainly because that most of current water trades in china occurred at local level such as the trades between agriculture and industry along the yellow river and the trades among farmers in the irrigation districts there is a preference of the stakeholders to trade water through local water agencies which directly provide the water allocation and monitor the usage these are different from the trading platforms used in other countries such as the waterpool https www waterpool org au of water partners aust ltd victoria australia the waterpool platform uses the allocation bank account in the victorian water register that provides water entitlement available water allocation and usage volume of the user it trades allocation water through a pooled exchange at a price driven by the market the registration of the platform remains open to anyone in sum current framework of water rights system in china consisting of water rights water abstraction permits and water market is shown in fig 3 3 lessons for improving china s water rights and water market system 3 1 detailing entitlement sharing from catchment and regional levels down to the individual users water entitlement sharing in china means sharing the annual mean runoff among the riparian regions in a river basin the volumetric shares of the regions are recognized as their long term water rights which are demonstrated in their water abstraction permissions the shares are equal to the water use quotas of the regions which are used to cap their water withdraws in addition each region is required to allocate its share to sub regions such as provinces to cities cities to towns and towns to factories and individual users currently china s mwr has identified the water entitlement shares of 31 provinces in the country in some provinces the water entitlement has been allocated down to the individual users for example in the shiyang river basin of gansu province the annual runoff of the river has been shared by the riparian regions since 2007 afterwards the regions allocated their water shares down to the individual farmers through suppling the irrigation demands of about 2 5 mu 1 mu 666 67 m2 farmland per capita in the basin however most of the provinces have not allocated the shares down to cities and towns not even mention of individual users it is necessary to further allocate the provinces bulk water entitlements to the sub regions and individual users only in this way the water rights system can be well established for water market of actual users rather than the trading between regional governments 3 2 expanding the application of seasonal water allocation at national wide water entitlement sharing is not enough to regulate the water withdraws without seasonal allocation according to the experiences of the yellow river basin the seasonal water allocation plays an essential role in regulating the water use quotas for users in a given year otherwise the users tend to maximize their water withdraws up to their shares of the annual mean runoff this leads to the shortage of supply in dry seasons however only few basins have season water allocation systems that are recognized by the mwr such as in the yellow river and hei river basin in gansu provinces in which the state council has issued the regulations and political documents to implement the seasonal water allocation there are few regulations from state level on seasonal water allocations in other basins a framework or national wide policy for season water allocation in china is required for improving its water rights system 3 3 better design of the water market 3 3 1 removing the barriers on water pricing in the market there are still barriers on water pricing or biding in current water market of china for example in the yellow river basin the industries obtained water from irrigation districts through lining the channels from the reservoirs to the fields rather than paying cash to the farmers in this case the price of water trading was calculated on the base of the cost of channel lining the famers were not involved in the market and did not have the chance for biding on the other hand in the irrigation water trading among wuas in the shiyang river basin the irrigation authority checked the applicants water availability canal condition and the price of their bid before approving their trades the price of selling water among villages was limited to three times the price at which the villages paid the authority for annual water at the beginning of the year the stakeholders price and biding activate are currently heavily influenced by the china s governments causing the reduction of the trading benefits it is important to reduce the interference from the governments and remove the barriers on water price to further develop more active and beneficial water market in china 3 3 2 accounting for the third party impacts the third party impacts of water trading are not fully recognized in china s water market for example in the yellow river basin the water trading was conducted between agricultural users and industrial users through channel lining and water saving in the irrigation districts since 2003 most of the channels of the irrigation district in the inner mongolia along the yellow river have been lined from the earth canals to the concrete canals the water leakage to the groundwater was dramatically reduced because of the channel lining this will definitely impact the ecosystems such as the trees and the downstream lakes relying on the groundwater supplied by the leakage flows from the channels this impact is poorly understood in the water trading of the yellow river there are insufficient insights on the impacts on ecological system sustainability in the irrigation district due to the limited observations and researches the third party impacts of water trading are required to be assessed in current water market of china third party impacts of water trading are generally considered in the u s under no injury or no harm rules such rules require that trades do not result in injury or harm to third party uses such as impairing habitat function or the quantity or timing of flows to existing water rights holders while these rules are necessary and well intentioned they are sometimes applied in such a manner that makes it difficult to trade water in practice lengthy environmental impact reviews or case by case evaluation can cause significant delay in reviewing and approving transfers because many water transfers are time sensitive such delays can thwart trades altogether programs that have transparent trading rules appear to strike the appropriate balance between evaluating third party impacts and approving trades in a timely manner the trading rules will typically be codified and publicly available for anyone to understand under what conditions a trade will be approved or denied 3 3 3 improving democracy and public involvement in bulk water trading among regional governments currently the major water trades in china are between the regional governments or between the irrigation districts and industries such as one government of a region sells its bulk water entitlement to another regional government there are rare democracy process and relevant public involvements in these trading actives the governments should publish the details of the water trading and let the public know that the bulk water entitlements belong to them has been traded by the government on the behalf of them and the benefits from water selling is fairly used by the government 4 conclusion a framework for describing water rights systems and trading programs are presented in this paper there are three key elements in the framework including 1 water rights sharing 2 water abstraction permits water rights certificates and seasonal allocations and 3 water markets the water rights and trading systems in china are presented basing on this framework in china a person with a water right does not own the water but owns the right to use the water the relevant government agency can decide on the appropriate level of water allocation for each use basin wide generally prioritize domestic and industrial water demands over agricultural water demands this is known as public allocation in the chinese context the public allocation is the major system of defining water rights in china basing on this water rights are defined by bureaucratic prescription in which transboundary water resources are allocated to riparian regions through a top down planning process dominated by catchment authorities and regional governments moreover water rights and allocations are not carried over to the next year in irrigation districts due to limited reservoir storage in china formal water market was established after 2000 through a series of water rights allocation and trading pilot projects which were regulated top down by the central government water market reform now has become a national initiative led by ministry of water resources currently a majority of water trading cases is between agricultural users and industries users along the yellow river the water transferred to the industries is mainly the volumes of evaporations and leakages saved along the channels from the reservoirs to the fields through lining the earth canals to concrete ones by contrast the exchange amounts of irrigation water trading among individual famers is quite low due to the small and scattered areas of irrigation lands leading to high cost of monitoring water use and quantifying tradable water savings the third party impacts of water trading are generally not well considered in china s water market because lengthy environmental impact reviews or case by case evaluation can cause significant delay in reviewing and approving transfers it is necessary that transparent trading rules should be used to strike the appropriate balance between evaluating third party impacts and approving trades in a timely manner in sum the water rights and market system in china has made significant progress during the past decade managing water resources sustainability based on the water rights has become a national wide consensus in china although there are still many difficulties in establishing a national water rights system the main concern is how to deal with the relationship between the market and the government under china s administrative context in other word it is how to stimulate the market enthusiasm and reduce transaction costs under the water abstraction permits and trading administrative supervision there are two points that china s existing practices on dealing with above questions are meaningful for the other countries one is to encourage water rights trading between industry and agriculture because the larger trading profits can offset the transaction costs second internet technology and online trading platform is useful to assist in internal agricultural water rights transactions to reduce the transaction cost among farmers several suggestions for improving china s water rights and trading systems are provided including 1 detailing entitlement sharing from catchment and regional levels down to the individual users 2 expanding the application of seasonal water allocation at national wide 3 removing the barriers on water pricing in the market 4 accounting for the third party impacts and 5 improving democracy and public involvement in bulk water trading among regional governments credit authorship contribution statement hang

20127,a major section of india s economy is directly linked with water dependent food and energy systems skillful predictions of droughts play a pivotal role in sustainable water management and evading serious damages to agriculture production and economy of a region recent decades have witnessed valuable advances in scientific understanding and prediction of droughts in india in this review we synthesize major sources of drought predictability over different regions in india we find that a few large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and regional scale hydrometeorological variables are key to understanding and predicting drought occurrences we also present a concise summary of major statistical and dynamical forecasting based modelling efforts in drought predictions although major strides have been taken in drought prediction in the recent decades important gaps remain in understanding the onset and spatio temporal dynamics of droughts further many opportunities of improving the skill of drought prediction over india are envisaged and many impending challenges are highlighted the overall picture is that significant efforts and investments are critical for understanding and skillfully predicting droughts over india keywords drought prediction ismr statistical models enso dynamical models 1 introduction drought over a region is defined when water availability in the region is significantly lower than the normal among the most complex natural eco hydrological processes droughts can occur at temporal scales of weeks to years and spatial scales of cities to continents 148 125 droughts can appear in different forms such as deficits in precipitation lack of soil moisture deficits of streamflow and lack of snowfall among others corresponding stresses to the natural ecosystem can emerge for example agricultural stresses are most clearly reflected in soil moisture deficits 65 82 many drought definitions have evolved over the years and corresponding indices or metrics have been proposed to quantify drought intensities discussed in detail in section 2 the all india summer june july august september monsoon rainfall ismr variability is generally used to distinguish drought and wet years in india agricultural yield in india is highly correlated with ismr and droughts can reduce the gross domestic product gdp of the country by 2 to 5 through crop failure 29 ismr drought of 1987 fig 1 affected the agriculture activities in roughly 59 million hectares crop area 46 of the total all india crop area and resulted in severe deficits in drinking water in large parts of the country 163 accurate seasonal predictions of droughts can help in early preparedness efforts and better management thereby saving lives and the economy sub seasonal predictions are most useful to farmers who have to decide and manage the necessary investment options in crop production before the cropping season 122 114 104 over the past few decades there have been significant advances in drought prediction over india and most of the state of the art models show promising skill in forecasting ismr tendency more than a month ahead however significant gaps remain in explaining the ismr annual and sub seasonal variability and hence in prediction of droughts in this work we discuss the major large scale climatic teleconnections that are shown to explain the majority of ismr variability followed by different approaches that have evolved in the recent years to predict droughts including various statistical and dynamical approaches and finally we highlight some of the emerging challenges and future research directions that can help in advancing models for drought predictions over india 2 drought definitions droughts nearly occur in all regions of the globe with varying frequency and the associated negative impacts on economy society and ecosystems which vary spatially and temporally depending on the societal context of drought 156 a universal definition of drought is thus unrealistic anticipation because drought definition should reflect the spatio temporal variability stochastic nature of water demand and socio economic factors that are functions of climate regimes 157 scores of definitions of drought have been developed across multiple disciplines according to their perspectives of droughts and their impacts these definitions of droughts are broadly categorized either as conceptual definitions offer a general qualitative idea of drought without considering about onset termination and severity and operational definitions that attempt to identify and quantify the key characteristics of droughts including onset termination and severity 157 156 operational definitions are formulated as drought indices that can be used to analyze the frequency severity and duration of a given drought event to provide an early warning system 80 17 the drought definitions also vary based on the variable or context used to describe them and are hence divided into 4 major classes 80 157 17 a meteorological drought b hydrological droughts c agricultural droughts d socio economic drought meteorological drought is defined as a period of months to years that are deficit in precipitation 38 27 and are often augmented by above normal temperature and high potential evapotranspiration 17 meteorological droughts most often preceed and trigger other kinds of droughts hydrological drought is defined as a period with below normal surface and sub surface water levels 146 149 while agricultural drought is a period with inadequate soil moisture to sustain crop growth 107 158 finally socio economic drought arises when the demand for water and related socioeconomic goods and services exceed its supply due to meteorological and hydrological scarcity of water 16 80 a collection of multiple drought indices have been developed over the recent decades to identify and characterize different kinds of droughts with each having its own advantages and limitations in monitoring and forecasting droughts 151 160 57 93 the most commonly used drought indices to characterize monitor and forecast droughts in india are given in table 1 3 data driven approaches data driven statistical models and empirical models have served as powerful tools in understanding and forecasting climatic variables imd heavily relies on statistical models for long range operational forecasting of ismr with the most recent statistical models developed and updated with efforts of many years imd issues two long range forecasts first in the mid april for the ismr and then an updated forecast in june for jas all india rainfall 97 the details of imd multiple linear regression models can be found at https mausam imd gov in imd latest contents seasonal forecast php in most cases data driven models for drought prediction are physics driven where the predictor variables are selected based on their influence on ismr variability through some atmospheric or oceanic physical processes in this section we summarize the most important predictors for ismr and droughts challenges in developing models and different modelling attempts in the recent years to forecast droughts including purely time series analysis linear regression and artificial intelligence based approaches 3 1 use of standard climate indices most of the recent work in statistical approaches has been devoted to understanding the influence of large scale climatic oscillations on ismr and how they can be used to predict droughts a major lead in statistical forecasting of indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr definition jjas happened when it was found that the eastern pacific el niño southern oscillation ep enso plays a significant role in driving a major fraction of the monsoon variability 52 103 most of the severe droughts over india have happened during the el niño warmer sst in eastern pacific phase of enso 56 61 sst anomalies over the indian ocean affect the variability of ismr through the indian ocean dipole iod and recent works have demonstrated that the atmospheric component of iod called the equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo is more correlated with ismr 34 68 and can be a better predictor of droughts the negative phase of equinoo is comprised of negative and positive convection anomalies over the western and the eastern equatorial indian ocean respectively and westerly wind anomalies in the equatorial indian ocean and a suppressed ismr the anomalies reverse during the positive phase of equinoo many droughts have occurred during the negative phase of equinoo and most of the droughts over india are well explained by a co occurrence of negative equinoo and negative enso i e el niño 145 apart from the pacific and indian oceans other distant regional climates are also believed to influence the variability of ismr of particular interest are the sst anomalies in the north atlantic ocean that affect the snow cover over the eurasia in anomalous snow winters when the snow cover is large the eurasia does not heat up strongly during spring and summer the decrease in the temperature gradient between indian ocean and eurasia landmass decreases the strength of indian summer monsoon 28 hence sst anomalies over the north atlantic ocean as depicted by the north atlantic oscillation nao for example can be important predictors of droughts over india 40 141 other large scale low frequency oceanic oscillations such as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo are thought to influence the ismr through their influence on the strengths of enso and nao patterns 71 131 for example ganguli and reddy 35 found that higher fraction 60 of rainfall deficit years happened when amo was in negative phase borah et al 13 noted that most of the non el niño droughts occurred when north atlantic ocean was relatively cold furthermore it was noted that large scale rossby waves caused severe sub seasonal declines in the monsoon rainfall over india mainly during late monsoon 13 3 2 search of precursors instead of the predefined standard climate indices for example nino3 4 for enso which are metrics for major states of the climate it is prudent to search for specific regional climates that are linked with ismr through teleconnections 19 95 155 if a few leading regional climates are found to be linked with ismr these can be considered as the precursors of the ismr and can be utilized for months ahead drought prediction much of the research in this area has relied on developing correlation maps of ismr with months ahead sea level pressure slp and or sst fields over the globe and it is hoped that a few significantly correlated regions will appear from the maps the imd operational statistical models for ismr forecasts 97 use multiple predictors that are 1 to 4 months lead time climates in different regions around the globe including the north atlantic and north pacific ssts equatorial south indian ocean sst east asia slp and eurasia land surface temperature among others it is likely that some of the precursor regions in the correlation maps are interrelated and hence do not add independent skills to drought forecasting based on 4 and 5 month lead times slp and air temperature di capua et al 19 obtained a set of five independent precursors by removing correlated precursors using partial correlations besides the pacific and atlantic regions the authors found two precursors of ismr in the arctic and one in indonesia similarly based on correlation fields wang et al 155 showed that central pacific warm sst anomalies ahead of the summer affect the ismr which is supported by sahastrabuddhe et al 111 who found central and eastern pacific warm sst anomalies el niño events during wide spread monsoon rainfall deficit years it should be noted however that predictors found through correlation may not have a physical relationship with ismr thus the list of predictors needs to be scrutinized to remove those that show spurious correlations 3 3 spatial heterogeneity in ismr there is a large degree of spatial variability in summer rainfall over india see drought of 1987 in fig 1 part of which can be attributed to local factors such as orography and the land cover type but a significant portion is related to the large scale climatic teleconnections 36 84 88 159 the spatially varying correlation of climatic teleconnections with summer rainfall suggests multiple avenues in the context of drought prediction or in general ismr prediction the use of lumped average rainfall over india may confound regional prediction skills of the climatic teleconnections resulting in lower skill of ismr prediction on the other hand the use of regional or finer scale rainfall anomalies can produce global precursors for drought prediction more conspicuously even by using the standard climate indices prediction of droughts over india can be improved by considering regional or finer scale anomalies rather than all india rainfall indeed finer scale predictions are more directly useful for regional scale planning and management sahastrabuddhe et al 111 identified nine spatial patterns of indian summer monsoon using k means clustering algorithm and found some distinct precursors for the patterns that showed wide scale rainfall deficits they noted that climatic teleconnections can provide important information on the spatial distribution of monsoon rainfall in addition to the lumped all india summer rainfall predictions at regional scale considering climatically homogenous regions is performed in many recent studies 25 24 55 96 108 3 4 multiple modelling frameworks a basic and powerful statistical modelling approach that uses multiple predictors to predict droughts in a region is multiple linear regression mlr framework given as y α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β p x p where y is the drought series in terms of a drought index and x 1 to x p are the predictors α is the intercept term β 1 to β p are the corresponding coefficients and is the residual term the most simplistic linear regression framework utilizes the rainfall anomalies from a few previous months to predict future droughts these include autoregression based models such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima models mishra et al 78 and mishra and desai 77 found that for kansasbati river basin area 4265 km2 in west bengal the correlation skill given as the correlation coefficient between the forecasted drought indices and the observed values was small 0 35 at lead times of 4 months tiwari and mishra 147 considered lagged accumulated rainfall spi and spei over past months to forecast storage anomalies in 91 reservoirs over india the results showed that lagged rainfall provides a high correlation skill 0 7 in predicting 1 to 3 months ahead reservoir anomalies and it was found all the four major drought months from 2002 to 2017 were primarily related to below average monsoon in the previous year it was further noted that lagged ssi when available can improve upon spi and spei in forecasting reservoir anomalies imd stage1 linear regression model with multiple precursors showed a correlation skill 0 82 for 1 5 months ahead ismr forecasts for the period 1981 2004 97 though the correlation equation used in the analysis is not correct equation 6 in their paper for the same forecast period di capua et al 19 showed moderate correlations of 0 35 based on imd precursors used in rajeevan et al 97 for longer leads of two and four months maity and kumar 69 used a composite index of lagged enso and equinoo to predict monthly rainfall anomalies over india copula framework was used to model the dependence between ismr and the composite index while the uncertainty between the dependence was utilized to estimate the uncertainty bands of the predicted ismr the model performed significantly better than the linear regression based models however a visual analysis of forecasts of drought months suggests that most of the drought months 16 out of 25 were outside the 90th percentile uncertainty bands ganguli and reddy 35 used enso iod and amo to predict up 1 to 3 month lead time six monthly spi spi6 in western rajasthan using support vector regression svr then copula framework was used to develop joint probability distribution of the observed and svm predicted spi6 which was then used to simulate the ensembles of droughts conditional on the predictions from svm giving the uncertainty of the predictions in their work most of the droughts were within the 95th percentile prediction intervals though the prediction intervals in many cases were wide covering wet range spi6 1 it is also noted that summer months showed larger uncertainty in predictions as compared to the winter seasons wang et al 155 observed smaller and negative correlation skill of imd operational forecasting system in predicting ismr for 1989 to 2012 period surendran et al 145 developed a linear model with enso and equinoo indices for summer as predictors that is able to explain more than half of the variance in ismr and the one month ahead lead time predictions showed 0 5 correlation skill with ismr another approach that has been found useful is to decompose the drought index into multiple independent components that can be predicted with better accuracy without significant loss of information maity et al 70 used wavelet based decomposed series to predict transitions of meteorological drought to agricultural and hydrologic drought in upper mahanadi basin in chhattisgarh with lesser assumptions than wavelet decomposition adarsh and reddy 6 employed the empirical mode decomposition technique to decompose the original spi series into multiple independent components for meteorological drought prediction over kerala telangana and orrisa drought processes do not necessarily follow a linear relationship with the lagged index values and exogenous predictors especially for short term droughts such as one month spi1 or three month spi3 6 70 78 due to their capability to capture non linear relationships artificial intellai based models to predict droughts have received significant attention recently 73 110 132 for kansasbati river basin mishra et al 78 found better performance of hybrid arima artificial neural network ann model than arima model malik et al 73 compared models based on mlr co active neuron fuzzy inference system canfis and multiple layer perceptron neural networks mlpnn to predict droughts over two small watersheds of the ganga river it was observed that canfis and mlpnn performed better for smaller scale droughts than mlr and all the models performed competitively for longer scale 6 months droughts ganguli and reddy 35 employed support vector regression using enso iod and amo indices as predictors for droughts over western rajasthan and found a moderate correlation skill of 0 55 for 3 month lead time drought kashid et al 54 used climate teleconnections enso and equinoo and local covariates e g outgoing long wave radiation olr to predict weekly streamflow for summer season over mahanadi river using genetic programming they observed a reasonable streamflow forecast skill nse of roughly 0 67 in general however streamflow in low flow weeks and months were overestimated consistently in most of the 13 summers analyzed from 1990 to 2003 similar results can be observed in their later studies maity and kashid 67 66 sahoo et al 112 compared recurrent neural networks rnn and long short term memory rnn lstm rnn to predict 1 month ahead lower quantile monthly streamflows at basantpura station of mahanadi river the results showed high forecasts skill of both modelling frameworks and it is found that lstm rnn only marginally improves over rnn nse values of 0 878 and 0 843 these studies showed marginal prediction skill improvements of ai based models over mlr based models besides the standard climatic indices regional precursors using correlation maps have been used as predictors for ismr di capua et al 19 used 4 to 5 months ahead temperature and pressure anomalies of five independent precursor regions in an mlr based model to predict ismr variability the model yielded a modest albeit better than operational imd forecasts correlation of 0 4 for 1981 2004 forecast period however based on imd definition of drought of rainfall 10 below the long term mean none of the four drought years in the period were predicted accurately from the physical understanding of the monsoon and climate teleconnections and correlation maps wang et al 155 developed an ismr prediction model based on spring season temperature and pressure anomalies in four precursor regions the model showed an improved correlation skill of 0 64 for the 1921 2012 forecasted period 4 physically based approaches besides statistical approaches of weather predictions which only consider physically based empirical relationships between the predictors and predictand without accounting for the detailed underlying physical mechanisms dynamical approaches are mostly based on the physical processes in the atmosphere ocean and land surfaces dynamical predictions rely on climate models global or and regional and or hydrological models that imitate the physical processes by a large set of numerical equations these climate models represent and simulate the physical and thermodynamical processes either in the atmosphere only agcms or oceans ogcms or coupling of both coupled ocean atmosphere since dynamical models are physically based they have the ability to capture nonlinear interaction of climate systems and thus are capable of predicting unprecedented conditions even under non stationary climate besides uncertainty in initial conditions inaccurate knowledge of evolutionary mechanisms of weather processes introduces uncertainty in the model termed as model uncertainty charney et al 15 hypothesized a second kind of predictability that stems from the low frequency variations of boundary forcing anomalies such as sea surface temperature sst ice cover and soil moisture and act as the basis for seasonal predictability several post processing techniques such as bias correction methods multi model ensemble mme technique and downscaling procedures have proved fruitful in improving the forecast skill 4 60 105 the use of gcms for prediction of indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr started in the early 1990s when different modelling groups tried to simulate 1987 and 1988 monsoon features under the monsoon numerical experimental group program 86 and atmospheric model inter comparison project amip and highlighted that models show incongruity in simulating the interannual variability of monsoon even though forced with observed sst 139 31 4 1 meteorological droughts prediction using agcms out of 30 agcms from amip only 11 models performed realistically in simulating the mean rainfall and interannual variation of monsoon over india and the skill was high during enso associated seasons though their performance was poor for extremes years 31 in addition to better skill in weekly rainfall forecasts reasonable skill scores probability of detection pod threat score and others 0 5 were also reported for excess and scanty categories of weekly rainfall over multiple regions of india 114 mean ensemble technique has been satisfactorily implemented in simulating the essential features of ismr such as climatology intra seasonal variability and successfully validated against observation for the drought year 2002 113 a reasonable agreement between model simulations from national centre for environmental prediction s t170 l42 model and observation was found in key features of ismr such as climatology monsoon circulations etc for the period 1985 2004 however differences were evident in the magnitude of interannual and intra seasonal variability 106 moreover models forecasts skill was poor in predicting droughts and excess monsoons for example droughts of 1987 and 2002 and excess of 1994 which were later on efficiently simulated except 1994 by averaging the member ensembles with similar seasonal numbers of below and above average pentads by ratna and sikka 105 the skills of five different agcms were evaluated under the seasonal prediction of the indian monsoon project by forcing them with either observed sst forcing for the period 1985 2004 or persistent april ssts for 1987 1988 1994 1997 and 2002 results from observed sst forcing simulations showed that only two models successfully predicted the sign of seasonal rainfall anomalies during the drought and excess years with one model reasonably predicting the magnitudes also correlation coefficient 0 4 32 the bias identified in simulations could be either due to irrational oversensitivity of models to el niño southern oscillation enso or inability to simulate equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo or both 32 105 precipitation forecast from global ensemble forecast system s gefs at a lead of 7 days for the period 1985 2010 have shown higher skill in precipitation forecasts during non monsoon season correlation 0 6 compared to monsoon season correlation 0 5 though no significant improvement was observed after post processing 121 this low skill of monsoon forecasts was attributed to the inability of the model to simulate the intra seasonal variability specifically active break phases during monsoon 4 2 need for coupled ocean atmosphere gcms multiple studies found that most of agcms fail to predict droughts and ismr variability in general with a reasonable skill 30 31 106 32 although improvements have been seen in agcm forecast the actual predictability skill of agcms is much lower than the potential skill of 0 65 estimated by the perfect model which showed improvement when agcms were forced by simulated sst 59 despite improvements from post processing techniques the performance of agcms is relatively poor as compared to coupled ocean atmosphere models in predicting seasonal precipitation correlation 0 2 60 85 because of misrepresentation of air sea interactions over warm pool region and indo west pacific ocean however agcms forecast with better skill at lead 0 forecast started in june for june september rainfall 129 these deficiencies of agcms and the ability of coupled models to better capture the intra seasonal and interannual variability of ismr endorse the need for coupled ocean atmosphere models for monsoon prediction 59 98 153 4 3 meteorological droughts prediction using coupled models in general the forecasts from agcms have improved globally and regionally over the last few decades 64 138 161 but their predictability skill and use in operational mode is still a topic of discussion particularly for monsoon regions 59 105 preethi et al 92 used 7 coupled models from development of european multi model ensemble system for seasonal to interannual prediction demeter and reported a positive but weak predictability skill for monsoon forecasts at 1 months lead however multi model ensemble mme performed better in 1980s but failed afterward mme of six coupled models from ensembles were found to have higher skill compared to mme of demeter in forecasting ismr and it efficiently simulated droughts of 1972 1974 1982 and excess year 1961 but failed to capture the recent decline in enso monsoon relationship 61 which resulted in a reduction in actual skill from 0 3 for 1960 1979 to 0 1 for 1980 2005 98 comparing the skill of 6 gcms 4 coupled and 2 agcms in simulating ismr at three different leads 0 month 1 month and 2 month it was found that coupled models and agcms exhibit higher predictability at 1 month and 0 month lead respectively and the predictability skill decreases as lead time increases 129 127 shrivastava et al 127 considered 20 days ahead forecasts of rainfall from 44 ensemble members of indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm climate forecast system and global forecast system models over central india to predict 1 month spi 1 month spei and pdsi in their results they found that model based probabilistic predictions of drought occurrences months with spi 1 were in good agreement with observation hit rate false alarm rate skill coefficient 0 5 the predicted spei and pdsi also showed reasonable agreement with observations and efficiently captured 2002 2009 and 2014 droughts 127 in addition they also noted that the raw ensemble member forecasts have large biases and variance based bias correction improves the ensemble mean drought forecasts resulting in high hit and smaller false alarm rates the results from the comparison of monsoon season predicted spi from 9 gcms 3 agcms and 6 coupled gcms and imd for the period 1982 2010 concluded that all models predictability skill is low with maximum skill for gml and cfsv2 correlation 0 54 index of agreement 0 7 at all india scale however none of the models predicted droughts effectively for example cfsv2 predicted the maximum 3 out of 6 observed droughts 2002 2000 2009 5 weighted mean mme technique showed noticeable improvement in the skill of spi forecasts compared to arithmetic average mme and individual models jain et al 50 were able to achieve a skill of about 0 6 at seasonal lead times using multi model average of 8 prediction systems from climate historical forecast system which was found to improve by spatial averaging over a larger area because of extended spatial coherence of monsoon variability an increase was noted in the better representation of mean state of the indian monsoon its variability and predictability skill with higher resolution cfsv2 model t382 configuration correlation ρ 0 55 compared to low resolution configuration t126 ρ 0 49 101 moreover increased skill in the high resolution model was attributed to the significant improvement in iod monsoon relationship reduction in bias and enso monsoon teleconnection strengthening of teleconnection but both configurations failed to capture the correct phase of ismr in 7 years 1985 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 and 1997 101 100 in a recent study köhn reich and bürger 58 found that the removal of the erroneous year such as 1997 from the analysis could greatly improve the skill of forecasting in addition cfsv2 seas4 and multi model ensemble realistically simulated droughts and excess years during the period 1982 2005 consistent with previous studies multiple recent studies have highlighted that the errors underestimation of precipitation during missing enso monsoon link for example 1997 monsoon are due to the super sensitivity of models to enso rather than iod enso relationship and mean rainfall bias 50 58 multiple improvements were made in the cefsv2 model equations and algorithm for example improvements in parameterization of convection land surface processes improved ocean model improved cloud microphysics and other improvements have been useful in enhancing the model prediction skill 100 143 90 and skill score pearson s correlation improved from 0 55 to 0 67 0 118 to 0 326 over extended central india central india region 65 95 e 5 35 n 70 90 e 10 30 n 91 imd under the monsoon mission program successfully predicted two consecutive monsoon droughts of 2014 and 2015 at 3 month lead using cfsv2 t382 model which outperformed the imd s operational forecasts statistical models in terms of forecast skill by about 0 18 102 however 142 proposed one month gain in the predictability of indian rainfall by using burst initialization i e perturbated initial conditions in the atmospheric conditions ignoring the false alarms of 2006 and 2016 all major droughts during the period 2003 2017 were successfully simulated 4 4 prediction of hydrological and agricultural droughts predictions for soil moisture and runoff anomalies are simulated in a hydrological model driven by climate forecasts and other land variables with the skill dependent on both climate forcing and initial hydrological conditions ihc the soil moisture and total runoff for india were successfully simulated at 7 day lead by running variable infiltration capacity vic 83 model forced by raw and corrected gefs forecasts with ihcs generated using observed imd forcing on 14 february and 14 july each year 121 the results highlighted the dominating role of ihcs in soil moisture forecast at 7 day lead time because of persistent high soil moisture compared to runoff simulations where persistence of both soil moisture and hydrological variables are important droughts in non monsoon season were predicted with a higher skill p o d avg 0 7 compared to monsoon p o d avg 0 5 but no significant improvement was observed in pod using bias corrected forcing the weekly drought prediction system based on soil moisture index smi successfully reproduced the spatio temporal structure of drought during 2002 2004 2005 and 2009 with some minor inconsistencies forecasts from cfsv2 and 4 high resolution models from the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm have been successfully used to stimulate agricultural and hydrological droughts at 45 day lead time 122 bias corrected iitm ensembles forcing and calibrated vic model successfully reproduced the observed the spatio temporal pattern of soil moisture and runoff anomalies at 45 day lead with better skill critical success index csi 0 71 for runoff and 0 67 for soil moisture compared to raw iitm ensemble csi 0 63 for runoff and 0 6 for soil moisture and cfsv2 5 challenges and future perspectives from the above studies it can be recognized that significant improvements have been made in ismr prediction in the past few decades there is however a large fraction of ismr variability yet to be explained and hence a large scope for improvements in seasonal prediction of ismr and droughts charney et al 15 found that predictability of second kind may contribute to better prediction of indian monsoon over large spatio temporal scales but it should be noted that these simulations are highly unreliable for shorter spatio temporal scales 106 although mean rainfall bias impacts the seasonal prediction skill 39 but enso monsoon relationship is more important for the seasonal predictability of indian monsoon and is overestimated by most of the climate models resulting in erroneous predictions 105 58 59 also the iod monsoon relationship is not simulated correctly and is opposite to the observed relationship in some models 59 hence remaining skill p o t e n t i a l a c t u a l in predictability can be achieved by improving the models ability to capture the pacific sst of erroneous years like 1997 iod monsoon relationship and monsoon el niño modoki relationship efficiently by improving model parameterizations and representation of physical processes 1 50 59 101 152 decadal predictions those at 10 to 30 year time scale as per smith et al 137 are often full of uncertainty that mainly stems from internal variability and model variability which are the spreads of the climate predictions of same model but with different initial conditions different realizations of the same model and predictions from different models also known as inter model uncertainty respectively 144 7 47 at a longer time scale such as centennial projections uncertainties linked to likelihood of future forcing are more important akhter et al 7 found that the internal variability defined as standard deviation of detrended variations or simply noise in simulations accounts for about 70 80 of total uncertainty in precipitation projections and dominate the inter model variability defined as standard deviation of multi model projections at a particular time 20 30 of total uncertainty this contribution reduces to 60 and 50 by the end of the century under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively they also noted higher model spread for changes in precipitation in 3 future periods 2006 35 2036 65 2066 95 under rcp 8 5 14 17 23 compared to rcp 4 5 13 15 20 7 in contrast to internal variability which is inherent to models and can hardly be reduced by ensemble method inter model uncertainty can be reduced by weighing the model based on past performance and bias correction of models 144 7 133 furthermore gcms operate at coarse resolution that limits their ability to capture and reproduce the finer scale processes at the regional and local scales 124 135 multiple statistical and dynamical downscaling approaches though help in obtaining high resolution data introduce uncertainties in the projections 21 37 134 5 1 finer scale spatial and temporal predictions some large scale climatic oscillations are associated with rapid changes in sst and slp anomalies causing unprecedented changes in the ismr at sub seasonal scales 13 correlations of rapidly changing pressure and temperature anomalies over northern asia with ismr have grown significantly during the recent decades 155 19 rapid changes in the pacific sst anomalies during 2012 were related to the decrease of forecast skill in the model developed by sahastrabuddhe et al 111 severe deficits of rainfall in any month of the summer may eventually result in a drought year even when the rainfall received in the rest of the three months of the season is near normal 13 for improved droughts forecasts it is imperative to understand the drivers of the sub seasonal variability of summer rainfall in this context active break predictions can be a valuable approach especially for extreme breaks following a lower than normal preceding active period wang et al 154 suggest that the monsoon oscillation active followed by break period and so on are induced locally and the cycle continues due to large scale upper level convergence in the eastern equatorial indian ocean eio left by previous monsoon cycle end phase this suggests that suppressed connection over eio can be a precursor of break periods with this knowledge ding and wang 22 used olr over southern india representing convection activity and 200 hpa heights representing circulation anomalies to predict extreme active and break periods of monsoon it was shown that extreme break phases can be predicted at a high hit rate of 72 and false alarm rate of 62 at lead times 6 7 days borah et al 12 developed a probabilistic model based on self organizing maps to predict active and break phases the model yielded a high hit rate of 70 and a small false alarm rate of 30 for 5 day lead time and it is seen that short breaks 5 days are predicted more accurately than longer breaks at all the lead times ranging from 5 to 20 days some other important studies on active break prediction are 42 3 2 as noted earlier the spatial heterogeneity of ismr and its correlations with climatic teleconnections is one of the important factors responsible for low skill forecasts owing to this many recent studies have performed analysis at regional scale considering a set of homogenous regions in india 24 25 55 108 96 however a finer scale analysis without predefining homogenous regions based only on the regional climate can be more valuable in finding the precursor regions and improving the forecasts the higher resolution cfsv2 t382 38 km performed better in representing the monsoon intra seasonal oscillation miso and also reduced the climatological bias in june september precipitation compared to a lower resolution cfsv2 t126 100 km 109 multiple studies have noted improvements in prediction skill by using regional climate models either stand alone or coupled 79 20 135 and downscaled gcms 136 134 shah et al 122 noted a negative correlation high mean absolute error and small critical success index defined as the ratio of hits and sum of hits miss and false events csi 0 2 between the observations and model forecasted 7 day accumulated rainfall over the hilly and complex terrains of himalayan foothills the skill reduced with the increase in forecast accumulation time 15 days 30 days and 45 days similar results were found by sridevi et al 140 with gfs model at t574 and t1534 resolution hit score 60 though the skill was better with t1534 resolution the critical success index of predicting droughts based on spi spi 0 5 and ssi ssi 0 5 also highlighted the lower skill over hilly terrains csi 0 1 compared to plains csi 0 3 120 119 other important studies featuring the impact of topography on prediction skills include 130 136 74 5 2 non stationarity and climatic interactions it has been observed that the influence of large scale teleconnections is not consistent on the variability of ismr for example a majority of droughts have occurred during el niño periods many el niño years however have resulted in near normal ismr 62 145 conversely the imd predictions of normal ismr for severe drought years during moderate el niño events of 2002 and 2004 questioned our understanding and modelling of pacific sst effects on ismr 9 33 30 depending on the background large scale low frequency variations in the climate ismr interaction with teleconnections may appear contrasting for example the strong el niño of 1997 did not result in severe deficits over india 62 the sst anomaly pattern in the pacific for example fluctuates the precursor regions for ismr 19 further recent studies have shown that the interaction of enso with the indian summer monsoon is not stationary 10 61 and that due to global warming the warm eastern pacific precursor of droughts ep el niño has shifted to the central pacific cp el niño 62 63 wang et al 155 found significant correlations of the central pacific sst anomalies with ismr in the recent decades and suggested a central pacific dipole region as one of their two new precursors for predicting ismr a dynamic linear regression model was proposed by maity and kumar 68 to predict ismr at a lead time of one month using enso and equinoo in which the model parameters are updated through bayesian posterior updating using the information in terms of observations available up to the time of forecast this captured the non stationary relationship between ismr variability and the two indices in general the model performed reasonably over the prediction period of 1986 to 2003 droughts however were underestimated generally recent works 25 24 26 suggest a more rigorous way to incorporate non stationarity in predicting droughts in dutta and maity 25 a time varying svr and copula based model are proposed for ismr prediction in which the model inputs change after every τ years τ is roughly between 3 and 5 years and is estimated through optimization of forecast skill accordingly calibration and validation period continuously slide by τ years input covariates among various lags of enso and equinoo for each period were obtained through graphical modelling that allows identifying conditionally independent covariates directly associated with the ismr the results showed that the time varying model predicted summer droughts more accurately than the stationary model in which the associations between ismr and enso and equinoo were kept stationary the results also suggested that the 90th percentile prediction intervals covered almost all droughts the same approach was applied at regional scale over five homogenous regions of india for the prediction of 5 month lead ismr 24 in this case however many other large scale climatic indices were searched for the best model inputs in different sliding calibration periods however the performance of regional models for example in terms of rmse did not improve over the pan india ismr models developed in dutta and maity 25 and many of the droughts in different regions were under predicted i e rainfall anomaly predicted was smaller than observed anomaly the approach was further adopted in dutta and maity 26 for one month ahead monthly streamflow prediction of bhadra dam basin in karnataka the results showed that the time varying models predicted streamflow more accurately than the time invariant models for the testing period of 2001 to 2003 however the models seem to generally overestimate the low flows and severe low flows were generally out of the 80th percentile prediction interval clearly these works suggest that the operational statistical models need to be updated to embrace the changes associated with global warming an understanding of the changes to climatic interactions with ismr will help in identifying new non stationary precursors required to improve the forecast skill in the coming decades 5 3 recent advances in drought science as mentioned above sudden transitions in the climate state can reverse the direction of ismr within weeks from positive anomaly to negative anomaly sudden onset and intensification of droughts termed as flash droughts have received significant attention recently owing to their large societal impacts mainly attributed to our lack of preparedness in managing these events 164 165 the mechanisms of flash drought intensification relies on deficits of rainfall and above average temperatures and result in feedbacks that potentially enhance drought intensity further 76 45 116 115 understanding of flash drought evolution feedback mechanisms involved and their incorporation in sub seasonal drought forecasting systems are important research areas for advancing drought science in india winter precipitation and temperature in snow dominated mountainous regions control water availability in the low lying downstream watersheds in later seasons lack of precipitation or higher temperatures during winter can severely reduce the water security in the downstream regions in ensuing spring and summer due to the alterations of precipitation and temperature regimes in a warmer climate the concept of snow drought defined as lack of winter precipitation and or higher temperatures in snow dominated regions has recently emerged 44 48 many basins in india including the indus and ganga are dominated by snow and glaciers in the himalayas serious considerations should be given to the global warming driven changes in snow droughts and the resulting water availability in the basins declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

20127,a major section of india s economy is directly linked with water dependent food and energy systems skillful predictions of droughts play a pivotal role in sustainable water management and evading serious damages to agriculture production and economy of a region recent decades have witnessed valuable advances in scientific understanding and prediction of droughts in india in this review we synthesize major sources of drought predictability over different regions in india we find that a few large scale atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns and regional scale hydrometeorological variables are key to understanding and predicting drought occurrences we also present a concise summary of major statistical and dynamical forecasting based modelling efforts in drought predictions although major strides have been taken in drought prediction in the recent decades important gaps remain in understanding the onset and spatio temporal dynamics of droughts further many opportunities of improving the skill of drought prediction over india are envisaged and many impending challenges are highlighted the overall picture is that significant efforts and investments are critical for understanding and skillfully predicting droughts over india keywords drought prediction ismr statistical models enso dynamical models 1 introduction drought over a region is defined when water availability in the region is significantly lower than the normal among the most complex natural eco hydrological processes droughts can occur at temporal scales of weeks to years and spatial scales of cities to continents 148 125 droughts can appear in different forms such as deficits in precipitation lack of soil moisture deficits of streamflow and lack of snowfall among others corresponding stresses to the natural ecosystem can emerge for example agricultural stresses are most clearly reflected in soil moisture deficits 65 82 many drought definitions have evolved over the years and corresponding indices or metrics have been proposed to quantify drought intensities discussed in detail in section 2 the all india summer june july august september monsoon rainfall ismr variability is generally used to distinguish drought and wet years in india agricultural yield in india is highly correlated with ismr and droughts can reduce the gross domestic product gdp of the country by 2 to 5 through crop failure 29 ismr drought of 1987 fig 1 affected the agriculture activities in roughly 59 million hectares crop area 46 of the total all india crop area and resulted in severe deficits in drinking water in large parts of the country 163 accurate seasonal predictions of droughts can help in early preparedness efforts and better management thereby saving lives and the economy sub seasonal predictions are most useful to farmers who have to decide and manage the necessary investment options in crop production before the cropping season 122 114 104 over the past few decades there have been significant advances in drought prediction over india and most of the state of the art models show promising skill in forecasting ismr tendency more than a month ahead however significant gaps remain in explaining the ismr annual and sub seasonal variability and hence in prediction of droughts in this work we discuss the major large scale climatic teleconnections that are shown to explain the majority of ismr variability followed by different approaches that have evolved in the recent years to predict droughts including various statistical and dynamical approaches and finally we highlight some of the emerging challenges and future research directions that can help in advancing models for drought predictions over india 2 drought definitions droughts nearly occur in all regions of the globe with varying frequency and the associated negative impacts on economy society and ecosystems which vary spatially and temporally depending on the societal context of drought 156 a universal definition of drought is thus unrealistic anticipation because drought definition should reflect the spatio temporal variability stochastic nature of water demand and socio economic factors that are functions of climate regimes 157 scores of definitions of drought have been developed across multiple disciplines according to their perspectives of droughts and their impacts these definitions of droughts are broadly categorized either as conceptual definitions offer a general qualitative idea of drought without considering about onset termination and severity and operational definitions that attempt to identify and quantify the key characteristics of droughts including onset termination and severity 157 156 operational definitions are formulated as drought indices that can be used to analyze the frequency severity and duration of a given drought event to provide an early warning system 80 17 the drought definitions also vary based on the variable or context used to describe them and are hence divided into 4 major classes 80 157 17 a meteorological drought b hydrological droughts c agricultural droughts d socio economic drought meteorological drought is defined as a period of months to years that are deficit in precipitation 38 27 and are often augmented by above normal temperature and high potential evapotranspiration 17 meteorological droughts most often preceed and trigger other kinds of droughts hydrological drought is defined as a period with below normal surface and sub surface water levels 146 149 while agricultural drought is a period with inadequate soil moisture to sustain crop growth 107 158 finally socio economic drought arises when the demand for water and related socioeconomic goods and services exceed its supply due to meteorological and hydrological scarcity of water 16 80 a collection of multiple drought indices have been developed over the recent decades to identify and characterize different kinds of droughts with each having its own advantages and limitations in monitoring and forecasting droughts 151 160 57 93 the most commonly used drought indices to characterize monitor and forecast droughts in india are given in table 1 3 data driven approaches data driven statistical models and empirical models have served as powerful tools in understanding and forecasting climatic variables imd heavily relies on statistical models for long range operational forecasting of ismr with the most recent statistical models developed and updated with efforts of many years imd issues two long range forecasts first in the mid april for the ismr and then an updated forecast in june for jas all india rainfall 97 the details of imd multiple linear regression models can be found at https mausam imd gov in imd latest contents seasonal forecast php in most cases data driven models for drought prediction are physics driven where the predictor variables are selected based on their influence on ismr variability through some atmospheric or oceanic physical processes in this section we summarize the most important predictors for ismr and droughts challenges in developing models and different modelling attempts in the recent years to forecast droughts including purely time series analysis linear regression and artificial intelligence based approaches 3 1 use of standard climate indices most of the recent work in statistical approaches has been devoted to understanding the influence of large scale climatic oscillations on ismr and how they can be used to predict droughts a major lead in statistical forecasting of indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr definition jjas happened when it was found that the eastern pacific el niño southern oscillation ep enso plays a significant role in driving a major fraction of the monsoon variability 52 103 most of the severe droughts over india have happened during the el niño warmer sst in eastern pacific phase of enso 56 61 sst anomalies over the indian ocean affect the variability of ismr through the indian ocean dipole iod and recent works have demonstrated that the atmospheric component of iod called the equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo is more correlated with ismr 34 68 and can be a better predictor of droughts the negative phase of equinoo is comprised of negative and positive convection anomalies over the western and the eastern equatorial indian ocean respectively and westerly wind anomalies in the equatorial indian ocean and a suppressed ismr the anomalies reverse during the positive phase of equinoo many droughts have occurred during the negative phase of equinoo and most of the droughts over india are well explained by a co occurrence of negative equinoo and negative enso i e el niño 145 apart from the pacific and indian oceans other distant regional climates are also believed to influence the variability of ismr of particular interest are the sst anomalies in the north atlantic ocean that affect the snow cover over the eurasia in anomalous snow winters when the snow cover is large the eurasia does not heat up strongly during spring and summer the decrease in the temperature gradient between indian ocean and eurasia landmass decreases the strength of indian summer monsoon 28 hence sst anomalies over the north atlantic ocean as depicted by the north atlantic oscillation nao for example can be important predictors of droughts over india 40 141 other large scale low frequency oceanic oscillations such as the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo are thought to influence the ismr through their influence on the strengths of enso and nao patterns 71 131 for example ganguli and reddy 35 found that higher fraction 60 of rainfall deficit years happened when amo was in negative phase borah et al 13 noted that most of the non el niño droughts occurred when north atlantic ocean was relatively cold furthermore it was noted that large scale rossby waves caused severe sub seasonal declines in the monsoon rainfall over india mainly during late monsoon 13 3 2 search of precursors instead of the predefined standard climate indices for example nino3 4 for enso which are metrics for major states of the climate it is prudent to search for specific regional climates that are linked with ismr through teleconnections 19 95 155 if a few leading regional climates are found to be linked with ismr these can be considered as the precursors of the ismr and can be utilized for months ahead drought prediction much of the research in this area has relied on developing correlation maps of ismr with months ahead sea level pressure slp and or sst fields over the globe and it is hoped that a few significantly correlated regions will appear from the maps the imd operational statistical models for ismr forecasts 97 use multiple predictors that are 1 to 4 months lead time climates in different regions around the globe including the north atlantic and north pacific ssts equatorial south indian ocean sst east asia slp and eurasia land surface temperature among others it is likely that some of the precursor regions in the correlation maps are interrelated and hence do not add independent skills to drought forecasting based on 4 and 5 month lead times slp and air temperature di capua et al 19 obtained a set of five independent precursors by removing correlated precursors using partial correlations besides the pacific and atlantic regions the authors found two precursors of ismr in the arctic and one in indonesia similarly based on correlation fields wang et al 155 showed that central pacific warm sst anomalies ahead of the summer affect the ismr which is supported by sahastrabuddhe et al 111 who found central and eastern pacific warm sst anomalies el niño events during wide spread monsoon rainfall deficit years it should be noted however that predictors found through correlation may not have a physical relationship with ismr thus the list of predictors needs to be scrutinized to remove those that show spurious correlations 3 3 spatial heterogeneity in ismr there is a large degree of spatial variability in summer rainfall over india see drought of 1987 in fig 1 part of which can be attributed to local factors such as orography and the land cover type but a significant portion is related to the large scale climatic teleconnections 36 84 88 159 the spatially varying correlation of climatic teleconnections with summer rainfall suggests multiple avenues in the context of drought prediction or in general ismr prediction the use of lumped average rainfall over india may confound regional prediction skills of the climatic teleconnections resulting in lower skill of ismr prediction on the other hand the use of regional or finer scale rainfall anomalies can produce global precursors for drought prediction more conspicuously even by using the standard climate indices prediction of droughts over india can be improved by considering regional or finer scale anomalies rather than all india rainfall indeed finer scale predictions are more directly useful for regional scale planning and management sahastrabuddhe et al 111 identified nine spatial patterns of indian summer monsoon using k means clustering algorithm and found some distinct precursors for the patterns that showed wide scale rainfall deficits they noted that climatic teleconnections can provide important information on the spatial distribution of monsoon rainfall in addition to the lumped all india summer rainfall predictions at regional scale considering climatically homogenous regions is performed in many recent studies 25 24 55 96 108 3 4 multiple modelling frameworks a basic and powerful statistical modelling approach that uses multiple predictors to predict droughts in a region is multiple linear regression mlr framework given as y α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β p x p where y is the drought series in terms of a drought index and x 1 to x p are the predictors α is the intercept term β 1 to β p are the corresponding coefficients and is the residual term the most simplistic linear regression framework utilizes the rainfall anomalies from a few previous months to predict future droughts these include autoregression based models such as autoregressive integrated moving average arima models mishra et al 78 and mishra and desai 77 found that for kansasbati river basin area 4265 km2 in west bengal the correlation skill given as the correlation coefficient between the forecasted drought indices and the observed values was small 0 35 at lead times of 4 months tiwari and mishra 147 considered lagged accumulated rainfall spi and spei over past months to forecast storage anomalies in 91 reservoirs over india the results showed that lagged rainfall provides a high correlation skill 0 7 in predicting 1 to 3 months ahead reservoir anomalies and it was found all the four major drought months from 2002 to 2017 were primarily related to below average monsoon in the previous year it was further noted that lagged ssi when available can improve upon spi and spei in forecasting reservoir anomalies imd stage1 linear regression model with multiple precursors showed a correlation skill 0 82 for 1 5 months ahead ismr forecasts for the period 1981 2004 97 though the correlation equation used in the analysis is not correct equation 6 in their paper for the same forecast period di capua et al 19 showed moderate correlations of 0 35 based on imd precursors used in rajeevan et al 97 for longer leads of two and four months maity and kumar 69 used a composite index of lagged enso and equinoo to predict monthly rainfall anomalies over india copula framework was used to model the dependence between ismr and the composite index while the uncertainty between the dependence was utilized to estimate the uncertainty bands of the predicted ismr the model performed significantly better than the linear regression based models however a visual analysis of forecasts of drought months suggests that most of the drought months 16 out of 25 were outside the 90th percentile uncertainty bands ganguli and reddy 35 used enso iod and amo to predict up 1 to 3 month lead time six monthly spi spi6 in western rajasthan using support vector regression svr then copula framework was used to develop joint probability distribution of the observed and svm predicted spi6 which was then used to simulate the ensembles of droughts conditional on the predictions from svm giving the uncertainty of the predictions in their work most of the droughts were within the 95th percentile prediction intervals though the prediction intervals in many cases were wide covering wet range spi6 1 it is also noted that summer months showed larger uncertainty in predictions as compared to the winter seasons wang et al 155 observed smaller and negative correlation skill of imd operational forecasting system in predicting ismr for 1989 to 2012 period surendran et al 145 developed a linear model with enso and equinoo indices for summer as predictors that is able to explain more than half of the variance in ismr and the one month ahead lead time predictions showed 0 5 correlation skill with ismr another approach that has been found useful is to decompose the drought index into multiple independent components that can be predicted with better accuracy without significant loss of information maity et al 70 used wavelet based decomposed series to predict transitions of meteorological drought to agricultural and hydrologic drought in upper mahanadi basin in chhattisgarh with lesser assumptions than wavelet decomposition adarsh and reddy 6 employed the empirical mode decomposition technique to decompose the original spi series into multiple independent components for meteorological drought prediction over kerala telangana and orrisa drought processes do not necessarily follow a linear relationship with the lagged index values and exogenous predictors especially for short term droughts such as one month spi1 or three month spi3 6 70 78 due to their capability to capture non linear relationships artificial intellai based models to predict droughts have received significant attention recently 73 110 132 for kansasbati river basin mishra et al 78 found better performance of hybrid arima artificial neural network ann model than arima model malik et al 73 compared models based on mlr co active neuron fuzzy inference system canfis and multiple layer perceptron neural networks mlpnn to predict droughts over two small watersheds of the ganga river it was observed that canfis and mlpnn performed better for smaller scale droughts than mlr and all the models performed competitively for longer scale 6 months droughts ganguli and reddy 35 employed support vector regression using enso iod and amo indices as predictors for droughts over western rajasthan and found a moderate correlation skill of 0 55 for 3 month lead time drought kashid et al 54 used climate teleconnections enso and equinoo and local covariates e g outgoing long wave radiation olr to predict weekly streamflow for summer season over mahanadi river using genetic programming they observed a reasonable streamflow forecast skill nse of roughly 0 67 in general however streamflow in low flow weeks and months were overestimated consistently in most of the 13 summers analyzed from 1990 to 2003 similar results can be observed in their later studies maity and kashid 67 66 sahoo et al 112 compared recurrent neural networks rnn and long short term memory rnn lstm rnn to predict 1 month ahead lower quantile monthly streamflows at basantpura station of mahanadi river the results showed high forecasts skill of both modelling frameworks and it is found that lstm rnn only marginally improves over rnn nse values of 0 878 and 0 843 these studies showed marginal prediction skill improvements of ai based models over mlr based models besides the standard climatic indices regional precursors using correlation maps have been used as predictors for ismr di capua et al 19 used 4 to 5 months ahead temperature and pressure anomalies of five independent precursor regions in an mlr based model to predict ismr variability the model yielded a modest albeit better than operational imd forecasts correlation of 0 4 for 1981 2004 forecast period however based on imd definition of drought of rainfall 10 below the long term mean none of the four drought years in the period were predicted accurately from the physical understanding of the monsoon and climate teleconnections and correlation maps wang et al 155 developed an ismr prediction model based on spring season temperature and pressure anomalies in four precursor regions the model showed an improved correlation skill of 0 64 for the 1921 2012 forecasted period 4 physically based approaches besides statistical approaches of weather predictions which only consider physically based empirical relationships between the predictors and predictand without accounting for the detailed underlying physical mechanisms dynamical approaches are mostly based on the physical processes in the atmosphere ocean and land surfaces dynamical predictions rely on climate models global or and regional and or hydrological models that imitate the physical processes by a large set of numerical equations these climate models represent and simulate the physical and thermodynamical processes either in the atmosphere only agcms or oceans ogcms or coupling of both coupled ocean atmosphere since dynamical models are physically based they have the ability to capture nonlinear interaction of climate systems and thus are capable of predicting unprecedented conditions even under non stationary climate besides uncertainty in initial conditions inaccurate knowledge of evolutionary mechanisms of weather processes introduces uncertainty in the model termed as model uncertainty charney et al 15 hypothesized a second kind of predictability that stems from the low frequency variations of boundary forcing anomalies such as sea surface temperature sst ice cover and soil moisture and act as the basis for seasonal predictability several post processing techniques such as bias correction methods multi model ensemble mme technique and downscaling procedures have proved fruitful in improving the forecast skill 4 60 105 the use of gcms for prediction of indian summer monsoon rainfall ismr started in the early 1990s when different modelling groups tried to simulate 1987 and 1988 monsoon features under the monsoon numerical experimental group program 86 and atmospheric model inter comparison project amip and highlighted that models show incongruity in simulating the interannual variability of monsoon even though forced with observed sst 139 31 4 1 meteorological droughts prediction using agcms out of 30 agcms from amip only 11 models performed realistically in simulating the mean rainfall and interannual variation of monsoon over india and the skill was high during enso associated seasons though their performance was poor for extremes years 31 in addition to better skill in weekly rainfall forecasts reasonable skill scores probability of detection pod threat score and others 0 5 were also reported for excess and scanty categories of weekly rainfall over multiple regions of india 114 mean ensemble technique has been satisfactorily implemented in simulating the essential features of ismr such as climatology intra seasonal variability and successfully validated against observation for the drought year 2002 113 a reasonable agreement between model simulations from national centre for environmental prediction s t170 l42 model and observation was found in key features of ismr such as climatology monsoon circulations etc for the period 1985 2004 however differences were evident in the magnitude of interannual and intra seasonal variability 106 moreover models forecasts skill was poor in predicting droughts and excess monsoons for example droughts of 1987 and 2002 and excess of 1994 which were later on efficiently simulated except 1994 by averaging the member ensembles with similar seasonal numbers of below and above average pentads by ratna and sikka 105 the skills of five different agcms were evaluated under the seasonal prediction of the indian monsoon project by forcing them with either observed sst forcing for the period 1985 2004 or persistent april ssts for 1987 1988 1994 1997 and 2002 results from observed sst forcing simulations showed that only two models successfully predicted the sign of seasonal rainfall anomalies during the drought and excess years with one model reasonably predicting the magnitudes also correlation coefficient 0 4 32 the bias identified in simulations could be either due to irrational oversensitivity of models to el niño southern oscillation enso or inability to simulate equatorial indian ocean oscillation equinoo or both 32 105 precipitation forecast from global ensemble forecast system s gefs at a lead of 7 days for the period 1985 2010 have shown higher skill in precipitation forecasts during non monsoon season correlation 0 6 compared to monsoon season correlation 0 5 though no significant improvement was observed after post processing 121 this low skill of monsoon forecasts was attributed to the inability of the model to simulate the intra seasonal variability specifically active break phases during monsoon 4 2 need for coupled ocean atmosphere gcms multiple studies found that most of agcms fail to predict droughts and ismr variability in general with a reasonable skill 30 31 106 32 although improvements have been seen in agcm forecast the actual predictability skill of agcms is much lower than the potential skill of 0 65 estimated by the perfect model which showed improvement when agcms were forced by simulated sst 59 despite improvements from post processing techniques the performance of agcms is relatively poor as compared to coupled ocean atmosphere models in predicting seasonal precipitation correlation 0 2 60 85 because of misrepresentation of air sea interactions over warm pool region and indo west pacific ocean however agcms forecast with better skill at lead 0 forecast started in june for june september rainfall 129 these deficiencies of agcms and the ability of coupled models to better capture the intra seasonal and interannual variability of ismr endorse the need for coupled ocean atmosphere models for monsoon prediction 59 98 153 4 3 meteorological droughts prediction using coupled models in general the forecasts from agcms have improved globally and regionally over the last few decades 64 138 161 but their predictability skill and use in operational mode is still a topic of discussion particularly for monsoon regions 59 105 preethi et al 92 used 7 coupled models from development of european multi model ensemble system for seasonal to interannual prediction demeter and reported a positive but weak predictability skill for monsoon forecasts at 1 months lead however multi model ensemble mme performed better in 1980s but failed afterward mme of six coupled models from ensembles were found to have higher skill compared to mme of demeter in forecasting ismr and it efficiently simulated droughts of 1972 1974 1982 and excess year 1961 but failed to capture the recent decline in enso monsoon relationship 61 which resulted in a reduction in actual skill from 0 3 for 1960 1979 to 0 1 for 1980 2005 98 comparing the skill of 6 gcms 4 coupled and 2 agcms in simulating ismr at three different leads 0 month 1 month and 2 month it was found that coupled models and agcms exhibit higher predictability at 1 month and 0 month lead respectively and the predictability skill decreases as lead time increases 129 127 shrivastava et al 127 considered 20 days ahead forecasts of rainfall from 44 ensemble members of indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm climate forecast system and global forecast system models over central india to predict 1 month spi 1 month spei and pdsi in their results they found that model based probabilistic predictions of drought occurrences months with spi 1 were in good agreement with observation hit rate false alarm rate skill coefficient 0 5 the predicted spei and pdsi also showed reasonable agreement with observations and efficiently captured 2002 2009 and 2014 droughts 127 in addition they also noted that the raw ensemble member forecasts have large biases and variance based bias correction improves the ensemble mean drought forecasts resulting in high hit and smaller false alarm rates the results from the comparison of monsoon season predicted spi from 9 gcms 3 agcms and 6 coupled gcms and imd for the period 1982 2010 concluded that all models predictability skill is low with maximum skill for gml and cfsv2 correlation 0 54 index of agreement 0 7 at all india scale however none of the models predicted droughts effectively for example cfsv2 predicted the maximum 3 out of 6 observed droughts 2002 2000 2009 5 weighted mean mme technique showed noticeable improvement in the skill of spi forecasts compared to arithmetic average mme and individual models jain et al 50 were able to achieve a skill of about 0 6 at seasonal lead times using multi model average of 8 prediction systems from climate historical forecast system which was found to improve by spatial averaging over a larger area because of extended spatial coherence of monsoon variability an increase was noted in the better representation of mean state of the indian monsoon its variability and predictability skill with higher resolution cfsv2 model t382 configuration correlation ρ 0 55 compared to low resolution configuration t126 ρ 0 49 101 moreover increased skill in the high resolution model was attributed to the significant improvement in iod monsoon relationship reduction in bias and enso monsoon teleconnection strengthening of teleconnection but both configurations failed to capture the correct phase of ismr in 7 years 1985 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 and 1997 101 100 in a recent study köhn reich and bürger 58 found that the removal of the erroneous year such as 1997 from the analysis could greatly improve the skill of forecasting in addition cfsv2 seas4 and multi model ensemble realistically simulated droughts and excess years during the period 1982 2005 consistent with previous studies multiple recent studies have highlighted that the errors underestimation of precipitation during missing enso monsoon link for example 1997 monsoon are due to the super sensitivity of models to enso rather than iod enso relationship and mean rainfall bias 50 58 multiple improvements were made in the cefsv2 model equations and algorithm for example improvements in parameterization of convection land surface processes improved ocean model improved cloud microphysics and other improvements have been useful in enhancing the model prediction skill 100 143 90 and skill score pearson s correlation improved from 0 55 to 0 67 0 118 to 0 326 over extended central india central india region 65 95 e 5 35 n 70 90 e 10 30 n 91 imd under the monsoon mission program successfully predicted two consecutive monsoon droughts of 2014 and 2015 at 3 month lead using cfsv2 t382 model which outperformed the imd s operational forecasts statistical models in terms of forecast skill by about 0 18 102 however 142 proposed one month gain in the predictability of indian rainfall by using burst initialization i e perturbated initial conditions in the atmospheric conditions ignoring the false alarms of 2006 and 2016 all major droughts during the period 2003 2017 were successfully simulated 4 4 prediction of hydrological and agricultural droughts predictions for soil moisture and runoff anomalies are simulated in a hydrological model driven by climate forecasts and other land variables with the skill dependent on both climate forcing and initial hydrological conditions ihc the soil moisture and total runoff for india were successfully simulated at 7 day lead by running variable infiltration capacity vic 83 model forced by raw and corrected gefs forecasts with ihcs generated using observed imd forcing on 14 february and 14 july each year 121 the results highlighted the dominating role of ihcs in soil moisture forecast at 7 day lead time because of persistent high soil moisture compared to runoff simulations where persistence of both soil moisture and hydrological variables are important droughts in non monsoon season were predicted with a higher skill p o d avg 0 7 compared to monsoon p o d avg 0 5 but no significant improvement was observed in pod using bias corrected forcing the weekly drought prediction system based on soil moisture index smi successfully reproduced the spatio temporal structure of drought during 2002 2004 2005 and 2009 with some minor inconsistencies forecasts from cfsv2 and 4 high resolution models from the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm have been successfully used to stimulate agricultural and hydrological droughts at 45 day lead time 122 bias corrected iitm ensembles forcing and calibrated vic model successfully reproduced the observed the spatio temporal pattern of soil moisture and runoff anomalies at 45 day lead with better skill critical success index csi 0 71 for runoff and 0 67 for soil moisture compared to raw iitm ensemble csi 0 63 for runoff and 0 6 for soil moisture and cfsv2 5 challenges and future perspectives from the above studies it can be recognized that significant improvements have been made in ismr prediction in the past few decades there is however a large fraction of ismr variability yet to be explained and hence a large scope for improvements in seasonal prediction of ismr and droughts charney et al 15 found that predictability of second kind may contribute to better prediction of indian monsoon over large spatio temporal scales but it should be noted that these simulations are highly unreliable for shorter spatio temporal scales 106 although mean rainfall bias impacts the seasonal prediction skill 39 but enso monsoon relationship is more important for the seasonal predictability of indian monsoon and is overestimated by most of the climate models resulting in erroneous predictions 105 58 59 also the iod monsoon relationship is not simulated correctly and is opposite to the observed relationship in some models 59 hence remaining skill p o t e n t i a l a c t u a l in predictability can be achieved by improving the models ability to capture the pacific sst of erroneous years like 1997 iod monsoon relationship and monsoon el niño modoki relationship efficiently by improving model parameterizations and representation of physical processes 1 50 59 101 152 decadal predictions those at 10 to 30 year time scale as per smith et al 137 are often full of uncertainty that mainly stems from internal variability and model variability which are the spreads of the climate predictions of same model but with different initial conditions different realizations of the same model and predictions from different models also known as inter model uncertainty respectively 144 7 47 at a longer time scale such as centennial projections uncertainties linked to likelihood of future forcing are more important akhter et al 7 found that the internal variability defined as standard deviation of detrended variations or simply noise in simulations accounts for about 70 80 of total uncertainty in precipitation projections and dominate the inter model variability defined as standard deviation of multi model projections at a particular time 20 30 of total uncertainty this contribution reduces to 60 and 50 by the end of the century under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively they also noted higher model spread for changes in precipitation in 3 future periods 2006 35 2036 65 2066 95 under rcp 8 5 14 17 23 compared to rcp 4 5 13 15 20 7 in contrast to internal variability which is inherent to models and can hardly be reduced by ensemble method inter model uncertainty can be reduced by weighing the model based on past performance and bias correction of models 144 7 133 furthermore gcms operate at coarse resolution that limits their ability to capture and reproduce the finer scale processes at the regional and local scales 124 135 multiple statistical and dynamical downscaling approaches though help in obtaining high resolution data introduce uncertainties in the projections 21 37 134 5 1 finer scale spatial and temporal predictions some large scale climatic oscillations are associated with rapid changes in sst and slp anomalies causing unprecedented changes in the ismr at sub seasonal scales 13 correlations of rapidly changing pressure and temperature anomalies over northern asia with ismr have grown significantly during the recent decades 155 19 rapid changes in the pacific sst anomalies during 2012 were related to the decrease of forecast skill in the model developed by sahastrabuddhe et al 111 severe deficits of rainfall in any month of the summer may eventually result in a drought year even when the rainfall received in the rest of the three months of the season is near normal 13 for improved droughts forecasts it is imperative to understand the drivers of the sub seasonal variability of summer rainfall in this context active break predictions can be a valuable approach especially for extreme breaks following a lower than normal preceding active period wang et al 154 suggest that the monsoon oscillation active followed by break period and so on are induced locally and the cycle continues due to large scale upper level convergence in the eastern equatorial indian ocean eio left by previous monsoon cycle end phase this suggests that suppressed connection over eio can be a precursor of break periods with this knowledge ding and wang 22 used olr over southern india representing convection activity and 200 hpa heights representing circulation anomalies to predict extreme active and break periods of monsoon it was shown that extreme break phases can be predicted at a high hit rate of 72 and false alarm rate of 62 at lead times 6 7 days borah et al 12 developed a probabilistic model based on self organizing maps to predict active and break phases the model yielded a high hit rate of 70 and a small false alarm rate of 30 for 5 day lead time and it is seen that short breaks 5 days are predicted more accurately than longer breaks at all the lead times ranging from 5 to 20 days some other important studies on active break prediction are 42 3 2 as noted earlier the spatial heterogeneity of ismr and its correlations with climatic teleconnections is one of the important factors responsible for low skill forecasts owing to this many recent studies have performed analysis at regional scale considering a set of homogenous regions in india 24 25 55 108 96 however a finer scale analysis without predefining homogenous regions based only on the regional climate can be more valuable in finding the precursor regions and improving the forecasts the higher resolution cfsv2 t382 38 km performed better in representing the monsoon intra seasonal oscillation miso and also reduced the climatological bias in june september precipitation compared to a lower resolution cfsv2 t126 100 km 109 multiple studies have noted improvements in prediction skill by using regional climate models either stand alone or coupled 79 20 135 and downscaled gcms 136 134 shah et al 122 noted a negative correlation high mean absolute error and small critical success index defined as the ratio of hits and sum of hits miss and false events csi 0 2 between the observations and model forecasted 7 day accumulated rainfall over the hilly and complex terrains of himalayan foothills the skill reduced with the increase in forecast accumulation time 15 days 30 days and 45 days similar results were found by sridevi et al 140 with gfs model at t574 and t1534 resolution hit score 60 though the skill was better with t1534 resolution the critical success index of predicting droughts based on spi spi 0 5 and ssi ssi 0 5 also highlighted the lower skill over hilly terrains csi 0 1 compared to plains csi 0 3 120 119 other important studies featuring the impact of topography on prediction skills include 130 136 74 5 2 non stationarity and climatic interactions it has been observed that the influence of large scale teleconnections is not consistent on the variability of ismr for example a majority of droughts have occurred during el niño periods many el niño years however have resulted in near normal ismr 62 145 conversely the imd predictions of normal ismr for severe drought years during moderate el niño events of 2002 and 2004 questioned our understanding and modelling of pacific sst effects on ismr 9 33 30 depending on the background large scale low frequency variations in the climate ismr interaction with teleconnections may appear contrasting for example the strong el niño of 1997 did not result in severe deficits over india 62 the sst anomaly pattern in the pacific for example fluctuates the precursor regions for ismr 19 further recent studies have shown that the interaction of enso with the indian summer monsoon is not stationary 10 61 and that due to global warming the warm eastern pacific precursor of droughts ep el niño has shifted to the central pacific cp el niño 62 63 wang et al 155 found significant correlations of the central pacific sst anomalies with ismr in the recent decades and suggested a central pacific dipole region as one of their two new precursors for predicting ismr a dynamic linear regression model was proposed by maity and kumar 68 to predict ismr at a lead time of one month using enso and equinoo in which the model parameters are updated through bayesian posterior updating using the information in terms of observations available up to the time of forecast this captured the non stationary relationship between ismr variability and the two indices in general the model performed reasonably over the prediction period of 1986 to 2003 droughts however were underestimated generally recent works 25 24 26 suggest a more rigorous way to incorporate non stationarity in predicting droughts in dutta and maity 25 a time varying svr and copula based model are proposed for ismr prediction in which the model inputs change after every τ years τ is roughly between 3 and 5 years and is estimated through optimization of forecast skill accordingly calibration and validation period continuously slide by τ years input covariates among various lags of enso and equinoo for each period were obtained through graphical modelling that allows identifying conditionally independent covariates directly associated with the ismr the results showed that the time varying model predicted summer droughts more accurately than the stationary model in which the associations between ismr and enso and equinoo were kept stationary the results also suggested that the 90th percentile prediction intervals covered almost all droughts the same approach was applied at regional scale over five homogenous regions of india for the prediction of 5 month lead ismr 24 in this case however many other large scale climatic indices were searched for the best model inputs in different sliding calibration periods however the performance of regional models for example in terms of rmse did not improve over the pan india ismr models developed in dutta and maity 25 and many of the droughts in different regions were under predicted i e rainfall anomaly predicted was smaller than observed anomaly the approach was further adopted in dutta and maity 26 for one month ahead monthly streamflow prediction of bhadra dam basin in karnataka the results showed that the time varying models predicted streamflow more accurately than the time invariant models for the testing period of 2001 to 2003 however the models seem to generally overestimate the low flows and severe low flows were generally out of the 80th percentile prediction interval clearly these works suggest that the operational statistical models need to be updated to embrace the changes associated with global warming an understanding of the changes to climatic interactions with ismr will help in identifying new non stationary precursors required to improve the forecast skill in the coming decades 5 3 recent advances in drought science as mentioned above sudden transitions in the climate state can reverse the direction of ismr within weeks from positive anomaly to negative anomaly sudden onset and intensification of droughts termed as flash droughts have received significant attention recently owing to their large societal impacts mainly attributed to our lack of preparedness in managing these events 164 165 the mechanisms of flash drought intensification relies on deficits of rainfall and above average temperatures and result in feedbacks that potentially enhance drought intensity further 76 45 116 115 understanding of flash drought evolution feedback mechanisms involved and their incorporation in sub seasonal drought forecasting systems are important research areas for advancing drought science in india winter precipitation and temperature in snow dominated mountainous regions control water availability in the low lying downstream watersheds in later seasons lack of precipitation or higher temperatures during winter can severely reduce the water security in the downstream regions in ensuing spring and summer due to the alterations of precipitation and temperature regimes in a warmer climate the concept of snow drought defined as lack of winter precipitation and or higher temperatures in snow dominated regions has recently emerged 44 48 many basins in india including the indus and ganga are dominated by snow and glaciers in the himalayas serious considerations should be given to the global warming driven changes in snow droughts and the resulting water availability in the basins declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

20128,the ambiguity of competing water security interpretations obscure the inherently political dimensions of water being explicit about how water security is conceptualised reveals the underlying assumptions about for whom is water is secured for what purpose and how it is secured here a framing cycle is adapted for the water security context that asks security of what against what for whom and over what timeframe the framing cycle provides a content analysis of documents representing australian water security framings across administrative levels whilst some overarching themes are common water for the environment agriculture and drinking water ubran water supplies each administrative level varies in emphasis and detail the variation is likely related to different responsibilities and roles at each level highlighting the need for fit for purpose definitions of water security rather than trying to accommodate all facets of water security at all levels the framing cycle was a useful tool in unpacking how water security was conceptualised at different levels however more nuanced insight could be achieved by combining the framing cycle with other lenses for example a decolonial lens keywords water security australia policy hueristic 1 introduction the term water security has become ubiquitous but it refers to numerous competing definitions and concepts the ambiguity may contribute to the depoliticising of water security in policy debates despite the inherently political dimensions of water 1 therefore interrogating the framing of water security can help to reveal implicit assumptions about what is really meant by the term and who benefits from it this article examines water security framings across several administrative levels 2 using an australian case study each administrative level represents a suite of water related responsibilities interests and power dynamics taken together they comprise the administrative institutional environment in which water security decisions are made table 1 documents corresponding to each level were analysed using a heuristic that asks security of what secured against what risks water security for whom and over what timeframe as shown in fig 1 the heuristic was adapted from helfgott s framing cycle for resilience 3 each document provides the boundaries within which the framing cycle is explored representing a different perspective on water security issues institutions are complex change over time and may have multiple roles each document provides only partial insight into the institutional perspective on water security the analysis indicates that multiple framings of water security operate at different administrative levels roles and responsibilities for water vary across levels as do resources and political imperatives thus it is to be expected that disparate framings of water security emerge the discussion examines gaps and discrepancies between the water security framings water security priorities shift across levels this illustrates the need for water security definitions to be fit for purpose and furthermore for those definitions to be clearly stated the analysis indicates a lack of clarity about how water security is defined in australian water policy more explicit articulation of water security objectives at different levels could allow greater policy precision and provide a framework for monitoring and evaluation it may promote policy consistency and reduce overlap across administrative levels the framing cycle itself is then discussed it is suggested that although the framing cycle has utility bringing in other analytical lenses adds value other lenses can introduce new considerations and question implicit assumptions as the discussion elaborates applying a decolonial lens to this institutional analysis would reveal a range of issues around water colonialism the article concludes that interrogating water security framings can provide valuable information about water security policy cohesiveness and that the framing cycle presented here is one effective tool that can be used for analysis 2 background water security concepts and approaches the concept of water security emerged in the 1990s and is increasingly prevalent in water discourses 4 it is suggested that the concept of water security is replacing previously dominant concepts such as sustainable water management or integrated water resources management 5 however there is no consensus about exactly what to include and exclude from our conceptualisations of water security water access is acutely bound with issues of power and structural inequality and thus the idea of water security presents an inherently political dilemma 1 yet water security is often presented as a self explanatory water management objective a number of water security definitions and frameworks have been developed 6 12 often the quest for water security involves quantifying water related risks setting standards and developing appropriate indices to measure progress 13 different academic disciplines bring different foci to water security conceptualisations varying according to the underpinning analytical assumptions for example agricultural studies tend to focus on water as an input to agricultural production and food security whereas hydrology is concerned with the security of the entire hydrological cycle 9 zeitoun et al suggest two main approaches broad integrated approaches or narrow reductionist approaches 8 it is outside of the scope of this article to review all approaches the critical point is that it that water security is defined and understood differently depending on the context 2 1 interrogating water security framings numerous methods can be used for unpacking water security framings depending on the context and research objective this overview gives selected examples in order to illustrate the variety of analytical approaches methods tend to include literature reviews and content analysis often combined with a disciplinary specific lens analysis can be enriched with data from additional sources such as interviews a literature review of disciplinary approaches to water security by cook bakker combined quantitative and qualitative methods such as content clouds to search articles analyse subject areas key terms and definitions 9 taylor undertook qualitative content analysis of policy documents 14 zeitoun s content analysis focused on literature in which term water security was used specific intent 8 boelens seeman s in depth investigation of yanque water security peru combined interviews literature review and secondary data 1 garrick hall use a risk lens 15 beek et al provide a literature review framed by three key dimensions social equity environmental sustainability and economic efficiency 16 staddon and scott draw on political ecology in their analysis 3 scott et al use societal ecosystem hydroclimatic systems approach to interpret and frame water security in several case studies 17 wilson et al combine two eyed seeing research and a hydrosocial approach to reframe water security based on tr ondëk hwëch in relationships to water 18 3 method water security framing cycle this article draws on previous work by undertaking a content analysis of water policy documents and plans a heuristic shown in fig 1 was developed that asks security of what secured against what risks water security for whom and over what timeframe the framing cycles that emerge from the heuristic explicitly address the key water security question of for whom is water secured 5 8 12 the heuristic was adapted from helfgott s resilience framing cycle 3 the adaptation of the tool is not an attempt to merge water security and resilience literatures rather the choice of this method reflects the utility of the questions asked at each stage of the framing cycle that reveal the boundaries of interest key perceived threats what desirable features need to be secured and whose interests are being supported each element has the potential to reframe the others in this article each document supplies the boundaries from whose perspective over what timeframe and so on for example the national plan for water security provides an approximation of the federal government s view of water security in 2007 based on a ten year plan the boundaries of the framings are important because some institutions have multiple roles the commonwealth government for example oversaw the national plan for water security it is also central to the office of northern australia which issued the report our north our future working along with the western australia queensland and northern territory governments 4 australian case study in australia water security interpretations have received limited attention taylor reviewed federal government water policy and found that water security was not explicitly defined within policy documents even those directly focused on the topic such as the national plan for water security 14 implicit interpretations of water security within australian policy tended to be narrow and consistent with cook and bakker s findings focused on water quantity 9 various water related measures are tracked by the australian government and can be found within reports such as water in australia which is produced annually by the bureau of meteorology 19 however the data is not evaluated against a water security framework the peak body for the water industry the australian water association noted the lack of an overarching cohesive framework and called on the australian government to define a water security agenda 20 this article aims to understand framings it does not attempt to assess water in australia as secure or insecure as a relatively arid country with variable rainfall and increasing demand for water there is a sense that australia is facing a water emergency 21 as regions dry due to climate change and modified land uses adaptive water management is critical yet it is unclear what water security looks like for australia how it might best be measured or who gets to determine what is considered secure or insecure the case study presented here focuses on the multiple administrative levels involved in the west kimberley in western australia the focal location was selected as a site of growing conflict about the future of water resources 22 24 decisions about the future of water in the region have both local and national significance 22 multiple levels of australian government have a role these are explored through document content analysis using the water security framing cycle 4 1 document selection at each administrative level a desktop review identified key documents about water security there is some overlap in the institutions involved due to the multiple functions performed at some administrative levels criteria for inclusion were documents containing plans or policies about water or about water security that had implications for the case study location note that not all documents were explicitly labelled as water security plans five documents were chosen the national plan for water security our north our future white paper on developing northern australia the water for growth urban western australia s water supply and demand outlook to 2050 the kimberley regional water plan strategic directions and actions 2010 2030 draft for public comment and the intergovernmental agreement on a national water initiative between the commonwealth of australia and the governments of new south wales victoria queensland south australia the australian capital territory and the northern territory or national water initiative 25 29 4 2 analysis of water security framings content analysis of the selected documents was undertaken using the four questions of the water security framing cycle the results are summarised in table 2 an overview of the results for each component of the framing cycle are as follows security of what the documents focused on water for the environment agriculture and urban water supplies drinking water supplies relative emphasis on each focal area and relative emphasis on water quantity versus quality varied between documents against what threats is water secured irrigation inefficiency was a key threat of the national water security plan whereas climate change was a key threat for western australia s water for growth plan our north our future identified insecure water access rights that is the water licences used by some jurisdictions were considered less secure than the national water access entitlement system which provides a perpetual property like right very few documents analysed discussed water security in relation to destructive aspects of water such as floods for whom is water being secured in general the plans secured water for agricultural water users and community members accessing urban water supplies the national plan for water security despite being national focused on securing water in the murray darling basin and great artesian basin over what timeframe timeframes varied most of the plans span several decades the national water initiative is intended to be a long term plan for water reform with periodic review but no particular end date 5 discussion 5 1 do we know what we mean by water security as noted earlier australian water policy lacks clear definitions of water security at the federal level none of the documents explicitly stated a definition or framework for water security the documents contained objectives for water that indicated certain water security approaches however the objectives did not link to a clear and cohesive vision for water security 5 2 multiple framings across levels the framing of water security issues has significant overlap across the documents with emphasis on agriculture the environment and urban water supplies however there are shifts in emphasis across administrative levels particularly around the threats against which water is secured for example the commonwealth government identifies insecure forms of property rights as a threat to water security by contrast the western australian state government s plan for urban water supply does not prioritise property rights reform some of the differences can be attributed to the different types of planning document for example our north our future considers water security in relation to enablingresource development whereas the water for growth urban plan provides long term planning for town and city drinking water supplies institutional roles and responsibilities for water likewise differ which is reflected in the framing cycles for example the commonwealth government co ordinates matters of national interest correspondingly there is a strong emphasis on ensuring cohesiveness between adjoining states and territories 5 3 the need for fit for purpose definitions the implication of the findings is that firstly the concept of water security is underexamined by the documents analysed here as suggested by the australian water association a clearer framework for a national water security agenda would provide policy direction secondly any water security definition must fit the context the findings suggest that water security is expressed at different administrative levels in relation to key responsibilities at that level therefore salient water security considerations shift across levels whilst it is appropriate to adapt water security definitions and objectives to fit the purpose of each administrative level there must also be cohesiveness between levels if australia adopts a water security framework in the future co ordination between the states territories and federal government would be required to avoid incompatible visions for water security 5 4 utility of framing cycle the four question heuristic based on helfgott s framing cycle provided a useful tool for understanding water security framing each question revealed a facet of water security within the boundaries of each document s purpose and logic further insight could be gained by either widening the analysis or by using additional analytical lenses a widened analysis could examine for example framings by industry organisations and community groups this would incorporate multiple views of water security not just the government framings explored here additional analytical lenses can be used to interrogate administrative water security framings from particular standpoints or critical frameworks for example decolonial and settler colonial studies literature critiques australian water management institutions 30 as a former british settlement australian water management has a foundation of water colonialism that is the claiming of water rights by colonists according to colonial logic and laws that legitimised their actions to the exclusion of indigenous peoples 22 31 each phase of australia s decades of water reform has further entrenched and strengthened the water rights of settler colonists 32 although data is limited a recent study found that in the nsw portion of the murray darling basin aboriginal organizations hold only 0 2 of the available surface water 33 this inequity is often obscured by the dominant discourse that frames indigenous people as new or community water users rather than peoples and nations with rights laws and institutions that pre exist colonial institutions 32 and yet the national agenda to develop and secure water resources avoids the troubling matter of water contestation and questions of for whom by focusing on building dams and introducing water markets as noted by langton water rights in northern australia are the new colonial frontier 34 this counter narrative is not captured by government framings therefore the heuristic can be enhanced by applying specific lenses to critique the framings and to examine what is excluded a further option is to expand each dimension with additional sub questions helfgott refers to ulrich s critical systems heuristics questions and provides an adapted version to complement the resilience framing cycle 3 35 a similar suite of sub questions could be adapted for the water security context 5 5 framing rhetoric versus implementation and action the analysis in this article examines conceptual framing of water security with the assumption that the conceptualisation of policy problems directly relates to the solutions proposed 36 however there is frequently a gap between policy aims and implementation the national plan for water security for example mentions several threats to water in australia including climate change irrigation inefficiency and governance challenges the plan however fails to address climate change in a systematic way 37 the expressed aims in the documents were not always directly supported by corresponding action and strategies consequently themes that appear consistent across the administrative levels such as security for environmental water may not be equally reflected by policy action for a more accurate picture that seperates the real priorities from mere rhetoric the documents texts need to be interpreted in conjunction with corresponding policy measures and implementation 6 conclusions water scarcity is an urgent concern water security is the proposed solution despite the ubiquity of the term water security in australian policy there is not a clear consistent framework nor a set of complementary yet distinct frameworks as the analysis shows water security framings diverge across administrative levels meanings and priorities interact and compete discrepancies in what is prioritised reflects different responsibilities and agendas the implications are that water security frameworks need to be fit for purpose in the case of australian policy which has yet to adopt an explicit water security definition or set of objectives there is a need for clearly articulated water security framework s in order to guide investment and action the water security framing cycle used here has utility providing a useful and simple heuristic for content analysis however broadening the analysis or introducing other analytical lenses would add further insight as we talk more and more about the need for water security now is the time for clarity about our water security visions and objectives credit authorship

agricultural water users and community members accessing urban water supplies the national plan for water security despite being national focused on securing water in the murray darling basin and great artesian basin over what timeframe timeframes varied most of the plans span several decades the national water initiative is intended to be a long term plan for water reform with periodic review but no particular end date 5 discussion 5 1 do we know what we mean by water security as noted earlier australian water policy lacks clear definitions of water security at the federal level none of the documents explicitly stated a definition or framework for water security the documents contained objectives for water that indicated certain water security approaches however the objectives did not link to a clear and cohesive vision for water security 5 2 multiple framings across levels the framing of water security issues has significant overlap across the documents with emphasis on agriculture the environment and urban water supplies however there are shifts in emphasis across administrative levels particularly around the threats against which water is secured for example the commonwealth government identifies insecure forms of property rights as a threat to water security by contrast the western australian state government s plan for urban water supply does not prioritise property rights reform some of the differences can be attributed to the different types of planning document for example our north our future considers water security in relation to enablingresource development whereas the water for growth urban plan provides long term planning for town and city drinking water supplies institutional roles and responsibilities for water likewise differ which is reflected in the framing cycles for example the commonwealth government co ordinates matters of national interest correspondingly there is a strong emphasis on ensuring cohesiveness between adjoining states and territories 5 3 the need for fit for purpose definitions the implication of the findings is that firstly the concept of water security is underexamined by the documents analysed here as suggested by the australian water association a clearer framework for a national water security agenda would provide policy direction secondly any water security definition must fit the context the findings suggest that water security is expressed at different administrative levels in relation to key responsibilities at that level therefore salient water security considerations shift across levels whilst it is appropriate to adapt water security definitions and objectives to fit the purpose of each administrative level there must also be cohesiveness between levels if australia adopts a water security framework in the future co ordination between the states territories and federal government would be required to avoid incompatible visions for water security 5 4 utility of framing cycle the four question heuristic based on helfgott s framing cycle provided a useful tool for understanding water security framing each question revealed a facet of water security within the boundaries of each document s purpose and logic further insight could be gained by either widening the analysis or by using additional analytical lenses a widened analysis could examine for example framings by industry organisations and community groups this would incorporate multiple views of water security not just the government framings explored here additional analytical lenses can be used to interrogate administrative water security framings from particular standpoints or critical frameworks for example decolonial and settler colonial studies literature critiques australian water management institutions 30 as a former british settlement australian water management has a foundation of water colonialism that is the claiming of water rights by colonists according to colonial logic and laws that legitimised their actions to the exclusion of indigenous peoples 22 31 each phase of australia s decades of water reform has further entrenched and strengthened the water rights of settler colonists 32 although data is limited a recent study found that in the nsw portion of the murray darling basin aboriginal organizations hold only 0 2 of the available surface water 33 this inequity is often obscured by the dominant discourse that frames indigenous people as new or community water users rather than peoples and nations with rights laws and institutions that pre exist colonial institutions 32 and yet the national agenda to develop and secure water resources avoids the troubling matter of water contestation and questions of for whom by focusing on building dams and introducing water markets as noted by langton water rights in northern australia are the new colonial frontier 34 this counter narrative is not captured by government framings therefore the heuristic can be enhanced by applying specific lenses to critique the framings and to examine what is excluded a further option is to expand each dimension with additional sub questions helfgott refers to ulrich s critical systems heuristics questions and provides an adapted version to complement the resilience framing cycle 3 35 a similar suite of sub questions could be adapted for the water security context 5 5 framing rhetoric versus implementation and action the analysis in this article examines conceptual framing of water security with the assumption that the conceptualisation of policy problems directly relates to the solutions proposed 36 however there is frequently a gap between policy aims and implementation the national plan for water security for example mentions several threats to water in australia including climate change irrigation inefficiency and governance challenges the plan however fails to address climate change in a systematic way 37 the expressed aims in the documents were not always directly supported by corresponding action and strategies consequently themes that appear consistent across the administrative levels such as security for environmental water may not be equally reflected by policy action for a more accurate picture that seperates the real priorities from mere rhetoric the documents texts need to be interpreted in conjunction with corresponding policy measures and implementation 6 conclusions water scarcity is an urgent concern water security is the proposed solution despite the ubiquity of the term water security in australian policy there is not a clear consistent framework nor a set of complementary yet distinct frameworks as the analysis shows water security framings diverge across administrative levels meanings and priorities interact and compete discrepancies in what is prioritised reflects different responsibilities and agendas the implications are that water security frameworks need to be fit for purpose in the case of australian policy which has yet to adopt an explicit water security definition or set of objectives there is a need for clearly articulated water security framework s in order to guide investment and action the water security framing cycle used here has utility providing a useful and simple heuristic for content analysis however broadening the analysis or introducing other analytical lenses would add further insight as we talk more and more about the need for water security now is the time for clarity about our water security visions and objectives credit authorship

20129,water scarcity turns into shortage when water supplies are mismatched with user demands after clarifying the different social and private uses of water i explain how to use prices to allocate treated utility water among municipal and industrial users and untreated raw water among irrigators assuming institutional capacity successful management of water scarcity requires prices that constrain total demand and revenues that cover the cost of reliable supply public acceptance of effective water pricing requires that policies protect the poor and the environment i e policies that prioritize social water over water competitively allocated among economic uses keywords water scarcity water pricing water markets political economy sustainability 1 introduction water shortages result when water supplies are inadequate to meet various demands this description probably makes sense to the average person but different academic disciplines bring different perspectives to its interpretation engineers and sociologists in their straw man forms might prefer civil works or subsidies to address physical or economic shortages respectively economists tend to blame shortages on failures to manage scarcity given market and price institutions water will be abundant if supply is greater than demand at a price of zero or scarce if demand is greater than supply at a price of zero in the presence of positive prices shortage or surplus results when the prices are set lower or higher than the level balancing supply and demand this axiom includes assumptions that economists often fail to elaborate or explore first prices reflect all useful information second prices fluctuate to reconcile relevant supply side costs and subjective demand side values third the good s use or role is uniformly understood and agreed by all participants when it comes to water these assumptions often do not hold first information over water sources and uses is diffused across time space and re use second water prices are often missing or distorted by non price factors third water s nature as a private or social good changes with its use and management 1 1 in this article i use individual excludable and or economic as synonyms for private and collective non excludable and or political as synonyms for social most discussions of treated or utility water focus on the tariffs paid by municipal and industrial water users these tariffs aim to cover the utility s operating and system costs but they often ignore the scarcity value of water in cases of managing water as a natural resource the price to raw or untreated water to agricultural or industrial users can help conserve the resource or merely cover administrative costs in either situation the correlation between price and scarcity might be positive negative or absent in this article i explain when it is appropriate to use economic tools to manage private water versus political tools to manage collective water define and explore supply demand price and non price factors affecting scarcity recount how utility water pricing has evolved and describe how markets for raw water succeed or fail i conclude with examples of where prices or markets managed scarcity and prevented shortage 2 managing scarcity in theory economists interpret scarcity as a cost with greater water scarcity implying a higher cost of acquiring water or doing without the severity of scarcity depends on the ratio of total demand to total supply several factors affect scarcity the institutions informal norms and formal rules managing water sources and uses the rate of water consumption relative to current and potential supplies and the transformation of individual choices into aggregated outcomes for example consider farmers competing for groundwater from a rapidly draining aquifer in the absence of pumping limits or other rationing institutions the farmers are stuck in a prisoner s dilemma in which all would gain by forbearance but none has an incentive to pump less without a means of ending this dilemma total demand outstrips supply water shortages emerge and crops dry out see chapter 13 in 46 in the subsections that follow i describe how management institutions non price factors supply demand and prices affect water scarcity my point is that the right incentives and institutions can help individuals and communities manage scarcity while the wrong incentives and institutions increase the risk of shortage 2 1 when to use prices and when to avoid them the problem of optimal water allocation is wicked because flows provide joint and several benefits to collective and private uses fig 1 untangles these uses its framework which can be applied to any set or mix of goods separates goods into four types based on each good s excludability and rivalry a good is excludable if access to its use can be restricted a good is non excludable if anyone can use it a rival or subtractable good is consumed in use whereas a non rival good can be re used fig 1 does not imply static or fixed uses as water s nature as a good can change a utility for instance can pump water from a common pool good aquifer into a club good distribution network that charges customers according to their private good metered consumption if the utility s water withdrawals are small relative to natural water sources then its operations do not materially reduce the benefits from remaining public good flows in the environment fig 1 also indicates that non excludable water is best managed via political top down or collective peer to peer methods while excludable water is best managed via economic methods that depend on property rights and prices since water flows and uses often overlap it is important to specify and separately manage non excludable and excludable water to prevent harmful spill overs negative externalities from use decisions given the common understanding of water resources as the property of the state or the people it makes sense to reserve non excludable uses based on a political collective process that reflects social and political goals before allocating remaining excludable water with economic tools to maximize private benefits 72 these steps do not deny the relevance or necessity of answering important questions on how much social water to reserve how to award and ration economic water or how to minimize negative externalities affecting non excludable waters assuming social water has been set aside and economic water allocated for better or worse 2 2 most water rights have already been allocated to private economic uses without regard to social benefits and costs in the worst cases the same water has been allocated to multiple users which weakens the value of those rights while also increasing the probability that the over appropriated source will be stressed to the point of shortage in more typical cases rights awarded for one use are converted to another use thereby harming others we turn to pricing excludable water to manage scarcity in the short run prices limit demand by allocating or rationing a fixed supply e g auctioning the right to take raw water from a river or setting treated water prices to limit demand for utility water in the longer run several weeks to years scarcity bolstered prices can encourage increases in supply via wells aqueducts dams desalination plants and so on but we will ignore the long run here scarcity can alter water s status as a good a utility s promise of non rivalrous service will for example be broken if heat and drought increase demand and decrease supply to the point that one customer s metered and paid for use impacts the quantity of water available to others this move from club to common pooled good does not inevitably lead to a tragedy of the commons 32 ostrom et al argue and demonstrate how effective collective action supports sustainable use of a common pooled good a common pool situation whereas failed collective action leads to a tragic common pool dilemma 46 increased withdrawals from natural sources can likewise create a common pool dilemma in which irrigation demands disrupt environmental flows that as public goods previously benefitted everyone in these circumstances political and social interventions are necessary but not sufficient to prevent further damages and functioning institutions are crucial for these interventions to work 45 42 34 the next paragraphs recount some examples of interventions that addressed scarcity and prevented shortages brisbane faced severe water scarcity in 2007 as reservoir levels fell to record lows during the 1996 2011 millennial drought as scarcity rose club good storage turned into a common pooled good in which each person s use left less for others rather than treat water as a private good by raising metered prices politicians called for cooperative restraint water use fell by 50 percent and the dilemma was converted into a situation in 2008 barcelona faced a similar risk of dry taps as reservoirs dropped to 15 percent of capacity after which point stored water would be unfit for treatment or drinking politicians and water managers banned outdoor watering shut off fountains and called for conservation but their most interesting and costly solution was importing water on ships from nearby spanish and french cities the ships contributed to public awareness of the need for conservation in a way that prices could not due to public unwillingness to accept higher charges from a utility that failed to manage its leaking network in any case the ships hardly mattered rain saved barcelona 53 12 in 2018 cape town faced a day zero in which pipes would go dry and people would need to collect drinking water from distribution points preventative actions included higher water prices city employees promoting conservation in neighborhoods and the publication of maps showing which households were consuming too much 67 consumption dropped by 50 percent as higher prices reduced quantity demanded and a conservation ethos similar to that of brisbane shifted demand in the timely arrival of seasonal rains similar to barcelona s miracle also helped by shifting supply out these shift and slide terms terms are defined and discussed below these examples show that collective mechanisms and price incentives can hold off shortages but long term security depends on stronger institutions and deeper reforms that discussion is beyond the scope of this article 3 3 zetland colenbrander for example describe the 100 year process of developing universal clean drinking water services in the netherlands 75 see 12 40 for deeper dives into the historic and institutional failures underpinning the crises in barcelona and cape town respectively so i will focus on policies that modify short run incentives the next subsection compares price and non price interactions before later subsections elaborate on supply demand and cost price value relations 2 2 non price shifters and price sliders the prior subsection focussed on treating water as the good it is excludable or non excludable rather than the good it was or one wishes it to be from here onwards we will discuss excludable water that can and should be managed as an economic good to get started it is useful to clarify the basic dynamics of supply and demand fig 2 shows two steps to reduce demand and thus scarcity via an inward shift in demand from thick to thin line to the black dot followed by a slide in quantity demanded to the red circle in response to an inward shift of the supply curve from thick to dashed line the following subsections give more detail on supply and demand this section clarifies how non price elements shifting demand can complement or conflict with with a price driven slide in demand inward shifts of demand occurred in brisbane and barcelona in the examples above as communications and community pressure changed people s desires for green lawns in cape town two elements reduced demand an awareness of the need to conserve that caused the shift to the black dot and higher water prices causing the supply curve to slide up the demand curve thus reducing quantity demanded to the red dot thus policies complemented each other bollinger et al find a similar dynamic outdoor water use falling when neighbors yards are less green in the presence of price incentives in the american city of phoenix arizona 9 the mix and impact of price and non price factors depends on local institutions political discourse and technology volumetric water pricing depends on meters as well as billing systems regulations as a non price shifter can reinforce price signals e g a ban on outdoor watering complementing higher prices or conflict with them e g enforcing green lawn regulations in a drought 2 3 supply of water economists define the capacity to supply in terms of the marginal cost of an additional unit given the quantity of units already supplied in the case of urban water marginal costs depend on the scale and quality of the existing distribution network the fixed costs of this infrastructure do not change with water flows for many utilities fixed costs account for a large share typically 80 percent of all costs meaning that only 20 percent of costs vary with delivery volumes 31 utilities must recover fixed costs also called capital expenditures or capex and variable costs also called operating expenditures or opex via some mix of tariffs prices to customers taxes collected from local sources and transfers gifts from distant sources this ttt mix must cover all costs if the utility is to provide reliable service 43 there are several implications of the high ratio of fixed to variable costs first the need to spend huge sums before any water can be delivered or paid for means that water distribution is a natural monopoly while the incumbent whose fixed costs are already spent or sunk only needs enough revenue to pay opex on an ongoing basis an entrant charging competitive prices would be losing massive sums due to the need to also pay capex on new infrastructure second most water distribution companies as natural monopolies are regulated by state actors to ensure that they do not abuse their market power by raising prices to profit maximizing levels that are far above the variable cost of delivery but below levels that would attract competition third regulators try to target appropriate prices excessively low prices starve the utility of funds needed for operations renewal and reliability excessively high prices create rents that encourage waste and exploit customers finally regulators often permit or require a mix of fixed and variable charges that does not match the utility s mix of fixed and variable costs mismatches from political pressure management fads or unreliable information lead to surprises and complications discussed below three additional factors affect the cost and reliability of supply first utility costs arise from extracting treating and delivering water they like raw water users rarely pay for the water itself politicians often give away water rights or allow unlimited pumping in exchange for a modest administrative fee some utilities do pay volumetric charges but those are often based on historical or accounting figures unrelated to current scarcity the market value of water or the option value of future water reserves the resulting perception of water as a free good makes it hard to charge for scarcity 68 it also means that users ignore opportunity cost when extracting free water that might have higher value if left in a river for environmental flows or aquifer for future use second the cost of cleaning water can be greater than the cost of moving it in pre industrial times risk came from natural pollutants lead arsenic cholera and so on industrialization introduced thousands of new chemicals hormones and other impurities to surface and groundwater sources at the same time as increased demand encouraged managers to tap marginal sources the cost of identifying monitoring and removing pollutants can be very high researchers activists regulators and water managers lacking agreement on the right balance of treatment costs and health benefits often argue over the optimal mix and levels of contaminants third higher capex can lower opex which means that water prices can be lower in a well engineered system this relationship also means that underinvestment in maintenance can mean higher opex and thus higher charges as well as lower reliability fig 3 combines these ideas into a stylized relationship showing how the marginal cost of water and thus often its volumetric price depends on capex more than on delivery volumes to the point not shown in which raw water supply runs out it also shows how scarcity adds to costs whether or not customers see those costs in higher prices 2 4 demand for water the supply curve reflects the marginal cost of providing water the demand curve reflects the marginal value of consuming water demand will therefore depend on use drinking vs washing the car time thirsty now vs later information strong versus weak price signals and preferences consumption versus conservation this subsection examines residential water demand the next subsection will discuss how prices affect the interaction of total supply and total demand demand for water depends on value in use consumers are willing to pay more for higher valued uses such as drinking or bathing higher willingness to pay can also be interpreted as having a lower elasticity responsiveness to prices but willingness to pay holding income constant declines as consumption increases and additional water is put to lower value uses such as sanitation or landscaping 4 4 there is a strong correlation between income and demand for water since more income often leads to larger houses more landscaping and other water features even considering how income also makes it easier to pay for more efficient less consumption fixtures although some people think price per unit of water should rise with use see ibrs below this logic is not accepted when discussing the price of gasoline phone service airline tickets or nearly any other good besides water in my opinion the rich should pay more perspective only persists when regulators have a strong say in water pricing and listen to it often with disappointing results fig 4 illustrates these ideas using a kinked demand curve that highlights how elasticity rises as willingness to pay value falls 5 5 a conventional linear demand curve goes from elastic to inelastic as price falls and quantity increases because the definition of elasticity δ q δ p p q considers baseline consumption quantities given a linear demand curve a one unit shift in demand from a low starting quantity therefore represents a much larger change in percentages this mathematical result does not really reflect the realities of household water demand in comparison to fig 4 the demand curve begins on the upper left with an inelastic demand for initial units of higher valued uses e g drinking then stretches down into medium value uses e g sanitation before reaching the last span of more elastic lower value uses e g landscaping this figure illustrates how increases in price from zero cut demand from below by reducing lower value uses 16 57 further price increases then walk up the demand curve reducing quantity demanded until only higher value uses remain it is very hard to use prices to eliminate those higher value uses which is why they are called inelastic although that point might seem obvious i make it here to counter a common complaint people will not be able to afford essential uses if prices increase that ignores the goal and result of most price increases reducing lower value demands this complaint is based on a real fact humans die without water that has been mistakenly extrapolated into a claim that all water not just drinking water must be priced at zero because we cannot live without water confusion over values gave rise to the so called diamond water paradox a version of which appeared in adam smith s 1776 wealth of nations 59 the paradox is more or less stated as how is it that we can put such a high value on diamonds that are not necessary to life while putting a low value on water that keeps us alive nineteenth century economists resolved the paradox by calling attention to a well known fact i e that the marginal value of an additional unit of a good depends on how many units one has or has consumed thus an englishman might place a high value on their first diamond but a low value on their n th bucket of water amidst liquid plenty that same englishman would give all his wealth for a sip of water if parched in the desert but most of us live like the english we have so much clean cheap water that we use it to flush toilets and water lawns this il logic explains why prices are a feasible and useful tool for signaling scarcity and preventing shortage after considering use demand also depends on time information and preferences time allows for gradual changes in behavior and new adaptions such as installing a low flow shower head lowering consumption without changing habits or replacing water thirsty with drought tolerant landscaping information makes choices visible smart meters give real time use monthly bills link actions to results more quickly than annual bills salience refers to information becoming relevant price signals will not work on bureaucrats teens or tenants who do not see or pay water bills salience is also relevant when the water bill is too cheap to notice news of a drought or a notice of higher prices from the utility can raise elasticity from zero not paying attention to significant levels ripping out a lawn at a cost of 2 000 to save 20 per month finally it is important to consider preferences that can shift demand in or out at all price quantity combinations higher income can shift demand out resulting in more water use a desire to save the planet or copy a virtuous neighbor can shift demand in and reduce water use prices as extrinsic motivators can reinforce or dampen the non price intrinsic motivators just described so let us look at how prices affect supply and demand 2 5 cost price and value moving from the factors separately affecting supply and demand we will now look at their interaction in a free market price would rise or fall until quantity supplied equaled quantity demanded but water prices are usually set by regulators or administrators according to bureaucratic criteria that may have nothing to do with preventing shortages fig 5 combines figs 3 and 4 to illustrate how prices might not reflect scarcity the general rule in market economies is that prices are higher than sellers costs and lower than buyers values because willing sellers make profits producer surplus and willing buyers receive benefits consumer surplus in the water sector regulators want to set prices that are high enough to recover costs but low enough to limit profits and maximize consumer benefits i will discuss the various components of costs in the next section for now we will assume that regulators set price p to recover variable financial costs but do not include the non financial cost of scarcity reflected in p s here i am assuming that variable costs vc and marginal costs mc are equal due to economies of scale and that regulators set price equal to mc these assumptions make it easier to discuss basic behavior and impacts accurate representations of actual variable and marginal costs are very hard to calculate due to debates over what to include in these costs and especially when fixed costs affect variable costs 13 6 63 in fig 5 the price of non scarce water p is equal to the marginal cost mc for all units sold for the consumer the benefit of consumption is the area under the demand curve less charges p q 6 6 i intentionally made it impossible to calculate this area the upward pointing arrow on the demand curve shoots to infinity because we are assuming the first units of water have infinite value to someone who does not want to die of thirst thus we have the useful situation in which value exceeds a price that is neither above nor below cost before addressing scarcity let us look into a few important factors first the way price determines quantity in most economics texts price and quantity are determined simultaneously meaning that higher price can increase quantity supplied just as easily as higher quantity demanded increases price marshall 1920 discussed these differences with the example of a fish market in which a fixed quantity of fish are allocated by price in the short run one day but price signals change quantities in the longer run a few weeks 38 with urban water quantity demanded depends on prices that are fixed during a short run that can last a year or more and has supply adequate to meet all demands at that price in raw water markets causation is reversed competing bidders make offers until the competitive winning price allocates a fixed quantity in the longer run high treated or raw prices can increase supply via bigger pumps more infrastructure transferred water rights and so on how are urban prices set usually political or bureaucratic regulators set drinking water prices based on operational economic and political factors that vary with location history and institutions according to dinar et al there is no best practice that can be recommended to one country or sector 19 page 3 water using sectors in various locations face different situations and needs for pricing approaches in their book dinar et al use case studies from fifteen countries to illustrate the rich variety of challenges and failures solutions and successes in water pricing these cases discuss problems with cost recovery debate charges that vary by sector or customer class and explore the interaction and interference between excludable and non excludable uses these elements are important but we will stick with the basic fundamentals that tend to apply in many situations consider costs as stated above regulators limit prices to prevent water utilities from using their market power to increase profits at the same time regulators also know they must put a floor under prices to help utilities pay their costs in many cases that floor is too low politicians for example set prices below full cost more on that meaning in a moment in an attempt to curry public favor 76 7 7 that decision according to ramsey is inefficient in terms of raising revenue since people with inelastic demand will pay higher prices to get the good but most governments prefer to subsidize water rather than raise revenue 50 this priority is troublesome when prices are too low to cover costs or signal scarcity the trouble with low populist prices is that they encourage excess demand compare q to q s and thus increase the risk of shortage a long list of cities suffer from excess demand because their water prices do not cover full costs the impacts of excess demand vary with local expectations for the supply of abundant clean water the severity of the shortfall and potential responses to shortage risks perhaps drinking water is provided only a few hours per day or groundwater levels drop and ecosystems deteriorate as unsustainable withdrawals rise or workers spend their time responding to surprises and emergencies due to under maintained deteriorating infrastructure amsterdam copenhagen and singapore have good results from full cost pricing but most readers of this article live in cities where unpriced costs contribute to concerns over water quality service interruptions and or ecosystem stress what components are included in full cost prices moving from often to rarely start with operating costs that vary with consumption such as the energy for pumping and treatment and labor and materials devoted to ongoing operations the next most often included costs are the fixed costs for management billing maintenance customer service and so on most utilities cover these costs those that cut back on service and maintenance deliver poor customer service leaky pipes unsafe water and so on third most often but not often due to their massive scale are capital expenditures for building new facilities expanding the network or improving service and water quality these costs are enormous when they arise from building dams or treatment plants or extending service to neighborhoods or slums capital spending is usually financed by grants transfers in poorer countries and debt repaid via taxes and or tariffs in richer ones 8 8 most transfers are from other national sources international grants are more important in the poorest countries inadequate capital spending means that networks lack capacity or scale which means residents must cope with less than 24 7 service finally it is important to include the non financial costs of protecting water quality and ecosystems those hard to see costs are critical in the long run but often ignored in the short run of a politician s or regulator s career 3 utility water pricing water is often priced in strange ways due to path dependency outdated institutions and misunderstandings over different water uses see 68 and discussion around fig 1 raw water is often free to those with non quantified abstraction permits municipal and industrial water is often sold at the price of delivery without regard to scarcity mispricing can persist for a very long time because local monopolies sell water at prices that include or exclude many cost factors making price comparisons useless because water s heavy weight and low value eliminates potential arbitrage opportunities and because utilities as natural monopolies do not go out of business if they mismanage water or their finances since prices can vary for trivial regulatory or deep institutional reasons it is hard to identify or quantify the right price or a fair price see 76 35 for a discussion and recent data respectively even so i will describe the advantages and disadvantages of some common practices for managing scarcity by building up a just so story of how water management has evolved over millennia 60 23 this evolution has been driven by changes in technology on the supply side pumps reservoirs meters filtration and so on and changes in tastes income and information on the demand side i e indoor plumbing germ theory of disease precision irrigation conservation and so on 75 the earliest method of supplying water was self supply which meant collecting water from rivers lakes or rainfall and perhaps digging wells to access groundwater although such waters often start off as abundant public goods relative to demand their non excludable nature often means that scarcity increases converting the waters into common pooled goods in some cases users find ways to reduce shortage risks by limiting their total demand to renewable supplies a common pool situation in other cases they fail to establish the right mix of institutions and experience a common pool dilemma 46 69 70 the earliest cases of sharing water as a club good involved dams aqueducts and fountains that rulers would build for their people in these cases the water was free and supply abundant enough for everyone to drink 9 9 romans used a rationing system that prioritized public over private use by ordering pipes connected at collector junctions by height the lowest pipes brought water to public drinking fountains and the highest pipes above the ground went to private houses pipes at middle height went to public baths this system ensured that private houses were cut off before public facilities if water levels at collectors dropped systems became more complex when businesses and utilities starting charging for water in 16 th century london customers paid a fixed charge per unit of time that did not depend on water use 26 revenue from fixed charges were adequate to cover all costs most of which were fixed 31 this system works when water is abundant as revenue need only cover costs and the scarcity cost of water is zero here it is worth mentioning that water charges are often set at the same price for all customers in a geographic area this practice is called postage stamp pricing psp in reference to the fact that the same domestic postage stamp can send a letter across the road or across the country by definition psp creates cross subsidies from cheap to expensive to supply users usually this subsidy is too small to matter but it will be large when a new subdivision is added to a city and everyone pays more instead of new consumers paying the marginal but very high fixed cost of extending the network to their homes 74 the invention of water meters allowed charges based on volumetric use meters allow fixed and variable charges to match fixed and variable costs i e 80 percent of charges are fixed to match the 80 percent of costs that are fixed such a system is financially stable because costs and revenues rise and fall in line with use but economists started to tinker with this balance to incentivize conservation their first step was to increase existing uniform volumetric charges uniform because every unit costs the same in contrast to schemes discussed below while reducing fixed charges these conservation tariffs reduce quantity demanded but they also destabilize utility revenues falling demand for example means that mostly variable revenues fall faster than mostly fixed costs leading to shortfalls rising demand on the other hand means excess profits these asymmetries customers win when the utility loses and vice versa can lead to conflicts in 2009 for example customers in the east bay in northern california dropped their demand by so much that the utility had to raise prices to replace lost revenues 61 customers were not pleased other efficiency enhancing refinements added complications the most prominent are decreasing block rates dbrs and increasing block rates ibrs in which unit prices change with the customer s use in the case of dbrs customers pay less per unit the more water they consume ibrs use rising prices per unit to discourage excess use in his landmark article discussing ibrs in los angeles hanemann explains that they were designed with the intention of choking demand before supply limits were reached 30 in his preferred scheme there were two blocks with the more expensive block priced according to the price of recycled wastewater supplies which were the last or marginal source of extra water he also assumed a household of 4 5 people suggested that the first block be set at 500 gallons per day 1 89 m3 to allow for 75 gallons capita day gcd of indoor usage and another 30 gcd outdoors thus 280 110 liters capita day or lcd respectively and suggested summer surcharges of 25 percent los angeles has distorted or ignored most of hanemann s advice the city has four tariff blocks assumes a household of six people the median is less than three people changes the number of blocks to a household according to location and lot size and undermines summer surcharges by increasing the allocation of cheap blocks to customers with larger lots and thus more landscaping 73 several articles have attempted to quantify the separate effects of prices blocks and demand shifters e g public information campaigns loaiciga and renehan also discussed below report on the combined impact of public information and steep price increases in an ibr system 37 both were responsible for a 46 percent drop in total demand but it was the combination of demand destruction and ongoing high prices the ibr was mostly flat but charges per unit were roughly tripled that left post drought demand at 61 percent of pre drought levels renwick and green in a study of eight california water utilities find that demand falls with price increases and restrictions on use but do not find any impact from block rates 52 kenney et al find that higher prices reduce quantity demanded elasticity of 0 6 but rationing policies reduce via crowding out this elasticity to 0 37 36 they also estimate that the presence of ibrs reduces quantity demanded by 5 percent 10 10 they attribute that reduction to a fear of unknowingly entering a higher priced block they report that customers with a water smart meter consumed 16 percent more water as they maximized their consumption in a lower priced block while avoiding entry into the next higher priced block ibrs may also be less effective in addressing water scarcity because they focus on households rather than total demand and supply why is this difference important and unusual in the market for gasoline for example the price for all units rises and falls to ensure that total demand stays below total supply in the area gasoline prices that depended on the weight of the customer the model of their car or their cumulative mileage for the year would be confusing and ineffective and that is what we see with block rate water pricing 8 academics have written many critiques of ibrs sibly griffin and mjelde fuente et al nauges and whittington discuss how ibrs are inefficient in promoting conservation and unfair to the poor since block prices change based on metered consumption for the house rather than per person 58 29 24 41 utilities reply that it is illegal or expensive to collect headcounts instead they try to avoid controversy by allocating enough cheap units of water to suit double the average number of residents per household see los angeles example above such kludges allow managers to avoid hard decisions that deliver long term sustainability 7 variations on block and volumetric pricing are meant to address some of these concerns water budgets modify the ibr by changing the number of cheap blocks according to the number of residents landscaping area temperature zone etc the los angeles example above matches these parameters but water budgets are often calculated for each household which raises data collection calibration and communication costs water budgets are popular with water managers and customers who want everyone to enjoy fair access to scarce water but they create a right to landscaping when overall use might need to drop indeed baerenklau et al in their article comparing the relative effectiveness of water budgets to uniform rates find strong conservation effects in relation to consumption in higher blocks corresponding to outdoor irrigation in their arid southern california study area 4 going further they also suggest that utilities can safely pursue relatively simpler rate structures with perhaps only three blocks without foregoing significant conservation opportunities p 698 their key message in line with most economic reasoning is that customers respond to prices on the margin those prices can be present with ibrs water budgets or uniform charges after several years of reading about complex mis targeted and ineffective tariff schemes i designed my own scheme to encourage conservation without destabilizing utility finances or confusing customers in living with water scarcity i describe a system that brings one tool to each task of recovering costs stabilizing utility finances and signaling scarcity 72 pp 30 32 utilities should collect fixed and variable revenues in direct proportion to fixed and variable costs so their finances are stable all customers should pay the same uniform volumetric prices to be fair a surcharge can be added when water is scarce and demand needs to fall excess revenue from that surcharge can be rebated to each household without respect to their water use to ensure that the utility uses higher prices only as a temporary means of preventing shortage the surcharge increases the cost per unit consumed but the rebate does not depend on consumption so it does not dilute the surcharge s tendency to reduce quantity demanded fig 6 reproduced below shows how water costs usually arrive left column the way that water is typically mispriced center column and how to price water correctly for fiscal and environmental stability right column although i groped my way to this structure after several years of thinking about the interactions of different goals i was pleasantly surprised to find that electricity and natural gas charges in the netherlands follow this pattern of paying fixed costs charging extra to discourage use and then rebating excess revenues per household 11 11 https www belastingdienst nl wps wcm connect bldcontentnl belastingdienst zakelijk overige belastingen belastingen op milieugrondslag energiebelasting the regulator of sydney water likewise has implemented a system in which treated water prices rise when dam storage falls 56 on a more basic level summer surcharges per hanemann can also signal scarcity and dampen demand for extensive landscaping or swimming pools my model also addresses two deficiencies the first arises from the assumption that recovering fixed costs through variable charges is the same as charging for scarce water that assumption is wrong because variable charges based on opex not water scarcity remember rise and fall with demand while fixed costs do not the second deficiency is a habit of raising prices after revenue falls due to conservation as a means of paying for outstanding expenses rather than raising prices adding a scarcity surcharge in anticipation of scarcity as a means of reducing demand recall the east bay example above these deficiencies do not appear in competitive markets for commodities such as gasoline they appear in the water sector because prices are set by regulators based on political considerations that might ignore scarcity or shortage risk a mechanism that automatically adds surcharges when scarcity is rising and drops them when it recedes would signal scarcity and incentivize the behavioral changes necessary to avoid shortages i conclude this section by reminding readers that low water prices by encouraging use often harm the poor who are least able to cope with the resulting scarcity and shortage in new delhi for example around 40 percent of water is lost to leaks and theft and revenue covers only 40 percent of costs 12 12 leaking water can sometimes recharge groundwater but that recharge can occur in the wrong places it would make more sense to reduce leaks improve groundwater management and distribute water to a larger share of the population than pretend that leaks are somehow efficient the resulting lack of funds to run or expand the system and water to flow though it means the poor are more likely to get their water from tankers than the rich who are connected to the semi functional cheaper network 66 fuente et al likewise describe how subsidies in nairobi are more likely to go to the rich than the poor 24 chile to contrary has a functioning pro poor system after poor households are identified the central government pays for their basic consumption these households see their total use and the subsidy paid on their behalf they must pay for extra consumption 11 chile s system does not endanger the utility s finances require special tariffs or force the utility to ask households for their headcount or income 4 markets for raw water the sections above explored utility water pricing offered to residential customers but municipal and industrial use is much smaller than agricultural use which accounts for 70 90 percent of total developed water use 13 13 developed refers to water directed by humans in contrast to uncontrolled natural flows farmers are not really final water consumers so it is a bit misleading to say they use the water 1 likewise there is a robust debate on when water is used as opposed to changing its quality or location see 48 for an overview of water accounting it is important that farmers do not waste water although one would assume farmers consider scarcity they might not give it adequate attention first they might receive water deliveries via distribution systems that are reliable in quantities and timing regardless of scarcity affecting other users or the environment second they might self supply from private or common pooled groundwater and ignore falling water levels third they might have use it or lose it water rights that lapse if conserved water is unused 14 14 the existence of use or lose policies does not automatically mean rights are lost the definition of use might be lenient e g once per five years the burden of proof may lie on the regulator the measurement of use might be contested and so on fourth they might continue to use scarce water to avoid using other more expensive inputs such as labor 15 15 alfalfa is widely derided as a low value crop that requires large quantities of water to grow in desert conditions but it is more profitable than crops that require expensive labor such as strawberries these reasons might explain why some people claim farmers waste water when the farmers are efficiently responding to local conditions incentives and constraints an option to sell conserved water in water markets could change this situation by giving farmers a way to profit from scarcity data prices volumes from markets can also encourage storage or balance fluctuations from changes in crops weather and other factors the next section reviews some case studies but let us begin by reviewing some concepts relevant to water markets first it is important to have clear and quantified definitions of water rights as there is a big difference between having the right to divert 60 units of water and the right to consume 60 units from a diversion of 100 units that assumes 40 units of return flows 48 in many cases it is also important to distinguish between permanent property rights that may not be attached to land and currently deliverable flows that are available now markets in rights are weakened by risk and uncertainty over future conditions and the need to protect others from permanent changes in flows or collective management markets in flows are easier to run as transfers are valid only for one growing season and the water is often used locally second assuming a market in flows leases or short term transfers it is important to have many buyers and sellers to maximize market liquidity and competitive prices as well as conveyance for delivering water from buyers to sellers 71 market power on the buy sell or conveyance sides of the market distorts prices reduces trading volumes and interferes with good decisions third markets introduce high powered incentives that can break or strain existing institutions water exports for example reduce volumes in shared conveyances and return flows which harms other users and the environment in some cases the option to sell private good surface rights can increase stress on common pooled groundwater as sellers pump groundwater to replace the water they have sold these problems can worsen if it is possible to export food and fiber since increases in imported demand leads to increases in virtual water exports 1 77 the bottom line is that well designed water markets can reduce water scarcity but poorly designed ones can turn scarcity into shortage 5 some successful examples the water sector has many cases of success and failure due to its wide variety of institutions this section describes a few successes but see epa brandes et al and zetland gasson for representative surveys of municipal water pricing in the us north america and world wide respectively 22 10 76 for representative surveys of municipal water pricing in the us north america and world wide respectively also note that there are easily over 100 000 functioning drinking water systems in the world most of which operate without drama but also without much public oversight or reporting so the water sector is full of dogs that do not bark in many cases ongoing operations and drinkable water prove existence but not necessarily success as many systems could be run more cheaply with less energy lower leakage and so on the literature on water utility performance is under developed due to varying standards and missing competition among local monopolies but the literature on benchmark competition partially fills that gap 17 25 21 44 now let us review some examples of scarcity pricing preventing shortages the first case is singapore a southeast asian city state of around 4 5 million that split from malaysia in 1965 but still relies on imported water from its neighbor singapore s government has spent decades and billions of dollars on upgrading its supply side infrastructure water imports will end in 2061 and inducing citizens to conserve often citing national security per capita use has dropped from 172 lcd in 1995 to 143 lcd in 2017 64 49 pub singapore s integrated water utility has used conservation campaigns and price incentives to reduce demand according to pub current water tariffs are sgd 2 74 per m3 usd 2 04 for monthly consumption of less than 40 m3 and sgd 3 69 per m3 for consumption above that amount about 400 lcd for the average household of 3 2 people 49 this two block ibr most closely follows the recommendation of hanemann by targeting full cost recovery in the first block and the marginal cost of new sources in the second block 30 in addition households pay a water conservation tax wct which was introduced in 1991 to encourage water conservation and to reflect its scarcity value wct is imposed as a percentage of the water tariff to reinforce the message that water is precious from the very first drop 49 the wct basically matches the scarcity surcharge that i proposed above in addition to wct the government of singapore sends a rebate called gst voucher u save because it is funded by the goods and services tax to poorer households 49 this rebate helps poorer households in the same way as chile s policy described above singapore s water policies are world class ignoring countries and municipalities that cannot provide 24 7 safe water a development failure affecting 3 5 4 billion people see 65 many water utilities undercharge for their water by omitting capital scarcity and environmental costs from their prices these utilities are vulnerable to shortages and network failures but they also damage the environment and reduce the flow of beneficial ecosystem services 15 62 high quality affordable service requires good management long term budgets and customers willing to pay for reliable service my next example draws from 37 a case study of how santa barbara california avoided running out of water during the 1987 1992 drought the article begins by describing the panic over the city s falling reservoir levels which bottomed out at 12 percent of capacity enough for a few months in march 1991 as a complement to water conservation campaigns the public works department began raising water prices in july 1989 as well as shortening blocks in their ibr pricing schedule pushing consumers into more expensive blocks at lower uses to the point where the most expensive block beginning at 1 300 liters per day roughly the same as singapore s second block had a price of usd 10 40 per m3 usd 20 70 in 2020 or 30 times the pre drought price of usd 0 31 m3 although it is difficult to disaggregate the individual impacts of public awareness conservation regulations and pricing see 36 for one effort water demand dropped from around 700 liters per capita per day in 1987 to about half that figure in 1991 more interestingly the return of rains in 1991 and drop in water prices to merely triple their pre drought levels did not result in a huge rebound in demand which rose to only 61 percent of pre drought levels by 1995 the message s of this article are clear first higher prices reinforce other conservation messages second higher prices can make previously ignored block pricing more salient as discussed above third short term price shocks can induce long term behavioral change for case studies of pricing raw water in markets i turn to the widely studied examples of chile and australia chile s 1981 water code created a market for trading private water rights this reform combined with later reforms to corporatize and later privatize drinking water utilities resulted in radical changes in water management and a reduction in water scarcity through water trading and management 33 20 the water code was not without controversy and weak protections for environmental flows and social justice resulted in a 2005 reform 5 3 the case for australia s murray darling basin is likewise complex and evolving put in simple terms australia s federal government began changing laws in 1988 to limit state authority over water use and trading thereby allowing for trans boundary markets in permanent rights entitlements and temporary flows allocations these markets reduced water scarcity and benefitted farmers who were the primary users of surface waters but there are still many controversies regarding water use and management in the basin e g over paying to protect environmental flows inefficient regulation of trades inadequate environmental protections excess spending on technology that failed to deliver conservation and so on 28 39 2 54 27 although these cases are controversial in some ways they show how it is possible to reduce scarcity costs and improve water management at scale as a generalization water management in most of the rest of the world is either lucky scarcity has not arrived or troubled policies mismanage scarcity my overall opinion is that fossil groundwater depletion over drafting of renewable groundwater and climate chaos driven destabilization of precipitation and surface flows will reduce water supplies on the demand side increasing population wealth and meat consumption are increasing irrigation on the intensive applying more water and extensive displacing ecosystems and rain fed agriculture margins 55 18 the resulting squeeze between falling supply and rising demand increases the risk of water shortages and thus food shortages and upheaval maturing water economies must develop and implement policies for managing scarce economic water 51 6 the potential for pricing this article has reviewed the factors important to pricing water scarcity and thus how to design and implement reasonable and effective policies that will signal scarcity and prevent shortages of municipal industrial and agricultural water supplies although it is possible to manage scarcity with non price regulations and appeals to social norms such methods are less effective and often ineffective without complementary price structures in some cases e g auctions for agricultural water prices are sufficient to avoid shortage in others e g supplying water in thirsty cities prices are necessary but not sufficient for preventing shortages in all cases institutions for titling administering measuring and re allocating stocks and flows and their externalities are necessary to enable economic instruments to work stepping back we know that prices and markets can provide powerful incentives to put water to highest and best use but neither can address political and social choices regarding the share of water to leave in the environment or how to help poor citizens receive water services functional policies to address such social concerns are a pre requisite if citizens are to accept price mechanisms for allocating remaining water to economic uses emerging pressures from climate chaos and billions of increasingly wealthy humans are likely to convert today s inconvenient scarcity into disruptive shortages and perhaps even social collapse it is therefore important to begin negotiations with stakeholders on how to reform policies and institutions it is better to have a slow steady flow of water than none at all declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

20129,water scarcity turns into shortage when water supplies are mismatched with user demands after clarifying the different social and private uses of water i explain how to use prices to allocate treated utility water among municipal and industrial users and untreated raw water among irrigators assuming institutional capacity successful management of water scarcity requires prices that constrain total demand and revenues that cover the cost of reliable supply public acceptance of effective water pricing requires that policies protect the poor and the environment i e policies that prioritize social water over water competitively allocated among economic uses keywords water scarcity water pricing water markets political economy sustainability 1 introduction water shortages result when water supplies are inadequate to meet various demands this description probably makes sense to the average person but different academic disciplines bring different perspectives to its interpretation engineers and sociologists in their straw man forms might prefer civil works or subsidies to address physical or economic shortages respectively economists tend to blame shortages on failures to manage scarcity given market and price institutions water will be abundant if supply is greater than demand at a price of zero or scarce if demand is greater than supply at a price of zero in the presence of positive prices shortage or surplus results when the prices are set lower or higher than the level balancing supply and demand this axiom includes assumptions that economists often fail to elaborate or explore first prices reflect all useful information second prices fluctuate to reconcile relevant supply side costs and subjective demand side values third the good s use or role is uniformly understood and agreed by all participants when it comes to water these assumptions often do not hold first information over water sources and uses is diffused across time space and re use second water prices are often missing or distorted by non price factors third water s nature as a private or social good changes with its use and management 1 1 in this article i use individual excludable and or economic as synonyms for private and collective non excludable and or political as synonyms for social most discussions of treated or utility water focus on the tariffs paid by municipal and industrial water users these tariffs aim to cover the utility s operating and system costs but they often ignore the scarcity value of water in cases of managing water as a natural resource the price to raw or untreated water to agricultural or industrial users can help conserve the resource or merely cover administrative costs in either situation the correlation between price and scarcity might be positive negative or absent in this article i explain when it is appropriate to use economic tools to manage private water versus political tools to manage collective water define and explore supply demand price and non price factors affecting scarcity recount how utility water pricing has evolved and describe how markets for raw water succeed or fail i conclude with examples of where prices or markets managed scarcity and prevented shortage 2 managing scarcity in theory economists interpret scarcity as a cost with greater water scarcity implying a higher cost of acquiring water or doing without the severity of scarcity depends on the ratio of total demand to total supply several factors affect scarcity the institutions informal norms and formal rules managing water sources and uses the rate of water consumption relative to current and potential supplies and the transformation of individual choices into aggregated outcomes for example consider farmers competing for groundwater from a rapidly draining aquifer in the absence of pumping limits or other rationing institutions the farmers are stuck in a prisoner s dilemma in which all would gain by forbearance but none has an incentive to pump less without a means of ending this dilemma total demand outstrips supply water shortages emerge and crops dry out see chapter 13 in 46 in the subsections that follow i describe how management institutions non price factors supply demand and prices affect water scarcity my point is that the right incentives and institutions can help individuals and communities manage scarcity while the wrong incentives and institutions increase the risk of shortage 2 1 when to use prices and when to avoid them the problem of optimal water allocation is wicked because flows provide joint and several benefits to collective and private uses fig 1 untangles these uses its framework which can be applied to any set or mix of goods separates goods into four types based on each good s excludability and rivalry a good is excludable if access to its use can be restricted a good is non excludable if anyone can use it a rival or subtractable good is consumed in use whereas a non rival good can be re used fig 1 does not imply static or fixed uses as water s nature as a good can change a utility for instance can pump water from a common pool good aquifer into a club good distribution network that charges customers according to their private good metered consumption if the utility s water withdrawals are small relative to natural water sources then its operations do not materially reduce the benefits from remaining public good flows in the environment fig 1 also indicates that non excludable water is best managed via political top down or collective peer to peer methods while excludable water is best managed via economic methods that depend on property rights and prices since water flows and uses often overlap it is important to specify and separately manage non excludable and excludable water to prevent harmful spill overs negative externalities from use decisions given the common understanding of water resources as the property of the state or the people it makes sense to reserve non excludable uses based on a political collective process that reflects social and political goals before allocating remaining excludable water with economic tools to maximize private benefits 72 these steps do not deny the relevance or necessity of answering important questions on how much social water to reserve how to award and ration economic water or how to minimize negative externalities affecting non excludable waters assuming social water has been set aside and economic water allocated for better or worse 2 2 most water rights have already been allocated to private economic uses without regard to social benefits and costs in the worst cases the same water has been allocated to multiple users which weakens the value of those rights while also increasing the probability that the over appropriated source will be stressed to the point of shortage in more typical cases rights awarded for one use are converted to another use thereby harming others we turn to pricing excludable water to manage scarcity in the short run prices limit demand by allocating or rationing a fixed supply e g auctioning the right to take raw water from a river or setting treated water prices to limit demand for utility water in the longer run several weeks to years scarcity bolstered prices can encourage increases in supply via wells aqueducts dams desalination plants and so on but we will ignore the long run here scarcity can alter water s status as a good a utility s promise of non rivalrous service will for example be broken if heat and drought increase demand and decrease supply to the point that one customer s metered and paid for use impacts the quantity of water available to others this move from club to common pooled good does not inevitably lead to a tragedy of the commons 32 ostrom et al argue and demonstrate how effective collective action supports sustainable use of a common pooled good a common pool situation whereas failed collective action leads to a tragic common pool dilemma 46 increased withdrawals from natural sources can likewise create a common pool dilemma in which irrigation demands disrupt environmental flows that as public goods previously benefitted everyone in these circumstances political and social interventions are necessary but not sufficient to prevent further damages and functioning institutions are crucial for these interventions to work 45 42 34 the next paragraphs recount some examples of interventions that addressed scarcity and prevented shortages brisbane faced severe water scarcity in 2007 as reservoir levels fell to record lows during the 1996 2011 millennial drought as scarcity rose club good storage turned into a common pooled good in which each person s use left less for others rather than treat water as a private good by raising metered prices politicians called for cooperative restraint water use fell by 50 percent and the dilemma was converted into a situation in 2008 barcelona faced a similar risk of dry taps as reservoirs dropped to 15 percent of capacity after which point stored water would be unfit for treatment or drinking politicians and water managers banned outdoor watering shut off fountains and called for conservation but their most interesting and costly solution was importing water on ships from nearby spanish and french cities the ships contributed to public awareness of the need for conservation in a way that prices could not due to public unwillingness to accept higher charges from a utility that failed to manage its leaking network in any case the ships hardly mattered rain saved barcelona 53 12 in 2018 cape town faced a day zero in which pipes would go dry and people would need to collect drinking water from distribution points preventative actions included higher water prices city employees promoting conservation in neighborhoods and the publication of maps showing which households were consuming too much 67 consumption dropped by 50 percent as higher prices reduced quantity demanded and a conservation ethos similar to that of brisbane shifted demand in the timely arrival of seasonal rains similar to barcelona s miracle also helped by shifting supply out these shift and slide terms terms are defined and discussed below these examples show that collective mechanisms and price incentives can hold off shortages but long term security depends on stronger institutions and deeper reforms that discussion is beyond the scope of this article 3 3 zetland colenbrander for example describe the 100 year process of developing universal clean drinking water services in the netherlands 75 see 12 40 for deeper dives into the historic and institutional failures underpinning the crises in barcelona and cape town respectively so i will focus on policies that modify short run incentives the next subsection compares price and non price interactions before later subsections elaborate on supply demand and cost price value relations 2 2 non price shifters and price sliders the prior subsection focussed on treating water as the good it is excludable or non excludable rather than the good it was or one wishes it to be from here onwards we will discuss excludable water that can and should be managed as an economic good to get started it is useful to clarify the basic dynamics of supply and demand fig 2 shows two steps to reduce demand and thus scarcity via an inward shift in demand from thick to thin line to the black dot followed by a slide in quantity demanded to the red circle in response to an inward shift of the supply curve from thick to dashed line the following subsections give more detail on supply and demand this section clarifies how non price elements shifting demand can complement or conflict with with a price driven slide in demand inward shifts of demand occurred in brisbane and barcelona in the examples above as communications and community pressure changed people s desires for green lawns in cape town two elements reduced demand an awareness of the need to conserve that caused the shift to the black dot and higher water prices causing the supply curve to slide up the demand curve thus reducing quantity demanded to the red dot thus policies complemented each other bollinger et al find a similar dynamic outdoor water use falling when neighbors yards are less green in the presence of price incentives in the american city of phoenix arizona 9 the mix and impact of price and non price factors depends on local institutions political discourse and technology volumetric water pricing depends on meters as well as billing systems regulations as a non price shifter can reinforce price signals e g a ban on outdoor watering complementing higher prices or conflict with them e g enforcing green lawn regulations in a drought 2 3 supply of water economists define the capacity to supply in terms of the marginal cost of an additional unit given the quantity of units already supplied in the case of urban water marginal costs depend on the scale and quality of the existing distribution network the fixed costs of this infrastructure do not change with water flows for many utilities fixed costs account for a large share typically 80 percent of all costs meaning that only 20 percent of costs vary with delivery volumes 31 utilities must recover fixed costs also called capital expenditures or capex and variable costs also called operating expenditures or opex via some mix of tariffs prices to customers taxes collected from local sources and transfers gifts from distant sources this ttt mix must cover all costs if the utility is to provide reliable service 43 there are several implications of the high ratio of fixed to variable costs first the need to spend huge sums before any water can be delivered or paid for means that water distribution is a natural monopoly while the incumbent whose fixed costs are already spent or sunk only needs enough revenue to pay opex on an ongoing basis an entrant charging competitive prices would be losing massive sums due to the need to also pay capex on new infrastructure second most water distribution companies as natural monopolies are regulated by state actors to ensure that they do not abuse their market power by raising prices to profit maximizing levels that are far above the variable cost of delivery but below levels that would attract competition third regulators try to target appropriate prices excessively low prices starve the utility of funds needed for operations renewal and reliability excessively high prices create rents that encourage waste and exploit customers finally regulators often permit or require a mix of fixed and variable charges that does not match the utility s mix of fixed and variable costs mismatches from political pressure management fads or unreliable information lead to surprises and complications discussed below three additional factors affect the cost and reliability of supply first utility costs arise from extracting treating and delivering water they like raw water users rarely pay for the water itself politicians often give away water rights or allow unlimited pumping in exchange for a modest administrative fee some utilities do pay volumetric charges but those are often based on historical or accounting figures unrelated to current scarcity the market value of water or the option value of future water reserves the resulting perception of water as a free good makes it hard to charge for scarcity 68 it also means that users ignore opportunity cost when extracting free water that might have higher value if left in a river for environmental flows or aquifer for future use second the cost of cleaning water can be greater than the cost of moving it in pre industrial times risk came from natural pollutants lead arsenic cholera and so on industrialization introduced thousands of new chemicals hormones and other impurities to surface and groundwater sources at the same time as increased demand encouraged managers to tap marginal sources the cost of identifying monitoring and removing pollutants can be very high researchers activists regulators and water managers lacking agreement on the right balance of treatment costs and health benefits often argue over the optimal mix and levels of contaminants third higher capex can lower opex which means that water prices can be lower in a well engineered system this relationship also means that underinvestment in maintenance can mean higher opex and thus higher charges as well as lower reliability fig 3 combines these ideas into a stylized relationship showing how the marginal cost of water and thus often its volumetric price depends on capex more than on delivery volumes to the point not shown in which raw water supply runs out it also shows how scarcity adds to costs whether or not customers see those costs in higher prices 2 4 demand for water the supply curve reflects the marginal cost of providing water the demand curve reflects the marginal value of consuming water demand will therefore depend on use drinking vs washing the car time thirsty now vs later information strong versus weak price signals and preferences consumption versus conservation this subsection examines residential water demand the next subsection will discuss how prices affect the interaction of total supply and total demand demand for water depends on value in use consumers are willing to pay more for higher valued uses such as drinking or bathing higher willingness to pay can also be interpreted as having a lower elasticity responsiveness to prices but willingness to pay holding income constant declines as consumption increases and additional water is put to lower value uses such as sanitation or landscaping 4 4 there is a strong correlation between income and demand for water since more income often leads to larger houses more landscaping and other water features even considering how income also makes it easier to pay for more efficient less consumption fixtures although some people think price per unit of water should rise with use see ibrs below this logic is not accepted when discussing the price of gasoline phone service airline tickets or nearly any other good besides water in my opinion the rich should pay more perspective only persists when regulators have a strong say in water pricing and listen to it often with disappointing results fig 4 illustrates these ideas using a kinked demand curve that highlights how elasticity rises as willingness to pay value falls 5 5 a conventional linear demand curve goes from elastic to inelastic as price falls and quantity increases because the definition of elasticity δ q δ p p q considers baseline consumption quantities given a linear demand curve a one unit shift in demand from a low starting quantity therefore represents a much larger change in percentages this mathematical result does not really reflect the realities of household water demand in comparison to fig 4 the demand curve begins on the upper left with an inelastic demand for initial units of higher valued uses e g drinking then stretches down into medium value uses e g sanitation before reaching the last span of more elastic lower value uses e g landscaping this figure illustrates how increases in price from zero cut demand from below by reducing lower value uses 16 57 further price increases then walk up the demand curve reducing quantity demanded until only higher value uses remain it is very hard to use prices to eliminate those higher value uses which is why they are called inelastic although that point might seem obvious i make it here to counter a common complaint people will not be able to afford essential uses if prices increase that ignores the goal and result of most price increases reducing lower value demands this complaint is based on a real fact humans die without water that has been mistakenly extrapolated into a claim that all water not just drinking water must be priced at zero because we cannot live without water confusion over values gave rise to the so called diamond water paradox a version of which appeared in adam smith s 1776 wealth of nations 59 the paradox is more or less stated as how is it that we can put such a high value on diamonds that are not necessary to life while putting a low value on water that keeps us alive nineteenth century economists resolved the paradox by calling attention to a well known fact i e that the marginal value of an additional unit of a good depends on how many units one has or has consumed thus an englishman might place a high value on their first diamond but a low value on their n th bucket of water amidst liquid plenty that same englishman would give all his wealth for a sip of water if parched in the desert but most of us live like the english we have so much clean cheap water that we use it to flush toilets and water lawns this il logic explains why prices are a feasible and useful tool for signaling scarcity and preventing shortage after considering use demand also depends on time information and preferences time allows for gradual changes in behavior and new adaptions such as installing a low flow shower head lowering consumption without changing habits or replacing water thirsty with drought tolerant landscaping information makes choices visible smart meters give real time use monthly bills link actions to results more quickly than annual bills salience refers to information becoming relevant price signals will not work on bureaucrats teens or tenants who do not see or pay water bills salience is also relevant when the water bill is too cheap to notice news of a drought or a notice of higher prices from the utility can raise elasticity from zero not paying attention to significant levels ripping out a lawn at a cost of 2 000 to save 20 per month finally it is important to consider preferences that can shift demand in or out at all price quantity combinations higher income can shift demand out resulting in more water use a desire to save the planet or copy a virtuous neighbor can shift demand in and reduce water use prices as extrinsic motivators can reinforce or dampen the non price intrinsic motivators just described so let us look at how prices affect supply and demand 2 5 cost price and value moving from the factors separately affecting supply and demand we will now look at their interaction in a free market price would rise or fall until quantity supplied equaled quantity demanded but water prices are usually set by regulators or administrators according to bureaucratic criteria that may have nothing to do with preventing shortages fig 5 combines figs 3 and 4 to illustrate how prices might not reflect scarcity the general rule in market economies is that prices are higher than sellers costs and lower than buyers values because willing sellers make profits producer surplus and willing buyers receive benefits consumer surplus in the water sector regulators want to set prices that are high enough to recover costs but low enough to limit profits and maximize consumer benefits i will discuss the various components of costs in the next section for now we will assume that regulators set price p to recover variable financial costs but do not include the non financial cost of scarcity reflected in p s here i am assuming that variable costs vc and marginal costs mc are equal due to economies of scale and that regulators set price equal to mc these assumptions make it easier to discuss basic behavior and impacts accurate representations of actual variable and marginal costs are very hard to calculate due to debates over what to include in these costs and especially when fixed costs affect variable costs 13 6 63 in fig 5 the price of non scarce water p is equal to the marginal cost mc for all units sold for the consumer the benefit of consumption is the area under the demand curve less charges p q 6 6 i intentionally made it impossible to calculate this area the upward pointing arrow on the demand curve shoots to infinity because we are assuming the first units of water have infinite value to someone who does not want to die of thirst thus we have the useful situation in which value exceeds a price that is neither above nor below cost before addressing scarcity let us look into a few important factors first the way price determines quantity in most economics texts price and quantity are determined simultaneously meaning that higher price can increase quantity supplied just as easily as higher quantity demanded increases price marshall 1920 discussed these differences with the example of a fish market in which a fixed quantity of fish are allocated by price in the short run one day but price signals change quantities in the longer run a few weeks 38 with urban water quantity demanded depends on prices that are fixed during a short run that can last a year or more and has supply adequate to meet all demands at that price in raw water markets causation is reversed competing bidders make offers until the competitive winning price allocates a fixed quantity in the longer run high treated or raw prices can increase supply via bigger pumps more infrastructure transferred water rights and so on how are urban prices set usually political or bureaucratic regulators set drinking water prices based on operational economic and political factors that vary with location history and institutions according to dinar et al there is no best practice that can be recommended to one country or sector 19 page 3 water using sectors in various locations face different situations and needs for pricing approaches in their book dinar et al use case studies from fifteen countries to illustrate the rich variety of challenges and failures solutions and successes in water pricing these cases discuss problems with cost recovery debate charges that vary by sector or customer class and explore the interaction and interference between excludable and non excludable uses these elements are important but we will stick with the basic fundamentals that tend to apply in many situations consider costs as stated above regulators limit prices to prevent water utilities from using their market power to increase profits at the same time regulators also know they must put a floor under prices to help utilities pay their costs in many cases that floor is too low politicians for example set prices below full cost more on that meaning in a moment in an attempt to curry public favor 76 7 7 that decision according to ramsey is inefficient in terms of raising revenue since people with inelastic demand will pay higher prices to get the good but most governments prefer to subsidize water rather than raise revenue 50 this priority is troublesome when prices are too low to cover costs or signal scarcity the trouble with low populist prices is that they encourage excess demand compare q to q s and thus increase the risk of shortage a long list of cities suffer from excess demand because their water prices do not cover full costs the impacts of excess demand vary with local expectations for the supply of abundant clean water the severity of the shortfall and potential responses to shortage risks perhaps drinking water is provided only a few hours per day or groundwater levels drop and ecosystems deteriorate as unsustainable withdrawals rise or workers spend their time responding to surprises and emergencies due to under maintained deteriorating infrastructure amsterdam copenhagen and singapore have good results from full cost pricing but most readers of this article live in cities where unpriced costs contribute to concerns over water quality service interruptions and or ecosystem stress what components are included in full cost prices moving from often to rarely start with operating costs that vary with consumption such as the energy for pumping and treatment and labor and materials devoted to ongoing operations the next most often included costs are the fixed costs for management billing maintenance customer service and so on most utilities cover these costs those that cut back on service and maintenance deliver poor customer service leaky pipes unsafe water and so on third most often but not often due to their massive scale are capital expenditures for building new facilities expanding the network or improving service and water quality these costs are enormous when they arise from building dams or treatment plants or extending service to neighborhoods or slums capital spending is usually financed by grants transfers in poorer countries and debt repaid via taxes and or tariffs in richer ones 8 8 most transfers are from other national sources international grants are more important in the poorest countries inadequate capital spending means that networks lack capacity or scale which means residents must cope with less than 24 7 service finally it is important to include the non financial costs of protecting water quality and ecosystems those hard to see costs are critical in the long run but often ignored in the short run of a politician s or regulator s career 3 utility water pricing water is often priced in strange ways due to path dependency outdated institutions and misunderstandings over different water uses see 68 and discussion around fig 1 raw water is often free to those with non quantified abstraction permits municipal and industrial water is often sold at the price of delivery without regard to scarcity mispricing can persist for a very long time because local monopolies sell water at prices that include or exclude many cost factors making price comparisons useless because water s heavy weight and low value eliminates potential arbitrage opportunities and because utilities as natural monopolies do not go out of business if they mismanage water or their finances since prices can vary for trivial regulatory or deep institutional reasons it is hard to identify or quantify the right price or a fair price see 76 35 for a discussion and recent data respectively even so i will describe the advantages and disadvantages of some common practices for managing scarcity by building up a just so story of how water management has evolved over millennia 60 23 this evolution has been driven by changes in technology on the supply side pumps reservoirs meters filtration and so on and changes in tastes income and information on the demand side i e indoor plumbing germ theory of disease precision irrigation conservation and so on 75 the earliest method of supplying water was self supply which meant collecting water from rivers lakes or rainfall and perhaps digging wells to access groundwater although such waters often start off as abundant public goods relative to demand their non excludable nature often means that scarcity increases converting the waters into common pooled goods in some cases users find ways to reduce shortage risks by limiting their total demand to renewable supplies a common pool situation in other cases they fail to establish the right mix of institutions and experience a common pool dilemma 46 69 70 the earliest cases of sharing water as a club good involved dams aqueducts and fountains that rulers would build for their people in these cases the water was free and supply abundant enough for everyone to drink 9 9 romans used a rationing system that prioritized public over private use by ordering pipes connected at collector junctions by height the lowest pipes brought water to public drinking fountains and the highest pipes above the ground went to private houses pipes at middle height went to public baths this system ensured that private houses were cut off before public facilities if water levels at collectors dropped systems became more complex when businesses and utilities starting charging for water in 16 th century london customers paid a fixed charge per unit of time that did not depend on water use 26 revenue from fixed charges were adequate to cover all costs most of which were fixed 31 this system works when water is abundant as revenue need only cover costs and the scarcity cost of water is zero here it is worth mentioning that water charges are often set at the same price for all customers in a geographic area this practice is called postage stamp pricing psp in reference to the fact that the same domestic postage stamp can send a letter across the road or across the country by definition psp creates cross subsidies from cheap to expensive to supply users usually this subsidy is too small to matter but it will be large when a new subdivision is added to a city and everyone pays more instead of new consumers paying the marginal but very high fixed cost of extending the network to their homes 74 the invention of water meters allowed charges based on volumetric use meters allow fixed and variable charges to match fixed and variable costs i e 80 percent of charges are fixed to match the 80 percent of costs that are fixed such a system is financially stable because costs and revenues rise and fall in line with use but economists started to tinker with this balance to incentivize conservation their first step was to increase existing uniform volumetric charges uniform because every unit costs the same in contrast to schemes discussed below while reducing fixed charges these conservation tariffs reduce quantity demanded but they also destabilize utility revenues falling demand for example means that mostly variable revenues fall faster than mostly fixed costs leading to shortfalls rising demand on the other hand means excess profits these asymmetries customers win when the utility loses and vice versa can lead to conflicts in 2009 for example customers in the east bay in northern california dropped their demand by so much that the utility had to raise prices to replace lost revenues 61 customers were not pleased other efficiency enhancing refinements added complications the most prominent are decreasing block rates dbrs and increasing block rates ibrs in which unit prices change with the customer s use in the case of dbrs customers pay less per unit the more water they consume ibrs use rising prices per unit to discourage excess use in his landmark article discussing ibrs in los angeles hanemann explains that they were designed with the intention of choking demand before supply limits were reached 30 in his preferred scheme there were two blocks with the more expensive block priced according to the price of recycled wastewater supplies which were the last or marginal source of extra water he also assumed a household of 4 5 people suggested that the first block be set at 500 gallons per day 1 89 m3 to allow for 75 gallons capita day gcd of indoor usage and another 30 gcd outdoors thus 280 110 liters capita day or lcd respectively and suggested summer surcharges of 25 percent los angeles has distorted or ignored most of hanemann s advice the city has four tariff blocks assumes a household of six people the median is less than three people changes the number of blocks to a household according to location and lot size and undermines summer surcharges by increasing the allocation of cheap blocks to customers with larger lots and thus more landscaping 73 several articles have attempted to quantify the separate effects of prices blocks and demand shifters e g public information campaigns loaiciga and renehan also discussed below report on the combined impact of public information and steep price increases in an ibr system 37 both were responsible for a 46 percent drop in total demand but it was the combination of demand destruction and ongoing high prices the ibr was mostly flat but charges per unit were roughly tripled that left post drought demand at 61 percent of pre drought levels renwick and green in a study of eight california water utilities find that demand falls with price increases and restrictions on use but do not find any impact from block rates 52 kenney et al find that higher prices reduce quantity demanded elasticity of 0 6 but rationing policies reduce via crowding out this elasticity to 0 37 36 they also estimate that the presence of ibrs reduces quantity demanded by 5 percent 10 10 they attribute that reduction to a fear of unknowingly entering a higher priced block they report that customers with a water smart meter consumed 16 percent more water as they maximized their consumption in a lower priced block while avoiding entry into the next higher priced block ibrs may also be less effective in addressing water scarcity because they focus on households rather than total demand and supply why is this difference important and unusual in the market for gasoline for example the price for all units rises and falls to ensure that total demand stays below total supply in the area gasoline prices that depended on the weight of the customer the model of their car or their cumulative mileage for the year would be confusing and ineffective and that is what we see with block rate water pricing 8 academics have written many critiques of ibrs sibly griffin and mjelde fuente et al nauges and whittington discuss how ibrs are inefficient in promoting conservation and unfair to the poor since block prices change based on metered consumption for the house rather than per person 58 29 24 41 utilities reply that it is illegal or expensive to collect headcounts instead they try to avoid controversy by allocating enough cheap units of water to suit double the average number of residents per household see los angeles example above such kludges allow managers to avoid hard decisions that deliver long term sustainability 7 variations on block and volumetric pricing are meant to address some of these concerns water budgets modify the ibr by changing the number of cheap blocks according to the number of residents landscaping area temperature zone etc the los angeles example above matches these parameters but water budgets are often calculated for each household which raises data collection calibration and communication costs water budgets are popular with water managers and customers who want everyone to enjoy fair access to scarce water but they create a right to landscaping when overall use might need to drop indeed baerenklau et al in their article comparing the relative effectiveness of water budgets to uniform rates find strong conservation effects in relation to consumption in higher blocks corresponding to outdoor irrigation in their arid southern california study area 4 going further they also suggest that utilities can safely pursue relatively simpler rate structures with perhaps only three blocks without foregoing significant conservation opportunities p 698 their key message in line with most economic reasoning is that customers respond to prices on the margin those prices can be present with ibrs water budgets or uniform charges after several years of reading about complex mis targeted and ineffective tariff schemes i designed my own scheme to encourage conservation without destabilizing utility finances or confusing customers in living with water scarcity i describe a system that brings one tool to each task of recovering costs stabilizing utility finances and signaling scarcity 72 pp 30 32 utilities should collect fixed and variable revenues in direct proportion to fixed and variable costs so their finances are stable all customers should pay the same uniform volumetric prices to be fair a surcharge can be added when water is scarce and demand needs to fall excess revenue from that surcharge can be rebated to each household without respect to their water use to ensure that the utility uses higher prices only as a temporary means of preventing shortage the surcharge increases the cost per unit consumed but the rebate does not depend on consumption so it does not dilute the surcharge s tendency to reduce quantity demanded fig 6 reproduced below shows how water costs usually arrive left column the way that water is typically mispriced center column and how to price water correctly for fiscal and environmental stability right column although i groped my way to this structure after several years of thinking about the interactions of different goals i was pleasantly surprised to find that electricity and natural gas charges in the netherlands follow this pattern of paying fixed costs charging extra to discourage use and then rebating excess revenues per household 11 11 https www belastingdienst nl wps wcm connect bldcontentnl belastingdienst zakelijk overige belastingen belastingen op milieugrondslag energiebelasting the regulator of sydney water likewise has implemented a system in which treated water prices rise when dam storage falls 56 on a more basic level summer surcharges per hanemann can also signal scarcity and dampen demand for extensive landscaping or swimming pools my model also addresses two deficiencies the first arises from the assumption that recovering fixed costs through variable charges is the same as charging for scarce water that assumption is wrong because variable charges based on opex not water scarcity remember rise and fall with demand while fixed costs do not the second deficiency is a habit of raising prices after revenue falls due to conservation as a means of paying for outstanding expenses rather than raising prices adding a scarcity surcharge in anticipation of scarcity as a means of reducing demand recall the east bay example above these deficiencies do not appear in competitive markets for commodities such as gasoline they appear in the water sector because prices are set by regulators based on political considerations that might ignore scarcity or shortage risk a mechanism that automatically adds surcharges when scarcity is rising and drops them when it recedes would signal scarcity and incentivize the behavioral changes necessary to avoid shortages i conclude this section by reminding readers that low water prices by encouraging use often harm the poor who are least able to cope with the resulting scarcity and shortage in new delhi for example around 40 percent of water is lost to leaks and theft and revenue covers only 40 percent of costs 12 12 leaking water can sometimes recharge groundwater but that recharge can occur in the wrong places it would make more sense to reduce leaks improve groundwater management and distribute water to a larger share of the population than pretend that leaks are somehow efficient the resulting lack of funds to run or expand the system and water to flow though it means the poor are more likely to get their water from tankers than the rich who are connected to the semi functional cheaper network 66 fuente et al likewise describe how subsidies in nairobi are more likely to go to the rich than the poor 24 chile to contrary has a functioning pro poor system after poor households are identified the central government pays for their basic consumption these households see their total use and the subsidy paid on their behalf they must pay for extra consumption 11 chile s system does not endanger the utility s finances require special tariffs or force the utility to ask households for their headcount or income 4 markets for raw water the sections above explored utility water pricing offered to residential customers but municipal and industrial use is much smaller than agricultural use which accounts for 70 90 percent of total developed water use 13 13 developed refers to water directed by humans in contrast to uncontrolled natural flows farmers are not really final water consumers so it is a bit misleading to say they use the water 1 likewise there is a robust debate on when water is used as opposed to changing its quality or location see 48 for an overview of water accounting it is important that farmers do not waste water although one would assume farmers consider scarcity they might not give it adequate attention first they might receive water deliveries via distribution systems that are reliable in quantities and timing regardless of scarcity affecting other users or the environment second they might self supply from private or common pooled groundwater and ignore falling water levels third they might have use it or lose it water rights that lapse if conserved water is unused 14 14 the existence of use or lose policies does not automatically mean rights are lost the definition of use might be lenient e g once per five years the burden of proof may lie on the regulator the measurement of use might be contested and so on fourth they might continue to use scarce water to avoid using other more expensive inputs such as labor 15 15 alfalfa is widely derided as a low value crop that requires large quantities of water to grow in desert conditions but it is more profitable than crops that require expensive labor such as strawberries these reasons might explain why some people claim farmers waste water when the farmers are efficiently responding to local conditions incentives and constraints an option to sell conserved water in water markets could change this situation by giving farmers a way to profit from scarcity data prices volumes from markets can also encourage storage or balance fluctuations from changes in crops weather and other factors the next section reviews some case studies but let us begin by reviewing some concepts relevant to water markets first it is important to have clear and quantified definitions of water rights as there is a big difference between having the right to divert 60 units of water and the right to consume 60 units from a diversion of 100 units that assumes 40 units of return flows 48 in many cases it is also important to distinguish between permanent property rights that may not be attached to land and currently deliverable flows that are available now markets in rights are weakened by risk and uncertainty over future conditions and the need to protect others from permanent changes in flows or collective management markets in flows are easier to run as transfers are valid only for one growing season and the water is often used locally second assuming a market in flows leases or short term transfers it is important to have many buyers and sellers to maximize market liquidity and competitive prices as well as conveyance for delivering water from buyers to sellers 71 market power on the buy sell or conveyance sides of the market distorts prices reduces trading volumes and interferes with good decisions third markets introduce high powered incentives that can break or strain existing institutions water exports for example reduce volumes in shared conveyances and return flows which harms other users and the environment in some cases the option to sell private good surface rights can increase stress on common pooled groundwater as sellers pump groundwater to replace the water they have sold these problems can worsen if it is possible to export food and fiber since increases in imported demand leads to increases in virtual water exports 1 77 the bottom line is that well designed water markets can reduce water scarcity but poorly designed ones can turn scarcity into shortage 5 some successful examples the water sector has many cases of success and failure due to its wide variety of institutions this section describes a few successes but see epa brandes et al and zetland gasson for representative surveys of municipal water pricing in the us north america and world wide respectively 22 10 76 for representative surveys of municipal water pricing in the us north america and world wide respectively also note that there are easily over 100 000 functioning drinking water systems in the world most of which operate without drama but also without much public oversight or reporting so the water sector is full of dogs that do not bark in many cases ongoing operations and drinkable water prove existence but not necessarily success as many systems could be run more cheaply with less energy lower leakage and so on the literature on water utility performance is under developed due to varying standards and missing competition among local monopolies but the literature on benchmark competition partially fills that gap 17 25 21 44 now let us review some examples of scarcity pricing preventing shortages the first case is singapore a southeast asian city state of around 4 5 million that split from malaysia in 1965 but still relies on imported water from its neighbor singapore s government has spent decades and billions of dollars on upgrading its supply side infrastructure water imports will end in 2061 and inducing citizens to conserve often citing national security per capita use has dropped from 172 lcd in 1995 to 143 lcd in 2017 64 49 pub singapore s integrated water utility has used conservation campaigns and price incentives to reduce demand according to pub current water tariffs are sgd 2 74 per m3 usd 2 04 for monthly consumption of less than 40 m3 and sgd 3 69 per m3 for consumption above that amount about 400 lcd for the average household of 3 2 people 49 this two block ibr most closely follows the recommendation of hanemann by targeting full cost recovery in the first block and the marginal cost of new sources in the second block 30 in addition households pay a water conservation tax wct which was introduced in 1991 to encourage water conservation and to reflect its scarcity value wct is imposed as a percentage of the water tariff to reinforce the message that water is precious from the very first drop 49 the wct basically matches the scarcity surcharge that i proposed above in addition to wct the government of singapore sends a rebate called gst voucher u save because it is funded by the goods and services tax to poorer households 49 this rebate helps poorer households in the same way as chile s policy described above singapore s water policies are world class ignoring countries and municipalities that cannot provide 24 7 safe water a development failure affecting 3 5 4 billion people see 65 many water utilities undercharge for their water by omitting capital scarcity and environmental costs from their prices these utilities are vulnerable to shortages and network failures but they also damage the environment and reduce the flow of beneficial ecosystem services 15 62 high quality affordable service requires good management long term budgets and customers willing to pay for reliable service my next example draws from 37 a case study of how santa barbara california avoided running out of water during the 1987 1992 drought the article begins by describing the panic over the city s falling reservoir levels which bottomed out at 12 percent of capacity enough for a few months in march 1991 as a complement to water conservation campaigns the public works department began raising water prices in july 1989 as well as shortening blocks in their ibr pricing schedule pushing consumers into more expensive blocks at lower uses to the point where the most expensive block beginning at 1 300 liters per day roughly the same as singapore s second block had a price of usd 10 40 per m3 usd 20 70 in 2020 or 30 times the pre drought price of usd 0 31 m3 although it is difficult to disaggregate the individual impacts of public awareness conservation regulations and pricing see 36 for one effort water demand dropped from around 700 liters per capita per day in 1987 to about half that figure in 1991 more interestingly the return of rains in 1991 and drop in water prices to merely triple their pre drought levels did not result in a huge rebound in demand which rose to only 61 percent of pre drought levels by 1995 the message s of this article are clear first higher prices reinforce other conservation messages second higher prices can make previously ignored block pricing more salient as discussed above third short term price shocks can induce long term behavioral change for case studies of pricing raw water in markets i turn to the widely studied examples of chile and australia chile s 1981 water code created a market for trading private water rights this reform combined with later reforms to corporatize and later privatize drinking water utilities resulted in radical changes in water management and a reduction in water scarcity through water trading and management 33 20 the water code was not without controversy and weak protections for environmental flows and social justice resulted in a 2005 reform 5 3 the case for australia s murray darling basin is likewise complex and evolving put in simple terms australia s federal government began changing laws in 1988 to limit state authority over water use and trading thereby allowing for trans boundary markets in permanent rights entitlements and temporary flows allocations these markets reduced water scarcity and benefitted farmers who were the primary users of surface waters but there are still many controversies regarding water use and management in the basin e g over paying to protect environmental flows inefficient regulation of trades inadequate environmental protections excess spending on technology that failed to deliver conservation and so on 28 39 2 54 27 although these cases are controversial in some ways they show how it is possible to reduce scarcity costs and improve water management at scale as a generalization water management in most of the rest of the world is either lucky scarcity has not arrived or troubled policies mismanage scarcity my overall opinion is that fossil groundwater depletion over drafting of renewable groundwater and climate chaos driven destabilization of precipitation and surface flows will reduce water supplies on the demand side increasing population wealth and meat consumption are increasing irrigation on the intensive applying more water and extensive displacing ecosystems and rain fed agriculture margins 55 18 the resulting squeeze between falling supply and rising demand increases the risk of water shortages and thus food shortages and upheaval maturing water economies must develop and implement policies for managing scarce economic water 51 6 the potential for pricing this article has reviewed the factors important to pricing water scarcity and thus how to design and implement reasonable and effective policies that will signal scarcity and prevent shortages of municipal industrial and agricultural water supplies although it is possible to manage scarcity with non price regulations and appeals to social norms such methods are less effective and often ineffective without complementary price structures in some cases e g auctions for agricultural water prices are sufficient to avoid shortage in others e g supplying water in thirsty cities prices are necessary but not sufficient for preventing shortages in all cases institutions for titling administering measuring and re allocating stocks and flows and their externalities are necessary to enable economic instruments to work stepping back we know that prices and markets can provide powerful incentives to put water to highest and best use but neither can address political and social choices regarding the share of water to leave in the environment or how to help poor citizens receive water services functional policies to address such social concerns are a pre requisite if citizens are to accept price mechanisms for allocating remaining water to economic uses emerging pressures from climate chaos and billions of increasingly wealthy humans are likely to convert today s inconvenient scarcity into disruptive shortages and perhaps even social collapse it is therefore important to begin negotiations with stakeholders on how to reform policies and institutions it is better to have a slow steady flow of water than none at all declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this article acknowledgments i thank andrei jouravlev giel verbeeck syvilla boon the editor brian richter and two
