16430,riverbank filtration is an established and quantitatively important approach to mine high quality raw water for drinking water production bacterial fecal indicators are routinely used to monitor hygienic raw water quality however their applicability in viral contamination has been questioned repeatedly additionally there are concerns that the increasing frequency and intensity of meteorological and hydrological events i e heavy precipitation and droughts leading to high and low river levels may impair riverbank filtration performance in this study we explored the removal of adenovirus compared with several commonly used bacterial and viral water quality indicators during different river levels in a seasonal study water from the rhine river a series of groundwater monitoring wells and a production well were regularly collected and analyzed for adenovirus coliphages e coli c perfringens coliform bacteria the total number of prokaryotic cells tcc and the number of virus like particles tvpc using molecular and cultivation based assays additionally basic physico chemical parameters including temperature ph dissolved organic carbon and nutrients were measured the highest log10 reduction during the 72 m of riverbank filtration from the river channel to the production well was observed for coliforms 3 7 log10 followed by e coli 3 4 log10 somatic coliphages 3 1 log10 c perfringens 2 5 log10 and f coliphages 2 1 log10 at high river levels adenovirus decreased by 1 6 3 1 log units in the first monitoring well 32 m and was not detected in further distant wells the highest removal efficiency of adenovirus and most other viral and bacterial fecal indicators was achieved during high river levels which were characterized by increased numbers of pathogens and indicators during low river levels coliforms and c perfringens were occasionally present in raw water at the production well adenovirus quantified via droplet digital pcr correlated with e coli somatic coliphages tcc tvpc ph and doc at high river levels at low river levels adenoviruses correlated with coliforms tvpc ph and water travel time we conclude that although standard fecal indicators are insufficient for assessing hygienic raw water quality a combination of e coli coliforms and somatic coliphages can assess riverbank filtration performance in adenovirus removal furthermore effects of extreme hydrological events should be studied on an event to event basis at high spatial and temporal resolutions finally there is an urgent need for a lower limit of detection for pathogenic viruses in natural waters preconcentration of viral particles from larger water volumes 100 l constitutes a promising strategy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords riverbank filtration

worldwide völker and borchardt 2019 when groundwater is insufficient or of low quality surface water is used however since the surface water quality is generally low purification is required wherever possible natural purification processes are used instead of technical treatment along large rivers and lakes induced riverbank filtration is a common approach for drinking water production kuehn and mueller 2000 in this study surface water is guided through riverbed sediments and the adjacent shallow aquifer to a production well although riverbank filtration appears efficient providing adequate water conditioning most of the year extreme hydrological events which tend to become more frequent due to climate change can pose a serious risk to the quality of bank filtrated water and the safe operation of drinking water supply sprenger et al 2011 drinking water supply from surface water via riverbank filtration is widely used not only in europe but also in north and south america and asia gillefalk et al 2018 in germany approximately 16 of drinking water is produced from induced riverbank filtration gillefalk et al 2018 at numerous sites riverbank filtration has a long history of more than 150 years of operation schubert 2002 with ongoing industrialization and population growth there has been widespread pollution of surface water resources although the establishment of high standards in wastewater treatment has improved water quality over the past decades pollutants such as pathogenic viruses may exhibit high resistance to current water treatment techniques which poses a

as the immobilization of metals and other inorganic compounds ibrahim et al 2015 sandhu et al 2019 the hygienic aspects of water quality have always been of particular concern recent studies have

persistence in the aqueous environment resistance to disinfection methods small colloidal size and low infectious doses fong and lipp 2005 to date the efficiency of riverbank filtration in removing pathogenic viruses has mainly been studied using viral surrogates or fecal indicators such as bacteriophages rather than following the fate of human pathogenic viruses with only a few exceptions betancourt et al 2014 reasons for using surrogates are manifold including difficulties associated with the direct detection of pathogenic viruses mcminn et al 2017 commonly used fecal indicators such as e coli and coliforms are reliable in assessing bacterial pathogen contamination however their application to assess and monitor viral contamination is limited ashbolt et al 2001 even the use of bacteriophages e g coliphages as indicators for assessing water contaminated with human pathogenic viruses lack predictive power jofre et al 2016 alternatively adenoviruses which cause several gastroenteric diseases have been proposed as monitoring targets who 2006 they are shed into wastewater in significant amounts along with the feces of infected patients bauer et al 2011 riverbank filtration systems must be considered highly vulnerable to pathogen contamination under extreme hydrological conditions floods and low water situations are expected to occur more frequently in europe in the future because of climate change sprenger et al 2011 eckert et al 2008 ipcc 2014 hari et al 2020 demonstrated that the occurrence of the 2018 2019 summer drought in central europe is unprecedented in the last 250 years it has been repeatedly recommended to evaluate the impact of extreme hydrological events on water quality and riverbank filtration efficiency particularly the impact on the natural attenuation of bacterial and viral pathogens masse dufresne et al 2021 the primary objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics in attenuation efficiency of riverbank filtration for adenoviruses viral indicators and other fecal and microbial indicators with respect to the impact of extreme hydrological events we targeted the predictability of hygienic contamination via individual fecal and or viral indicators and its practical use for monitoring riverbank filtration efficiency correlations between microbiological and physico chemical variables with a focus on water quality parameters were assessed for 16 months water samples were collected from the banks of the rhine river and from various groundwater monitoring wells along an observation transect from the

by a tertiary silty fine sand aquitard numerous groundwater monitoring wells surround the riverbank filtration plant eleven wells have been selected for our study because of their locations with increasing distance to the rhine river and the extension to various depths which allowed following the fate of the bank filtrate from the river to one of the production wells pw5 pw5 is part of a well gallery located parallel to the river which forces river water through the riverbank and the shallow aquifer fig 1b the bank filtrate obtained from pw5 was a mixture of water from the well gallery between the river and pw5 two sets of monitoring wells a and b are situated at a horizontal distance of 40 2 and 20 4 m to the production well fig 1c according to schubert 2002 the minimum travel

performed in the same lab and with the same methods based on the initial sample volume and the volume of dna extract used in our study a detection limit between 10 9 and 397 particles l 1 was calculated without taking into account losses during concentration and extraction 2 3 water travel time analysis mean travel times for conservative solute transport from the river to the observation wells as influenced by the river level changes and the pumping rate was estimated from the measured piezometric pressure heads of the observation wells for this we calculated the mean particle velocity in the groundwater on the basis of darcy s law taking the hydraulic gradient between observation wells a1 and b1 v t 1 n k d h t d l 1 n k h a 1 t h b 1 t δ l a 1 b 1 where v t represents the mean particle velocity in the groundwater at time t m d 1 n represents the effective porosity of the aquifer k represents the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer m d 1 dh t dl represents the hydraulic gradient at time t ha 1 t and hb 1 t represent piezometric pressure heads at time t at the observation wells a1 and b1 m and la 1 b 1 represents the distance between wells a1 and b1 m following the modeling results of sharma et al 2012 for the same field site we assumed n 0 2 and k 1 59 10 3 m s 1 assuming flow is only in the direction perpendicular to the river the mean travel time t s t from the river to an observation well at a distance s from the river and time t can be calculated using the following equations s t t s t t v t d t v t v t t s t v t v t d t v t is assumed to be stepwise constant based on the hydraulic gradients available at the sampling dates then the integral v t can be given with v t i 0 j 1 v i d t i v j i 0 j d t i t t i 0 j 1 d t i a n d t i 0 j d t i then s v t v t t s t s v k i 0 k 1 d t i t t s t i k 1 j 1 v i d t i v j i 0 j d t i t t s t can be calculated by finding k 0 1 n where n represents the highest timestep number so that these two equations are satisfied s i k 1 j 1 v i d t i v j i k j d t i t s i k j 1 v i d t i v j i k j d t i t then t s t s i k 1 j 1 v i d t i v j i 0 j d t i t v k t i 0 k 1 d t i note that t s t is only an estimate for the travel time since i the distance between the river and the observation wells slightly varies over time due to river level changes ii flow will have a vertical component close to the river groundwater iii our limited sampling frequency prevent us from fully capturing the dynamically changing the hydraulic gradient iv and spatial heterogeneities in n and k are neglected the mean travel time t was calculated for observation wells at a s 40 m b s 60 m and pw5 s 80 m with the river as a reference for the riverside groundwater flow using the hydraulic gradient between observation wells c and oo8 t is also calculated for observation wells c s 17 m from oo8 and pw5 s 35 m from oo8 during the shut off of pw5 in spring 2018 the river level and the groundwater level at well oo8 indicate that natural effluent conditions have returned thus no travel time could be calculated excluding the switch off of pw5 the attenuation efficiency of riverbank filtration for viral and bacterial indicators was evaluated for three hydrological situations i e the high medium and low river levels these hydrological events were categorized by river levels as described in section 2 1 whereas the water samples from the observation wells were categorized according to the hydrological event at the commencement of its underground passage considering the estimated mean travel time figure s2 2 4 statistical analysis all statistics were implemented with software packages in the r environment r foundation http www r project org with the significance level set as α 0 05 differences and similarities in abiotic and biotic variables within and between the individual well rows were tested through kruskal wallis tests kruska test and anova oneway test spearman rank correlation matrices using hmisc package were used to explore relationships between biological abundance of viral and bacterial indicators atp tcc and tvpc and chemical ion concentrations and physico chemical factors ph do ec and temperature the log reduction of biological indicators during riverbank filtration was calculated by comparing the composition of groundwater and river water at different hydrological events figure s2 principal component analysis pca was performed considering the selected biological variables and physico chemical parameters using the prcomp function 3 results 3 1 water level dynamics the river level during the 16 month sampling period showed a typical seasonality with high levels in winter and low levels in summer fig 2 the highest levels were monitored at the beginning of the field study with 33 meter above sea level m a s l lowest river levels 27 3 m a s l were recorded in late october 2018 the groundwater levels in the different observation wells were very similar but dampened dynamic as those in the river fig 2 the river level was always above the groundwater levels indicating infiltrating conditions except for the shutdown period of the waterworks facility 3 2 bank filtration water travel times travel times of the infiltrated river water are strongly related to the river level fig 3 extended travel times occur when the river level is receding over a longer period for example during the regression of the high river level short travel times are caused by sudden river level increases as observed in winter 2018 2019 when pw5 was shut off for maintenance the direction of water flow between the river and the production well could have reversed resulting in groundwater discharge to the river and negative water flow velocities when river levels are medium to low which was the case for most of the year groundwater from the land side area opposite to the river with respect to the extraction well flows toward pw5 passing well oo8 and row c fig 3 during high river levels river water infiltrates far beyond the production well reversing the water flow direction at the land side 3 3 water stable isotope signatures the δ18o values as well as δ2h values figure s3 in river water remained constant throughout the year with only small variations 9 5 0 3 fig 4 a compared with surface water groundwater specific isotopic signatures at oo8 and row c showed higher values from march to november 2018 fig 2 samples taken at oo8 and row c during high water levels showed similar isotope ratios to river water at low river levels only water in rows a b and pw5 contained river water as depicted from the isotope ratios whereas wells opposite to the production well c oo8 contained land side groundwater 3 4 dynamics in physico chemical conditions the river water temperature showed a seasonality with low values down to 3 9 c in winter and high temperatures up to 25 7 c in summer fig 2 the mean river water temperature during the period of sampling was 14 2 c 7 1 c the groundwater temperature at oo8 varied between 10 8 c and 16 6 c 13 7 c 1 6 c at pw5 as recorded between july 2018 and may 2019 the water temperature ranged between 8 6 c and 17 4 c with a mean of 13 4 c 3 0 c ec in the river water showed no significant variation fig 2 with a mean value of 566 61 µs cm 1 groundwater in oo8 had its minimum of 539 µs cm 1 during high river levels and its highest values up to 852 µs cm 1 when disconnected from the river during medium and low water levels the overall pattern of ec in water from the observation wells was consistent with stable water isotope analysis results the ec pattern was also consistent with selected ions exemplarily displayed for ca2 and so4 2 figure s4 generally ph values did not show strong fluctuations during the study but a clear gradient between the river 8 1 0 2 and water in oo8 7 3 0 2 the mean ph value at pw5 was similar to that at oo8 with 7 3 0 1 the do concentration in the water samples exhibited a clear seasonality decreasing with increasing water temperature fig 2 compared with the land side groundwater high do concentrations were observed in river water ranging from 7 3 to 13 5 mg l 1 with a mean of 10 4 1 8 mg l 1 the concentration of do in groundwater at oo8 and pw5 ranged from below detection to 6 9 mg l 1 with a mean of 2 2 1 7 mg l 1 and 3 5 2 3 mg l 1 respectively do decreased as river water passed through the riverbank fig 4f the decline in do was also mirrored to a lesser degree in a decrease in doc figure s3 further distant from the river the doc concentration remained constant noticeably the do concentration in the riverbank filtrate dropped to zero several times during summer however in connection to the local disappearance of do no obvious change in nitrate concentrations was observed figure s3 3 5 dynamics of bacterial indicators the total number of tcc in the river ranged from 3 0 108 to 2 8 109 cells l 1 positively correlated with the water temperature fig 5 as water flows through the riverbank tcc readily declined 16 fold on average between the river and wells in row a although the annual mean values of tcc in water from the different observation wells were in the same order of magnitude there was a significant difference between different locations along the transect to the production well pw5 table s1 the lowest tcc values were observed in groundwater from row c a similar pattern was found with microbial activity atp fig 6 a the highest atp values were found in the river water on average 6 4 10 10 5 2 10 10 m atp decreased not only with distance to the river but also with distance to well oo8 hence the lowest atp was found in water in pw5 2 4 10 12 8 1 10 12 m the fecal indicators e coli and coliforms were frequently detected in river water but only occasionally in water from the observation wells fig 5 there was no obvious trend in the dynamics of e coli or coliforms in the river depending on the season the mean e coli concentration in river water was 803 mpn 100 ml with a large variance 1148 mpn 100 ml only 12 of 283 water samples from the observation wells were positive for e coli and e coli was never found in any of the land side groundwater samples fig 5 the concentration of coliforms in the river was approximately 5 times higher than e coli with an average of 4884 6027 mpn 100 ml coliforms were observed more frequently in water from the observation wells in 83 of 283 samples considering hydrological situations and travel time coliforms were detected in water in pw5 at low river level figure s5 the occurrence of c perfringens in river water did not show a seasonal trend similar to other bacterial indicators compared with e coli and coliforms the average concentration of c perfringens was lower with 197 163 cfu 100 ml c perfringens was also detected in the monitoring wells of row a even when the river was at medium levels in total 38 of 268 water samples from the observation wells were c perfringens positive 3 6 viral indicators a mean of 3 2 1010 1 2 1010 virus particles l 1 was detected in the river which was on average is 23 times higher than the tcc of the same samples and 38 times higher than tvpc in row a the lowest tvpc was found in water samples from row c 5 7 108 3 7 108 virus particles l 1 human enteric adenoviruses were found in the rhine river during the entire sampling period the mean concentration of adenovirus in surface water was 1 2 104 3 0 104 particles l 1 whereas the virus concentration in well a2 was already two to three orders of magnitude lower with 5 8 101 3 6 101 particles l 1 no adenovirus was above the limit of detection lod in the selected samples of well b1 the occurrence of f coliphages and somatic coliphages in the river differed f coliphage concentration was the highest in january 2018 with 12 pfu 100 ml overall with a mean concentration of 2 6 3 8 pfu 100 ml effective attenuation of f coliphages during riverbank filtration was observed between the river and rows a and b only a few samples were detected as positive in wells a2 and b1 in spring 2018 fig 7 no f coliphages were found in groundwater from other wells only 5 of 74 water samples from the observation wells contained active f coliphages above the lod the highest concentration of somatic coliphages detected in the river was 116 pfu 100 ml in february 2019 and other samples exceeding a concentration of 40 pfu 100 ml were detected only in january and december 2018 the mean concentration of active somatic coliphages in river water was 24 1 28 0 pfu 100 ml 9 fold higher than f coliphages only 7 of 74 water samples from the observation wells were positive for somatic coliphages however somatic coliphages were occasionally detected in groundwater at c1 in spring 2018 3 7 river water bank filtrate and groundwater in comparison spearman rank correlation analysis revealed that all biological variables including adenovirus recorded for the riverbank filtration transect are significantly correlated figure s6 noticeably all biological indicators positively correlated with ph and negatively correlated with the travel time furthermore all biological indicators negatively correlated with δ18o and ec except adenovirus the do concentration positively correlates with viral indicators e coli and c perfringens rather than coliforms and tcc the river and groundwater level co varied with three bacterial indicators i e e coli coliforms and c perfringens a covariation was also discovered between tcc tvpc coliforms and temperature the correlation analysis exhibited different patterns when data from surface water and observation wells were analyzed separately for the river samples fewer correlations were obtained although all biological indicators were detected all year round for bacterial indicators the concentration of coliforms correlated with both c perfringens and e coli a positive correlation occurred between the viral indicators f coliphages and somatic coliphages as well as for tvpc and f coliphages however none of the biological variables correlated with the abundance of adenovirus the relationships between the biological indicators in the riverbank filtrate and groundwater were different c perfringens correlated with most of the biological indicators including f coliphages coliforms e coli tcc tvpc and atp additionally the number of coliforms correlated with e coli and tcc the two groups of coliphages did not correlate with each other nonetheless somatic coliphages correlated positively with atp whereas f coliphages correlated with e coli and c perfringens once more no correlation between adenovirus and other biological indicators was found taking a specific look at the correlations between adenovirus and individual physico chemical parameters at different hydrological situations ph was the only variable correlating independent of the hydrological condition the abundance of adenovirus during bank filtration correlated positively with ph elevated doc concentrations found at high river levels correlated positively with an increased abundance of adenovirus at medium river levels several factors i e travel time temperature ph do were found to correlate with adenovirus at low river levels it was only ph and travel time that revealed a statistical significant correlation to adenovirus with respect to other biological indicators adenoviruses correlated with e coli somatic coliphages tcc and tvpc during high river levels with coliforms somatic coliphages atp at medium river levels and with coliforms tvpc and atp at low river levels respectively principal component analyses pca fig 8 depict the spatial and temporal differences within water samples collected from the river and observation wells with respect to the selected physico chemical and biological variables the difference between river water and water from the observation wells was explained by principal components with 47 1 of the total variance and pc2 explained another 17 4 fig 8a although river water had significantly higher concentrations of coliforms e coli c perfringens atp tcc tvpc and doc the riverbank filtrate and groundwater samples were closely clustered in the pca plot fig 8a excluding river samples from the analysis the trend in water samples could be explained by pc1 with 29 5 and pc2 with 19 4 fig 8b pc1 is mainly represented by the distance from the river whereas seasonality represented by temperature and do is the dominant factor for the variance in pc2 3 8 efficiency of riverbank filtration in removing pathogens and fecal indicators we observed that in surface water concentrations of several bacterial and viral indicators i e e coli c perfringens adenovirus f coliphages and somatic coliphages were higher during high river levels flood situation than during low and medium river levels fig 9 the absolute removal efficiency during riverbank filtration in terms of log10 reduction was higher during high river levels than in other hydrological phases for most biological indicators fig 9 however most of the biological indicators could not be detected in the production well pw5 regardless of the hydrological conditions the highest log10 reduction during passage through the riverbank was observed for coliforms 3 7 log10 followed by e coli 3 4 log10 somatic coliphages 3 1 log10 c perfringens 2 5 log10 and f coliphages 2 1 log10 at high river levels the concentration of adenovirus decreased by 3 1 log units between the river and observation well row a it is obvious from our data that the most pronounced removal of viruses and bacteria takes place in the early sediment passage from the river channel to well row a table 1 for this first stretch of sediment passage low river levels had a beneficial effect on the removal of c perfringens tvpc and f coliphages with a reduction of 2 3 log10 1 8 log10 and 0 8 log10 respectively tcc e coli and somatic coliphages were reduced most efficiently at medium water levels by 1 3 log10 2 7 log10 2 4 log10 adenovirus was the only agent that exhibited the highest removal efficiency 3 1 log10 between the river to well row a at high river levels table 1 4 discussions 4 1 attenuation of adenovirus and other viral and bacterial indicators during riverbank filtration in our study we investigated the fate of adenovirus compared with several viral and bacterial fecal indicators during riverbank filtration across a transect of 72 m from the rhine river to the production well of a waterwork facility fig 1 using ddpcr we detected adenovirus all year round in rhine river water at concentrations of 7 1 101 to 1 2 105 particles l 1 although adenovirus could occasionally still be detected in the riverbank filtrate water after 32 m of sediment passage at a2 fig 7 all samples analyzed from the observation well b1 52 m travel distance from the river were adenovirus negative given the lod of approximately 10 particles l 1 consequently we assume the risk of adenovirus contamination at concentrations 1 virus particle l 1 in water at the production well pw5 to be very low however an occasional occurrence at lower concentrations cannot be excluded in agreement with this observation none of the other tested viral indicators such as coliphages were detected in water from the production well and individual bacterial fecal indicators such as c perfringens and coliforms were detected only rarely besides the risk assessment of adenovirus contamination in raw water at the waterworks in duesseldorf germany a major focus of our study was on the suitability of individual viral and bacterial indicators expectedly viral and bacterial indicators when transported through aquatic sediments differ in terms of attenuation including processes such as straining adsorption persistence and decay schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 although straining is considered one of the most important processes for attenuating bacteria it has been shown that it mainly occurs when the ratio of the particles of concern viruses 0 02 0 08 µm bacteria 0 2 2 µm and the medium grain size this study 0 5 to 10 mm is 0 5 bradford et al 2004 as such straining is considered to be negligible for our setting previous studies revealed that total adenovirus particles had the highest persistence decay rate of 0 008 0 027 log10 day 1 followed by other selected indicators i e c perfringens inactivation rate of 0 027 log10 day 1 infectious coliphages inactivation rate of 0 03 1 0 log10 day 1 e coli and coliforms inactivation rate of 0 02 1 5 log10 day 1 when incubated at 15 c in groundwater or autoclaved surface water medema et al 1997 john and rose 2005 ogorzaly et al 2010 moreover the persistence of selected indicators decreases to varying degrees at elevated temperatures the presence of active autochthonous microbes and unsaturated conditions feichtmayer et al 2017 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the adsorption of viruses and bacteria is particle specific i e surface charge and hydrophobicity mineral surfaces specific i e surface charge heterogeneity and depends on water chemistry i e ph ionic strength cations and organic matter as summarized in the dlvo derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 therefore even among viruses of a similar size different transport and survival behavior have to be expected and documented a bosch et al 2006 nevertheless numerous studies claim that individual fecal indicators such as e coli can adequately account for bacterial and viral contamination donn et al 2020 love et al 2014 meanwhile at first glance the different indicators tested in our study provided similar information however at a closer look numerous differences are found from the perspective of removal efficiency during the sediment passage from the river to the production well the routinely used indicators coliforms and e coli experienced a stronger reduction i e 3 6 log10 and 2 9 log10 respectively than viral indicators i e somatic coliphages 2 5 log10 f coliphages 1 6 log10 and total viral particles tvpc 1 6 log10 clostridium perfringens performed worse than somatic coliphages 2 3 log10 and the total number of tcc revealed the least reduction 1 4 log10 of all indicators tested the main reduction in viral and bacterial indicators generally takes place in the early sediment passage schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 this is consistent with our findings focusing only on the transect between the rhine river and row a and ignoring various hydrological situations the mean reduction of adenovirus was 2 3 log units which is comparable with the removal of e coli 2 6 log10 coliforms 2 4 log10 and somatic coliphages 2 3 log10 and higher than that of other selected microorganisms a higher spatial resolution would have been advantageous to explore the attenuation pattern i e exponential vs linear reduction in more detail a large range in the reduction of adenovirus from approximately 1 to 5 log units is reported for riverbank filtration of comparable distances 31 92 m from previous studies betancourt et al 2014 verbyla et al 2016 sprenger et al 2014 removal efficiencies are very site specific partinoudi and collins 2007 rohns et al 2006 weiss et al 2003 2005 variations in reduction are mainly caused by the different adenovirus source concentrations sediment properties water residence times and the lod of quantification methods used the same is true for other indicators a reduction of coliphages by 1 9 to 4 4 log units after a sediment infiltration distance of 27 177 m has been documented verbyla et al 2016 weiss et al 2003 2005 rohns et al 2006 note that an approximate 5 log10 reduction of somatic coliphages after only 3 8 m of riverbank passage was reported by sprenger et al 2014 for site water infiltration is not forced by pumping implying the water residence time to be a key factor sprenger et al 2011 the removal efficiency of bacterial fecal indicators i e coliforms e coli and c perfringens during riverbank filtration has been investigated in several studies a reduction of 2 4 log units has frequently been observed for sediment travel distances of 12 55 m and source concentrations 104 pfu 100 ml partinoudi and collins 2007 ren et al 2019 weiss et al 2003 although studies that directly compared the removal efficiency for viral and bacterial pathogens and or indicators are rare bacterial indicators showed a higher reduction level than viral indicators same as found in our study weiss et al 2003 2005 besides specific bacterial and viral indicators we monitored the behavior of tvpc and tcc during riverbank filtration which are variables that have rarely been considered in previous studies especially for the underground passage at field scale compared with adenovirus and other indicators tvpc and tcc exhibited the lowest log removal during the passage of river water to the production well similar to the other indicators most of the removal occurred in the sediment passage between river and well row a a low removal of tvpc and tcc comparable with that in the present study ranging between 1 and 1 7 log10 units after 1 1 m of vertical infiltration and 70 m of horizontal infiltration through aquatic sediments were observed by mindl et al 2015 and fillinger et al 2020 contrary to other more specific indicators tvpc and tcc may contain offspring from microbes and viruses which can replicate in the bank sediment thus they may not be suitable indicators for monitoring attenuation efficiency for pathogens during riverbank filtration who 2017 regarded 10 5 pathogenic viruses l 1 as a safe threshold concentration for drinking water which is six orders of magnitude below our lod for adenovirus 10 particles l 1 there is no routine technique to concentrate viruses from water by greater than or equal to six to seven orders of magnitude pei et al 2012 seidel et al 2016 hence this target quality of riverbank filtration can be evaluated considering the viral load in river water and predicted reduction during riverbank filtration the removal of adenovirus and the viral indicators tested meet the minimum removal for viruses of 2 1 log10 expected in riverbank filtration as stated by who 2017 additionally the reduction of most other targeted bacterial fecal indicators exceeded the minimum removal of 2 log10 for bacteria with the sediment passage from the river to the production well 4 2 correlations between biological indicators and physico chemical variables as human pathogenic viruses cannot propagate in an aquatic environment the abundance of adenovirus in river likely correlates with the fraction of wastewater from the runoff of sewage treatment plants which may be increased during and after heavy rain events passerat et al 2011 and low river level periods karakurt et al 2019 concretely our study revealed increased numbers of coliphages in river water at high levels when compared with other hydrological conditions note that there was a strong negative correlation between the number of cultivable coliphages and river water temperature suggesting that low temperatures experienced during high river levels may have favored virus survival as viruses generally experience thermal destabilization and gradation of the viral capsid when exposed to higher temperatures john and rose 2005 additionally low temperatures reduce the activity of antagonistic microbes and biological mechanisms contributing to virus survival gordon and toze 2003 yates et al 1990 tcc and tvpc mainly reflecting the autochthonous microbes and viruses exhibited a higher density at high temperatures resulting in a high concentration in river water during low river levels tcc was also positively correlated with temperature as reported in a previous study by liu et al 2013 furthermore we observed a negative correlation between c perfringens and ec in river water heavy rainfall accompanied by high river levels with low ec in river water due to dilution effects has the potential to mobilize adsorbed microorganisms from river bed sediments and soils of the catchment landry et al 1979 moreover albeit a high concentration of coliforms in river water was observed at low river levels no correlation with any drought specific physico chemical parameter was found noticeably the occurrence and abundance of adenovirus in the river water and bank filtrate did not correlate with any of the bacterial and viral indicators monitored nor with any of the physico chemical parameters tested thus based on the fate of fecal bacterial indicators e coli coliforms viral surrogates coliphages tcc and tvpc it would not have been possible to predict the occurrence and abundance of pathogenic viruses in either river water or bank filtrate 4 3 impact of hydrological extremes on riverbank filtration efficiency another focus of our study was the effect of different river levels on the transport and reduction of adenovirus and viral and bacterial fecal indicators during riverbank filtration the water travel time through bank sediments is a complex function of parameters including hydraulic conductivity of subsurface sediments pumping rate at the production well land side groundwater levels and river stages expectedly with longer travel times all selected biological indicators were reduced this correlation supports the typical hypothesis that a decrease in travel time caused by short termed increases of the river stage increases the risk of viruses reaching the production well vice versa at slow changing and generally low river levels reduced water flow velocity and increased water residence time can be assumed improving removal efficiency for pathogenic agents high river levels are believed to impair the natural water purification efficiency in riverbank filtration mainly due to potentially elevated concentrations of viruses and bacteria in surface water a reduced travel time and less dilution with groundwater in our study concretely most of the targeted viral and microbial indicators either showed the highest concentrations in surface water during flood events or concentrations were in the same range in all hydrological situations we found travel times from the rhine river to the production well of less than 10 days at high river levels compared to maximum travel times of up to 78 days mean travel time was 31 days previous studies and well established raw water protection schemes recommend a mean water travel time of 10 60 days to be sufficient for efficiently removing pathogenic viruses and bacteria worth mentioning based on our δ18o data we can show that water from the production well entirely originated from the river at high water levels while the river water share was 84 and 77 during medium and low water levels respectively furthermore at times of high river levels a full sediment passage from the river to the production well was required to efficiently remove the tested biological indicators whereas under other hydrological situations particularly during low river levels a sediment passage from the river to the nearby observation wells at row a was already sufficient to reduce most targeted indicators to below the lod another aspect related to high river level situations was raised by irmscher and teermann 2002 who claimed that low activity filter media do not remove pathogens efficiently and as the river level rises the infiltrating surface water reaches unsaturated subsoil zones unconditioned for effective natural attenuation additionally factors including low ionic strength elevated doc and high flow velocities caused by floods may not only lower the adsorption of microorganisms and viruses to the sediment matrix significantly decreasing the attenuation capacity of riverbank filtration but also trigger a remobilization of previously adsorbed bacteria and viruses promoting their long distance underground transport sprenger et al 2011 maliva 2019 the highest removal efficiency for adenovirus and most viral and bacterial indicators tested in our study was observed during high river levels following the above mentioned findings and assumptions this is surprising however the data obtained are worth a second look the higher removal efficiency for pathogens and indicators by riverbank filtration during high river levels are related to higher absolute numbers of respective agents in river water during flood situations fig 9 in fact high coliform and coliphage numbers in combination with high water levels as reported by rohns et al 2006 could indeed pose a serious risk to water quality at the production well exceeding the capacity of riverbank filtration taking a specific look to the different hydrological situations the abundance of adenovirus during bank filtration correlated positively with ph supporting the idea that virus particles attach to a lesser extent at a higher ph due to increased electrostatic repulsion according to the dvlo theory schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 elevated doc concentrations found at high river levels correlated positively with an increased abundance of adenovirus in fact dissolved organic matter was shown to compete with viruses for sorption sites on sediment surfaces gerba 1984 at low river levels it was only ph and travel time that revealed a statistical significant correlation to adenovirus no common biological indicators were found to correlate with the abundance of adenovirus during sediment passage at different river levels while at high river level adenoviruses correlated with e coli somatic coliphages tcc and tvpc a correlation with coliforms tvpc and atp was revealed at low river levels in consequence for the site investigated a combination of e coli coliforms and coliphages seems safe to monitor raw water quality the only contamination of raw water at the production well was the occasional occurrence of coliforms and c perfringens during the long period of extremely low river levels in the summer of 2018 low river levels entail the risk of river bed sediment clogging here clogging includes excessive biomass accumulation sedimentation of accumulated suspended particles and precipitation of mn4 or fe3 after consumption of do and denitrification sprenger et al 2011 engesgaard et al 2006 diem et al 2013 clogging may not only reduce the bank filtrate quantity but may also lead to preferential flow paths and impaired removal efficiency of pathogens and microbiological indicators jaramillo 2011 conversely an increased number of fine particles and iron oxide minerals may constitute an effective barrier leading to an increased adsorption of viruses schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 additionally viruses and bacteria have been demonstrated to be less inactivated and removed under anoxic conditions which we have observed during the long term drought when compared with oxic conditions klitzke et al 2015 frohnert et al 2014 thus we summarize that both high river levels with reduced sediment travel times for water carrying a huge particle load and low water levels with increased water temperature and the risk of bank sediment clogging may pose a risk to raw water quality at the production well this conclusion is supported by earlier findings of rohns et al 2006 who investigated the same riverbank filtration site 5 conclusion in this study we compared the performance of a riverbank filtration site for the removal of adenovirus and several commonly used bacterial and viral water quality indicators during different hydrological situations surprisingly high river levels were characterized not only by an increased number of pathogens and indicators but also by the highest removal efficiency with riverbank filtration during drought and low river levels coliforms and c perfringens were occasionally present in raw water at the production well of the waterworks adenovirus quantified via droplet digital pcr correlated with e coli somatic coliphages tcc tvpc ph and doc at high river levels at low river levels adenoviruses correlated with coliforms tvpc ph and water travel time for the site investigated a combination of e coli coliforms and coliphages for assessing raw water quality was proved safe for adenovirus and probably other human pathogenic viruses viral fecal indicators such as coliphages may occasionally fail predictability as shown for low river levels which is an issue that awaits a more detailed exploration extreme hydrological events and their influence on the performance of riverbank filtration should be studied on an event to event basis at a significantly higher spatial and temporal resolution this is a difficult task because flood and drought periods cannot be precisely forecasted when planning a field study finally there is an urgent need for lower lods of pathogenic viruses in natural waters since molecular tools such as the ddpcr cannot be significantly improved the pre concentration of viral particles from larger

16430,riverbank filtration is an established and quantitatively important approach to mine high quality raw water for drinking water production bacterial fecal indicators are routinely used to monitor hygienic raw water quality however their applicability in viral contamination has been questioned repeatedly additionally there are concerns that the increasing frequency and intensity of meteorological and hydrological events i e heavy precipitation and droughts leading to high and low river levels may impair riverbank filtration performance in this study we explored the removal of adenovirus compared with several commonly used bacterial and viral water quality indicators during different river levels in a seasonal study water from the rhine river a series of groundwater monitoring wells and a production well were regularly collected and analyzed for adenovirus coliphages e coli c perfringens coliform bacteria the total number of prokaryotic cells tcc and the number of virus like particles tvpc using molecular and cultivation based assays additionally basic physico chemical parameters including temperature ph dissolved organic carbon and nutrients were measured the highest log10 reduction during the 72 m of riverbank filtration from the river channel to the production well was observed for coliforms 3 7 log10 followed by e coli 3 4 log10 somatic coliphages 3 1 log10 c perfringens 2 5 log10 and f coliphages 2 1 log10 at high river levels adenovirus decreased by 1 6 3 1 log units in the first monitoring well 32 m and was not detected in further distant wells the highest removal efficiency of adenovirus and most other viral and bacterial fecal indicators was achieved during high river levels which were characterized by increased numbers of pathogens and indicators during low river levels coliforms and c perfringens were occasionally present in raw water at the production well adenovirus quantified via droplet digital pcr correlated with e coli somatic coliphages tcc tvpc ph and doc at high river levels at low river levels adenoviruses correlated with coliforms tvpc ph and water travel time we conclude that although standard fecal indicators are insufficient for assessing hygienic raw water quality a combination of e coli coliforms and somatic coliphages can assess riverbank filtration performance in adenovirus removal furthermore effects of extreme hydrological events should be studied on an event to event basis at high spatial and temporal resolutions finally there is an urgent need for a lower limit of detection for pathogenic viruses in natural waters preconcentration of viral particles from larger water volumes 100 l constitutes a promising strategy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords riverbank filtration

worldwide völker and borchardt 2019 when groundwater is insufficient or of low quality surface water is used however since the surface water quality is generally low purification is required wherever possible natural purification processes are used instead of technical treatment along large rivers and lakes induced riverbank filtration is a common approach for drinking water production kuehn and mueller 2000 in this study surface water is guided through riverbed sediments and the adjacent shallow aquifer to a production well although riverbank filtration appears efficient providing adequate water conditioning most of the year extreme hydrological events which tend to become more frequent due to climate change can pose a serious risk to the quality of bank filtrated water and the safe operation of drinking water supply sprenger et al 2011 drinking water supply from surface water via riverbank filtration is widely used not only in europe but also in north and south america and asia

pathogenic viruses has mainly been studied using viral surrogates or fecal indicators such as bacteriophages rather than following the fate of human pathogenic viruses with only a few exceptions betancourt et al 2014 reasons for using surrogates are manifold including difficulties associated with the direct detection of pathogenic viruses mcminn et al 2017 commonly used fecal indicators such as e coli and coliforms are reliable in assessing bacterial pathogen contamination however their application to assess and monitor viral contamination is limited ashbolt et al 2001 even the use of bacteriophages e g coliphages as indicators for assessing water contaminated with human pathogenic viruses lack predictive power jofre et al 2016 alternatively adenoviruses which cause several gastroenteric diseases have been proposed as monitoring targets who 2006 they are shed into wastewater in significant amounts along with the feces of infected patients bauer et al 2011 riverbank filtration systems must be considered highly vulnerable to pathogen contamination under extreme hydrological conditions floods and low water situations are expected to occur more frequently in europe in the future because of climate change sprenger et al 2011 eckert et al 2008 ipcc 2014 hari et al 2020 demonstrated that the occurrence of the 2018 2019 summer drought in central europe is unprecedented in the last 250 years it has been repeatedly recommended to evaluate the impact of extreme hydrological events on water quality and riverbank filtration efficiency particularly the impact on the natural attenuation of bacterial and viral pathogens masse dufresne et al 2021 the primary objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics in attenuation efficiency of riverbank filtration for adenoviruses viral indicators and other fecal and microbial indicators with respect to the impact of extreme hydrological events we targeted the predictability of hygienic contamination via individual fecal and or viral indicators and its practical use for monitoring riverbank filtration efficiency correlations between microbiological and physico chemical variables with a focus on water quality parameters were assessed for 16 months water samples were collected from the banks of the rhine river and from various groundwater monitoring wells along an observation transect from the

gradient of 0 2 m km 1 and a median discharge of 2100 m3 s 1 sharma et al 2012 samples were collected between january 2018 and may 2019 during this period the mean river level was 29 5 1 6 m a s l meters above sea level fig 1c thus we assumed river levels above 31 1 m a s l as high flood below 27 9 m a s l as low drought and river levels between 27 9 and 31 1 m a s l as medium river levels in our study river water quality was monitored at a nearby station kilometer 732 1 by the local water authorities the hydrogeology at the site is marked by a shallow quaternary aquifer consisting of heterogeneous sand gravel mixtures d50 0 5 9 4 mm with an effective porosity of 20 and a range in kf values from 2 10 2 to 4 10 3 m s 1 schubert 2002 the aquifer is about 20 m thick and confined below by a tertiary silty fine sand aquitard numerous groundwater monitoring wells surround the riverbank filtration plant eleven wells have been selected for our study because of their locations with increasing distance to the rhine river and the extension to various depths which allowed following the fate of the bank filtrate from the river to one of the production wells pw5 pw5 is part of a well gallery located parallel to the river which forces river water through the riverbank and the shallow aquifer fig 1b the bank filtrate obtained from pw5 was a mixture of water from the well gallery between the river and pw5 two sets of monitoring wells a and b are situated at a horizontal distance of 40 2 and 20 4 m to the production well fig 1c according to schubert 2002 the minimum travel

2010 using the bactiter glo microbial cell viability assay kit promega freshwater samples were analyzed within 3 days after storage at 4 c in the dark additional samples collected between regular intervals were frozen for subsequent analysis with these samples intracellular atp was calculated from measurements of total atp only using the linear relationship between total atp and extracellular atp found in regular groundwater r2 0 40 p 0 05 and river water r2 0 25 p 0 05 samples autoclaved mq water were used as blank for extracellular and total atp analysis 2 2 3 biological indicators the detection and enumeration of e coli and coliforms were performed using the colilert 18 method idexx according to iso 9308 2 1990 the detection and enumeration of clostridium perfringens were performed using the membrane method according to iso 14189 2013 the detection limit for all indicator bacteria was 1 mpn or 1 cfu per 100 ml sample analysis of somatic and f coliphages from 10 l water samples followed the protocol of binder 2013 the titer of infectious coliphages in water samples was determined using the double agar overlay method plaque assay kropinski et al 2009 briefly a solid agar base 10 ml of 1 5 agar w v was overlaid with a mixture of soft agar 4 ml of 0 75 agar w v and 1 ml of a well mixed solution of diluted sample and host bacteria e coli famp for f coliphages and e coli cn 13 for somatic coliphages harvested in the logarithmic growth phase 1 1 v v serial dilutions of samples were incubated at 37 c overnight and quantified in duplicates the detection limit for coliphages was 0 07 pfu per 100 ml 2 2 4 quantification of adenovirus we quantified the free and particle adsorbed fraction containing viruses on and in organic and inorganic particles 0 22 µm of adenovirus particles in water samples adsorbed viruses in 10 l freshwater were first filtered onto 0 22 µm pes filters thermofisher the filtrate containing the fraction of free virus particles was dedicated to a fecl3 addition 2 mg l 1 to concentrate virus particles along with fe precipitation john et al 2011 after 1 h of sedimentation the precipitate was collected on 0 45 µm filters whatman the adsorbed viruses together with microbial biomass collected on 0 22 µm filters and free viruses fe precipitate collected on 0 45 µm filters were both frozen at 80 c for later processing for data analysis virus abundance values from the free and adsorbed fraction were combined the allprep powerviral dna rna kit qiagen was used to extract adenovirus dna for the adsorbed adenovirus fraction small pieces of the 0 22 µm pes filters were directly processed according to the instruction of the manufacturer for the free adenovirus fraction first the iron precipitate was dissolved using an ascorbate buffer john et al 2011 and then the resuspension was concentrated via amicon ultra 15 centrifugal filter units merck the concentrate was then used for dna extraction for quantitative estimation of adenovirus particles a droplet digital pcr ddpcr was applied with the following details in accordance with the digital miqe guidelines huggett 2020 the detection was based on a 131 bp fragment using the primer

number below 8000 were repeated with an additional tenfold dilution for selected samples up to four replicates were performed with an average coefficient of variation of 23 all detections were performed in the same lab and with the same methods based on the initial sample volume and the volume of dna extract used in our study a detection limit between 10 9 and 397 particles l 1 was calculated without taking into account losses during concentration and extraction 2 3 water travel time analysis mean travel times for conservative solute transport from the river to the observation wells as influenced by the river level changes and the pumping rate was estimated from the measured piezometric pressure heads of the observation wells for this we calculated the mean particle velocity in the groundwater on the basis of darcy s law taking the hydraulic gradient between observation wells a1 and b1 v t 1 n k d h t d l 1 n k h a 1 t h b 1 t δ l a 1 b 1 where v t represents the mean particle velocity in the groundwater at time t m d 1 n represents the effective porosity of the aquifer k represents the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer m d 1 dh t dl represents the hydraulic gradient at time t ha 1 t and hb 1 t represent piezometric pressure heads at time t at the observation wells a1 and b1 m and la 1 b 1 represents the distance between wells a1 and b1 m following the modeling results of sharma et al 2012 for the same field site we assumed n 0 2 and k 1 59 10 3 m s 1 assuming flow is only in the direction perpendicular to the river the mean travel time t s t from the river to an observation well at a distance s from the river and time t can be calculated using the following equations s t t s t t v t d t v t v t t s t v t v t d t v t is assumed to be stepwise constant based on the hydraulic gradients available at the sampling dates then the integral v t can be given with v t i 0 j 1 v i d t i v j i 0 j d t i t t i 0 j 1 d t i a n d t i 0 j d

estimate for the travel time since i the distance between the river and the observation wells slightly varies over time due to river level changes ii flow will have a vertical component close to the river groundwater iii our limited sampling frequency prevent us from fully capturing the dynamically changing the hydraulic gradient iv and spatial heterogeneities in n and k are neglected the mean travel time t was calculated for observation wells at a s 40 m b s 60 m and pw5 s 80 m with the river as a reference for the riverside groundwater flow using the hydraulic gradient between observation wells c and oo8 t is also calculated for observation wells c s 17 m from oo8 and pw5 s 35 m from oo8 during the shut off of pw5 in spring 2018 the river level and the groundwater level at well oo8 indicate that natural effluent conditions have returned thus no travel time could be calculated excluding the switch off of pw5 the attenuation efficiency of riverbank filtration for viral and bacterial indicators was evaluated for three hydrological situations i e the high medium and low river levels these hydrological events were categorized by river levels as described in section 2 1 whereas the water samples from the observation wells were categorized according to the hydrological event at the commencement of its underground passage considering the estimated mean travel time figure s2 2 4 statistical analysis all statistics were implemented with software packages in the r environment r foundation http www r project org with the significance level set as α 0 05 differences and similarities in abiotic and biotic variables within and between the individual well rows were tested through kruskal wallis tests kruska test and anova oneway test spearman rank correlation matrices using hmisc package were used to explore relationships between biological abundance of viral and bacterial indicators atp tcc and tvpc and chemical ion concentrations and physico chemical factors ph do ec and temperature the log reduction of biological indicators during riverbank filtration was calculated by comparing the composition of groundwater and river water at different hydrological events figure s2 principal component analysis pca was performed considering the selected biological variables and physico chemical parameters using the prcomp function 3 results 3 1 water level dynamics the river level during the 16 month sampling period showed a typical seasonality with high levels in winter and low levels in summer fig 2 the highest levels were monitored at the beginning of the field study with 33 meter above sea level m a s l lowest river levels 27 3 m a s l were recorded in late october 2018 the groundwater levels in the different observation wells were very similar but dampened dynamic as those in the river fig 2 the river level was always above the groundwater levels indicating infiltrating conditions except for the shutdown period of the waterworks facility 3 2 bank filtration water travel times travel times of the infiltrated river water are strongly related to the river level fig 3 extended travel times occur when the river level is receding over a longer period for example during the regression of the high river level short travel times are caused by sudden river level increases as observed in winter 2018 2019 when pw5 was shut off for maintenance the direction of water flow between the river and the production well could have reversed resulting in groundwater discharge to the river and negative water flow velocities when river levels are medium to low which was the case for most of the year groundwater from the land side area opposite to the river with respect to the extraction well flows toward pw5 passing well oo8 and row c fig 3 during high river levels river water infiltrates far beyond the production well reversing the water flow direction at the land side 3 3 water stable isotope signatures the δ18o values as well as δ2h values figure s3 in river water remained constant throughout the year with only small variations 9 5 0 3 fig 4 a compared with surface water groundwater specific isotopic signatures at oo8 and row c showed higher values from march to november 2018 fig 2 samples taken at oo8 and row c during high water levels showed similar isotope ratios to river water at low river levels only water in rows a b and pw5 contained river water as depicted from the isotope ratios whereas wells opposite to the production well c oo8 contained land side groundwater 3 4 dynamics in physico chemical conditions the river water temperature showed a seasonality with low values down to 3 9 c in winter and high temperatures up to 25 7 c in summer fig 2 the mean river water temperature during the period of sampling was 14 2 c 7 1 c the groundwater temperature at oo8 varied between 10 8 c and 16 6 c 13 7 c 1 6 c at pw5 as recorded between july 2018 and may 2019 the water temperature ranged between 8 6 c and 17 4 c with a mean of 13 4 c 3 0 c ec in the river water showed no significant variation fig 2 with a mean value of 566 61 µs cm 1 groundwater in oo8 had its minimum of 539 µs cm 1 during high river levels and its highest values up to 852 µs cm 1 when disconnected from the river during medium and low water levels the overall pattern of ec in water from the observation wells was consistent with stable water isotope analysis results the ec pattern was also consistent with selected ions exemplarily displayed for ca2 and so4 2 figure s4 generally ph values did not show strong fluctuations during the study but a clear gradient between the river 8 1 0 2 and water in oo8 7 3 0 2 the mean ph value at pw5 was similar to that at oo8 with 7 3 0 1 the do concentration in the water samples exhibited a clear seasonality decreasing with increasing water temperature fig 2 compared with the land side groundwater high do concentrations were observed in river water ranging from 7 3 to 13 5 mg l 1 with a mean of 10 4 1 8 mg l 1 the concentration of do in groundwater at oo8 and pw5 ranged from below detection to 6 9 mg l 1 with a mean of 2 2 1 7 mg l 1 and 3 5 2 3 mg l 1 respectively do decreased as river water passed through the riverbank fig 4f the decline in do was also mirrored to a lesser degree in a decrease in doc figure s3 further distant from the river the doc concentration remained constant noticeably the do concentration in the riverbank filtrate dropped to zero several times during summer however in connection to the local disappearance of do no obvious change in nitrate concentrations was observed figure s3 3 5 dynamics of bacterial indicators the total number of tcc in the river ranged from 3 0 108 to 2 8 109 cells l 1 positively correlated with the water temperature fig 5 as water flows through the riverbank tcc readily declined 16 fold on average between the river and wells in row a although the annual mean values of tcc in water from the different observation wells were in the same order of magnitude there was a significant difference between different locations along the transect to the production well pw5 table s1 the lowest tcc values were observed in groundwater from row c a similar pattern was found with microbial activity atp fig 6 a the highest atp values were found in the river water on average 6 4 10 10 5 2 10 10 m atp decreased not only with distance to the river but also with distance to well oo8 hence the lowest atp was found in water in pw5 2 4 10 12 8 1 10 12 m the fecal indicators e coli and coliforms were frequently detected in river water but only occasionally in water from the observation wells fig 5 there was no obvious trend in the dynamics of e coli or coliforms in the river depending on the season the mean e coli concentration in river water was 803 mpn 100 ml with a large variance 1148 mpn 100 ml only 12 of 283 water samples from the observation wells were positive for e coli and e coli was never found in any of the land side groundwater samples fig 5 the concentration of coliforms in the river was approximately 5 times higher than e coli with an average of 4884 6027 mpn 100 ml coliforms were observed more frequently in water from the observation wells in 83 of 283 samples considering hydrological situations and travel time coliforms were detected in water in pw5 at low river level figure s5 the occurrence of c perfringens in river water did not show a seasonal trend similar to other bacterial indicators compared with e coli and coliforms the average concentration of c perfringens was lower with 197 163 cfu 100 ml c perfringens was also detected in the monitoring wells of row a even when the river was at medium levels in total 38 of 268 water samples from the observation wells were c perfringens positive 3 6 viral indicators a mean of 3 2 1010 1 2 1010 virus particles l 1 was detected in the river which was on average is 23 times higher than the tcc of the same samples and 38 times higher than tvpc in row a the lowest tvpc was found in water samples from row c 5 7 108 3 7 108 virus particles l 1 human enteric adenoviruses were found in the rhine river during the entire sampling period the mean concentration of adenovirus in surface water was 1 2 104 3 0 104 particles l 1 whereas the virus concentration in well a2 was already two to three orders of magnitude lower with 5 8 101 3 6 101 particles l 1 no adenovirus was above the limit of detection lod in the selected samples of well b1 the occurrence of f coliphages and somatic coliphages in the river differed f coliphage concentration was the highest in january 2018 with 12 pfu 100 ml overall with a mean concentration of 2 6 3 8 pfu 100 ml effective attenuation of f coliphages during riverbank filtration was observed between the river and rows a and b only a few samples were detected as positive in wells a2 and b1 in spring 2018 fig 7 no f coliphages were found in groundwater from other wells only 5 of 74 water samples from the observation wells contained active f coliphages above the lod the highest concentration of somatic coliphages detected in the river was 116 pfu 100 ml in february 2019 and other samples exceeding a concentration of 40 pfu 100 ml were detected only in january and december 2018 the mean concentration of active somatic coliphages in river water was 24 1 28 0 pfu 100 ml 9 fold higher than f coliphages only 7 of 74 water samples from the observation wells were positive for somatic coliphages however somatic coliphages were occasionally detected in groundwater at c1 in spring 2018 3 7 river water bank filtrate and groundwater in comparison spearman rank correlation analysis revealed that all biological variables including adenovirus recorded for the riverbank filtration transect are significantly correlated figure s6 noticeably all biological indicators positively correlated with ph and negatively correlated with the travel time furthermore all biological indicators negatively correlated with δ18o and ec except adenovirus the do concentration positively correlates with viral indicators e coli and c perfringens rather than coliforms and tcc the river and groundwater level co varied with three bacterial indicators i e e coli coliforms and c perfringens a covariation was also discovered between tcc tvpc coliforms and temperature the correlation analysis exhibited different patterns when data from surface water and observation wells were analyzed separately for the river samples fewer correlations were obtained although all biological indicators were detected all year round for bacterial indicators the concentration of coliforms correlated with both c perfringens and e coli a positive correlation occurred between the viral indicators f coliphages and somatic coliphages as well as for tvpc and f coliphages however none of the biological variables correlated with the abundance of adenovirus the relationships between the biological indicators in the riverbank filtrate and groundwater were different c perfringens correlated with most of the biological indicators including f coliphages coliforms e coli tcc tvpc and atp additionally the number of coliforms correlated with e coli and tcc the two groups of coliphages did not correlate with each other nonetheless somatic coliphages correlated positively with atp whereas f coliphages correlated with e coli and c perfringens once more no correlation between adenovirus and other biological indicators was found taking a specific look at the correlations between adenovirus and individual physico chemical parameters at different hydrological situations ph was the only variable correlating independent of the hydrological condition the abundance of adenovirus during bank filtration correlated positively with ph elevated doc concentrations found at high river levels correlated positively with an increased abundance of adenovirus at medium river levels several factors i e travel time temperature ph do were found to correlate with adenovirus at low river levels it was only ph and travel time that revealed a statistical significant correlation to adenovirus with respect to other biological indicators adenoviruses correlated with e coli somatic coliphages tcc and tvpc during high river levels with coliforms somatic coliphages atp at medium river levels and with coliforms tvpc and atp at low river levels respectively principal component analyses pca fig 8 depict the spatial and temporal differences within water samples collected from the river and observation wells with respect to the selected physico chemical and biological variables the difference between river water and water from the observation wells was explained by principal components with 47 1 of the total variance and pc2 explained another 17 4 fig 8a although river water had significantly higher concentrations of coliforms e coli c perfringens atp tcc tvpc and doc the riverbank filtrate and groundwater samples were closely clustered in the pca plot fig 8a excluding river samples from the analysis the trend in water samples could be explained by pc1 with 29 5 and pc2 with 19 4 fig 8b pc1 is mainly represented by the distance from the river whereas seasonality represented by temperature and do is the dominant factor for the variance in pc2 3 8 efficiency of riverbank filtration in removing pathogens and fecal indicators we observed that in surface water concentrations of several bacterial and viral indicators i e e coli c perfringens adenovirus f coliphages and somatic coliphages were higher during high river levels flood situation than during low and medium river levels fig 9 the absolute removal efficiency during riverbank filtration in terms of log10 reduction was higher during high river levels than in other hydrological phases for most biological indicators fig 9 however most of the biological indicators could not be detected in the production well pw5 regardless of the hydrological conditions the highest log10 reduction during passage through the riverbank was observed for coliforms 3 7 log10 followed by e coli 3 4 log10 somatic coliphages 3 1 log10 c perfringens 2 5 log10 and f coliphages 2 1 log10 at high river levels the concentration of adenovirus decreased by 3 1 log units between the river and observation well row a it is obvious from our data that the most pronounced removal of viruses and bacteria takes place in the early sediment passage from the river channel to well row a table 1 for this first stretch of sediment passage low river levels had a beneficial effect on the removal of c perfringens tvpc and f coliphages with a reduction of 2 3 log10 1 8 log10 and 0 8 log10 respectively tcc e coli and somatic coliphages were reduced most efficiently at medium water levels by 1 3 log10 2 7 log10 2 4 log10 adenovirus was the only agent that exhibited the highest removal efficiency 3 1 log10 between the river to well row a at high river levels table 1 4 discussions 4 1 attenuation of adenovirus and other viral and bacterial indicators during riverbank filtration in our study we investigated the fate of adenovirus compared with several viral and bacterial fecal indicators during riverbank filtration across a transect of 72 m from the rhine river to the production well of a waterwork facility fig 1 using ddpcr we detected adenovirus all year round in rhine river water at concentrations of 7 1 101 to 1 2 105 particles l 1 although adenovirus could occasionally still be detected in the riverbank filtrate water after 32 m of sediment passage at a2 fig 7 all samples analyzed from the observation well b1 52 m travel distance from the river were adenovirus negative given the lod of approximately 10 particles l 1 consequently we assume the risk of adenovirus contamination at concentrations 1 virus particle l 1 in water at the production well pw5 to be very low however an occasional occurrence at lower concentrations cannot be excluded in agreement with this observation none of the other tested viral indicators such as coliphages were detected in water from the production well and individual bacterial fecal indicators such as c perfringens and coliforms were detected only rarely besides the risk assessment of adenovirus contamination in raw water at the waterworks in duesseldorf germany a major focus of our study was on the suitability of individual viral and bacterial indicators expectedly viral and bacterial indicators when transported through aquatic sediments differ in terms of attenuation including processes such as straining adsorption persistence and decay schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 although straining is considered one of the most important processes for attenuating bacteria it has been shown that it mainly occurs when the ratio of the particles of concern viruses 0 02 0 08 µm bacteria 0 2 2 µm and the medium grain size this study 0 5 to 10 mm is 0 5 bradford et al 2004 as such straining is considered to be negligible for our setting previous studies revealed that total adenovirus particles had the highest persistence decay rate of 0 008 0 027 log10 day 1 followed by other selected indicators i e c perfringens inactivation rate of 0 027 log10 day 1 infectious coliphages inactivation rate of 0 03 1 0 log10 day 1 e coli and coliforms inactivation rate of 0 02 1 5 log10 day 1 when incubated at 15 c in groundwater or autoclaved surface water medema et al 1997 john and rose 2005 ogorzaly et al 2010 moreover the persistence of selected indicators decreases to varying degrees at elevated temperatures the presence of active autochthonous microbes and unsaturated conditions feichtmayer et al 2017 schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 the adsorption of viruses and bacteria is particle specific i e surface charge and hydrophobicity mineral surfaces specific i e surface charge heterogeneity and depends on water chemistry i e ph ionic strength cations and organic matter as summarized in the dlvo derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 therefore even among viruses of a similar size different transport and survival behavior have to be expected and documented a bosch et al 2006 nevertheless numerous studies claim that individual fecal indicators such as e coli can adequately account for bacterial and viral contamination donn et al 2020 love et al 2014 meanwhile at first glance the different indicators tested in our study provided similar information however at a closer look numerous differences are found from the perspective of removal efficiency during the sediment passage from the river to the production well the routinely used indicators coliforms and e coli experienced a stronger reduction i e 3 6 log10 and 2 9 log10 respectively than viral indicators i e somatic coliphages 2 5 log10 f coliphages 1 6 log10 and total viral particles tvpc 1 6 log10 clostridium perfringens performed worse than somatic coliphages 2 3 log10 and the total number of tcc revealed the least reduction 1 4 log10 of all indicators tested the main reduction in viral and bacterial indicators generally takes place in the early sediment passage schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 this is consistent with our findings focusing only on the transect between the rhine river and row a and ignoring various hydrological situations the mean reduction of adenovirus was 2 3 log units which is comparable with the removal of e coli 2 6 log10 coliforms 2 4 log10 and somatic coliphages 2 3 log10 and higher than that of other selected microorganisms a higher spatial resolution would have been advantageous to explore the attenuation pattern i e exponential vs linear reduction in more detail a large range in the reduction of adenovirus from approximately 1 to 5 log units is reported for riverbank filtration of comparable distances 31 92 m from previous studies betancourt et al 2014 verbyla et al 2016 sprenger et al 2014 removal efficiencies are very site specific partinoudi and collins 2007 rohns et al 2006 weiss et al 2003 2005 variations in reduction are mainly caused by the different adenovirus source concentrations sediment properties water residence times and the lod of quantification methods used the same is true for other indicators a reduction of coliphages by 1 9 to 4 4 log units after a sediment infiltration distance of 27 177 m has been documented verbyla et al 2016 weiss et al 2003 2005 rohns et al 2006 note that an approximate 5 log10 reduction of somatic coliphages after only 3 8 m of riverbank passage was reported by sprenger et al 2014 for site water infiltration is not forced by pumping implying the water residence time to be a key factor sprenger et al 2011 the removal efficiency of bacterial fecal indicators i e coliforms e coli and c perfringens during riverbank filtration has been investigated in several studies a reduction of 2 4 log units has frequently been observed for sediment travel distances of 12 55 m and source concentrations 104 pfu 100 ml partinoudi and collins 2007 ren et al 2019 weiss et al 2003 although studies that directly compared the removal efficiency for viral and bacterial pathogens and or indicators are rare bacterial indicators showed a higher reduction level than viral indicators same as found in our study weiss et al 2003 2005 besides specific bacterial and viral indicators we monitored the behavior of tvpc and tcc during riverbank filtration which are variables that have rarely been considered in previous studies especially for the underground passage at field scale compared with adenovirus and other indicators tvpc and tcc exhibited the lowest log removal during the passage of river water to the production well similar to the other indicators most of the removal occurred in the sediment passage between river and well row a a low removal of tvpc and tcc comparable with that in the present study ranging between 1 and 1 7 log10 units after 1 1 m of vertical infiltration and 70 m of horizontal infiltration through aquatic sediments were observed by mindl et al 2015 and fillinger et al 2020 contrary to other more specific indicators tvpc and tcc may contain offspring from microbes and viruses which can replicate in the bank sediment thus they may not be suitable indicators for monitoring attenuation efficiency for pathogens during riverbank filtration who 2017 regarded 10 5 pathogenic viruses l 1 as a safe threshold concentration for drinking water which is six orders of magnitude below our lod for adenovirus 10 particles l 1 there is no routine technique to concentrate viruses from water by greater than or equal to six to seven orders of magnitude pei et al 2012 seidel et al 2016 hence this target quality of riverbank filtration can be evaluated considering the viral load in river water and predicted reduction during riverbank filtration the removal of adenovirus and the viral indicators tested meet the minimum removal for viruses of 2 1 log10 expected in riverbank filtration as stated by who 2017 additionally the reduction of most other targeted bacterial fecal indicators exceeded the minimum removal of 2 log10 for bacteria with the sediment passage from the river to the production well 4 2 correlations between biological indicators and physico chemical variables as human pathogenic viruses cannot propagate in an aquatic environment the abundance of adenovirus in river likely correlates with the fraction of wastewater from the runoff of sewage treatment plants which may be increased during and after heavy rain events passerat et al 2011 and low river level periods karakurt et al 2019 concretely our study revealed increased numbers of coliphages in river water at high levels when compared with other hydrological conditions note that there was a strong negative correlation between the number of cultivable coliphages and river water temperature suggesting that low temperatures experienced during high river levels may have favored virus survival as viruses generally experience thermal destabilization and gradation of the viral capsid when exposed to higher temperatures john and rose 2005 additionally low temperatures reduce the activity of antagonistic microbes and biological mechanisms contributing to virus survival gordon and toze 2003 yates et al 1990 tcc and tvpc mainly reflecting the autochthonous microbes and viruses exhibited a higher density at high temperatures resulting in a high concentration in river water during low river levels tcc was also positively correlated with temperature as reported in a previous study by liu et al 2013 furthermore we observed a negative correlation between c perfringens and ec in river water heavy rainfall accompanied by high river levels with low ec in river water due to dilution effects has the potential to mobilize adsorbed microorganisms from river bed sediments and soils of the catchment landry et al 1979 moreover albeit a high concentration of coliforms in river water was observed at low river levels no correlation with any drought specific physico chemical parameter was found noticeably the occurrence and abundance of adenovirus in the river water and bank filtrate did not correlate with any of the bacterial and viral indicators monitored nor with any of the physico chemical parameters tested thus based on the fate of fecal bacterial indicators e coli coliforms viral surrogates coliphages tcc and tvpc it would not have been possible to predict the occurrence and abundance of pathogenic viruses in either river water or bank filtrate 4 3 impact of hydrological extremes on riverbank filtration efficiency another focus of our study was the effect of different river levels on the transport and reduction of adenovirus and viral and bacterial fecal indicators during riverbank filtration the water travel time through bank sediments is a complex function of parameters including hydraulic conductivity of subsurface sediments pumping rate at the production well land side groundwater levels and river stages expectedly with longer travel times all selected biological indicators were reduced this correlation supports the typical hypothesis that a decrease in travel time caused by short termed increases of the river stage increases the risk of viruses reaching the production well vice versa at slow changing and generally low river levels reduced water flow velocity and increased water residence time can be assumed improving removal efficiency for pathogenic agents high river levels are believed to impair the natural water purification efficiency in riverbank filtration mainly due to potentially elevated concentrations of viruses and bacteria in surface water a reduced travel time and less dilution with groundwater in our study concretely most of the targeted viral and microbial indicators either showed the highest concentrations in surface water during flood events or concentrations were in the same range in all hydrological situations we found travel times from the rhine river to the production well of less than 10 days at high river levels compared to maximum travel times of up to 78 days mean travel time was 31 days previous studies and well established raw water protection schemes recommend a mean water travel time of 10 60 days to be sufficient for efficiently removing pathogenic viruses and bacteria worth mentioning based on our δ18o data we can show that water from the production well entirely originated from the river at high water levels while the river water share was 84 and 77 during medium and low water levels respectively furthermore at times of high river levels a full sediment passage from the river to the production well was required to efficiently remove the tested biological indicators whereas under other hydrological situations particularly during low river levels a sediment passage from the river to the nearby observation wells at row a was already sufficient to reduce most targeted indicators to below the lod another aspect related to high river level situations was raised by irmscher and teermann 2002 who claimed that low activity filter media do not remove pathogens efficiently and as the river level rises the infiltrating surface water reaches unsaturated subsoil zones unconditioned for effective natural attenuation additionally factors including low ionic strength elevated doc and high flow velocities caused by floods may not only lower the adsorption of microorganisms and viruses to the sediment matrix significantly decreasing the attenuation capacity of riverbank filtration but also trigger a remobilization of previously adsorbed bacteria and viruses promoting their long distance underground transport sprenger et al 2011 maliva 2019 the highest removal efficiency for adenovirus and most viral and bacterial indicators tested in our study was observed during high river levels following the above mentioned findings and assumptions this is surprising however the data obtained are worth a second look the higher removal efficiency for pathogens and indicators by riverbank filtration during high river levels are related to higher absolute numbers of respective agents in river water during flood situations fig 9 in fact high coliform and coliphage numbers in combination with high water levels as reported by rohns et al 2006 could indeed pose a serious risk to water quality at the production well exceeding the capacity of riverbank filtration taking a specific look to the different hydrological situations the abundance of adenovirus during bank filtration correlated positively with ph supporting the idea that virus particles attach to a lesser extent at a higher ph due to increased electrostatic repulsion according to the dvlo theory schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 elevated doc concentrations found at high river levels correlated positively with an increased abundance of adenovirus in fact dissolved organic matter was shown to compete with viruses for sorption sites on sediment surfaces gerba 1984 at low river levels it was only ph and travel time that revealed a statistical significant correlation to adenovirus no common biological indicators were found to correlate with the abundance of adenovirus during sediment passage at different river levels while at high river level adenoviruses correlated with e coli somatic coliphages tcc and tvpc a correlation with coliforms tvpc and atp was revealed at low river levels in consequence for the site investigated a combination of e coli coliforms and coliphages seems safe to monitor raw water quality the only contamination of raw water at the production well was the occasional occurrence of coliforms and c perfringens during the long period of extremely low river levels in the summer of 2018 low river levels entail the risk of river bed sediment clogging here clogging includes excessive biomass accumulation sedimentation of accumulated suspended particles and precipitation of mn4 or fe3 after consumption of do and denitrification sprenger et al 2011 engesgaard et al 2006 diem et al 2013 clogging may not only reduce the bank filtrate quantity but may also lead to preferential flow paths and impaired removal efficiency of pathogens and microbiological indicators jaramillo 2011 conversely an increased number of fine particles and iron oxide minerals may constitute an effective barrier leading to an increased adsorption of viruses schijven and hassanizadeh 2000 additionally viruses and bacteria have been demonstrated to be less inactivated and removed under anoxic conditions which we have observed during the long term drought when compared with oxic conditions klitzke et al 2015 frohnert et al 2014 thus we summarize that both high river levels with reduced sediment travel times for water carrying a huge particle load and low water levels with increased water temperature and the risk of bank sediment clogging may pose a risk to raw water quality at the production well this conclusion is supported by earlier findings of rohns et al 2006 who investigated the same riverbank filtration site 5 conclusion in this study we compared the performance of a riverbank filtration site for the removal of adenovirus and several commonly used bacterial and viral water quality indicators during different hydrological situations surprisingly high river levels were characterized not only by an increased number of pathogens and indicators but also by the highest removal efficiency with riverbank filtration during drought and low river levels coliforms and c perfringens were occasionally present in raw water at the production well of the waterworks adenovirus quantified via droplet digital pcr correlated with e coli somatic coliphages tcc tvpc ph and doc at high river levels at low river levels adenoviruses correlated with coliforms tvpc ph and water travel time for the site investigated a combination of e coli coliforms and coliphages for assessing raw water quality was proved safe for adenovirus and probably other human pathogenic viruses viral fecal indicators such as coliphages may occasionally fail predictability as shown for low river levels which is an issue that awaits a more detailed exploration extreme hydrological events and their influence on the performance of riverbank filtration should be studied on an event to event basis at a significantly higher spatial and temporal resolution this is a difficult task because flood and drought periods cannot be precisely forecasted when planning a field study finally there is an urgent need for lower lods of pathogenic viruses in natural waters since molecular tools such as the ddpcr cannot be significantly improved the pre concentration of viral particles from larger

16431,the synthesized catalyst nitrogen doped multi walled carbon nanotubes n mwcnts were introduced into membrane technology for peroxymonosulfate pms activation the enhanced permeability of the n mwcnts modified membrane might be attributed to the increase in hydrophilicity and membrane porosity the catalytic degradation and membrane filtration performance for the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system in treating different types of natural waters were evaluated the removal of phenol by the n mwcnts modified membrane was 83 67 in 2 min which was greater than the phenol removal by the virgin membrane 3 39 and n mwcnt powder 41 42 respectively moreover the resultant membrane coupled with pms activation exhibited outstanding removal effects on the fluorescent organics in the secondary effluent and songhua river water the combination effectively reduced the total membrane fouling caused by the secondary effluent songhua river water and three typical model organics by 28 19 61 98 electron paramagnetic resonance and classical quenching tests presented that the active species so4 oh and 1o2 and other non radical processes generated by n mwcnts activated pms decreased the foulants deposition on the membrane surface meanwhile the membrane interception accelerated the aggregation of pollutants and pms towards the membrane surface through applied pressure facilitating their mass transfer to the n mwcnts surface for the catalysis exerted more effectively this study demonstrated the potential application of the coupling of n mwcnts catalytic oxidation and the uf which offers a promising prospect to improve the permeate quality and simultaneously overcome the membrane fouling barriers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrafiltration uf nitrogen doped multi walled carbon nanotube catalytic membrane natural organic matter nom membrane fouling peroxymonosulfate activation 1 introduction with the development of water purification technology membrane separation technology has been broadly applied in drinking water supply and advanced wastewater treatment systems liu et al 2019 talvitie et al 2017 among them the ultrafiltration uf membrane is one of the most attractive with low transmembrane pressure stable operation and without the need for additional chemicals liao et al 2020 however membrane fouling and inferior retention to organic micro pollutants with low molecular weight and high toxicity are critical obstructions for the broad application of the uf membrane in water treatment tian et al 2018 natural organic matter nom has been found to be responsible for membrane fouling in which high molecular weight polysaccharides and proteinaceous substances are known to be major foulants cheng et al 2019 these substances that ubiquitously exist in actual water including natural surface water and secondary effluent can readily form a loose cake layer and impermeable gel layer resulting in the blockage of membrane pores a common approach to alleviate the above mentioned problems is the advanced oxidation process aop wan et al 2019 in recent years the sulfate radical based so4 advanced oxidation process has attracted increasing attentions due to its wider ph range ph 1 9 higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 v versus nhe longer half life and stronger selectivity towards pollutants asif et al 2021 bao et al 2019 wan et al 2019 it was generally considered that so4 can be generated from peroxymonosulfate pms activated by a variety of methods such as transition metal ions wang et al 2020a uv irradiation hammouda et al 2018 ultra sonication lee et al 2021 and so on however the high energy input of physical techniques e g uv irradiation and ultra sonication and the leaching and toxic effects of homogeneous transition metal ions restrains their extensive application it has been found that novel carbon based nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes cnts activated carbon ac graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 etc can effectively activate pms having good catalytic performance and environmental safety adil et al 2020 ding et al 2020 gao et al 2018 cnts are materials with a conjugated π network composed of carbon

conducive to electron transfer inducing the nonradical degradation pathway li et al 2020 ye et al 2020 in addition the introduction of some heteroatoms such as n p and s into the carbon framework of cnts was found to be an efficient method to further upgrade the catalytic performance in activating pms li et al 2017 duan et al successfully synthesized nitrogen doped single welled carbon nanotubes nocnts and characterized their catalytic efficiency in pms activation for phenol degradation nocnts exhibited a strong catalytic capacity and their degradation rate was 16 9 and 15 6 times superior to those of α mno2 and co3o4 respectively duan et al 2015 commonly pms activation by cnts nano catalyst is utilized as a pretreatment prior to membrane filtration in feed water which mitigates membrane fouling caused by organic matters cheng et al 2021 nevertheless several drawbacks including the agglomeration between cnts and the problem of hard to recycle still exist resulting in low mass transfer efficiency and limited available active sites liu et al 2020 to address these problems a catalytic membrane by coupling the nano catalysts on the membrane surface has been widely studied wang et al 2020b the integrating of aops and membrane filtration showed complementarity in which the presence of membrane as a catalyst carrier increased the mass transfer efficiency to the catalyst and effectively exerted its catalytic ability meanwhile the active species generated by advanced oxidation on the membrane surface could degrade the pollutants and alleviate the membrane fouling recently numerous studies have also focused on the coupling technology of membrane separation and advanced oxidation pan et al 2019 the catalytic ceramic membrane coated with mno2 co3o4 nanoparticles was fabricated which achieved great removal of benzophenone 3 and reduction in toxicity of the permeate guo et al 2016 a biomimetic polydopamine and zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 modified

above mentioned existing catalytic membrane cnts catalytic membrane have the advantages of high cost effectiveness li et al 2017 no environmental problem of toxic metal leaching rathinavel et al 2021 and unique catalytic potential for pms activation cheng et al 2021 however coupling cnts with membrane to activate pms for natural waters treatment has been rarely reported in this study nitrogen doped multiwalled carbon nanotube n mwcnts was synthesized and immobilized on the surface of uf membrane to enhance the removal of the organic matters and alleviate membrane fouling the effect of the introduction of catalyst on the morphology chemical composition and permeability of the n mwcnts modified membrane was determined the main aims of this work were a to integrate catalyst n mwcnts with the membrane in a facile and efficient method b to investigate the catalytic degradation and membrane filtration performance of the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system c to evaluate the applicability of the n mwcnts modified membrane in different types of natural waters furthermore the mechanism of the interplay between the foulants and membranes in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system was explained and analyzed the results were expected to illustrate the feasibility of coupling catalyst n mwcnts and membrane filtration to enhance the permeate quality and control the membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents mwcnts with an outer diameter of 5 15 nm and a length of 10 30 μm were obtained from the jiangsu xianfeng nanomaterial technology co ltd china other chemicals and reagents were listed in the supplementary material all chemicals and solvents were used without further purification unless otherwise specified 2 2 feed water ha bsa and sa were chosen for preparing the model solution to represent humic substances proteins and polysaccharides in natural waters respectively and the concentrations were all 20 mg l to better simulate natural water 1 0 mmol l cacl2 nacl and nahco3 were added to the three model solutions and the ph values of the solutions were maintained at about 7 0 the natural surface water was taken from songhua river in harbin heilongjiang province china the secondary effluent before uv disinfection treatment used in this study was taken from the xinyi wastewater treatment plant in harbin heilongjiang china before the experiments the collected water samples were pre filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose ester membrane to remove the microorganisms and suspended particles 2 3 experimental setup a generalized schematic representation of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 1 the experimental setup consists of a nitrogen gas bottle electronic balance data acquisition system filtration cell electronic balance and pressure control device uf experiments were carried out in a filtration cell amicon 8400 millipore corp usa at a constant drive pressure of 0 3 bar supplied by the compressed n2 connected to the water reservoir the experiments were performed in dead end mode at room temperature 20 2 c the volume of the filtration cell is 400 ml which can be expanded to 3000 ml through an external pressure water storage device the filtrate was weighted by an electronic balance and the output data was automatically recorded by an online computer with a data acquisition system every 5 s the membranes were placed at the bottom of the filtration cell for each experiment 2 4 preparation and characterization of n mwcnts incorporated membranes first the catalyst n mwcnts for membrane modification was prepared specifically 1 g commercial mwcnts were dissolved in 100 ml of nitric acid followed by stirring at the temperature of 100 c for 4 h afterward the metal free mwcnts were filtered out from nitric acid washed several times with ultrapure water and dried in an oven at 60 c overnight the obtained mwcnt powder omwcnts was mixed with the mixture 100 ml with methanol and water to get a homogeneous suspension 1 g of melamine was added to the metal free mwcnts ethanol suspension stirred at 100 c to evaporate the ethanol and water the dried mixture was placed into a tube furnace to anneal at 700 c for 1 h under an n2 40 ml min atmosphere then the sample was repeatedly washed with ultrapure water and ethanol several times and dried in an oven at 60 c overnight to obtain nitrogen doped mwcnts named n mwcnts mwcnts and n mwcnts were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and x ray diffraction xrd the adsorption and catalytic activity of the n mwcnts were assessed by the removal of phenol the reaction was carried out in a 500 ml beaker with stirring at 400 rpm equipped with an automatic temperature control system the reaction temperature was controlled to 20 c first the uniform dispersion was prepared by adding 4 5 mg of n mwcnts into 300 ml of deionized water and sonicating for 30 min after dissolving the phenol and pms into this dispersion the samples 1 ml were taken at regular intervals the samples taken from a mixture containing phenol and pms were utilized to assess the catalytic activity of n mwcnts the samples withdrawn from the mixture containing only phenol but not pms were used to evaluate the adsorption property of n mwcnts the sample taken out was filtered out the impurities with a 0 22 μm membrane and then transferred to a vial containing 0 5 ml of methanol to quench the reaction the samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 lc with a spherisorb s5 ods2 column using uv detection at a wavelength of 270 nm two types of mwcnts including commercial mwcnts and synthetic n mwcnts were utilized to prepare catalytic membranes the commercial mwcnts coated membrane is denoted as mwcnts modified membrane the resultant membrane coated with n mwcnts is referred to as n mwcnts modified membrane the membranes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem atomic force microscopy afm attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy and x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps details of membrane preparation and characterization equipment information was shown in the supplementary material s3 2 5

wavelength versus emission wavelength versus fluorescence intensity electron paramagnetic resonance epr a200 brucker usa and classical radical quenching tests were used to investigate the catalytic mechanism of the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system details in the supplementary material s3 2 6 fouling tests the fouling resistance of the membranes during operation was calculated based on resistance in series model to evaluate the membrane fouling behavior wang et al 2017 as shown in eqs 1 3 1 j δ p μ r t 2 r t r m r r r i r 3 r f r r r i r where j is the permeation flux l m2 h δ p is

the composition and chemical states xps was utilized to analyze the two types of mwcnts and the results are presented in fig 2 a b as seen in fig 2 a the strong characteristic peaks of the materials at 284 8 399 2 and 531 2 ev are attributed to the binding energy of c 1 s n 1 s and o 1 s respectively the appearance of the n 1 s peak of the n mwcnts at 399 2 ev suggested the successful introduction of nitrogen elements into the commercial mwcnts in addition the nitrogen and oxygen levels were increased to 1 14 6 88 atom on n mwcnts after high temperature treatment respectively the n 1 s core level spectra of n mwcnts are showed in fig 2 b the catalytic performance of mwcnts is directly related to the degree of the doping of nitrogen atoms which can be found in the publication sun et al 2013 four peaks with binding energies of 398 2 399 9 401 2 and 403 5 ev corresponding to the pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and nitric oxide respectively in which the percentage of graphitic nitrogen affected the catalytic effect of the catalyst duan et al 2015 sem images xrd patterns and ftir of the catalysts are displayed in fig s1 s2 3 1 2 characterization of the membranes sem and afm were utilized to analyze the top surface and cross section of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane as shown in fig 3 a the membrane pores of the virgin membrane were evenly distributed on the surface of the membrane the surfaces of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes were completely covered by carbon nanotube leading to the pores of the underneath support membrane invisible the mwcnts modified membrane exhibited a rougher surface in which larger agglomerates formed by commercial mwcnts could be observed fig 3 b the surface of the n mwcnts modified membrane was smoother than that of the mwcnts modified membrane which was attributed to the reduced size and fewer aggregates of the modified mwcnts the cross sectional image of virgin membrane showed an asymmetric porous structure fig 3 d by contrast for the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes a boundary line between the coating and the underlying membrane surface can be clearly seen the coating thickness of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes were almost the same with values of 22 78 μm and 23 56 μm respectively the surface roughness of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes was characterized by afm as can be seen from fig 3 g i the virgin membrane exhibited a smooth surface while the roughness of the modified membranes was much greater than that of virgin membrane table 1 presents that the contact angle and overall porosity of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane compared with the virgin membrane 66 7 water contact angles of the mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane declined moreover the modified membranes exhibited greater overall porosity the chemical structures of the three types of membranes are explored by the xps and zeta potential characterizations more detailed descriptions are presented in section s4 of the supplementary material the results of pure water fluxes of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane are showed in fig 4 as can be seen the pure water fluxes of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes were 482 and 455 lmh bar respectively which were about 15 and 8 greater than that of the virgin membrane 419 lmh bar the augment in water flux of the modified membrane was due to the improved hydrophilicity and membrane porosity which was conducive to the formation of more hydrogen bonds with water molecules facilitating the transport of water molecules akhtar et al 2019 chara et al 2009 3 2 catalytic performance of the membranes 3 2 1 effects of experimental conditions on catalytic performance of the membranes the catalyst loading pms concentration and ph value of the mixed solution are important factors affecting the catalytic performance of the composite membrane asif et al 2021 for a detailed description of the effect of these experimental conditions on the catalytic performance of the membrane see supplementary material s5 the optimized loading amount of catalyst for the composite membrane was determined to be 0 1 mg cm2 the pms concentration in the system was set as 0 2 mm moreover the phenol removal efficiency reached the highest when the ph was adjusted to neutral ph 7 3 2 2 the phenol removal the phenol removal of the three types of membranes was compared to investigate the effect of the modification of the membrane on the activation ability of pms based on the above optimized experimental conditions before the experiment static adsorption was carried out on the three types of membranes for 60 min to achieve adsorption equilibrium as seen in fig 5 the concentration of phenol showed a trend of decreasing as the reaction proceeded the virgin membrane had almost no effect on the removal of phenol which was due to the much smaller size of phenol compared with that of virgin membrane resulting in ineffective membrane pore interception the phenol removal of the mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane was greater than that of the virgin membrane which was attributed to the catalytic ability on the membrane surface compared with the mwcnts modified membrane the n mwcnts modified membrane exhibited the highest phenol removal which reached 100 within 6 min to further explain the above phenomenon the phenol degradation of the same amounts of nanocarbon materials was comparatively investigated and the results are shown in fig 6 in this experiment the treated water was all 300 ml phenol solutions in which the concentrations of phenol and pms were 10 mg l and 5 mm respectively the total amount of catalyst n mwcnts used in each system was 4 5 mg in the n mwcnts powder system activated by pms 4 5 mg n mwcnts were dispersed into a 300 ml phenol solution the phenol removal reached 100 in 40 min of this system furthermore 4 5 mg n mwcnts were coated on the uf membrane of 45 cm2 to form the n mwcnts modified membrane under static conditions membrane immersed in 300 ml phenol solution containing pms without pressure driving the phenol removal was only about 40 which was far inferior to that in the n mwcnts modified membrane filtration pms system in summary the catalyst integrated on the membrane filtration better exerted its catalytic performance a similar phenomenon in which the catalytic efficiency of the membrane catalyst layer was higher than that of the same amount of catalyst powder has been reported ma et al 2020 3 2 3 the organic foulants removal to further explore the catalytic performance of the modified membrane the removals of organic pollutants in actual water secondary effluent and songhua river water were investigated the fluorescent organic matters in natural water detected by eems are the crucial components causing the membrane fouling in this study four statistically significant fluorescent peaks a d were obtained from actual water by parafac analysis table 2 displays the corresponding properties of the four fluorescent peaks the fluorescence eem spectra of each sample of the secondary effluent are shown in fig 7 in comparison to the raw water the reduction of the fluorophores in the permeate obtained by the three types of membranes indicated that these membranes played a certain role in the removal of fluorescent organics in the secondary effluent to quantitatively interpret the spectrum the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component in the feed and permeate are extracted and summarized in table s2 after filtration by the n mwcnts modified membrane the maximum fluorescence intensity of aromatic protein like substances tryptophan protein like substances fulvic like substances and humic like substances decreased by 99 72 90 19 77 97 and 80 28 respectively the obvious reduction of the peak values of each component demonstrated that the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system exhibited significant removal efficiency of organic matters in the secondary effluent the removal effect of three types of membranes on the fluorescent organics in songhua river water was investigated and the results are presented in fig 8 and table s3 the virgin membrane only reduced slightly the fluorescence intensity of peaks a and b protein like substances due to the rejection ability of membrane pores for the n mwcnts modified membrane all peak intensities were efficiently decreased from 4 7 98 8 368 3 and 253 7 of raw water to 5 1 32 5 293 5 and 192 7 respectively the results suggested that the synergistic effects between the retention ability of the membrane pores and the catalytic oxidation of the n mwcnts pms synergistic made a tremendous contribution to organic foulants removal in songhua river water compared with the virgin membrane the greater removal efficiency for all organic components of the n mwcnts modified membrane indicated that the n mwcnts catalyst on the membrane rather than the membrane pores played the most important role 3 3 membrane filtration performance 3 3 1 the model organic foulants the flux curves of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane on ha fouling are presented in fig 9 a the flux decline of the virgin membrane was most severe with a reduction of 63 08 of the initial flux at the end of filtration the accumulation of ha contaminants on the surface and pore wells of the virgin membrane resulting in a decreased membrane flux and serious membrane fouling the flux decline of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes was lower than that of the virgin membrane with the final values of 72 01 and 87 84 of the initial flux respectively compared with the virgin membrane and mwcnts modified membrane the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system exhibited a significant mitigation effect on the membrane fouling caused by ha fig 9 b illustrates the fouling resistance distributions of the three types of membranes the specific resistance of membrane fouling represents the ratio of the reversible resistance irreversible resistance and the total membrane fouling to the intrinsic membrane resistance in the process of membrane fouling deng et al 2020 the specific total fouling resistance r t r m of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane was 156 87 138 30 and 109 89 respectively these results showed that the modified membrane catalytically degraded the fouling deposited on the membrane surface with the participation of pms reducing the total membrane fouling resistance moreover the incorporation of n mwcnts dramatically decreased reversible and irreversible fouling with the values of the specific reversible resistance r r r m and specific irreversible resistance r i r r m reduced from 37 50 and 19 38 of the virgin membrane to 7 71 and 2 17 respectively the primary reason of membrane fouling caused by ha is the hydrophobic interaction between ha molecules and the membrane surface bai et al 2015 the n mwcnts modified membrane activated pms to decompose and mineralize the ha on the membrane surface thereby alleviating the membrane fouling caused by ha the mechanisms of membrane fouling mitigation will be further discussed in section 3 4 the effects of surface modification of the membrane on the bsa fouling are illustrated in fig 9 c at the beginning of filtration 50 ml the flux of the virgin membrane rapidly dropped to 81 44 of the initial flux and then the flux curve became smooth the finial normalized fluxes of the mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane were 61 77 and 87 32 respectively which were greater than the virgin membrane 53 50 similar to ha fouling the bsa fouling of the membrane modified with n mwcnts was dramatically alleviated it can be seen from fig 9 d that r t r m of the n mwcnts modified membrane was 114 52 which was lower than that of the virgin membrane 186 91 and the mwcnts modified membrane 161 90 during filtration of bsa the resistance of the virgin membrane was primarily concentrated in the irreversible fouling caused by the blockage of the membrane pores the r i r r m of the n mwcnts modified membrane dropped from 68 05 of the virgin membrane to 2 83 indicating that pms activation by n mwcnts catalyst on the membrane surface played an important role in mitigation of the bsa irreversible fouling oxidation reduced the stability of the organics adsorbed on the membrane which made the foulants readily eluted during the cleaning process leading to greater control of irreversible membrane fouling as shown in fig 9 e the flux decrease of three types of membranes caused by sa was assessed both the virgin membrane and mwcnts modified membrane displayed a significant flux decline the terminal normalized fluxes were reduced to 25 78 and 31 32 respectively in comparison the normalized flux of the n mwcnts modified membrane was improved with the final value of 67 80 indicating that the membrane modified by n mwcnts had an excellent mitigation effect on membrane fouling caused by sa the reversibility of bsa fouling of three types of membranes was analyzed and the results are depicted in fig 9 f the r t r m of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane were 387 94 319 27 and 147 48 respectively the higher r t r m demonstrated that the membrane fouling caused by sa was more severe than that by bsa and ha which is consistent with previously reported results sun et al 2018b the major fouling of all the membranes was reversible fouling which was due to the greater resistance of the cake layer formed by hydrophilic sa than that by hydrophobic ha and bsa zhang et al 2018 the r r r m of the n mwcnts modified membrane decreased from 287 41 of the virgin membrane to 47 04 which indicated that membrane modification alleviated the reversible fouling caused by sa thus realizing the control of membrane fouling in summary n mwcnts modified membrane exhibited outstanding effects on alleviating membrane fouling of three model organic foulants and each of them had reduced fouling resistance 3 3 2 the secondary effluent the existence of the great difference between the natural water and the artificial water of the laboratory is due to the complicated components of the natural water such as many kinds of ions and natural organic matters to comprehensively investigate the filtration performance of the n mwcnts modified membrane it is necessary to conduct membrane fouling experiments with natural waters secondary effluent and songhua river water as feed water the flux variations and fouling resistances in the systems of virgin membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane with pms by the filtration of the secondary effluent are illustrated in fig 10 a b as illustrated in fig 10 a the virgin membrane exhibited a more severe flux decline with reductions of about 45 70 and 44 57 during the first and second filtration cycles respectively for the n mwcnts modified membrane the normalized fluxes at the end of the two filtration cycles were 87 51 and 78 75 respectively which were significantly superior to those of the virgin membrane the fouling reversibility of the virgin and n mwcnts modified membranes was analyzed and the various resistances are presented in fig 10 b the r t of the n mwcnts modified membrane was much less than that of the virgin membrane in all two cycles compared with the virgin membrane the r i r r t of the n mwcnts modified membrane in the two filtration cycles decreased by 56 85 and 10 55 the improvement of the reversible fouling of the n mwcnts modified membrane was more obvious and the proportions of reversible fouling in the two cycles were 89 37 and 72 76 lower than those of the virgin membrane respectively these results demonstrated that surface modification strikingly alleviated the membrane fouling caused by secondary effluent especially the reversible fouling 3 3 3 the songhua river water the surface water collected from the songhua river was employed to investigate the filtration property of the n mwcnts modified membrane on natural water since the water quality standard for drinking water sources limits the concentration of sulfate ions the pms concentration in songhua river water was reduced to 20 of the secondary effluent in this study during filtration of songhua river water the flux curves of the virgin membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane are shown in fig 10 c the flux decline of the virgin membrane was relatively severe with a reduction of about 31 00 and 32 82 of the initial flux at the end of the first and second filtration cycles respectively in comparison the normalized terminal fluxes in the two cycles of the n mwcnts modified membrane increased to 65 21 and 47 67 indicating that the modified membrane showed better filtration performance even in the case of low oxidant concentration the membrane fouling resistance distribution of the virgin membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane is presented in fig 10 d the surface modification of the membrane dramatically decreased the reversible fouling and the reversible fouling resistance of the n mwcnts modified membrane was reduced to 32 58 and 40 35 of the virgin membrane in two filtration cycles however the surface modification was ineffective in mitigating the irreversible fouling which may be due to the less oxidant in the songhua river water experiment meanwhile the major foulant in songhua river water is ha guo et al 2020 which is easily blocked in the pores of the modified membrane and cause the irreversible fouling 3 4 mechanisms of enhanced catalytic performance and fouling mitigation the above results indicated that the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system exhibited enhanced organics removal efficiency and remarkable membrane fouling mitigation to better understand the excellent properties of the n mwcnts modified membrane the mechanism of the interplay between foulants and membranes in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system was discussed since size exclusion is the primary mechanism of the uf membrane for the removal of pollutants toxic micro contaminants smaller than the pore size are facile to pass directly through the membrane moreover the deposition of foulants on the membrane surface readily formed the cake gel layer resulting in reduced flux and increased energy consumption so the virgin membrane showed relatively inferior membrane performance the n mwcnts modified membrane was coupled with pms activation which overcame the drawback of membrane filtration since n mwcnts on the modified membrane activated pms to generate active species with strong oxidation capability thereby degrading organic pollutants that are toxic and easily cause membrane fouling the determination of active species is helpful for the explanation of the reaction mechanism in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system the epr was utilized to probe the generation of active species using dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agent of radical and 1o2 respectively fig 11 a c e show that so4 and oh were detected in both mwcnts modified membrane pms system and n mwcnts modified membrane pms system at 1 3 and 5 min the greater epr relative intensity of the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system demonstrated its stronger ability to generate radicals the adducts combined with temp and 1o2 displayed the three line epr spectrum with equal intensities which suggested the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system produced 1o2 as seen in fig 11 b d f classical quenching experiment was conducted to identify the major role of each active species in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system different scavengers such as methanol and ffa were employed to capture radicals and 1o2 as shown in fig 12 a the degradation efficiency of the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system decreased from 100 to 90 after the addition of methanol indicating that radicals accounted for a small proportion in the system approximately 10 fig 12 b presents the behavior of phenol degradation on the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system in the presence of ffa when ffa was added to the reaction solution the degradation efficiency reduced to 70 suggesting 1o2 contributed 30 to the overall degradation it is speculated the existence of other nonradical processes such as formed n mwcnts pms complex and direct electron transfer played the dominant role 60 in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system ding et al 2021 guan et al 2017 ren et al 2020 the occurrence of these radical and non radical processes was attributed to the significant role of graphite n of n mwcnts loaded on the membrane surface in the activation of pms duan et al 2015 the abundant s electrons with p electrons in the π orbitals of carbon nanotubes may exhibit great chemical activities which is conducive to electron transport to pms as electron acceptors sun et al 2018a the generated active species with strong oxidation potential can depolymerize contaminants into smaller and less toxic fragments which can pass through the membrane pores and prevent the formation of a cake gel layer on the membrane surface the presence of the catalytic layer accelerated the degradation of organic pollutants and reduced the probability of foulants contacting the membrane pores resulting in less deposition of fouling on the membrane surface and pores as depicted in scheme 1 in addition the support membrane with metal free catalysts provided more uniform active sites for foulants adsorption and degradation which more effectively exerted the catalytic efficiency of n mwcnts the membrane filtration accelerated the aggregation of pollutants and pms to the membrane surface through applied pressure facilitating their mass transfer to the n mwcnts surface for enhanced pms activation it has been reported that the catalytic efficiency of the membrane catalyst layer was much greater than that of the same amount of catalyst powder ma et al 2020 in this case the enhancement of the pms utilization ratio led to a more efficient generation of active species with strong oxidation therefore the pms activation by n mwcnts and membrane filtration were synergistic and complementary in membrane filtration and pms activation integrated process the presence of membranes can not only enhance the catalytic efficiency of n mwcnts but also intercept non degradable contaminants in pms activation ensuring the safety of the effluent meanwhile the active species generated by pms activation reduced the pollutants deposition on the membrane thereby alleviating the membrane fouling and improving the filtration efficiency 4 conclusion this study investigated the coupling technology of n mwcnts catalytic oxidation and membrane filtration was investigated to eliminate pollutants organics and micro pollutants in water and control uf membrane fouling caused by nom the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hydrophilicity of the n mwcnts modified membrane was much greater than that of the virgin membrane the graphitic nitrogen that enhanced the catalytic effect was detected on the n mwcnts modified membrane which was 20 2 of the total doped nitrogen the n mwcnts modified membrane showed slightly increased permeability and superior catalytic performance 2 the removal of phenol by the n mwcnts modified membrane was about 90 which was much higher than that by the virgin membrane 2 4 moreover the n mwcnts modified membrane exhibited a great removal effect on the fluorescent organics in the secondary effluent and songhua river water which demonstrated the strong potential of the modified membrane in water treatment applications 3 the n mwcnts modified membrane coupled with pms activation possessed the excellent self cleaning ability to mitigate membrane fouling caused by three typical organic model foulants songhua river water and secondary effluent 4 the reason for the superior filtration performance of the resultant membrane is that the combination of n mwcnts on the membrane and pms greatly degraded the pollutants thereby alleviating the membrane fouling meanwhile the presence of membranes enhanced the catalytic efficiency of n mwcnts and ensured the safety of the effluent 5 active species so4 oh and 1o2 were detected in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system in addition to radicals and 1o2 contributing 10 and 30 to the overall degradation other non radical processes such as formed n mwcnts pms complex and direct electron transfer existed in the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16431,the synthesized catalyst nitrogen doped multi walled carbon nanotubes n mwcnts were introduced into membrane technology for peroxymonosulfate pms activation the enhanced permeability of the n mwcnts modified membrane might be attributed to the increase in hydrophilicity and membrane porosity the catalytic degradation and membrane filtration performance for the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system in treating different types of natural waters were evaluated the removal of phenol by the n mwcnts modified membrane was 83 67 in 2 min which was greater than the phenol removal by the virgin membrane 3 39 and n mwcnt powder 41 42 respectively moreover the resultant membrane coupled with pms activation exhibited outstanding removal effects on the fluorescent organics in the secondary effluent and songhua river water the combination effectively reduced the total membrane fouling caused by the secondary effluent songhua river water and three typical model organics by 28 19 61 98 electron paramagnetic resonance and classical quenching tests presented that the active species so4 oh and 1o2 and other non radical processes generated by n mwcnts activated pms decreased the foulants deposition on the membrane surface meanwhile the membrane interception accelerated the aggregation of pollutants and pms towards the membrane surface through applied pressure facilitating their mass transfer to the n mwcnts surface for the catalysis exerted more effectively this study demonstrated the potential application of the coupling of n mwcnts catalytic oxidation and the uf which offers a promising prospect to improve the permeate quality and simultaneously overcome the membrane fouling barriers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ultrafiltration uf nitrogen doped multi walled carbon nanotube catalytic membrane natural organic matter nom membrane fouling peroxymonosulfate activation 1 introduction with the development of water purification technology membrane separation technology has been broadly applied in drinking water supply and advanced wastewater treatment systems liu et al 2019 talvitie et al 2017 among them the ultrafiltration uf membrane is one of the most attractive with low transmembrane pressure stable operation and without the need for additional chemicals liao et al 2020 however membrane fouling and inferior retention to organic micro pollutants with low molecular weight and high toxicity are critical obstructions for the broad application of the uf membrane in water treatment tian et al 2018 natural organic matter nom has been found to be responsible for membrane fouling in which high molecular weight polysaccharides and proteinaceous substances are known to be major foulants cheng et al 2019 these substances that ubiquitously exist in actual water including natural surface water and secondary effluent can readily form a loose cake layer and impermeable gel layer resulting in the blockage of membrane pores a common approach to alleviate the above mentioned problems is the advanced oxidation process aop wan et al 2019 in recent years the sulfate radical based so4 advanced oxidation process has attracted increasing attentions due to its wider ph range ph 1 9 higher redox potential 2 5 3 1 v versus nhe longer half life and stronger selectivity towards pollutants asif et al 2021 bao et al 2019 wan et al 2019 it was generally considered that so4 can be generated from peroxymonosulfate pms activated by a variety of methods such as transition metal ions wang et al 2020a uv irradiation hammouda et al 2018 ultra sonication lee et al 2021 and so on however the high energy input of physical techniques e g uv irradiation and ultra sonication and the leaching and toxic effects of homogeneous transition metal ions restrains their extensive application it has been found that novel carbon based nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes cnts activated carbon ac graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 etc can effectively activate pms having good catalytic performance and environmental safety adil et al 2020 ding et al 2020 gao et al 2018 cnts are materials with a conjugated π network composed of carbon

conducive to electron transfer inducing the nonradical degradation pathway li et al 2020 ye et al 2020 in addition the introduction of some heteroatoms such as n p and s into the carbon framework of cnts was found to be an efficient method to further upgrade the catalytic performance in activating pms li et al 2017 duan et al successfully synthesized nitrogen doped single welled carbon nanotubes nocnts and characterized their catalytic efficiency in pms activation for phenol degradation nocnts exhibited a strong catalytic capacity and their degradation rate was 16 9 and 15 6 times superior to those of α mno2 and co3o4 respectively duan et al 2015 commonly pms activation by cnts nano catalyst is utilized as a pretreatment prior to membrane filtration in feed water which mitigates membrane fouling caused by organic matters cheng et al 2021 nevertheless several drawbacks including the agglomeration between cnts and the problem of hard to recycle still exist resulting in low mass transfer efficiency and limited available active sites liu et al 2020 to address these problems a catalytic membrane by coupling the nano catalysts on the membrane surface has been widely studied wang et al 2020b the integrating of aops and membrane filtration showed complementarity in which the presence of membrane as a catalyst carrier increased the mass transfer efficiency to the catalyst and effectively exerted its catalytic ability meanwhile the active species generated by advanced oxidation on the membrane surface could degrade the pollutants and alleviate the membrane fouling recently numerous studies have also focused on the coupling technology of membrane separation and advanced oxidation pan et al 2019 the catalytic ceramic membrane coated with mno2 co3o4 nanoparticles was fabricated which achieved great removal of benzophenone 3 and reduction in toxicity of the permeate guo et al 2016 a biomimetic polydopamine and zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 modified polypropylene membrane possessed excellent dye degradation and anti fouling property in the presence of pms and visible light li et al 2019 wang et al demonstrated that the catalyst cuo immobilized on the membrane for pms activation showed greater advantages in bpa degradation and better anti fouling performance than the cuo catalyst dispersed in the feed water wang et al 2021 compared with the above mentioned existing catalytic membrane cnts catalytic membrane have the advantages of high cost effectiveness li et al 2017 no environmental problem of toxic metal leaching rathinavel et al 2021 and unique catalytic potential for pms activation cheng et al 2021 however coupling cnts with membrane to activate pms for natural waters treatment has been rarely reported in this study nitrogen doped multiwalled carbon nanotube n mwcnts was synthesized and immobilized on the surface of uf membrane to enhance the removal of the organic matters and alleviate membrane fouling the effect of the introduction of catalyst on the morphology chemical composition and permeability of the n mwcnts modified membrane was determined the main aims of this work were a to integrate catalyst n mwcnts with the membrane in a facile and efficient method b to investigate the catalytic degradation and membrane filtration performance of the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system c to evaluate the applicability of the n mwcnts modified membrane in different types of natural waters furthermore the mechanism of the interplay between the foulants and membranes in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system was explained and analyzed the results were expected to illustrate the feasibility of coupling catalyst n mwcnts and membrane filtration to enhance the permeate quality and control the membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents mwcnts with an outer diameter of 5 15 nm and a length of 10 30 μm were obtained from the jiangsu xianfeng nanomaterial technology co ltd china other chemicals and reagents were listed in the supplementary material all chemicals and solvents were used without further purification unless otherwise specified 2 2 feed water ha bsa and sa were chosen for preparing the model solution to represent humic substances proteins and polysaccharides in natural waters respectively and the concentrations were all 20 mg l to better simulate natural water 1 0 mmol l cacl2 nacl and nahco3 were added to the three model solutions and the ph values of the solutions were maintained at about 7 0 the natural surface water was taken from songhua river in harbin heilongjiang province china the secondary effluent before uv disinfection treatment used in this study was taken from the xinyi wastewater treatment plant in harbin heilongjiang china before the experiments the collected water samples were pre filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose ester membrane to remove the microorganisms and suspended particles 2 3 experimental setup a generalized schematic representation of the experimental setup is illustrated in fig 1 the experimental setup consists of a nitrogen gas bottle electronic balance data acquisition system filtration cell electronic balance and pressure control device uf experiments were carried out in a filtration cell amicon 8400 millipore corp usa at a constant drive pressure of 0 3 bar supplied by the compressed n2 connected to the water reservoir the experiments were performed in dead end mode at room temperature 20 2 c the volume of the filtration cell is 400 ml which can be expanded to 3000 ml through an external pressure water storage device the filtrate was weighted by an electronic balance and the output data was automatically recorded by an online computer with a data acquisition system every 5 s the membranes were placed at the bottom of the filtration cell for each experiment 2 4 preparation and characterization of n mwcnts incorporated membranes first the catalyst n mwcnts for membrane modification was prepared specifically 1 g commercial mwcnts were dissolved in 100 ml of nitric acid followed by stirring at the temperature of 100 c for 4 h afterward the metal free mwcnts were filtered out from nitric acid washed several times with ultrapure water and dried in an oven at 60 c overnight the obtained mwcnt powder omwcnts was mixed with the mixture 100 ml with methanol and water to get a homogeneous suspension 1 g of melamine was added to the metal free mwcnts ethanol suspension stirred at 100 c to evaporate the ethanol and water the dried mixture was placed into a tube furnace to anneal at 700 c for 1 h under an n2 40 ml min atmosphere then the sample was repeatedly washed with ultrapure water and ethanol several times and dried in an oven at 60 c overnight to obtain nitrogen doped mwcnts named n mwcnts mwcnts and n mwcnts were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and x ray diffraction xrd the adsorption and catalytic activity of the n mwcnts were assessed by the removal of phenol the reaction was carried out in a 500 ml beaker with stirring at 400 rpm equipped with an automatic temperature control system the reaction temperature was controlled to 20 c first the uniform dispersion was prepared by adding 4 5 mg of n mwcnts into 300 ml of deionized water and sonicating for 30 min after dissolving the phenol and pms into this dispersion the samples 1 ml were taken at regular intervals the samples taken from a mixture containing phenol and pms were utilized to assess the catalytic activity of n mwcnts the samples withdrawn from the mixture containing only phenol but not pms were used to evaluate the adsorption property of n mwcnts the sample taken out was filtered out the impurities with a 0 22 μm membrane and then transferred to a vial containing 0 5 ml of methanol to quench the reaction the samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1200 lc with a spherisorb s5 ods2 column using uv detection at a wavelength of 270 nm two types of mwcnts including commercial mwcnts and synthetic n mwcnts were utilized to prepare catalytic membranes the commercial mwcnts coated membrane is denoted as mwcnts modified membrane the resultant membrane coated with n mwcnts is referred to as n mwcnts modified membrane the membranes were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem atomic force microscopy afm attenuated total reflectance fourier transform

the composition and chemical states xps was utilized to analyze the two types of mwcnts and the results are presented in fig 2 a b as seen in fig 2 a the strong characteristic peaks of the materials at 284 8 399 2 and 531 2 ev are attributed to the binding energy of c 1 s n 1 s and o 1 s respectively the appearance of the n 1 s peak of the n mwcnts at 399 2 ev suggested the successful introduction of nitrogen elements into the commercial mwcnts in addition the nitrogen and oxygen levels were increased to 1 14 6 88 atom on n mwcnts after high temperature treatment respectively the n 1 s core level spectra of n mwcnts are showed in fig 2 b the catalytic performance of mwcnts is directly related to the degree of the doping of nitrogen atoms which can be found in the publication sun et al 2013 four peaks with binding energies of 398 2 399 9 401 2 and 403 5 ev corresponding to the pyridinic n pyrrolic n graphitic n and nitric oxide respectively in which the percentage of graphitic nitrogen affected the catalytic effect of the catalyst duan et al 2015 sem images xrd patterns and ftir of the catalysts are displayed in fig s1 s2 3 1 2 characterization of the membranes sem and afm were utilized to analyze the top surface and cross section of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane as shown in fig 3 a the membrane pores of the virgin membrane were evenly distributed on the surface of the membrane the surfaces of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes were completely covered by carbon nanotube leading to the pores of the underneath support membrane invisible the mwcnts modified membrane exhibited a rougher surface in which larger agglomerates formed by commercial mwcnts could be observed fig 3 b the surface of the n mwcnts modified membrane was smoother than that of the mwcnts modified membrane which was attributed to the reduced size and fewer aggregates of the modified mwcnts the cross sectional image of virgin membrane showed an asymmetric porous structure fig 3 d by contrast for the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes a boundary line between the coating and the underlying membrane surface can be clearly seen the coating thickness of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes were almost the same with values of 22 78 μm and 23 56 μm respectively the surface roughness of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes was characterized by afm as can be seen from fig 3 g i the virgin membrane exhibited a smooth surface while the roughness of the modified membranes was much greater than that of virgin membrane table 1 presents that the contact angle and overall porosity of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane compared with the virgin membrane 66 7 water contact angles of the mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane declined moreover the modified membranes exhibited greater overall porosity the chemical structures of the three types of membranes are explored by the xps and zeta potential characterizations more detailed descriptions are presented in section s4 of the supplementary material the results of pure water fluxes of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane are showed in fig 4 as can be seen the pure water fluxes of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes were 482 and 455 lmh bar respectively which were about 15 and 8 greater than that of the virgin membrane 419 lmh bar the augment in water flux of the modified membrane was due to the improved hydrophilicity and membrane porosity which was conducive to the formation of more hydrogen bonds with water molecules facilitating the transport of water molecules akhtar et al 2019 chara et al 2009 3 2 catalytic performance of the membranes 3 2 1 effects of experimental conditions on catalytic performance of the membranes the catalyst loading pms concentration and ph value of the mixed solution are important factors affecting the catalytic performance of the composite membrane asif et al 2021 for a detailed description of the effect of these experimental conditions on the catalytic performance of the membrane see supplementary material s5 the optimized loading amount of catalyst for the composite membrane was determined to be 0 1 mg cm2 the pms concentration in the system was set as 0 2 mm moreover the phenol removal efficiency reached the highest when the ph was adjusted to neutral ph 7 3 2 2 the phenol removal the phenol removal of the three types of membranes was compared to investigate the effect of the modification of the membrane on the activation ability of pms based on the above optimized experimental conditions before the experiment static adsorption was carried out on the three types of membranes for 60 min to achieve adsorption equilibrium as seen in fig 5 the concentration of phenol showed a trend of decreasing as the reaction proceeded the virgin membrane had almost no effect on the removal of phenol which was due to the much smaller size of phenol compared with that of virgin membrane resulting in ineffective membrane pore interception the phenol removal of the mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane was greater than that of the virgin membrane which was attributed to the catalytic ability on the membrane surface compared with the mwcnts modified membrane the n mwcnts modified membrane exhibited the highest phenol removal which reached 100 within 6 min to further explain the above phenomenon the phenol degradation of the same amounts of nanocarbon materials was comparatively investigated and the results are shown in fig 6 in this experiment the treated water was all 300 ml phenol solutions in which the concentrations of phenol and pms were 10 mg l and 5 mm respectively the total amount of catalyst n mwcnts used in each system was 4 5 mg in the n mwcnts powder system activated by pms 4 5 mg n mwcnts were dispersed into a 300 ml phenol solution the phenol removal reached 100 in 40 min of this system furthermore 4 5 mg n mwcnts were coated on the uf membrane of 45 cm2 to form the n mwcnts modified membrane under static conditions membrane immersed in 300 ml phenol solution containing pms without pressure driving the phenol removal was only about 40 which was far inferior to that in the n mwcnts modified membrane filtration pms system in summary the catalyst integrated on the membrane filtration better exerted its catalytic performance a similar phenomenon in which the catalytic efficiency of the membrane catalyst layer was higher than that of the same amount of catalyst powder has been reported ma et al 2020 3 2 3 the organic foulants removal to further explore the catalytic performance of the modified membrane the removals of organic pollutants in actual water secondary effluent and songhua river water were investigated the fluorescent organic matters in natural water detected by eems are the crucial components causing the membrane fouling in this study four statistically significant fluorescent peaks a d were obtained from actual water by parafac analysis table 2 displays the corresponding properties of the four fluorescent peaks the fluorescence eem spectra of each sample of the secondary effluent are shown in fig 7 in comparison to the raw water the reduction of the fluorophores in the permeate obtained by the three types of membranes indicated that these membranes played a certain role in the removal of fluorescent organics in the secondary effluent to quantitatively interpret the spectrum the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component in the feed and permeate are extracted and summarized in table s2 after filtration by the n mwcnts modified membrane the maximum fluorescence intensity of aromatic protein like substances tryptophan protein like substances fulvic like substances and humic like substances decreased by 99 72 90 19 77 97 and 80 28 respectively the obvious reduction of the peak values of each component demonstrated that the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system exhibited significant removal efficiency of organic matters in the secondary effluent the removal effect of three types of membranes on the fluorescent organics in songhua river water was investigated and the results are presented in fig 8 and table s3 the virgin membrane only reduced slightly the fluorescence intensity of peaks a and b protein like substances due to the rejection ability of membrane pores for the n mwcnts modified membrane all peak intensities were efficiently decreased from 4 7 98 8 368 3 and 253 7 of raw water to 5 1 32 5 293 5 and 192 7 respectively the results suggested that the synergistic effects between the retention ability of the membrane pores and the catalytic oxidation of the n mwcnts pms synergistic made a tremendous contribution to organic foulants removal in songhua river water compared with the virgin membrane the greater removal efficiency for all organic components of the n mwcnts modified membrane indicated that the n mwcnts catalyst on the membrane rather than the membrane pores played the most important role 3 3 membrane filtration performance 3 3 1 the model organic foulants the flux curves of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane on ha fouling are presented in fig 9 a the flux decline of the virgin membrane was most severe with a reduction of 63 08 of the initial flux at the end of filtration the accumulation of ha contaminants on the surface and pore wells of the virgin membrane resulting in a decreased membrane flux and serious membrane fouling the flux decline of the mwcnts modified and n mwcnts modified membranes was lower than that of the virgin membrane with the final values of 72 01 and 87 84 of the initial flux respectively compared with the virgin membrane and mwcnts modified membrane the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system exhibited a significant mitigation effect on the membrane fouling caused by ha fig 9 b illustrates the fouling resistance distributions of the three types of membranes the specific resistance of membrane fouling represents the ratio of the reversible resistance irreversible resistance and the total membrane fouling to the intrinsic membrane resistance in the process of membrane fouling deng et al 2020 the specific total fouling resistance r t r m of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane was 156 87 138 30 and 109 89 respectively these results showed that the modified membrane catalytically degraded the fouling deposited on the membrane surface with the participation of pms reducing the total membrane fouling resistance moreover the incorporation of n mwcnts dramatically decreased reversible and irreversible fouling with the values of the specific reversible resistance r r r m and specific irreversible resistance r i r r m reduced from 37 50 and 19 38 of the virgin membrane to 7 71 and 2 17 respectively the primary reason of membrane fouling caused by ha is the hydrophobic interaction between ha molecules and the membrane surface bai et al 2015 the n mwcnts modified membrane activated pms to decompose and mineralize the ha on the membrane surface thereby alleviating the membrane fouling caused by ha the mechanisms of membrane fouling mitigation will be further discussed in section 3 4 the effects of surface modification of the membrane on the bsa fouling are illustrated in fig 9 c at the beginning of filtration 50 ml the flux of the virgin membrane rapidly dropped to 81 44 of the initial flux and then the flux curve became smooth the finial normalized fluxes of the mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane were 61 77 and 87 32 respectively which were greater than the virgin membrane 53 50 similar to ha fouling the bsa fouling of the membrane modified with n mwcnts was dramatically alleviated it can be seen from fig 9 d that r t r m of the n mwcnts modified membrane was 114 52 which was lower than that of the virgin membrane 186 91 and the mwcnts modified membrane 161 90 during filtration of bsa the resistance of the virgin membrane was primarily concentrated in the irreversible fouling caused by the blockage of the membrane pores the r i r r m of the n mwcnts modified membrane dropped from 68 05 of the virgin membrane to 2 83 indicating that pms activation by n mwcnts catalyst on the membrane surface played an important role in mitigation of the bsa irreversible fouling oxidation reduced the stability of the organics adsorbed on the membrane which made the foulants readily eluted during the cleaning process leading to greater control of irreversible membrane fouling as shown in fig 9 e the flux decrease of three types of membranes caused by sa was assessed both the virgin membrane and mwcnts modified membrane displayed a significant flux decline the terminal normalized fluxes were reduced to 25 78 and 31 32 respectively in comparison the normalized flux of the n mwcnts modified membrane was improved with the final value of 67 80 indicating that the membrane modified by n mwcnts had an excellent mitigation effect on membrane fouling caused by sa the reversibility of bsa fouling of three types of membranes was analyzed and the results are depicted in fig 9 f the r t r m of the virgin membrane mwcnts modified membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane were 387 94 319 27 and 147 48 respectively the higher r t r m demonstrated that the membrane fouling caused by sa was more severe than that by bsa and ha which is consistent with previously reported results sun et al 2018b the major fouling of all the membranes was reversible fouling which was due to the greater resistance of the cake layer formed by hydrophilic sa than that by hydrophobic ha and bsa zhang et al 2018 the r r r m of the n mwcnts modified membrane decreased from 287 41 of the virgin membrane to 47 04 which indicated that membrane modification alleviated the reversible fouling caused by sa thus realizing the control of membrane fouling in summary n mwcnts modified membrane exhibited outstanding effects on alleviating membrane fouling of three model organic foulants and each of them had reduced fouling resistance 3 3 2 the secondary effluent the existence of the great difference between the natural water and the artificial water of the laboratory is due to the complicated components of the natural water such as many kinds of ions and natural organic matters to comprehensively investigate the filtration performance of the n mwcnts modified membrane it is necessary to conduct membrane fouling experiments with natural waters secondary effluent and songhua river water as feed water the flux variations and fouling resistances in the systems of virgin membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane with pms by the filtration of the secondary effluent are illustrated in fig 10 a b as illustrated in fig 10 a the virgin membrane exhibited a more severe flux decline with reductions of about 45 70 and 44 57 during the first and second filtration cycles respectively for the n mwcnts modified membrane the normalized fluxes at the end of the two filtration cycles were 87 51 and 78 75 respectively which were significantly superior to those of the virgin membrane the fouling reversibility of the virgin and n mwcnts modified membranes was analyzed and the various resistances are presented in fig 10 b the r t of the n mwcnts modified membrane was much less than that of the virgin membrane in all two cycles compared with the virgin membrane the r i r r t of the n mwcnts modified membrane in the two filtration cycles decreased by 56 85 and 10 55 the improvement of the reversible fouling of the n mwcnts modified membrane was more obvious and the proportions of reversible fouling in the two cycles were 89 37 and 72 76 lower than those of the virgin membrane respectively these results demonstrated that surface modification strikingly alleviated the membrane fouling caused by secondary effluent especially the reversible fouling 3 3 3 the songhua river water the surface water collected from the songhua river was employed to investigate the filtration property of the n mwcnts modified membrane on natural water since the water quality standard for drinking water sources limits the concentration of sulfate ions the pms concentration in songhua river water was reduced to 20 of the secondary effluent in this study during filtration of songhua river water the flux curves of the virgin membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane are shown in fig 10 c the flux decline of the virgin membrane was relatively severe with a reduction of about 31 00 and 32 82 of the initial flux at the end of the first and second filtration cycles respectively in comparison the normalized terminal fluxes in the two cycles of the n mwcnts modified membrane increased to 65 21 and 47 67 indicating that the modified membrane showed better filtration performance even in the case of low oxidant concentration the membrane fouling resistance distribution of the virgin membrane and n mwcnts modified membrane is presented in fig 10 d the surface modification of the membrane dramatically decreased the reversible fouling and the reversible fouling resistance of the n mwcnts modified membrane was reduced to 32 58 and 40 35 of the virgin membrane in two filtration cycles however the surface modification was ineffective in mitigating the irreversible fouling which may be due to the less oxidant in the songhua river water experiment meanwhile the major foulant in songhua river water is ha guo et al 2020 which is easily blocked in the pores of the modified membrane and cause the irreversible fouling 3 4 mechanisms of enhanced catalytic performance and fouling mitigation the above results indicated that the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system exhibited enhanced organics removal efficiency and remarkable membrane fouling mitigation to better understand the excellent properties of the n mwcnts modified membrane the mechanism of the interplay between foulants and membranes in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system was discussed since size exclusion is the primary mechanism of the uf membrane for the removal of pollutants toxic micro contaminants smaller than the pore size are facile to pass directly through the membrane moreover the deposition of foulants on the membrane surface readily formed the cake gel layer resulting in reduced flux and increased energy consumption so the virgin membrane showed relatively inferior membrane performance the n mwcnts modified membrane was coupled with pms activation which overcame the drawback of membrane filtration since n mwcnts on the modified membrane activated pms to generate active species with strong oxidation capability thereby degrading organic pollutants that are toxic and easily cause membrane fouling the determination of active species is helpful for the explanation of the reaction mechanism in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system the epr was utilized to probe the generation of active species using dmpo and temp as the spin trapping agent of radical and 1o2 respectively fig 11 a c e show that so4 and oh were detected in both mwcnts modified membrane pms system and n mwcnts modified membrane pms system at 1 3 and 5 min the greater epr relative intensity of the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system demonstrated its stronger ability to generate radicals the adducts combined with temp and 1o2 displayed the three line epr spectrum with equal intensities which suggested the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system produced 1o2 as seen in fig 11 b d f classical quenching experiment was conducted to identify the major role of each active species in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system different scavengers such as methanol and ffa were employed to capture radicals and 1o2 as shown in fig 12 a the degradation efficiency of the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system decreased from 100 to 90 after the addition of methanol indicating that radicals accounted for a small proportion in the system approximately 10 fig 12 b presents the behavior of phenol degradation on the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system in the presence of ffa when ffa was added to the reaction solution the degradation efficiency reduced to 70 suggesting 1o2 contributed 30 to the overall degradation it is speculated the existence of other nonradical processes such as formed n mwcnts pms complex and direct electron transfer played the dominant role 60 in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system ding et al 2021 guan et al 2017 ren et al 2020 the occurrence of these radical and non radical processes was attributed to the significant role of graphite n of n mwcnts loaded on the membrane surface in the activation of pms duan et al 2015 the abundant s electrons with p electrons in the π orbitals of carbon nanotubes may exhibit great chemical activities which is conducive to electron transport to pms as electron acceptors sun et al 2018a the generated active species with strong oxidation potential can depolymerize contaminants into smaller and less toxic fragments which can pass through the membrane pores and prevent the formation of a cake gel layer on the membrane surface the presence of the catalytic layer accelerated the degradation of organic pollutants and reduced the probability of foulants contacting the membrane pores resulting in less deposition of fouling on the membrane surface and pores as depicted in scheme 1 in addition the support membrane with metal free catalysts provided more uniform active sites for foulants adsorption and degradation which more effectively exerted the catalytic efficiency of n mwcnts the membrane filtration accelerated the aggregation of pollutants and pms to the membrane surface through applied pressure facilitating their mass transfer to the n mwcnts surface for enhanced pms activation it has been reported that the catalytic efficiency of the membrane catalyst layer was much greater than that of the same amount of catalyst powder ma et al 2020 in this case the enhancement of the pms utilization ratio led to a more efficient generation of active species with strong oxidation therefore the pms activation by n mwcnts and membrane filtration were synergistic and complementary in membrane filtration and pms activation integrated process the presence of membranes can not only enhance the catalytic efficiency of n mwcnts but also intercept non degradable contaminants in pms activation ensuring the safety of the effluent meanwhile the active species generated by pms activation reduced the pollutants deposition on the membrane thereby alleviating the membrane fouling and improving the filtration efficiency 4 conclusion this study investigated the coupling technology of n mwcnts catalytic oxidation and membrane filtration was investigated to eliminate pollutants organics and micro pollutants in water and control uf membrane fouling caused by nom the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the hydrophilicity of the n mwcnts modified membrane was much greater than that of the virgin membrane the graphitic nitrogen that enhanced the catalytic effect was detected on the n mwcnts modified membrane which was 20 2 of the total doped nitrogen the n mwcnts modified membrane showed slightly increased permeability and superior catalytic performance 2 the removal of phenol by the n mwcnts modified membrane was about 90 which was much higher than that by the virgin membrane 2 4 moreover the n mwcnts modified membrane exhibited a great removal effect on the fluorescent organics in the secondary effluent and songhua river water which demonstrated the strong potential of the modified membrane in water treatment applications 3 the n mwcnts modified membrane coupled with pms activation possessed the excellent self cleaning ability to mitigate membrane fouling caused by three typical organic model foulants songhua river water and secondary effluent 4 the reason for the superior filtration performance of the resultant membrane is that the combination of n mwcnts on the membrane and pms greatly degraded the pollutants thereby alleviating the membrane fouling meanwhile the presence of membranes enhanced the catalytic efficiency of n mwcnts and ensured the safety of the effluent 5 active species so4 oh and 1o2 were detected in the n mwcnts modified membrane pms system in addition to radicals and 1o2 contributing 10 and 30 to the overall degradation other non radical processes such as formed n mwcnts pms complex and direct electron transfer existed in the system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16432,low salt rejection reverse osmosis lsrro is a novel reverse osmosis ro based technology that can highly concentrate brines using moderate operating pressures in this study we investigate the performance of lsrro membrane modules and systems using module scale analysis specifically we correlate the observed salt rejection of an lsrro module with the water and salt permeabilities of the ro membrane we then elaborate the impact of membrane properties and operating conditions on the performance of a 2 stage lsrro providing design guidelines for lsrro systems we further compare the performance of 2 stage and 3 stage lsrro systems showing that an lsrro system with more stages is not always favored due to a larger energy consumption the performance of a 3 stage lsrro in treating different feed solutions for minimal zero liquid discharge mld zld applications is then evaluated based on our results when treating feed waters with a relatively low salinity e g 0 1 m or 5 800 mg l 1 nacl the 3 stage lsrro can achieve a concentrated brine that can be directly sent to the thermal brine crystallizers i e brine concentration 4 m or 240 000 mg l 1 nacl and the corresponding specific energy consumption s e c is only 3 kwh m 3 when treating feed waters with a relatively high salinity e g 0 6 m or 35 000 mg l 1 nacl the brine from the 3 stage lsrro can be 80 more concentrated compared to that from conventional ro while the corresponding s e c does not exceed 6 kwh m 3 our results demonstrate that lsrro can substantially advance minimal zero liquid discharge mld zld applications because it can significantly minimize the use of thermal brine concentrators we conclude with a discussion on the practicability of lsrro and highlight future research needs graphical

intensive industrial activities convert massive amounts of freshwater to wastewaters or brines with high salinities hoekstra 2014 holland et al 2015 jones et al 2019 traditional brine disposal pathways include deep well injection evaporation ponds and landfills but these methods are environmentally unfriendly or and economically costly heck et al 2018 panagopoulos haralambous and loizidou 2019 to minimize the negative environmental impacts of brine discharge governments have launched stringent discharge regulations bond and veerapaneni 2008 vishnu palanisamy and joseph 2008 xie li and zhao 2010 jiang 2015 zero liquid discharge zld is an ambitious brine management strategy aiming to simultaneously eliminate liquid brine discharge and recover all freshwater from brine tong and elimelech 2016 yaqub and lee 2019 the implementation of zld not only minimizes the environmental risks associated with brine discharge but also maximizes the freshwater utilization efficiency state of the art zld systems are based on reverse osmosis ro followed by thermal evaporators where the brine is first concentrated by ro followed by thermal brine concentration to over 200 000 mg l total dissolved solids tds and complete evaporation of water by thermal crystallizers bond and veerapaneni 2008 tong and elimelech 2016 however the applications of zld are severely limited due to the high capital and operational costs of thermal brine concentrators and crystallizers jamil and zubair 2017 liu bi and cui 2020 zhao et al 2011 to advance the applications of zld the use of thermal brine concentrators needs to be minimized or eliminated specifically the brine needs to be concentrated by ro as much as possible so that it can be directly sent to the thermal crystallizer however based on the working principles of ro the maximum brine concentration is limited by the applied hydraulic pressure tong and elimelech 2016 davenport et al 2018 to avoid detrimental effects of operating pressures on membranes and modules in conventional seawater ro the operating pressure cannot exceed 85 bar corresponding to a maximum brine concentration of 1 6 m i e 90 000 mg l tds nacl davenport et al 2018 baker 2012 chen and yip 2018 which is much lower than the required influent concentration for most thermal crystallizers i e 240 000 mg l tds davenport et al 2018 recently membrane modules that can sustain 120 bar hydraulic pressures have been developed with which a maximum brine concentration of 2 1 m i e 120 000 mg l tds can be obtained davenport et al 2018 schantz et al 2018 davenport et al 2020 however such a brine concentration is still much lower than the requirement for the feed for thermal crystallizers to overcome the limit of operating pressure in conventional ro we have recently introduced a novel staged ro configuration using low salt rejection ro modules referred to as low salt rejection ro lsrro wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 an n stage lsrro system comprises one conventional ro module and n 1 lsrro modules fig 1 the conventional ro is used in the first stage and the lsrro modules are used in the subsequent stages during operation the pressurized brine at each stage is sent to the next stage as feed for further concentration while the unpressurized permeate is repressurized and cycled back to the previous stage as an additional feed for re concentration freshwater is produced from the first stage and the final concentrated brine is discharged from the last stage after recovering the embedded energy in the stream by an energy recovery device erd for a given operating pressure lsrro can attain a much higher brine concentration than conventional ro because the osmotic pressure of the brine is mediated by the salty permeate in the lsrro modules using process modeling we demonstrated that lsrro can theoretically achieve brine concentrations over 4 m using an operating pressure of 70 bar and that the energy consumption of lsrro is far less than that of thermal brine concentrators wang et al 2020 however although simplified process modeling can effectively evaluate the performance of lsrro systems it cannot provide detailed parameters for system design wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 specifically via process modeling the observed salt rejection rate of each stage can be obtained but the detailed design parameters that determine the observed salt rejection rate i e membrane properties and system operating conditions remain unknown therefore there is a critical need to conduct a rigorous module scale analysis to determine the detailed design parameters for lsrro systems moreover the simplified process modeling in the previous studies contains idealized assumptions that compromise the accuracy of the simulation results whereas the module scale analysis can provide simulation results that are relevant to the practical operation of lsrro in this study we perform a module scale analysis of lsrro systems to provide design guidelines and accurately evaluate system performance we first show that the observed salt rejection of an lsrro module can be tuned based on the water and salt permeabilities of the ro membrane next we demonstrate the design guidelines for the lsrro system by elucidating the impact of membrane properties and operating conditions on the performance of a two stage lsrro system we then assess the performance of lsrro systems in mld zld applications with varying stage numbers and feed brine concentrations we conclude with highlighting the potential of implementing lsrro technology in practice and the critical need for future technology development 2 model development we start our analysis by calculating the local mass transport of water and salt through the ro lsrro membranes these local water and salt fluxes can be integrated over the entire membrane area to determine the performance of the membrane module by incorporating the module scale analysis into system scale analysis the performance of an lsrro system can be evaluated we note that all the simulations in this study are assumed to be under steady state 2 1 water and salt transport through ro lsrro membranes based on the mass transfer mechanisms of thin film composite tfc membranes the local water and salt fluxes across an ro lsrro membrane can be calculated werber deshmukh and

calculation procedures in supplementary material 2 2 module scale analysis based on mass balance of water and salt the governing equations for water and salt transport in an ro lsrro module can be

the membrane module s is the membrane area from the module entrance to the position being described normalized by the total membrane area a m combining and solving eqs 1 and 2 we can obtain the flow rates and concentrations of the permeate and brine flowing out of the membrane module 3a q b o u t q f 1 3b c b o u t c f 1 3c q p o u t a m 0 1 j w s d s 3d c p o u t 0 1 j s s d s 0 1 j w s d s where q b o u t and c b o u t are the flow rate and concentration of the brine flowing out of the membrane module i e s 1 respectively and q p o u t and c p o u t are the flow rate and concentration of the permeate flowing out of the membrane module respectively 2 3 system analysis of lsrro in an n stage lsrro system water and salt transport between adjacent stages can be related based on the working principles of lsrro fig 1 4a q f i q b i 1 q p i 1 4b c f i c b i 1 q b i 1 c p i 1 q p i 1 q b i 1 q p i 1 where q f i and c f i are the flow rate and salt concentration of the feed flowing

concentration of the permeate flowing out of the i th stage respectively the flow rate and concentration of the feed flowing into the lsrro system are q f and c f respectively in the nth stage q f n q b n 1 and c f n c b n 1 combining and solving eqs 1 4 we can acquire the flow rates and concentrations of all streams in the lsrro system since the purpose of lsrro is to highly concentrate the feed i e minimize the brine volume the final brine concentration c b and the specific energy consumption s e c are used as the performance metrics of an lsrro system we note that other performance metrics e g final brine flow rate q b can be calculated from these two metrics detailed information in supplementary material because the final brine stream flows out of the last stage c b c b n in lsrro s e c is defined as the energy consumption normalized by the volume reduction of the feed the volume reduction of the feed is essentially equivalent to the volume of permeate produced in the 1st stage thus the s e c of an n stage lsrro can be calculated as detailed derivation in supplementary material 5 s e c δ p q p i 2 n q p i q p δ p 1 i 2 n q p i q p where q p is the permeate flow rate of the lsrro system and q p q p 1 the observed salt rejection of the i th stage r i o b s is an important design parameter in lsrro we calculated the observed salt rejection using 6 r i o b s 1 c p i c f i 3 design guidelines for lsrro modules 3 1 observed salt rejection of lsrro modules with tuned membrane properties in previous studies the observed salt rejection rates of the lsrro modules r o b s were used to evaluate the performance of lsrro systems wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however r o b s cannot directly guide the fabrication of desired lsrro modules because it is not an intrinsic property of ro lsrro membranes freeman 1999 geise et al 2011 geise paul and freeman 2014 in other words r o b s is influenced by the operating conditions such as applied hydraulic pressure crossflow velocity and feed salt concentration herein we correlated r o b s with two intrinsic properties of tfc membranes the water permeability coefficient a and salt permeability coefficient b the variation of r o b s with the a and b coefficients is demonstrated in fig 2 a for a given b coefficient r o b s only slightly decreases with increasing a coefficient whereas for a given a coefficient r o b s drastically decreases with increasing b coefficient such results suggest that r o b s is more dependent on the b coefficient than the a coefficient the weak dependence of r o b s on the a coefficient can be attributed to concentration polarization cp which has been extensively studied in conventional ro patel et al 2020 werber deshmukh and elimelech 2016 specifically with a fixed b coefficient increasing the a coefficient would result in a higher osmotic pressure at the membrane surface on the feed side due to cp consequently leading to a relatively constant j w and j s eq 1 and fig 2b according to eq 3d the relatively constant j w and j s result in a relatively constant c p and thus a relatively stable r o b s eq 6 the strong dependence of r o b s on the b coefficient can be explained by the principles of water and salt transport through lsrro membranes eq 1 based on eq 1b a larger b coefficient results in a larger j s since a larger j s reduces the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane j w would increase for a fixed a coefficient eq 1a as shown in fig 2c both j s and j w increase with increasing b coefficient however the increase of j s is much more significant than that of j w thereby resulting in a substantially increased c p eq 3d a substantially increased c p corresponds to a markedly decreased r o b s eq 6 based on the above analysis we propose that lsrro membrane modules with desired r o b s can be fabricated by tuning the b coefficient of commercial ro membranes 3 2 facile fabrication of lsrro modules polyamide tfc membranes are the state of the art membranes for ro technology elimelech and phillip 2011 lu and elimelech 2021 werber osuji and elimelech 2016 previous studies have demonstrated a permeability selectivity trade off relationship for tfc membranes where the a and b coefficients are interrelated werber deshmukh and elimelech 2016 freeman 1999 geise paul and freeman 2014 in previous studies commercial polyamide ro membranes were modified via chlorine alkaline treatment to generate loose ro membranes with a range of different membrane transport properties yip and elimelech 2011 chen boo and yip 2021 raval et al 2010 zhai et al 2011 based on the measured properties of the modified membranes a correlation between the a and b coefficients for polyamide tfc membranes was established yip and elimelech 2011 7 b 0 0133 a 3 eq 7 is plotted in fig 2a to demonstrate the range of possible r o b s for polyamide based lsrro membranes as the a coefficient increases from 2 to 10 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 r o b s decreases from 100 to 15 indicating that polyamide based lsrro membranes can be fabricated via chlorine alkaline treatment of commercial polyamide ro membranes in this study we assumed that lsrro membranes obey the permeability selectivity tradeoff and eq 7 was used exclusively to describe the lsrro membrane properties in the following analysis 4 performance of two stage lsrro system 4 1 impact of membrane properties on the performance of a 2 stage lsrro system to demonstrate the design guidelines for lsrro systems we further elucidate the impact of membrane properties on the performance of a 2 stage lsrro system the final brine concentration c b and the corresponding specific energy consumption s e c of the 2 stage lsrro as a function of the membrane properties of the lsrro stage are shown in fig 3 a the feed salt concentration for the lsrro system in these simulations was fixed at 0 6 m 35 000 mg l nacl as the a 2 and b 2 permeability coefficients increase c b first increases approaching a maximum value and then decreases according to the design guidelines of lsrro modules larger a 2 and b 2 coefficients correspond to a lower observed salt rejection r o b s of the lsrro module fig 2a based on fig 3b a lower r o b s in an lsrro module results in a larger permeate flow rate q p 2 and higher permeate concentration c p 2 on the one hand a larger q p 2 provides additional feed water for the first ro stage and thus more freshwater could be recovered consequently leading to a higher c b on the other hand a higher c p 2 would increase the overall feed concentration for the first ro stage this may reduce the recovery rate of freshwater and result in a lower c b due to the interplay between q p 2 and c p 2 the final brine concentration c b becomes a concave function of the a 2 and b 2 coefficients unlike c b s e c increases monotonically with increasing the a 2 and b 2 coefficients as previously discussed larger a 2 and b 2 coefficients correspond to a lower r o b s and consequently lead to larger q p 2 and higher c p 2 fig 3b the interplay between q p 2 and c p 2 renders the permeate flow rate of freshwater q p relatively constant fig 3b with increasing q p 2 and constant q p the ratio of q p 2 to q p i e q p 2 q p increases since s e c is proportional to q p 2 q p eq 5 it increases with higher values of a 2 and b 2 coefficients according to the analysis above to produce highly concentrated brines the membrane properties in each lsrro stage need to be optimized specifically for the 2 stage lsrro system to achieve the highest c b fig 3a the optimal a 2 and b 2 coefficients are 6 95 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and 4 46 l m 2 h 1 respectively with these a 2 and b 2 coefficients c b can attain 1 89 m which is 44 higher than that from a conventional one stage ro system i e c b 1 31 m for a 2 2 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and b 2 0 21 l m 2 h 1 and the corresponding s e c is 3 45 kwh m 3 which is far lower than that of thermal brine concentrators i e 20 kwh m 3 4 2 impact of feed flow rate on the performance of 2 stage lsrro in addition to membrane properties the performance of an lsrro system is also influenced by the operating conditions the impact of feed flow rate q f on c b and s e c of a 2 stage lsrro system is shown in fig 4 a as q f increases c b decreases while s e c remains relatively constant a larger q f corresponds to a shorter hydraulic retention time of the feed in the lsrro system resulting in a less concentrated brine thus c b decreases with increasing q f with a larger q f the brine from the 1st stage becomes less concentrated according to the working principles of lsrro the brine from the 1st stage serves as the feed for the 2nd stage with a less concentrated feed the permeate flow rate of the 2nd stage i e q p 2 becomes larger hence the overall effect is that q p 2 increases with increasing q f since both q p and q p 2 increase with increasing q f their ratio q p 2 q p remains relatively unchanged resulting in a relatively constant s e c with increasing q f eq 5 according to fig 4a as q f is reduced from 1200 to 300 l h 1 c b is increased from 1 27 to 2 63 m while s e c remains relatively constant around 3 7 kwh m 3 such results suggest that a smaller q f is always preferred in lsrro operation however in practical applications a smaller q f enhances concentration polarization consequently leading to more severe fouling and scaling in the membrane modules hoek kim and elimelech 2002 matin et al 2019 therefore a moderate q f that balances the hydraulic retention time and concentration polarization would be favored for the design of a practical lsrro system 4 3 impact of hydraulic pressure on the performance of 2 stage lsrro hydraulic pressure δ p is another important operating parameter that can significantly influence the performance of lsrro fig 4b presents the impact of δ p on the performance of a 2 stage lsrro system showing that both c b and s e c increase monotonically with increasing δ p based on the working principle of ro as δ p increases more freshwater can be recovered thereby resulting in a higher c b according to eq 5 s e c is proportional to δ p leading to an increase of s e c with increasing δ p based on fig 4b to achieve higher brine concentrations in lsrro a larger δ p is needed which also increases s e c to avoid detrimental effects of operating pressures on conventional state of the art ro modules δ p cannot exceed 85 bar corresponding to a maximum c b of 2 3 m in 2 stage lsrro systems as mentioned previously high pressure ro modules that can withstand a δ p of 120 bar have been recently developed davenport et al 2018 schantz et al 2018 davenport et al 2020 with such modules being applied in the 2 stage lsrro system a maximum c b of 3 19 m can be obtained which is 39 higher than that from an lsrro system with conventional modules i e δ p of 85 bar in this case the corresponding s e c is 5 39 kwh m 3 which is only 27 of that of thermal brine concentrators i e 20 kwh m 3 5 multi stage lsrro system for zld mld applications 5 1 brine concentration of lsrro system with varying stage numbers in the previous section we demonstrated that a 2 stage lsrro system can efficiently produce hypersaline brines with reasonable energy input however the final brine concentration from a 2 stage lsrro system is typically around 1 9 m 110 000 mg l nacl to achieve a higher brine concentration the performance of a 3 stage lsrro system was evaluated in this section in our calculations the maximum δ p was set at 70 bar q f was fixed at 600 l h 1 the membrane area in each stage was fixed at 10 m2 the water permeabilities of the low rejection modules a i varied from 6 to 11 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the corresponding salt permeabilities of the low salt rejection modules b i were calculated with a i using eq 7 the maximum brine concentrations c b of the 2 stage lsrro and 3 stage lsrro systems as well as the corresponding s e c are shown in fig 5 a with an additional stage being used the 3 stage lsrro can achieve a more concentrated brine compared to the 2 stage lsrro based on the working principle of lsrro with an additional lsrro stage the final brine can be further concentrated because its osmotic pressure can be further mediated by the permeate of the additional stage notably to achieve a more concentrated brine with the 3 stage lsrro a larger s e c is required fig 5a although the 3rd lsrro stage can further concentrate the brine larger permeate flow rates are needed for recirculation in the lsrro system fig 5b resulting in a larger energy consumption for stream repressurization fig 5a and consequently lead to a larger s e c nevertheless the s e c of the 3 stage lsrro i e 4 75 kwh m 3 is still substantially lower than that of thermal brine concentrators i e 20 kwh m 3 suggesting a prominent advantage of lsrro over thermal brine concentrators in terms of energy efficiency our simulations further show that to achieve the same c b i e 1 89 m the 3 stage lsrro requires a larger s e c but smaller δ p than the 2 stage lsrro fig 5c the brine concentration in each stage can be lowered with more stages being used thereby resulting in a smaller δ p however with a smaller δ p and more stages being used the circulation of the permeate streams in the lsrro system becomes larger fig 5d demanding a larger energy consumption for repressurization therefore for designing an lsrro system the stage number needs to be optimized with regard to the target c b and maximum δ p if the target c b is high and or the maximum δ p is small an lsrro system with more stages should be designed otherwise the number of stages of an lsrro system should be as few as possible for the benefits of low capital and operational costs 5 2 mld zld applications with varying feed salt concentrations to evaluate the performance of lsrro in treating different feeds for mld zld applications the maximum brine concentration c b and the specific energy consumption s e c of a 3 stage lsrro were calculated for various feed salt concentrations c f in the calculations we have used δ p 70 bar and q f 600 l h 1 while the membrane properties in the low salt rejection stages were varied i e a i varied from 6 to 11 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and bi was calculated using b i 0 0133 a i 3 in a 3 stage lsrro system the maximum attainable c b decreases with increasing c f fig 6 a as the maximum δ p is fixed at 70 bar the brine concentration is almost unchanged with c f in the 1st ro stage fig 6a but the brine flow rate increases with increasing c f based on the mass balance of salts i e q b c f q f c b where q b and q f are the flow rates of the brine and feed respectively since the brine from the 1st ro stage serves as the feed of the 2nd lsrro stage the feed flow rate of the 2nd lsrro becomes larger with a higher c f while the feed concentration stays relatively constant thereby resulting in a brine with a lower concentration and larger flow rate in the 2nd lsrro stage likewise the brine from the 2nd lsrro stage serves as the feed of the 3rd lsrro stage consequently leading to a lower c b unlike the maximum attainable c b the corresponding s e c of the 3 stage lsrro increases with increasing c f fig 6a based on eq 5 given a fixed δ p the s e c of an lsrro system is determined by the permeate flow rates in the stages with a higher c f the permeate flow rate from the 1st ro stage q p or q p 1 becomes smaller while the permeate flow rates from the lsrro stages q p 2 and q p 3 are larger fig 6b thereby resulting in a larger s e c the trends of c b and s e c with increasing c f indicate that the performance of lsrro varies with the feed concentration in general lsrro performs better for treating feeds with lower concentrations specifically when treating a 0 1 m feed the maximum c b of the 3 stage lsrro system can exceed 4 m 240 000 mg l tds which already meets the requirement for the inlet brine concentration for a brine crystallizer and the corresponding s e c is only 3 kwh m 3 in such a scenario a 3 stage lsrro can completely replace mechanical vapor compression mvc evaporator for mld zld applications tong and elimelech 2016 davenport et al 2018 while treating feeds with higher feed concentrations i e 0 3 and 0 6 m although the maximum c b of the 3 stage lsrro system cannot reach 4 0 m it is still more than 80 higher than that of a conventional ro 1 3 m and the corresponding s e c 6 kwh m 3 is significantly lower than that of mvc 20 kwh m 3 in such scenarios the use of 3 stage lsrro can still minimize the working load of mvc for mld zld applications thus reducing the overall energy consumption therefore regardless of the feed concentrations lsrro can facilitate mld zld applications 5 3 further considerations like ro lsrro will face some practical challenges membrane fouling and scaling matin et al 2019 lee et al 2010 when dealing with highly concentrated brines lsrro could encounter more severe membrane fouling and scaling issues than conventional ro thus for the practical applications of lsrro effective fouling and scaling mitigation strategies need to be implemented specifically the inlet brines should be adequately pretreated e g ultrafiltration chemical precipitation and ph adjustment ang et al 2011 horseman et al 2021 and or novel membranes with excellent fouling and scaling resistance need to be developed tiraferri et al 2012 guan et al 2020 currently nanofiltration nf membranes are commercially available and could be used as lsrro membranes however the operating pressure of nf membranes is usually lower than 40 bar figoli et al 2010 which will not meet the requirement of lsrro applications thus lsrro membranes that can withstand higher operating pressures still need to be developed as previously discussed lsrro membranes can be made from existing ro membranes through correlating the observed salt rejection with membrane transport properties of ro lsrro membrane modules we propose that desired lsrro modules can be fabricated by tuning the water and salt permeabilities of commercial ro modules via oxidative chemical treatment additionally as figs 2b and 2c show the water flux in the lsrro module might be unevenly distributed which could result in severe fouling on the front part of the membrane module kim and hong 2018 kim park and hong 2020 to mitigate this problem lsrro modules with varied water permeability can be placed in the ro pressure vessel containing the modules song et al 2003 further instead of using new ro modules ro modules at their end of life can be used after chemical treatment as lsrro modules which could reduce the capital cost of the lsrro system in this study we made several assumptions that might reduce the accuracy of the simulation results by using eq 1 we assumed that the mass transfer mechanisms in lsrro membranes can be described by the solution diffusion model although the solution diffusion model has been widely used to describe the mass transfer mechanisms in ro membranes its applicability in lsrro membranes is not confirmed yet as we expect advective contribution to salt transport additionally we assumed negligible pressure loss in the membrane modules and the working efficiency of the erd to be 100 which might slightly underestimate the s e c of lsrro to acquire more accurate estimations of lsrro performance the above assumptions need to be revisited in future studies a techno economic analysis tea of lsrro systems is an important next step for understanding the feasibility of the technology since for a practical implementation of an lsrro system the capital cost is a critical factor that needs to be considered since an lsrro system requires the same components as a multi stage conventional ro system its capital cost should be much lower than that of an mvc system wittholz et al 2008 however to understand the optimal design of an lsrro system the inherent balance in the design must be examined as noted in this study the use of fewer stages in the lsrro system requires a higher pressure in the lsrro modules and reduces the sec of the water produced this introduces a tradeoff in the design of the system higher pressure modules will have a higher capital cost due to higher quality components being required more advanced membranes and more complicated designs to accommodate the higher pressures the high pressure system does however have fewer stages which reduces capital cost the fewer stage designs also have a lower operating cost due to the lower sec this means that there will be an optimal number of stages and pressure for a given situation that must be investigated before specific units begin construction this proposed tea would use number of stages and pressure as linked decision variables with the module capital cost being directly dependent on the operating pressure but the system cost also being dependent on the number of modules the proposed model would be used to calculate the energy expenditures of the system and thus the operating cost of the system over a time horizon of interest it could further use pressure as a variable in estimates of maintenance costs and component lifetimes since lsrro designs are largely proposed at this stage costing and maintenance information would come from the existing ro and hpro industries this type of future analysis will be very helpful in demonstrating the viability of lsrro as a desalination technology under a range of conditions 6 conclusion in this study the design guidelines and system performance of the lsrro process were investigated using module scale analysis for the design of lsrro membrane modules increasing the water and salt permeabilities will monotonically increase the energy consumption but there is a water permeability which will maximize the final brine concentration the operating conditions also have significant impact on the performance of an lsrro system specifically increasing the operating pressure will increase the final brine concentration while also increasing the energy consumption there is an optimal feed flow rate to minimize the energy consumption but increasing the flow rate decreases the final brine concentration importantly although increasing the number of lsrro stages allows for lower operating pressures and can increase the final brine concentration it increases capital cost and energy consumption notably lsrro systems are very sensitive to increasing the feed brine concentration causing the energy consumption to increase and the final brine concentration to decrease based on the findings in this work lsrro can highly concentrate brines and minimize the use of mvc in mld zld applications thereby enabling efficient brine management this work could serve as an important step in the further development and optimization of lsrro systems for practical use declaration of competing interest the authors

16432,low salt rejection reverse osmosis lsrro is a novel reverse osmosis ro based technology that can highly concentrate brines using moderate operating pressures in this study we investigate the performance of lsrro membrane modules and systems using module scale analysis specifically we correlate the observed salt rejection of an lsrro module with the water and salt permeabilities of the ro membrane we then elaborate the impact of membrane properties and operating conditions on the performance of a 2 stage lsrro providing design guidelines for lsrro systems we further compare the performance of 2 stage and 3 stage lsrro systems showing that an lsrro system with more stages is not always favored due to a larger energy consumption the performance of a 3 stage lsrro in treating different feed solutions for minimal zero liquid discharge mld zld applications is then evaluated based on our results when treating feed waters with a relatively low salinity e g 0 1 m or 5 800 mg l 1 nacl the 3 stage lsrro can achieve a concentrated brine that can be directly sent to the thermal brine crystallizers i e brine concentration 4 m or 240 000 mg l 1 nacl and the corresponding specific energy consumption s e c is only 3 kwh m 3 when treating feed waters with a relatively high salinity e g 0 6 m or 35 000 mg l 1 nacl the brine from the 3 stage lsrro can be 80 more concentrated compared to that from conventional ro while the corresponding s e c does not exceed 6 kwh m 3 our results demonstrate that lsrro can substantially advance minimal zero liquid discharge mld zld applications because it can significantly minimize the use of thermal brine concentrators we conclude with a discussion on the practicability of lsrro and highlight future research needs graphical

intensive industrial activities convert massive amounts of freshwater to wastewaters or brines with high salinities hoekstra 2014 holland et al 2015 jones et al 2019 traditional brine disposal pathways include deep well injection evaporation ponds and landfills but these methods are environmentally unfriendly or and economically costly heck et al 2018 panagopoulos haralambous and loizidou 2019 to minimize the negative environmental impacts of brine discharge governments have launched stringent discharge regulations bond and veerapaneni 2008 vishnu palanisamy and joseph 2008 xie li and zhao 2010 jiang 2015 zero liquid discharge zld is an ambitious brine management strategy aiming to simultaneously eliminate liquid brine discharge and recover all freshwater from brine tong and elimelech 2016 yaqub and lee 2019 the implementation of zld not only minimizes the environmental risks associated with brine discharge but also maximizes the freshwater utilization efficiency state of the art zld systems are based on reverse osmosis ro followed by thermal evaporators where the brine is first concentrated by ro followed by thermal brine concentration to over 200 000 mg l total dissolved solids tds and complete evaporation of water by thermal crystallizers bond and veerapaneni 2008 tong and elimelech 2016 however the applications of zld are severely limited due to the high capital and operational costs of thermal brine concentrators and crystallizers jamil and zubair 2017 liu bi and cui 2020 zhao et al 2011 to advance the applications of zld the use of thermal brine concentrators needs to be minimized or eliminated specifically the brine needs to be concentrated by ro as much as possible so that it can be directly sent to the thermal crystallizer however based on the working principles of ro the maximum brine concentration is limited by the applied hydraulic pressure tong and elimelech 2016 davenport et al 2018 to avoid detrimental effects of operating pressures on membranes and modules in conventional seawater ro the operating pressure cannot exceed 85 bar corresponding to a maximum brine concentration of 1 6 m i e 90 000 mg l tds nacl davenport et al 2018 baker 2012 chen and yip 2018 which is much lower than the required influent concentration for most thermal crystallizers i e 240 000 mg l tds davenport et al 2018 recently membrane modules that can sustain 120 bar hydraulic pressures have been developed with which a maximum brine concentration of 2 1 m i e 120 000 mg l tds can be obtained davenport et al 2018 schantz et al 2018 davenport et al 2020 however such a brine concentration is still much lower than the requirement for the feed for thermal crystallizers to overcome the limit of operating pressure in conventional ro we have recently introduced a novel staged ro configuration using low salt rejection ro modules referred to as low salt rejection ro lsrro wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 an n stage lsrro system comprises one conventional ro module and n 1 lsrro modules fig 1 the conventional ro is used in the first stage and the lsrro modules are used in the subsequent stages during operation the pressurized brine at each stage is sent to the next stage as feed for further concentration while the unpressurized permeate is repressurized and cycled back to the previous stage as an additional feed for re concentration freshwater is produced from the first stage and the final concentrated brine is discharged from the last stage after recovering the embedded energy in the stream by an energy recovery device erd for a given operating pressure lsrro can attain a much higher brine concentration than conventional ro because the osmotic pressure of the brine is mediated by the salty permeate in the lsrro modules using process modeling we demonstrated that lsrro can theoretically achieve brine concentrations over 4 m using an operating pressure of 70 bar and that the energy consumption of lsrro is far less than that of thermal brine concentrators wang et al 2020 however although simplified process modeling can effectively evaluate the performance of lsrro systems it cannot provide detailed parameters for system design wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 specifically via process modeling the observed salt rejection rate of each stage can be obtained but the detailed design parameters that determine the observed salt rejection rate i e membrane properties and system operating conditions remain unknown therefore there is a critical need to conduct a rigorous module scale analysis to determine the detailed design parameters for lsrro systems moreover the simplified process modeling in the previous studies contains idealized assumptions that compromise the accuracy of the simulation results whereas the module scale analysis can provide simulation results that are relevant to the practical operation of lsrro in this study we perform a module scale analysis of lsrro systems to provide design guidelines and accurately evaluate system performance we first show that the observed salt rejection of an lsrro module can be tuned based on the water and salt permeabilities of the ro membrane next we demonstrate the design guidelines for the lsrro system by elucidating the impact of membrane properties and operating conditions on the performance of a two stage lsrro system we then assess the performance of lsrro systems in mld zld applications with varying stage numbers and feed brine concentrations we conclude with highlighting the potential of implementing lsrro technology in practice and the critical need for future technology development 2 model development we start our analysis by calculating the local mass transport of water and salt through the ro lsrro membranes these local water and salt fluxes can be integrated over the entire membrane area to determine the performance of the membrane module by incorporating the module scale analysis into system scale analysis the performance of an lsrro system can be evaluated we note that all the simulations in this study are assumed to be under steady state 2 1 water and salt transport

the membrane module s is the membrane area from the module entrance to the position being described normalized by the total membrane area a m combining and solving eqs 1 and 2 we can obtain the flow rates and concentrations of the permeate and brine flowing out of the membrane module 3a q b o u t q f 1 3b c b o u t c f 1 3c q p o u t a m 0 1 j w s d s 3d c p o u t 0 1 j s s d s 0 1 j w s d s where q b o u t and c b o u t are the flow rate and concentration of the brine flowing out of the membrane module i e s 1 respectively and q p o u t and c p o u t are the flow rate and concentration of the permeate flowing out of the membrane module respectively 2 3 system analysis of lsrro in an n stage lsrro system water and salt transport between adjacent stages can be related based on the working principles of lsrro fig 1 4a q f i q b i 1 q p i 1 4b c f i c b i 1 q b i 1 c p i 1 q p i 1 q b i 1 q p i 1 where q f i and c f i are the flow rate and salt concentration of the feed flowing

concentration of the permeate flowing out of the i th stage respectively the flow rate and concentration of the feed flowing into the lsrro system are q f and c f respectively in the nth stage q f n q b n 1 and c f n c b n 1 combining and solving eqs 1 4 we can acquire the flow rates and concentrations of all streams in the lsrro system since the purpose of lsrro is to highly concentrate the feed i e minimize the brine volume the final brine concentration c b and the specific energy consumption s e c are used as the performance metrics of an lsrro system we note that other performance metrics e g final brine flow rate q b can be calculated from these two metrics detailed information in supplementary material because the final brine stream flows out of the last stage c b c b n in lsrro s e c is defined as the energy consumption normalized by the volume reduction of the feed the volume reduction of the feed is essentially equivalent to the volume of permeate produced in the 1st stage thus the s e c of an n stage lsrro can be calculated as detailed derivation in supplementary material 5 s e c δ p q p i 2 n q p i q p δ p 1 i 2 n q p i q p where q p is the permeate flow rate of the lsrro system and q p q p 1 the observed salt rejection of the i th stage r i o b s is an important design parameter in lsrro we calculated the observed salt rejection using 6 r i o b s 1 c p i c f i 3 design guidelines for lsrro modules 3 1 observed salt rejection of lsrro modules with tuned membrane properties in previous studies the observed salt rejection rates of the lsrro modules r o b s were used to evaluate the performance of lsrro systems wang et al 2020 wang et al 2021 however r o b s cannot directly guide the fabrication of desired lsrro modules because it is not an intrinsic property of ro lsrro membranes freeman 1999 geise et al 2011 geise paul and freeman 2014 in other words r o b s is influenced by the operating conditions such as applied hydraulic pressure crossflow velocity and feed salt concentration herein we correlated r o b s with two intrinsic properties of tfc membranes the water permeability coefficient a and salt permeability coefficient b the variation of r o b s with the a and b coefficients is demonstrated in fig 2 a for a given b coefficient r o b s only slightly decreases with increasing a coefficient whereas for a given a coefficient r o b s drastically decreases with increasing b coefficient such results suggest that r o b s is more dependent on the b coefficient than the a coefficient the weak dependence of r o b s on the a coefficient can be attributed to concentration polarization cp which has been extensively studied in conventional ro patel et al 2020 werber deshmukh and elimelech 2016 specifically with a fixed b coefficient increasing the a coefficient would result in a higher osmotic pressure at the membrane surface on the feed side due to cp consequently leading to a relatively constant j w and j s eq 1 and fig 2b according to eq 3d the relatively constant j w and j s result in a relatively constant c p and thus a relatively stable r o b s eq 6 the strong dependence of r o b s on the b coefficient can be explained by the principles of water and salt transport through lsrro membranes eq 1 based on eq 1b a larger b coefficient results in a larger j s since a larger j s reduces the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane j w would increase for a fixed a coefficient eq 1a as shown in fig 2c both j s and j w increase with increasing b coefficient however the increase of j s is much more significant than that of j w thereby resulting in a substantially increased c p eq 3d a substantially increased c p corresponds to a markedly decreased r o b s eq 6 based on the above analysis we propose that lsrro membrane modules with desired r o b s can be fabricated by tuning the b coefficient of commercial ro membranes 3 2 facile fabrication of lsrro modules polyamide tfc membranes are the state of the art membranes for ro technology elimelech and phillip 2011 lu and elimelech 2021 werber osuji and elimelech 2016 previous studies have demonstrated a permeability selectivity trade off relationship for tfc membranes where the a and b coefficients are interrelated werber deshmukh and elimelech 2016 freeman 1999 geise paul and freeman 2014 in previous studies commercial polyamide ro membranes were modified via chlorine alkaline treatment to generate loose ro membranes with a range of different membrane transport properties yip and elimelech 2011 chen boo and yip 2021 raval et al 2010 zhai et al 2011 based on the measured properties of the modified membranes a correlation between the a and b coefficients for polyamide tfc membranes was established yip and elimelech 2011 7 b 0 0133 a 3 eq 7 is plotted in fig 2a to demonstrate the range of possible r o b s for polyamide based lsrro membranes as the a coefficient increases from 2 to 10 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 r o b s decreases from 100 to 15 indicating that polyamide based lsrro membranes can be fabricated via chlorine alkaline treatment of commercial polyamide ro membranes in this study we assumed that lsrro membranes obey the permeability selectivity tradeoff and eq 7 was used exclusively to describe the lsrro membrane properties in the following analysis 4 performance of two stage lsrro system 4 1 impact of membrane properties on the performance of a 2 stage lsrro system to demonstrate the design guidelines for lsrro systems we further elucidate the impact of membrane properties on the performance of a 2 stage lsrro system the final brine concentration c b and the corresponding specific energy consumption s e c of the 2 stage lsrro as a function of the membrane properties of the lsrro stage are shown in fig 3 a the feed salt concentration for the lsrro system in these simulations was fixed at 0 6 m 35 000 mg l nacl as the a 2 and b 2 permeability coefficients increase c b first increases approaching a maximum value and then decreases according to the design guidelines of lsrro modules larger a 2 and b 2 coefficients correspond to a lower observed salt rejection r o b s of the lsrro module fig 2a based on fig 3b a lower r o b s in an lsrro module results in a larger permeate flow rate q p 2 and higher permeate concentration c p 2 on the one hand a larger q p 2 provides additional feed water for the first ro stage and thus more freshwater could be recovered consequently leading to a higher c b on the other hand a higher c p 2 would increase the overall feed concentration for the first ro stage this may reduce the recovery rate of freshwater and result in a lower c b due to the interplay between q p 2 and c p 2 the final brine concentration c b becomes a concave function of the a 2 and b 2 coefficients unlike c b s e c increases monotonically with increasing the a 2 and b 2 coefficients as previously discussed larger a 2 and b 2 coefficients correspond to a lower r o b s and consequently lead to larger q p 2 and higher c p 2 fig 3b the interplay between q p 2 and c p 2 renders the permeate flow rate of freshwater q p relatively constant fig 3b with increasing q p 2 and constant q p the ratio of q p 2 to q p i e q p 2 q p increases since s e c is proportional to q p 2 q p eq 5 it increases with higher values of a 2 and b 2 coefficients according to the analysis above to produce highly concentrated brines the membrane properties in each lsrro stage need to be optimized specifically for the 2 stage lsrro system to achieve the highest c b fig 3a the optimal a 2 and b 2 coefficients are 6 95 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and 4 46 l m 2 h 1 respectively with these a 2 and b 2 coefficients c b can attain 1 89 m which is 44 higher than that from a conventional one stage ro system i e c b 1 31 m for a 2 2 5 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and b 2 0 21 l m 2 h 1 and the corresponding s e c is 3 45 kwh m 3 which is far lower than that of thermal brine concentrators i e 20 kwh m 3 4 2 impact of feed flow rate on the performance of 2 stage lsrro in addition to membrane properties the performance of an lsrro system is also influenced by the operating conditions the impact of feed flow rate q f on c b and s e c of a 2 stage lsrro system is shown in fig 4 a as q f increases c b decreases while s e c remains relatively constant a larger q f corresponds to a shorter hydraulic retention time of the feed in the lsrro system resulting in a less concentrated brine thus c b decreases with increasing q f with a larger q f the brine from the 1st stage becomes less concentrated according to the working principles of lsrro the brine from the 1st stage serves as the feed for the 2nd stage with a less concentrated feed the permeate flow rate of the 2nd stage i e q p 2 becomes larger hence the overall effect is that q p 2 increases with increasing q f since both q p and q p 2 increase with increasing q f their ratio q p 2 q p remains relatively unchanged resulting in a relatively constant s e c with increasing q f eq 5 according to fig 4a as q f is reduced from 1200 to 300 l h 1 c b is increased from 1 27 to 2 63 m while s e c remains relatively constant around 3 7 kwh m 3 such results suggest that a smaller q f is always preferred in lsrro operation however in practical applications a smaller q f enhances concentration polarization consequently leading to more severe fouling and scaling in the membrane modules hoek kim and elimelech 2002 matin et al 2019 therefore a moderate q f that balances the hydraulic retention time and concentration polarization would be favored for the design of a practical lsrro system 4 3 impact of hydraulic pressure on the performance of 2 stage lsrro hydraulic pressure δ p is another important operating parameter that can significantly influence the performance of lsrro fig 4b presents the impact of δ p on the performance of a 2 stage lsrro system showing that both c b and s e c increase monotonically with increasing δ p based on the working principle of ro as δ p increases more freshwater can be recovered thereby resulting in a higher c b according to eq 5 s e c is proportional to δ p leading to an increase of s e c with increasing δ p based on fig 4b to achieve higher brine concentrations in lsrro a larger δ p is needed which also increases s e c to avoid detrimental effects of operating pressures on conventional state of the art ro modules δ p cannot exceed 85 bar corresponding to a maximum c b of 2 3 m in 2 stage lsrro systems as mentioned previously high pressure ro modules that can withstand a δ p of 120 bar have been recently developed davenport et al 2018 schantz et al 2018 davenport et al 2020 with such modules being applied in the 2 stage lsrro system a maximum c b of 3 19 m can be obtained which is 39 higher than that from an lsrro system with conventional modules i e δ p of 85 bar in this case the corresponding s e c is 5 39 kwh m 3 which is only 27 of that of thermal brine concentrators i e 20 kwh m 3 5 multi stage lsrro system for zld mld applications 5 1 brine concentration of lsrro system with varying stage numbers in the previous section we demonstrated that a 2 stage lsrro system can efficiently produce hypersaline brines with reasonable energy input however the final brine concentration from a 2 stage lsrro system is typically around 1 9 m 110 000 mg l nacl to achieve a higher brine concentration the performance of a 3 stage lsrro system was evaluated in this section in our calculations the maximum δ p was set at 70 bar q f was fixed at 600 l h 1 the membrane area in each stage was fixed at 10 m2 the water permeabilities of the low rejection modules a i varied from 6 to 11 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and the corresponding salt permeabilities of the low salt rejection modules b i were calculated with a i using eq 7 the maximum brine concentrations c b of the 2 stage lsrro and 3 stage lsrro systems as well as the corresponding s e c are shown in fig 5 a with an additional stage being used the 3 stage lsrro can achieve a more concentrated brine compared to the 2 stage lsrro based on the working principle of lsrro with an additional lsrro stage the final brine can be further concentrated because its osmotic pressure can be further mediated by the permeate of the additional stage notably to achieve a more concentrated brine with the 3 stage lsrro a larger s e c is required fig 5a although the 3rd lsrro stage can further concentrate the brine larger permeate flow rates are needed for recirculation in the lsrro system fig 5b resulting in a larger energy consumption for stream repressurization fig 5a and consequently lead to a larger s e c nevertheless the s e c of the 3 stage lsrro i e 4 75 kwh m 3 is still substantially lower than that of thermal brine concentrators i e 20 kwh m 3 suggesting a prominent advantage of lsrro over thermal brine concentrators in terms of energy efficiency our simulations further show that to achieve the same c b i e 1 89 m the 3 stage lsrro requires a larger s e c but smaller δ p than the 2 stage lsrro fig 5c the brine concentration in each stage can be lowered with more stages being used thereby resulting in a smaller δ p however with a smaller δ p and more stages being used the circulation of the permeate streams in the lsrro system becomes larger fig 5d demanding a larger energy consumption for repressurization therefore for designing an lsrro system the stage number needs to be optimized with regard to the target c b and maximum δ p if the target c b is high and or the maximum δ p is small an lsrro system with more stages should be designed otherwise the number of stages of an lsrro system should be as few as possible for the benefits of low capital and operational costs 5 2 mld zld applications with varying feed salt concentrations to evaluate the performance of lsrro in treating different feeds for mld zld applications the maximum brine concentration c b and the specific energy consumption s e c of a 3 stage lsrro were calculated for various feed salt concentrations c f in the calculations we have used δ p 70 bar and q f 600 l h 1 while the membrane properties in the low salt rejection stages were varied i e a i varied from 6 to 11 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 and bi was calculated using b i 0 0133 a i 3 in a 3 stage lsrro system the maximum attainable c b decreases with increasing c f fig 6 a as the maximum δ p is fixed at 70 bar the brine concentration is almost unchanged with c f in the 1st ro stage fig 6a but the brine flow rate increases with increasing c f based on the mass balance of salts i e q b c f q f c b where q b and q f are the flow rates of the brine and feed respectively since the brine from the 1st ro stage serves as the feed of the 2nd lsrro stage the feed flow rate of the 2nd lsrro becomes larger with a higher c f while the feed concentration stays relatively constant thereby resulting in a brine with a lower concentration and larger flow rate in the 2nd lsrro stage likewise the brine from the 2nd lsrro stage serves as the feed of the 3rd lsrro stage consequently leading to a lower c b unlike the maximum attainable c b the corresponding s e c of the 3 stage lsrro increases with increasing c f fig 6a based on eq 5 given a fixed δ p the s e c of an lsrro system is determined by the permeate flow rates in the stages with a higher c f the permeate flow rate from the 1st ro stage q p or q p 1 becomes smaller while the permeate flow rates from the lsrro stages q p 2 and q p 3 are larger fig 6b thereby resulting in a larger s e c the trends of c b and s e c with increasing c f indicate that the performance of lsrro varies with the feed concentration in general lsrro performs better for treating feeds with lower concentrations specifically when treating a 0 1 m feed the maximum c b of the 3 stage lsrro system can exceed 4 m 240 000 mg l tds which already meets the requirement for the inlet brine concentration for a brine crystallizer and the corresponding s e c is only 3 kwh m 3 in such a scenario a 3 stage lsrro can completely replace mechanical vapor compression mvc evaporator for mld zld applications tong and elimelech 2016 davenport et al 2018 while treating feeds with higher feed concentrations i e 0 3 and 0 6 m although the maximum c b of the 3 stage lsrro system cannot reach 4 0 m it is still more than 80 higher than that of a conventional ro 1 3 m and the corresponding s e c 6 kwh m 3 is significantly lower than that of mvc 20 kwh m 3 in such scenarios the use of 3 stage lsrro can still minimize the working load of mvc for mld zld applications thus reducing the overall energy consumption therefore regardless of the feed concentrations lsrro can facilitate mld zld applications 5 3 further considerations like ro lsrro will face some practical challenges membrane fouling and scaling matin et al 2019 lee et al 2010 when dealing with highly concentrated brines lsrro could encounter more severe membrane fouling and scaling issues than conventional ro thus for the practical applications of lsrro effective fouling and scaling mitigation strategies need to be implemented specifically the inlet brines should be adequately pretreated e g ultrafiltration chemical precipitation and ph adjustment ang et al 2011 horseman et al 2021 and or novel membranes with excellent fouling and scaling resistance need to be developed tiraferri et al 2012 guan et al 2020 currently nanofiltration nf membranes are commercially available and could be used as lsrro membranes however the operating pressure of nf membranes is usually lower than 40 bar figoli et al 2010 which will not meet the requirement of lsrro applications thus lsrro membranes that can withstand higher operating pressures still need to be developed as previously discussed lsrro membranes can be made from existing ro membranes through correlating the observed salt rejection with membrane transport properties of ro lsrro membrane modules we propose that desired lsrro modules can be fabricated by tuning the water and salt permeabilities of commercial ro modules via oxidative chemical treatment additionally as figs 2b and 2c show the water flux in the lsrro module might be unevenly distributed which could result in severe fouling on the front part of the membrane module kim and hong 2018 kim park and hong 2020 to mitigate this problem lsrro modules with varied water permeability can be placed in the ro pressure vessel containing the modules song et al 2003 further instead of using new ro modules ro modules at their end of life can be used after chemical treatment as lsrro modules which could reduce the capital cost of the lsrro system in this study we made several assumptions that might reduce the accuracy of the simulation results by using eq 1 we assumed that the mass transfer mechanisms in lsrro membranes can be described by the solution diffusion model although the solution diffusion model has been widely used to describe the mass transfer mechanisms in ro membranes its applicability in lsrro membranes is not confirmed yet as we expect advective contribution to salt transport additionally we assumed negligible pressure loss in the membrane modules and the working efficiency of the erd to be 100 which might slightly underestimate the s e c of lsrro to acquire more accurate estimations of lsrro performance the above assumptions need to be revisited in future studies a techno economic analysis tea of lsrro systems is an important next step for understanding the feasibility of the technology since for a practical implementation of an lsrro system the capital cost is a critical factor that needs to be considered since an lsrro system requires the same components as a multi stage conventional ro system its capital cost should be much lower than that of an mvc system wittholz et al 2008 however to understand the optimal design of an lsrro system the inherent balance in the design must be examined as noted in this study the use of fewer stages in the lsrro system requires a higher pressure in the lsrro modules and reduces the sec of the water produced this introduces a tradeoff in the design of the system higher pressure modules will have a higher capital cost due to higher quality components being required more advanced membranes and more complicated designs to accommodate the higher pressures the high pressure system does however have fewer stages which reduces capital cost the fewer stage designs also have a lower operating cost due to the lower sec this means that there will be an optimal number of stages and pressure for a given situation that must be investigated before specific units begin construction this proposed tea would use number of stages and pressure as linked decision variables with the module capital cost being directly dependent on the operating pressure but the system cost also being dependent on the number of modules the proposed model would be used to calculate the energy expenditures of the system and thus the operating cost of the system over a time horizon of interest it could further use pressure as a variable in estimates of maintenance costs and component lifetimes since lsrro designs are largely proposed at this stage costing and maintenance information would come from the existing ro and hpro industries this type of future analysis will be very helpful in demonstrating the viability of lsrro as a desalination technology under a range of conditions 6 conclusion in this study the design guidelines and system performance of the lsrro process were investigated using module scale analysis for the design of lsrro membrane modules increasing the water and salt permeabilities will monotonically increase the energy consumption but there is a water permeability which will maximize the final brine concentration the operating conditions also have significant impact on the performance of an lsrro system specifically increasing the operating pressure will increase the final brine concentration while also increasing the energy consumption there is an optimal feed flow rate to minimize the energy consumption but increasing the flow rate decreases the final brine concentration importantly although increasing the number of lsrro stages allows for lower operating pressures and can increase the final brine concentration it increases capital cost and energy consumption notably lsrro systems are very sensitive to increasing the feed brine concentration causing the energy consumption to increase and the final brine concentration to decrease based on the findings in this work lsrro can highly concentrate brines and minimize the use of mvc in mld zld applications thereby enabling efficient brine management this work could serve as an important step in the further development and optimization of lsrro systems for practical use declaration of competing interest the authors

fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir confirmed the oxidation of smp polysaccharides in zvi gacs mbr the iron ions released from zvi gacs showed inhibition on the secretion of smp eps proteins floc particle size distribution psd and x ray diffraction xrd spectrum confirmed that the coagulation effects of fe oh 3 and feooh triggered by fe3 increased the sludge floc size and contributed to membrane fouling mitigation genus enterococcus was enriched in mbr with the destruction of phens by the zvi gacs initiated radical generation process the findings of this study confirmed successful development and adoption of zvi gacs into mbr for bio refractory iww treatment it also provided an in depth understanding on the mechanisms of zvi gacs mbr system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane bioreactor mbr bio refractory industrial wastewater micro scale zvi gacs iron carbon galvanic cells fe 0 c membrane fouling soluble microbial products 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr is an innovative bio technology for wastewater treatment it possesses the superiorities of high organic load low sludge production high extreme environment resistance and economic space occupation over the traditional biological wastewater treatment processes meng et al 2017 mutamim et al 2013 studies have verified the better organic removal performance of mbr compared to the traditional activated sludge as processes in the treatment of domestic wastewater dww fenu et al 2010 phenolic wastewater deng et al 2021 tannery wastewater luján facundo et al 2018 coking wastewater jiang et al 2017 etc however in the treatment of industrial wastewater iww with high concentration of bio refractory organic compounds even the well acclimatized microorganisms in mbr showed low degradation capacity due to the low biodegradability and the inhibitory effects of these compounds deng et al 2021 luján facundo et al 2018 therefore further enhancement on mbr is required for the treatment of bio refractory iww moreover membrane fouling has been an inevitable issue in the application of mbr especially in the treatment of iww containing high concentrations of toxic organics and metals deowan et al 2016 huang et al 2019 membrane fouling markedly deteriorated membrane filtration performance and reduced membrane lifespan thereby increasing the operating cost of mbr system soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps which mainly consist of polysaccharides and proteins have been identified as the two major membrane foulants in mbr the polysaccharides and proteins performed strong promotion on the cake layer formation on the membrane surface meng et al 2017 moreover studies have verified that the contamination of bio refractory organics and toxic substances could speed up the secretion of eps and smp hao et al 2016 luján facundo et al 2018 it is a toxicity resistance mechanism of microorganisms but has resulted in a significantly aggravated membrane fouling deowan et al 2016 huang et al 2019 thus the enhancement of mbr in bio refractory iww treatment should take both the improvement of treatment efficiency and the control of membrane fouling into consideration among the potential technologies for enhancing iww treatment iron carbon galvanic cells fe 0 c has been identified as an efficient cost effective and easy to use method to strengthen the as systems for the treatment of textile wastewater sun et al 2019 caprolactam wastewater gedam et al 2014 ionic liquids zhou et al 2013 landfill leachate ying et al 2012 etc basically when the zero valent iron zvi particles are connected with the activated carbon ac in water or solutions galvanic cells could be formed with an zvi anode eq 1 and eq 2 and an ac cathode eq 3 allowing a current from ac to zvi electrons from zvi to gac and providing a voltage of up to 1 21 v fig s1 in the supplementary information deng et al 2020 jia et al 2020 with this voltage 1 electron reduction of h2o could be initiated cathodic reduction of h eq 3 and activated hydrogen h could be generated jia et al 2020 o brien 1964 zhou et al 2013 with the presence of oxygen o2 under aerobic condition oxygen competes as electron acceptor which could be reduced by the h and generate h2o2 via eq 4 sun et al 2019 ying et al 2012 the in situ generated h2o2 will subsequently react with the ferrous ions fe2 which is known as the fenton reaction eq 5 with the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh harada et al 2016 sun et al 2019 this radical generation process initiated by the fe 0 c galvanic cells has shown significant enhancement on the organic carbon degradation as well as the improvement on biodegradability of wastewater sun et al 2019 ying et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 1

relevant study has been conducted to investigate the impact of the fe 0 c galvanic cells on performance and membrane fouling of mbr on one hand the radical generation process initiated by the fe 0 c galvanic cells has the potential to enhance the oxidation of bio refractory organics in mbr on the other hand the enhanced degradation of bio refractory organic compounds could reduce the bio toxicity of the mixed liquor in mbr it is expected to reduce the secretion of smp and eps thereby mitigating the membrane fouling deng et al 2021 moreover the generated iron ions fe2 and fe3 from the fe 0 c galvanic cells are essential mineral nutrients for biomass growth and indispensable components for certain enzymes huang et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the research of huang et al 2019 has also proved that the accumulation of smp and eps could be reduced by adding ferric salts and the sludge flocs could be enhanced with the flocculation effect of fe3 both of which has contributed to the mitigation of membrane fouling therefore it is attractive to apply the fe 0 c galvanic cells for mbr enhancement and study should be performed to investigate the performance as well as the mechanisms of the fe 0 c galvanic cells enhanced mbr in this study a micro scale fe 0 c galvanic cells enclosed media zvi gacs was first developed by doping micro scale zvi onto granular activated carbon gac utilizing the formation process of calcium hydroxide crystal ca h or c h shahbazpanahi et al 2021 and hydrated calcium silicate ca si h or c s h alizadeh et al 2011 it was applied to enhance mbr for the treatment of a phenolic compounds phens contaminated bio refractory iww the aims of this study are to 1 evaluate the enhancement of the zvi gacs based fe 0 c galvanic cells on organics removal phens degradation bio toxicity reduction and its improvement on bio activity in bio refractory iww treatment 2 apply the zvi gacs into mbr system and investigate its influence on the performance and membrane fouling characteristics of mbr and 3 reveal the enclosed mechanisms on the performance enhancement and membrane fouling mitigation by zvi gacs the variation of microbiological community constitutions was explored based on 16s rrna for a better understanding of the enhancement of zvi gacs on the robustness of mbr for bio refractory iww treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents materials and the

which no h2o2 was observed in the gac group a relatively low level of h2o2 0 10 mg l was detected in the zvi group which is in accord with the research of harada et al 2016 who utilized nano zvi particles to generate h2o2 and the follow up oh as shown in fig 1 f oh was also detected in the zvi group with the decay of p cba k 1 0 007 min 1 the zvi gacs group has a much higher h2o2 production 0 41 mg l and oh generation rate comparing to the zvi group obtaining k 1 of 0 040 min 1 it is noteworthy that there is a decrease in the h2o2 concentrations of both zvi group and zvi gacs group after reaching their peak concentrations fig 1 e it could be attributed to the increase of fe2 concentration shown in fig s4 in the first 15 min reaction which could catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 generating oh eq 5 harada et al 2016 sun et al 2019 after 15 min the fe2 concentrations remained relatively stable reaching an equilibrium between its generation and consumption fig s4 comparatively the zvi gacs group stabled at a much higher h2o2 concentration of 0 19 0 28 mg l than the zvi group 0 02 0 05 mg l the results confirmed that the proposed preparation process of zvi gacs was applicable and demonstrated the successful formation of fe 0 c galvanic cells in zvi gacs 3 1 2 organic removal and phens degradation batch tests of phens degradation and toc removal were carried out with groups as gac as 5 zvi as 5 zvi gacs as 5 zvi gacs as 10 and zvi gacs as 20 control experiment with gac adsorption was conducted by directly dosing gac into wastewater the variations of toc level and phens concentration are shown in fig 2 the adsorption experiment showed that gac adsorption could only achieve toc and phens removal efficiencies of less than 15 demonstrating that degradation was the dominant mechanism of organics removal as fig 2 shows dosing gac into as slightly increased the toc and phens removal rate compared to bare as which confirmed the effect of gac adsorption dosing of zvi particles into as also showed a slight enhancement on toc and phens removal this result agreed well with the literature that the iron ions fe2 fe3 released from zvi are essential mineral nutrients for microorganisms which are capable to stimulate microbial growth and metabolisms chen et al 2018 it was noted that zvi gacs showed more obvious enhancement on organics degradation than gac and zvi the group zvi gacs as 5 obtained k 2 of 0 17 h 1 which was higher than the groups as 0 11 h 1 gac as 5 0 12 h 1 and zvi as 5 0 13 h 1 as fig 2 c and d shows zvi gacs also exhibited a considerable enhancement on phens degradation group zvi gacs as 5 possessed a much higher k 3 of 0 36 h 1 comparing to groups as 0 24 h 1 gac as 5 0 28 h 1 and zvi as 5 0 30 h 1 respectively at reaction time of 8 h the concentration of phens was reduced to 58 19 mg l in group zvi gacs as 5 while that was 213 53 mg l in as group when increasing the packing volume of zvi gacs a further improvement on organic degradation rate was observed in groups zvi gacs as 10 and zvi gacs as 20 k 2 increased to 0 21 and 0 23 h 1 respectively and k 3 increased to 0 49 and 0 57 h 1 respectively these results demonstrated that the fe 0 c galvanic cells has been successfully introduced into bio system by packing zvi gacs media which effectively generated h eqs 1 3 and enhanced h2o2 production under aerobic condition eq 4 ying et al 2012 therefore fenton reaction eq 5 could be initiated via the reaction between the in situ generated h2o2 and fe2 and the destroying of carbon chains of bio refractory organics could be enhanced thereby improving the biodegradability gedam et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 additionally the released fe2 fe3 could enhance the microbial growth and strengthen the metabolism chen et al 2018 huang et al 2019 which also benefited organic removal the enhancement of on zvi gacs on bio activity has been investigated in section 3 1 3 researches have applied the fe 0 c galvanic cells on biological organic removal from iww e g textile wastewater sun et al 2019 and methyl ethyl ketone zhu et al 2014 caprolactam wastewater gedam et al 2014 landfill leachate ying et al 2012 and the phens contaminated coal gasification wastewater ma et al 2018 but they usually directly packed the mixture of zvi and gac into the system which limited the formation of fe 0 c galvanic cells this study first confirmed the successful application of micro scale galvanic cells into bio system with the zvi gacs media and specific phens degradation rates of 7 8 and 9 7 mg g mlss h were achieved at packing volume percentages of 10 and 20 respectively while 4 6 mg g mlss h was calculated from the research of ma et al 2018 which utilized parking volume percentage of 40 it indicated that the zvi gacs exhibited a stronger enhancement on bio refractory compounds degradation with lower parking volume and demonstrated the successful development of zvi gacs 3 1 3 bio activity enhancement and bio toxicity reduction the sour test was conducted to assess the activity of aerobic as park et al 2018 it was noted from fig 3 a that the sour of the domestic as decreased from 3 7 to 1 8 mg o2 g mlvss h when iww was fed which demonstrated a remarkable decrease of bio activity the study of deng et al 2021 verified that the bio toxicity of water showed significant correlation p 0 02 with the concentration of phens in this study a 15 min acute bio toxicity of 28 9 37 1 was detected at the phens range of 525 1005 mg l these results demonstrated that phens showed severe inhibition on the biomass in iww treatment as fig 3 a shows the zvi as 5 group obtained higher sour 2 2 mg o2 g mlvss h than groups gac as 5 and as however the three groups showed no significant difference in the reduction of bio toxicity of the wastewater fig 3 b it indicated that the addition of zvi improved the bio toxicity resistance and maintained the bio activity of biomass chen et al 2018 and völker et al 2016 verified that the fe2 fe3 could exert a crucial role in the chains of electron transfer and the oxidoreductases prosthetic groups it was also demonstrated that fe2 fe3 could act as the active center of many enzymes that are essential for the cellular activities deng et al 2020 ma et al 2018 e g the dehydrogenase which is essential for the recycle of ubiquinone eq 8 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide eq 9 moreover the in situ generated h could also enhance the recirculation eq 8 8 2 h r or h uq deh uq h 2 r 9 2 nad uq h 2 2 nadh uq where h r is organic carbon deh is dehydrogenase uq is ubiquinone nad is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nadh is the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide a more obvious improvement of sour was observed when parking zvi gacs into the system comparing to group zvi as 5 group zvi gacs as 5 obtained a higher sour of 2 5 mg o2 g mlvss h moreover a significant p 0 04 decrease in bio toxicity in group zvi gacs as 5 was also observed fig 3 b it indicated that the reduction of bio toxicity by enhancing phens degradation shown in fig 2 c also contributed to the improvement of bio activity of the biomass as fig 3 shows the increase of zvi gacs parking volume percentage to 10 further reduced the bio toxicity and improved the sour to 3 3 mg o2 g mlvss h nonetheless sour decreased to 2 7 o2 g mlvss h when parking volume percentage was raised to 20 fig 3 a this would be due to the overdosing of zvi gacs leading to a high generation of h2o2 and oh which could destroy the microorganism cells bianco et al 2017 therefore the zvi gacs parking volume percentage of 10 was applied to the zvi gacs mbr process 3 2 the performance and membrane fouling of zvi gacs mbr the control mbr days 1 67 and zvi gacs mbr days 68 135 were operated to investigate the influence of zvi gacs on mbr in bio refractory iww treatment fig 4 steady stage i was achieved after a 10 day start up process by inoculating das the zvi gacs media was packed into the mbr system on the operational day 68 and 11 days was cost to reach steady stage ii as fig 4 a shows the effluent cod decreased when the zvi gacs media was packed under the same operation condition the zvi gacs mbr obtained a lower effluent cod of 253 85 mg l than the control mbr 737 162 mg l meanwhile zvi gacs mbr has a cod of 322 106 mg l and control mbr has a cod of 881 187 mg l in the mixed liquor indicating that the organic compounds were mainly removed by degradation instead of membrane filtration comparatively the cod removal of mbr was improved from 78 4 to 91 9 by dosing zvi gacs 10 meanwhile a significant p 0 04 reduction of effluent phens from 194 72 to 24 9 mg l was observed fig 4 b with phens removal enhancement from 74 9 to 96 6 previous studies e g ying et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 and ma et al 2018 also demonstrated the improvement of organics removal by fe 0 c galvanic cells in the continuously operated bio systems among them ma et al 2018 treated the phens contaminated iww with a biological aerated filter utilizing the commercial iron carbon media however lower cod 86 5 and phens 88 3 removal had been achieved even with a long hrt of 24 h and high packing volume percentage of 40 the results confirmed the successful set up and operation of zvi gacs mbr with zvi gacs media the change of tmp was monitored throughout the continuous operation to assess the membrane fouling behavior of mbr as fig 4 c shows zvi gacs extended the membrane fouling cycle of mbr the zvi gacs mbr reached the critical tmp 30 kpa with an average fouling cycle of 118 7 h whereas the control mbr took only 69 3 h it demonstrated that the membrane fouling was delayed by 70 7 studies have demonstrated that the toxic substances caused the rapid accumulations of smp and eps which resulted in aggravated membrane fouling deng et al 2021 drews 2010 thus the reduction of phens concentration has contributed to the mitigation of membrane fouling in this study moreover huang et al 2019 proved that the addition of ferric salt could reduce the membrane fouling by reducing the smp eps accumulation and increasing the sludge floc size however no specific research on the influence of fe 0 c galvanic cells on membrane fouling of mbr could be found hence this study detected the concentrations and compositions of smp and eps evaluated sludge floc size distribution and explored fe compounds transformation to investigate the membrane fouling mitigation mechanism by fe 0 c galvanic cells 3 3 eps and smp accumulations eps and smp have been identified as the main membrane foulants of mbr meng et al 2017 rosenberger et al 2006 fig 5 illustrated the variation of proteins and polysaccharides concentrations in the eps and smp extracted from different batch test groups and the mbr systems it was observed that all the concentrations of eps proteins polysaccharides and smp proteins polysaccharides increased in the as system for iww treatment compared to the as system for dww treatment the results confirmed the toxicity of phens deng et al 2021 in group zvi as 5 the decrease of eps proteins and smp proteins concentrations was observed compared to the group as iww fig 5 a this finding agreed well with the result of huang et al 2019 who added ferric chloride into mbr to mitigate membrane fouling however no obvious change in eps polysaccharides and smp polysaccharides was found in group zvi as 5 which suggested that the addition of fe3 controlled eps and smp accumulation by inhibiting the secretion of proteins in group gac as 5 the changes of all the concentrations were not obvious indicating this packing volume of gac rarely contributed to esp and smp control whereas obvious reduction in eps and smp occurred in group zvi gacs as 5 which was further enhanced once the packing volume was increased to 10 similar phenomenon has been observed in the continuous operation of mbr fig 5 b concentrations of eps proteins smp proteins eps polysaccharides and smp polysaccharides in the zvi gacs mbr were reduced by 5 7 27 1 66 7 and 60 2 respectively comparing to the control mbr among which the reduction of eps polysaccharides and smp polysaccharides were more significant p 0 05 this decrease of eps and smp concentrations was in accordance with the prolonged membrane fouling cycle of zvi gacs mbr 3 4 composition changes of eps and smp ftir microscope is a powerful methodology for quantitative mapping of membrane foulants in mbr via fingerprint analysis of spectral signatures meng et al 2010 therefore the membrane fouling reduction mechanism of the zvi gacs mbr was further investigated by detecting the composition changes of eps and smp through ftir as shown in fig 6 all eps and smp samples showed peak at 3200 3500 cm 1 which indicate the bands overlapping from the stretching vibration of n h and o h hao et al 2016 meng et al 2010 the peaks at wave numbers of 712 1445 and 2926 cm 1 reflects the c h bond and the peak at wave number of 848 cm 1 reflects the c c kim and jang 2006 both c h and c c bonds are in the alkenes class reflecting the concentration of polysaccharides the asymmetrical stretching peak c o group has been observed at 1005 and 1735 cm 1 which is associated with the o acetyl ester bonds hao et al 2016 the detected peaks at the wave numbers of 1540 cm 1 c n h and 1660 cm 1 h n h belong to the amide groups which are representative to the proteins ashfaq et al 2019 additionally peaks of c o bonds were located between 1200 and 1400 cm 1 hao et al 2016 yu and zhang 2019 fig 6 a showed the composition of eps in the domestic as control mbr and zvi gacs mbr the intensities of all c h c o c n h and h n h in eps increased in the control mbr comparing to the domestic as but decreased in the zvi gacs mbr this result is in accordance with the variations of eps proteins and eps polysaccharides concentrations that have been discussed in section 3 3 1 nevertheless the composition change of smp was more complicated than eps as shown in fig 6 b the intensity of the groups of c h c o and h n h first increased in the control mbr which verified the increase of smp concentration when the toxic iww was treated subsequently the intensities of these groups decreased with the introducing of zvi gacs media meanwhile the intensity of the peaks of c o 1365 cm 1 and o h n h 3200 3500 cm 1 markedly increased in zvi gacs mbr this enrichment of the c o and n h bonds with the decrease of amide groups and c o group was also observed by yu and zhang 2019 in the eps degradation with electro oxidation their results verified the formation of c o bond from c o group by capturing the h radical released from n h bond during electro oxidation and predicated that the accumulated n h bond was from the oxidation of the side chain of amide groups yu and zhang 2019 the result of this study demonstrated the oxidation of smp and eps by the radical generation process initiated by zvi gacs however the oxidation of smp was more obviously observed than eps attributing to the better contacting of smp soluble in the mixed liquor with zvi gacs than eps contained in biofilms and sludge flocs in smp a stronger oxidation of polysaccharides could also be concluded according to the greater decrease of smp polysaccharides by 60 2 than smp proteins by 27 1 as shown in fig 5 b eps is a construction material for biofilms and flocs which could be attached on the membrane surface and smp can be adsorbed and deposited onto the surface of membrane causing pore narrowing and blocking and subsequent formation of gel layer jiang et al 2020 these characteristics of eps and smp have contributed significantly to deteriorating membrane filtration performance in terms of polysaccharide it could form strong network connecting to membrane surface due to its gelling characteristics meng et al 2010 it was also proved that polysaccharides was the main contributor to membrane fouling rather than proteins banti et al 2018 according to the results smp and eps accumulations are reduced by applying the zvi gacs based fe 0 c galvanic cells to mbr the in situ generated fe3 decreased the eps secretion and the radical generation processes initiated by the zvi gacs contributed to smp and eps oxidation particularly the oxidation of smp polysaccharides 3 5 sludge floc size distribution and fe compounds transformation a larger sludge floc size in mbr is beneficial to membrane fouling mitigation while smaller size flocs 50 μm have shown high deposition tendency onto the surface of membrane surface and aggravated membrane fouling meng et al 2017 fig 7 shows the psd and microscope images of the sludge flocs in different batch test groups and the mbr systems the microscope images showed that more compacted sludge flocs with brown color were obtained in the zvi and zvi gacs dosed as system moreover the number of the sludge flocs with high particle size obviously increased with the increase of zvi gacs packing volume similar phenomenon has also been observed in the mbr system fig 7 b in terms of the psd the sludge flocs at diameter range of 0 100 μm markedly decreased with the increase at the diameter range of 500 2000 μm in group zvi gacs as 20 an average sludge floc size of 1179 μm was obtained while that was 310 μm in group as meanwhile the average floc size of zvi gacs mbr was increased to 753 μm comparing to control mbr 338 μm in which a significant increase of sludge flocs at diameter range of 500 1000 μm p 0 034 and a significant decrease at diameter ranges of 0 50 μm p 0 041 and 50 100 μm p 0 046 were observed the results showed that the packing of zvi gacs media could effectively enhance the sludge flocs of mbr as fig 8 shows both the concentrations of fe3 3 0 mg l and fe2 1 4 mg l increased in the effluent of zvi gacs mbr which confirmed the releasing of fe3 fe2 from the zvi gacs an iron content of 0 51 g l was found to be contained in the mlss see in table s1 of supplementary information these results suggested that the released iron ions participated in the formation of sludge flocs furthermore the xrd spectra patterns shown in fig 8 b identified that the fe compounds existed in mlss were mainly in the forms of ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 peaks located at 14 1 and 36 4 and lepidocrocite α feooh peaks located at 14 1 and 36 4 it identified the coagulation process initiated by fe3 in zvi gacs mbr it suggests that coagulation of sludge flocs could be initiated by zvi gacs with the generation of fe oh 3 therefore this study verified that the sludge floc size in zvi gacs mbr was enhanced by the in situ generation of fe3 and its coagulation effect which contributed to membrane fouling mitigation it is worthy to note that the release of iron ions from fe 0 c galvanic cells is based on the consumption of zvi gac media which also causes the increase of sludge production according to the results shown in table s1 48 4 mg fe was detected in 1 g dry sludge as the zvi gacs mbr has a mixed liquor volume of 2 25 l and has been operated at srt of 7 days and hrt of 16 h it can be calculated that 0 047 g fe is released form the zvi gac media when treating 1 l wastewater with a releasing rate of 0 16 g fe day 250 ml zvi gac media with actual density of 2 9 g cm3 has been packed in the mbr and the mass percentage of fe is 37 5 thus the fe releasing can theoretically last around 4 7 years after the start up of the system based on the estimated cost of zvi gac media 1 1 kg table s2 the consumption of zvi gac media will add 0 13 to the operational cost of treating 1 m3 bio refractory iww which is 4 6 5 4 of the operational cost calculated by fajardo et al 2015 2 4 2 8 m3 calculated with the u s industrial electricity price of 0 07 kwh in the treatment of similar bio refractory iww from petrochemical industry table s1 also shows that zvi gacs mbr mlss 10 4 0 5 g l has a 7 2 higher sludge production than the control mbr mlss 9 7 0 5 g l the increased percentages of the operation cost and sludge production are much lower that the improvement of cod and phens removal 14 and 22 respectively moreover the adoption of zvi gacs into mbr also extends the membrane fouling cycle by 71 which could significantly reduce the operation cost on membrane cleaning and extend the membrane life span however future up scaled studies still need to be conducted to further evaluate the cost benefit of applying zvi gacs into mbr 3 6 response of microbial communities the smooth implication curves shown in fig s5 demonstrated the high quality of pcr products and suggested that the sequencing result could sufficiently represent the microbial communities of the samples liu et al 2016 the pca analysis in fig s6 showed that the c mbr and z mbr were far away from das suggesting that the microbial community constitutions shifted when the bio refractory iww was fed fig 9 showed the microbial community distributions of the domestic as control mbr and zvi gacs mbr the phylum proteobacteria 62 9 comprised the highest percentages in das with high abundances of classes α and γ proteobacteria it is noted that phyla actinobacteria and firmicutes have been significantly enriched in samples c mbr and z mbr for bio refractory iww treatment which is attributed to the enrichment of classes actinobacteria and bacilli previous studies have also verified the high abundances of classes actinobacteria ros et al 2010 and bacilli li et al 2009 in biological iww treatment hierarchical heat map on genomic dna was shown in fig 9 c it was observed that the dominant genera obviously changed in c mbr and z mbr comparing to das in das genera thermomonas sphingopyxis and nitrospira were dominant comprising otu abundances of over 5 while their abundances decreased to 0 03 1 2 in the mbr for iww treatment demonstrating that their growth has been inhibited by the bio refractory iww meanwhile genera enterococcus paraclostridium mycobacterium and gordonia were significantly enriched in c mbr and z mbr among which the enterococcus 5 6 13 3 and mycobacterium 5 3 15 6 comprised the highest percentages of otu sequences genus mycobacterium has been verified as the functional microbe for the degradation of phens deng et al 2021 and isoprene johnston et al 2017 moreover it showed significant p 0 011 correlation with phens removal efficiency deng et al 2021 genus enterococcus has been applied to bio refractory organics degradation and was verified possessing high bio toxicity and antimicrobial resistance to toxic compounds e g gentamicin and tetracycline martins da costa et al 2006 saifi et al 2009 however no specific research has been found to apply enterococcus into phens contaminated wastewater treatment the decrease of the abundance of genus mycobacterium in z mbr could be attributed to the reduction of phens concentration by the oxidation processes initiated by zvi gacs this decrease of phens concentration caused the enrichment of genus enterococcus which was less functional in phens degradation but possessed considerable organic degradation capacity with high bio toxicity resistance 4 conclusions micro scale fe 0 c galvanic cells was successfully formed with the development of zvi gacs and was applied to enhance biological bio refractory iww treatment the combination of zvi gacs to aerobic activated sludge zvi gacs as initiated radical generation process and increased reaction rate constants of both toc removal k 2 and phens destruction k 3 the 15 min acute bio toxicity of wastewater was reduced and the bio activity of biomass was improved the packing of zvi gacs into mbr at volume percentage of 10 strengthened cod removal by 14 and phens degradation by 22 and extended membrane fouling by 71 the accumulations of eps and smp were reduced in the zvi gacs mbr the smp polysaccharides was oxidized by the zvi gacs initiated oxidation process with a significant change in composition the iron ions released from zvi gacs showed inhibition on the secretion of smp eps proteins the coagulation effect of fe oh 3 and feooh triggered by the fe3 released from zvi gacs significantly increased the sludge floc size and contributed to membrane fouling mitigation genus enterococcus was enriched and the organics

16433,micro scale zvi gac based iron carbon galvanic cells zvi gacs were prepared with the ca si h ca h formation process and first applied to initiate radical generation and coagulation processes in mbr for treating bio refractory industrial wastewater iww batch tests revealed the h2o2 production 0 19 0 28 mg l and oh generation p cba decay k 1 0 040 min 1 in zvi gacs dosed system packing volume

demonstrated that the bio toxicity of iww was reduced and the activity of biomass was enhanced in the zvi gacs as system in mbr zvi gacs at packing volume of 10 enhanced cod and phens removal by 14 and 22 respectively membrane fouling cycle was prolonged by 71 the accumulations of eps proteins eps polysaccharides smp proteins and smp polysaccharides were reduced by 6 67 27 and 60 respectively fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir confirmed the oxidation of smp polysaccharides in zvi gacs mbr the iron ions released from zvi gacs showed inhibition on the secretion of smp eps proteins floc particle size distribution psd and x ray diffraction xrd spectrum confirmed that the coagulation effects of fe oh 3 and feooh triggered by fe3 increased the sludge floc size and contributed to membrane fouling mitigation genus enterococcus was enriched in mbr with the destruction of phens by the zvi gacs initiated radical generation process the findings of this study confirmed successful development and adoption of zvi gacs into mbr for bio refractory iww treatment it also provided an in depth understanding on the mechanisms of zvi gacs mbr system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane bioreactor mbr bio refractory industrial wastewater micro scale zvi gacs iron carbon galvanic cells fe 0 c membrane fouling soluble microbial products 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr is an innovative bio technology for wastewater treatment it possesses the superiorities of high organic load low sludge production high extreme environment resistance and economic space occupation over the traditional biological wastewater treatment processes meng et al 2017 mutamim et al 2013 studies have verified the better organic removal performance of mbr compared to the traditional activated sludge as processes in the treatment of domestic wastewater dww fenu et al 2010 phenolic wastewater deng et al 2021 tannery wastewater luján facundo et al 2018 coking wastewater jiang et al 2017 etc however in the treatment of industrial wastewater iww with high concentration of bio refractory organic compounds even the well acclimatized microorganisms in mbr showed low degradation capacity due to the low biodegradability and the inhibitory effects of these compounds deng et al 2021 luján facundo et al 2018 therefore further enhancement on mbr is required for the treatment of bio refractory iww moreover membrane fouling has been an inevitable issue in the application of mbr especially in the treatment of iww containing high concentrations of toxic organics and metals deowan et al 2016 huang et al 2019 membrane fouling markedly deteriorated membrane filtration performance and reduced membrane lifespan thereby increasing the operating cost of mbr system soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps which mainly consist of polysaccharides and proteins have been identified as the two major membrane foulants in mbr the polysaccharides and proteins performed strong promotion on the cake layer formation on the membrane surface meng et al 2017 moreover studies have verified that the contamination of bio refractory organics and toxic substances could speed up the secretion of eps and smp hao et al 2016 luján facundo et al 2018 it is a toxicity resistance mechanism of microorganisms but has resulted in a significantly aggravated membrane fouling deowan et al 2016 huang et al 2019 thus the enhancement of mbr in bio refractory iww treatment should take both the improvement of treatment efficiency and the control of membrane fouling into consideration among the potential technologies for enhancing iww treatment iron carbon galvanic cells fe 0 c has been identified as an efficient cost effective and easy to use method to strengthen the as systems for the treatment of textile wastewater sun et al 2019 caprolactam wastewater gedam et al 2014 ionic liquids zhou et al 2013 landfill leachate ying et al 2012 etc basically when the zero valent iron zvi particles are connected with the activated carbon ac in water or solutions galvanic cells could be formed with an zvi anode eq 1 and eq 2 and an ac cathode eq 3 allowing a current from ac to zvi electrons from zvi to gac and providing a voltage of up to 1 21 v fig s1 in the supplementary information deng et al 2020 jia et al 2020 with this voltage 1 electron reduction of h2o could be initiated cathodic reduction of h eq 3 and activated hydrogen h could be generated jia et al 2020 o brien 1964 zhou et al 2013 with the presence of oxygen o2 under aerobic condition oxygen competes as electron acceptor which could be reduced by the h and generate h2o2 via eq 4 sun et al 2019 ying et al 2012 the in situ generated h2o2 will subsequently react with the ferrous ions fe2 which is known as the fenton reaction eq 5 with the generation of hydroxyl radicals oh harada et al 2016 sun et al 2019 this radical generation process initiated by the fe 0 c galvanic cells has shown significant enhancement on the organic carbon degradation as well as the improvement on biodegradability of wastewater sun et al 2019 ying et al 2012 zhou et al 2013 1

relevant study has been conducted to investigate the impact of the fe 0 c galvanic cells on performance and membrane fouling of mbr on one hand the radical generation process initiated by the fe 0 c galvanic cells has the potential to enhance the oxidation of bio refractory organics in mbr on the other hand the enhanced degradation of bio refractory organic compounds could reduce the bio toxicity of the mixed liquor in mbr it is expected to reduce the secretion of smp and eps thereby mitigating the membrane fouling deng et al 2021 moreover the generated iron ions fe2 and fe3 from the fe 0 c galvanic cells are essential mineral nutrients for biomass growth and indispensable components for certain enzymes huang et al 2019 ma et al 2018 the research of huang et al 2019 has also proved that the accumulation of smp and eps could be reduced by adding ferric salts and the sludge flocs could be enhanced with the flocculation effect of fe3 both of which has contributed to the mitigation of membrane fouling therefore it is attractive to apply the fe 0 c galvanic cells for mbr enhancement and study should be performed to investigate the performance as well as the mechanisms of the fe 0 c

sanger platform major bio shanghai ltd 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characteristics of zvi gacs and its enhancement on biological organic removal 3 1 1 characterization of zvi gacs and the zvi gacs based oh generation this study first utilized the formation processes of ca h and ca si h to prepare the zvi gacs the zvi gacs obtained a bet specific surface area of 87 15 m2 g and an actual density of 2 9 0 4 g cm3 the surface characteristics under sem the elemental composition detected by eds and the xrd spectral patterns of the prepared zvi gacs have been shown in fig 1 the formations of ca h joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds file 72 0156 lópez arce et al 2010 and ca si h jcpds file 29 0379 shaw et al 2000 were observed in zvi gacs under sem fig 1 a and plentiful micro scale fe 0 c galvanic cells were observed in the developed zvi gacs fig 1 b this observation demonstrated the successful doping of zvi particles onto gac eds scannogram fig 1 c suggested that the elements fe c ca si o and h have been evenly distributed in zvi gacs with average atomic percentages of 16 2 75 7 4 3 3 0 11 9 and 8 7 respectively xrd patterns illustrated in fig 1 d also demonstrated the successful formation of ca h peaks located at 29 4 and 56 5 lópez arce et al 2010 and ca si h peaks located at 31 7 45 6 and 75 4 alizadeh et al 2011 shaw et al 2000 in zvi gacs additionally the peaks of xrd pattern of zvi gacs has been found mainly located at 44 8 65 2 and 82 5 which is in accordance with the zvi particles fig 1 d the observation indicated that the zvi particles has been successfully doped onto gac and rarely oxidized into iron oxides in the preparation process fig 1 e illustrated the h2o2 production in the gac zvi and zvi gacs dosed systems among which no h2o2 was observed in the gac group a relatively low level of h2o2 0 10 mg l was detected in the zvi group which is in accord with the research of harada et al 2016 who utilized nano zvi particles to generate h2o2 and the follow up oh as shown in fig 1 f oh was also detected in the zvi group with the decay of p cba k 1 0 007 min 1 the zvi gacs group has a much higher h2o2 production 0 41 mg l and oh generation rate comparing to the zvi group obtaining k 1 of 0 040 min 1 it is noteworthy that there is a decrease in the h2o2 concentrations of both zvi group and zvi gacs group after reaching their peak concentrations fig 1 e it could be attributed to the increase of fe2 concentration shown in fig s4 in the first 15 min reaction which could catalyze the decomposition of h2o2 generating oh eq 5 harada et al 2016 sun et al 2019 after 15 min the fe2 concentrations remained relatively stable reaching an equilibrium between its generation and consumption fig s4 comparatively the zvi gacs group stabled at a much higher h2o2 concentration of 0 19 0 28 mg l than the zvi group 0 02 0 05 mg l the results confirmed that the proposed preparation process of zvi gacs was applicable and demonstrated the successful formation of fe 0 c galvanic cells in zvi gacs 3 1 2 organic removal and phens degradation batch tests of phens degradation and toc removal were carried out with groups as gac as 5 zvi as 5 zvi gacs as 5 zvi gacs as 10 and zvi gacs as 20 control experiment with gac adsorption was conducted by directly dosing gac into wastewater the variations of toc level and phens concentration are shown in fig 2 the adsorption experiment showed that gac adsorption could only achieve toc and phens removal efficiencies of less than 15 demonstrating that degradation was the dominant mechanism of organics removal as fig 2 shows dosing gac into as slightly increased the toc and phens removal rate compared to bare as which confirmed the effect of gac adsorption dosing of zvi particles into as also showed a slight enhancement on toc and phens removal this result agreed well with the literature that the iron ions fe2 fe3 released from zvi are essential mineral nutrients for microorganisms which are capable to stimulate microbial growth and metabolisms chen et al 2018 it was noted that zvi gacs showed more obvious enhancement on organics degradation than gac and zvi the group zvi gacs as 5 obtained k 2 of 0 17 h 1 which was higher than the groups as 0 11 h 1 gac as 5 0 12 h 1 and zvi as 5 0 13 h 1 as fig 2 c and d shows zvi gacs also exhibited a considerable enhancement on phens degradation group zvi gacs as 5 possessed a much higher k 3 of 0 36 h 1 comparing to groups as 0 24 h 1 gac as 5 0 28 h 1 and zvi as 5 0 30 h 1 respectively at reaction time of 8 h the concentration of phens was reduced to 58 19 mg l in group zvi gacs as 5 while that was 213 53 mg l in as group when increasing the packing volume of zvi gacs a further improvement on organic degradation rate was observed in groups zvi gacs as 10 and zvi gacs as 20 k 2 increased to 0 21 and 0 23 h 1 respectively and k 3 increased to 0 49 and 0 57 h 1 respectively these results demonstrated that the fe 0 c galvanic cells has been successfully introduced into bio system by packing zvi gacs media which effectively generated h eqs 1 3 and enhanced h2o2 production under aerobic condition eq 4 ying et al 2012 therefore fenton reaction eq 5 could be initiated via the reaction between the in situ generated h2o2 and fe2 and the destroying of carbon chains of bio refractory organics could be enhanced thereby improving the biodegradability gedam et al 2014 zhu et al 2014 additionally the released fe2 fe3 could enhance the microbial growth and strengthen the metabolism chen et al 2018 huang et al 2019 which also benefited organic removal the enhancement of on zvi gacs on bio activity has been investigated in section 3 1 3 researches have applied the fe 0 c galvanic cells on biological organic removal from iww e g textile wastewater sun et al 2019 and methyl ethyl ketone zhu et al 2014 caprolactam wastewater gedam et al 2014 landfill leachate ying et al 2012 and the phens contaminated coal gasification wastewater ma et al 2018 but they usually directly packed the mixture of zvi and gac into the system which limited the formation of fe 0 c galvanic cells this study first confirmed the successful application of micro scale galvanic cells into bio system with the zvi gacs media and specific phens degradation rates of 7 8 and 9 7 mg g mlss h were achieved at packing volume percentages of 10 and 20 respectively while 4 6 mg g mlss h was calculated from the research of ma et al 2018 which utilized parking volume percentage of 40 it indicated that the zvi gacs exhibited a stronger enhancement on bio refractory compounds degradation with lower parking volume and demonstrated the successful development of zvi gacs 3 1 3 bio activity enhancement and bio toxicity reduction the sour test was conducted to assess the activity of aerobic as park et al 2018 it was noted from fig 3 a that the sour of the domestic as decreased from 3 7 to 1 8 mg o2 g mlvss h when iww was fed which demonstrated a remarkable decrease of bio activity the study of deng et al 2021 verified that the bio toxicity of water showed significant correlation p 0 02 with the concentration of phens in this study a 15 min acute bio toxicity of 28 9 37 1 was detected at the phens range of 525 1005 mg l these results demonstrated that phens showed severe inhibition on the biomass in iww treatment as fig 3 a shows the zvi as 5 group obtained higher sour 2 2 mg o2 g mlvss h than groups gac as 5 and as however the three groups showed no significant difference in the reduction of bio toxicity of the wastewater fig 3 b it indicated that the addition of zvi improved the bio toxicity resistance and maintained the bio activity of biomass chen et al 2018 and völker et al 2016 verified that the fe2 fe3 could exert a crucial role in the chains of electron transfer and the oxidoreductases prosthetic groups it was also demonstrated that fe2 fe3 could act as the active center of many enzymes that are essential for the cellular activities deng et al 2020 ma et al 2018 e g the dehydrogenase which is essential for the recycle of ubiquinone eq 8 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide eq 9 moreover the in situ generated h could also enhance the recirculation eq 8 8 2 h r or h uq deh uq h 2 r 9 2 nad uq h 2 2 nadh uq where h r is organic carbon deh is dehydrogenase uq is ubiquinone nad is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and nadh is the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide a more obvious improvement of sour was observed when parking zvi gacs into the system comparing to group zvi as 5 group zvi gacs as 5 obtained a higher sour of 2 5 mg o2 g mlvss h moreover a significant p 0 04 decrease in bio toxicity in group zvi gacs as 5 was also observed fig 3 b it indicated that the reduction of bio toxicity by enhancing phens degradation shown in fig 2 c also contributed to the improvement of bio activity of the biomass as fig 3 shows the increase of zvi gacs parking volume percentage to 10 further reduced the bio toxicity and improved the sour to 3 3 mg o2 g mlvss h nonetheless sour decreased to 2 7 o2 g mlvss h when parking volume percentage was raised to 20 fig 3 a this would be due to the overdosing of zvi gacs leading to a high generation of h2o2 and oh which could destroy the microorganism cells bianco et al 2017 therefore the zvi gacs parking volume percentage of 10 was applied to the zvi gacs mbr process 3 2 the performance and membrane fouling of zvi gacs mbr the control mbr days 1 67 and zvi gacs mbr days 68 135 were operated to investigate the influence of zvi gacs on mbr in bio refractory iww treatment fig 4 steady stage i was achieved after a 10 day start up process by inoculating das the zvi gacs media was packed into the mbr system on the operational day 68 and 11 days was cost to reach steady stage ii as fig 4 a shows the effluent cod decreased when the zvi gacs media was packed under the same operation condition the zvi gacs mbr obtained a lower effluent cod of 253 85 mg l than the control mbr 737 162 mg l meanwhile zvi gacs mbr has a cod of 322 106 mg l and control mbr has a cod of 881 187 mg l in the mixed liquor indicating that the organic compounds were mainly removed by degradation instead of membrane filtration comparatively the cod removal of mbr was improved from 78 4 to 91 9 by dosing zvi gacs 10 meanwhile a significant p 0 04 reduction of effluent phens from 194 72 to 24 9 mg l was observed fig 4 b with phens removal enhancement from 74 9 to 96 6 previous studies e g ying et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 and ma et al 2018 also demonstrated the improvement of organics removal by fe 0 c galvanic cells in the continuously operated bio systems among them ma et al 2018 treated the phens contaminated iww with a biological aerated filter utilizing the commercial iron carbon media however lower cod 86 5 and phens 88 3 removal had been achieved even with a long hrt of 24 h and high packing volume percentage of 40 the results confirmed the successful set up and operation of zvi gacs mbr with zvi gacs media the change of tmp was monitored throughout the continuous operation to assess the membrane fouling behavior of mbr as fig 4 c shows zvi gacs extended the membrane fouling cycle of mbr the zvi gacs mbr reached the critical tmp 30 kpa with an average fouling cycle of 118 7 h whereas the control mbr took only 69 3 h it demonstrated that the membrane fouling was delayed by 70 7 studies have demonstrated that the toxic substances caused the rapid accumulations of smp and eps which resulted in aggravated membrane fouling deng et al 2021 drews 2010 thus the reduction of phens concentration has contributed to the mitigation of membrane fouling in this study moreover huang et al 2019 proved that the addition of ferric salt could reduce the membrane fouling by reducing the smp eps accumulation and increasing the sludge floc size however no specific research on the influence of fe 0 c galvanic cells on membrane fouling of mbr could be found hence this study detected the concentrations and compositions of smp and eps evaluated sludge floc size distribution and explored fe compounds transformation to investigate the membrane fouling mitigation mechanism by fe 0 c galvanic cells 3 3 eps and smp accumulations eps and smp have been identified as the main membrane foulants of mbr meng et al 2017 rosenberger et al 2006 fig 5 illustrated the variation of proteins and polysaccharides concentrations in the eps and smp extracted from different batch test groups and the mbr systems it was observed that all the concentrations of eps proteins polysaccharides and smp proteins polysaccharides increased in the as system for iww treatment compared to the as system for dww treatment the results confirmed the toxicity of phens deng et al 2021 in group zvi as 5 the decrease of eps proteins and smp proteins concentrations was observed compared to the group as iww fig 5 a this finding agreed well with the result of huang et al 2019 who added ferric chloride into mbr to mitigate membrane fouling however no obvious change in eps polysaccharides and smp polysaccharides was found in group zvi as 5 which suggested that the addition of fe3 controlled eps and smp accumulation by inhibiting the secretion of proteins in group gac as 5 the changes of all the concentrations were not obvious indicating this packing volume of gac rarely contributed to esp and smp control whereas obvious reduction in eps and smp occurred in group zvi gacs as 5 which was further enhanced once the packing volume was increased to 10 similar phenomenon has been observed in the continuous operation of mbr fig 5 b concentrations of eps proteins smp proteins eps polysaccharides and smp polysaccharides in the zvi gacs mbr were reduced by 5 7 27 1 66 7 and 60 2 respectively comparing to the control mbr among which the reduction of eps polysaccharides and smp polysaccharides were more significant p 0 05 this decrease of eps and smp concentrations was in accordance with the prolonged membrane fouling cycle of zvi gacs mbr 3 4 composition changes of eps and smp ftir microscope is a powerful methodology for quantitative mapping of membrane foulants in mbr via fingerprint analysis of spectral signatures meng et al 2010 therefore the membrane fouling reduction mechanism of the zvi gacs mbr was further investigated by detecting the composition changes of eps and smp through ftir as shown in fig 6 all eps and smp samples showed peak at 3200 3500 cm 1 which indicate the bands overlapping from the stretching vibration of n h and o h hao et al 2016 meng et al 2010 the peaks at wave numbers of 712 1445 and 2926 cm 1 reflects the c h bond and the peak at wave number of 848 cm 1 reflects the c c kim and jang 2006 both c h and c c bonds are in the alkenes class reflecting the concentration of polysaccharides the asymmetrical stretching peak c o group has been observed at 1005 and 1735 cm 1 which is associated with the o acetyl ester bonds hao et al 2016 the detected peaks at the wave numbers of 1540 cm 1 c n h and 1660 cm 1 h n h belong to the amide groups which are representative to the proteins ashfaq et al 2019 additionally peaks of c o bonds were located between 1200 and 1400 cm 1 hao et al 2016 yu and zhang 2019 fig 6 a showed the composition of eps in the domestic as control mbr and zvi gacs mbr the intensities of all c h c o c n h and h n h in eps increased in the control mbr comparing to the domestic as but decreased in the zvi gacs mbr this result is in accordance with the variations of eps proteins and eps polysaccharides concentrations that have been discussed in section 3 3 1 nevertheless the composition change of smp was more complicated than eps as shown in fig 6 b the intensity of the groups of c h c o and h n h first increased in the control mbr which verified the increase of smp concentration when the toxic iww was treated subsequently the intensities of these groups decreased with the introducing of zvi gacs media meanwhile the intensity of the peaks of c o 1365 cm 1 and o h n h 3200 3500 cm 1 markedly increased in zvi gacs mbr this enrichment of the c o and n h bonds with the decrease of amide groups and c o group was also observed by yu and zhang 2019 in the eps degradation with electro oxidation their results verified the formation of c o bond from c o group by capturing the h radical released from n h bond during electro oxidation and predicated that the accumulated n h bond was from the oxidation of the side chain of amide groups yu and zhang 2019 the result of this study demonstrated the oxidation of smp and eps by the radical generation process initiated by zvi gacs however the oxidation of smp was more obviously observed than eps attributing to the better contacting of smp soluble in the mixed liquor with zvi gacs than eps contained in biofilms and sludge flocs in smp a stronger oxidation of polysaccharides could also be concluded according to the greater decrease of smp polysaccharides by 60 2 than smp proteins by 27 1 as shown in fig 5 b eps is a construction material for biofilms and flocs which could be attached on the membrane surface and smp can be adsorbed and deposited onto the surface of membrane causing pore narrowing and blocking and subsequent formation of gel layer jiang et al 2020 these characteristics of eps and smp have contributed significantly to deteriorating membrane filtration performance in terms of polysaccharide it could form strong network connecting to membrane surface due to its gelling characteristics meng et al 2010 it was also proved that polysaccharides was the main contributor to membrane fouling rather than proteins banti et al 2018 according to the results smp and eps accumulations are reduced by applying the zvi gacs based fe 0 c galvanic cells to mbr the in situ generated fe3 decreased the eps secretion and the radical generation processes initiated by the zvi gacs contributed to smp and eps oxidation particularly the oxidation of smp polysaccharides 3 5 sludge floc size distribution and fe compounds transformation a larger sludge floc size in mbr is beneficial to membrane fouling mitigation while smaller size flocs 50 μm have shown high deposition tendency onto the surface of membrane surface and aggravated membrane fouling meng et al 2017 fig 7 shows the psd and microscope images of the sludge flocs in different batch test groups and the mbr systems the microscope images showed that more compacted sludge flocs with brown color were obtained in the zvi and zvi gacs dosed as system moreover the number of the sludge flocs with high particle size obviously increased with the increase of zvi gacs packing volume similar phenomenon has also been observed in the mbr system fig 7 b in terms of the psd the sludge flocs at diameter range of 0 100 μm markedly decreased with the increase at the diameter range of 500 2000 μm in group zvi gacs as 20 an average sludge floc size of 1179 μm was obtained while that was 310 μm in group as meanwhile the average floc size of zvi gacs mbr was increased to 753 μm comparing to control mbr 338 μm in which a significant increase of sludge flocs at diameter range of 500 1000 μm p 0 034 and a significant decrease at diameter ranges of 0 50 μm p 0 041 and 50 100 μm p 0 046 were observed the results showed that the packing of zvi gacs media could effectively enhance the sludge flocs of mbr as fig 8 shows both the concentrations of fe3 3 0 mg l and fe2 1 4 mg l increased in the effluent of zvi gacs mbr which confirmed the releasing of fe3 fe2 from the zvi gacs an iron content of 0 51 g l was found to be contained in the mlss see in table s1 of supplementary information these results suggested that the released iron ions participated in the formation of sludge flocs furthermore the xrd spectra patterns shown in fig 8 b identified that the fe compounds existed in mlss were mainly in the forms of ferric hydroxide fe oh 3 peaks located at 14 1 and 36 4 and lepidocrocite α feooh peaks located at 14 1 and 36 4 it identified the coagulation process initiated by fe3 in zvi gacs mbr it suggests that coagulation of sludge flocs could be initiated by zvi gacs with the generation of fe oh 3 therefore this study verified that the sludge floc size in zvi gacs mbr was enhanced by the in situ generation of fe3 and its coagulation effect which contributed to membrane fouling mitigation it is worthy to note that the release of iron ions from fe 0 c galvanic cells is based on the consumption of zvi gac media which also causes the increase of sludge production according to the results shown in table s1 48 4 mg fe was detected in 1 g dry sludge as the zvi gacs mbr has a mixed liquor volume of 2 25 l and has been operated at srt of 7 days and hrt of 16 h it can be calculated that 0 047 g fe is released form the zvi gac media when treating 1 l wastewater with a releasing rate of 0 16 g fe day 250 ml zvi gac media with actual density of 2 9 g cm3 has been packed in the mbr and the mass percentage of fe is 37 5 thus the fe releasing can theoretically last around 4 7 years after the start up of the system based on the estimated cost of zvi gac media 1 1 kg table s2 the consumption of zvi gac media will add 0 13 to the operational cost of treating 1 m3 bio refractory iww which is 4 6 5 4 of the operational cost calculated by fajardo et al 2015 2 4 2 8 m3 calculated with the u s industrial electricity price of 0 07 kwh in the treatment of similar bio refractory iww from petrochemical industry table s1 also shows that zvi gacs mbr mlss 10 4 0 5 g l has a 7 2 higher sludge production than the control mbr mlss 9 7 0 5 g l the increased percentages of the operation cost and sludge production are much lower that the improvement of cod and phens removal 14 and 22 respectively moreover the adoption of zvi gacs into mbr also extends the membrane fouling cycle by 71 which could significantly reduce the operation cost on membrane cleaning and extend the membrane life span however future up scaled studies still need to be conducted to further evaluate the cost benefit of applying zvi gacs into mbr 3 6 response of microbial communities the smooth implication curves shown in fig s5 demonstrated the high quality of pcr products and suggested that the sequencing result could sufficiently represent the microbial communities of the samples liu et al 2016 the pca analysis in fig s6 showed that the c mbr and z mbr were far away from das suggesting that the microbial community constitutions shifted when the bio refractory iww was fed fig 9 showed the microbial community distributions of the domestic as control mbr and zvi gacs mbr the phylum proteobacteria 62 9 comprised the highest percentages in das with high abundances of classes α and γ proteobacteria it is noted that phyla actinobacteria and firmicutes have been significantly enriched in samples c mbr and z mbr for bio refractory iww treatment which is attributed to the enrichment of classes actinobacteria and bacilli previous studies have also verified the high abundances of classes actinobacteria ros et al 2010 and bacilli li et al 2009 in biological iww treatment hierarchical heat map on genomic dna was shown in fig 9 c it was observed that the dominant genera obviously changed in c mbr and z mbr comparing to das in das genera thermomonas sphingopyxis and nitrospira were dominant comprising otu abundances of over 5 while their abundances decreased to 0 03 1 2 in the mbr for iww treatment demonstrating that their growth has been inhibited by the bio refractory iww meanwhile genera enterococcus paraclostridium mycobacterium and gordonia were significantly enriched in c mbr and z mbr among which the enterococcus 5 6 13 3 and mycobacterium 5 3 15 6 comprised the highest percentages of otu sequences genus mycobacterium has been verified as the functional microbe for the degradation of phens deng et al 2021 and isoprene johnston et al 2017 moreover it showed significant p 0 011 correlation with phens removal efficiency deng et al 2021 genus enterococcus has been applied to bio refractory organics degradation and was verified possessing high bio toxicity and antimicrobial resistance to toxic compounds e g gentamicin and tetracycline martins da costa et al 2006 saifi et al 2009 however no specific research has been found to apply enterococcus into phens contaminated wastewater treatment the decrease of the abundance of genus mycobacterium in z mbr could be attributed to the reduction of phens concentration by the oxidation processes initiated by zvi gacs this decrease of phens concentration caused the enrichment of genus enterococcus which was less functional in phens degradation but possessed considerable organic degradation capacity with high bio toxicity resistance 4 conclusions micro scale fe 0 c galvanic cells was successfully formed with the development of zvi gacs and was applied to enhance biological bio refractory iww treatment the combination of zvi gacs to aerobic activated sludge zvi gacs as initiated radical generation process and increased reaction rate constants of both toc removal k 2 and phens destruction k 3 the 15 min acute bio toxicity of wastewater was reduced and the bio activity of biomass was improved the packing of zvi gacs into mbr at volume percentage of 10 strengthened cod removal by 14 and phens degradation by 22 and extended membrane fouling by 71 the accumulations of eps and smp were reduced in the zvi gacs mbr the smp polysaccharides was oxidized by the zvi gacs initiated oxidation process with a significant change in composition the iron ions released from zvi gacs showed inhibition on the secretion of smp eps proteins the coagulation effect of fe oh 3 and feooh triggered by the fe3 released from zvi gacs significantly increased the sludge floc size and contributed to membrane fouling mitigation genus enterococcus was enriched and the organics degradation capacity of zvi gacs mbr was improved with the enhancement of phens destruction by the zvi gacs initiated radical generation process declaration of competing interest the authors declare

16434,wastewater treatment plant effluents and releases from rainwater overflow basins can contribute to the input of genotoxic micropollutants in aquatic ecosystems predominantly lipophilic genotoxic compounds tend to sorb to particulate matter making sediment a source and a sink of pollution therefore the present study aims to investigate the genotoxic potential of freshwater sediments i during the dry period and ii after extensive rain events by collecting sediment samples in one small anthropogenically impacted river in germany up and downstream of the local wastewater treatment plant the micronucleus and ames fluctuation assays with salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 ta100 yg1041 and yg1042 were used to assess the genotoxic potential of organic sediment extracts for evaluation of possible genotoxicity drivers target analysis for 168 chemical compounds was performed no clastogenic effects were observed while the genotoxic potential was observed at all sampling sites primarily driven by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons nitroarenes aromatic amines and polycyclic heteroarenes freshwater sediments genotoxic potential increased after extensive rain events due to sediment perturbation and the rainwater overflow basin release in the present study the rainwater overflow basin was a significant source for particle bound pollutants from untreated wastewater suggesting its role as a possible source of genotoxic potential the present study showed high sensitivity and applicability of the bacterial salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 to organic sediment extracts to assess the different classes of genotoxic compounds a combination of effect based methods and a chemical analysis was shown as a suitable tool for a genotoxic assessment of freshwater

european water bodies by 2027 european parliament and council 2000 however exceeding the environmental quality standards for the priority water pollutants in the water phase is one reason for the insufficient chemical status of more than half of european water bodies european commission 2019 furthermore with the development of the integrated approach for assessing sediment toxicity chapman 1989 chapman and hollert 2006 hollert et al 2002 and the formation of the european demand driven sediment research network sednet in 2001 the problem of contaminated sediments in europe received increased attention however obligatory sediment monitoring entered the eu wfd not before 2008 and is limited by the analytical testing for at least 21 priority substances european parliament and council 2008 genotoxic chemicals are of primary concern for aquatic ecosystems as there is no environmental safety level hiding a risk at even low concentrations belpomme et al 2007 efsa 2008 multiple

corredor santamaría et al 2016 keiter et al 2006a theodorakis 2001 due to the broad spectrum of genotoxic compounds the possible entry pathways into the environment are diverse some genotoxic

mueller et al 2019 as a consequence of extensive rain events vincze et al 2014 may lead to the release of particle bound genotoxic contaminants brinkmann et al 2010 additionally mixed sewer systems collecting municipal waste and rainwater allinson et al 2012 jolibois and guerbet 2005 and following discharges from rainwater overflow basins of wwtps due to insufficient capacities müller et al 2020 nickel and fuchs 2019 are important pathways for the discharge of particle bound genotoxic chemicals the studied sector of the wurm river receives the effluent and rainwater basin overflows of one of the biggest wwtps in germany the aachen soers wwtp the wwtp effluent makes up about 90 of the total water flow of the wurm river during dry weather at the same time the latter regularly receives the content of the rainwater overflow basin after extensive rain events the study by könemann et al 2019 showed the accumulation of wastewater born chemicals in benthic living organisms like gammarus pulex collected in the wurm river downstream of the rainwater overflow basin and at the effluent site of the aachen soers wwtp the present study focuses on assessing the genotoxic potential in freshwater sediments from the wurm river to investigate different factors impacting the sediments genotoxic potential sampling campaigns were conducted at different weather dry weather and after extensive rain events combined with the rainwater overflow basin release the assessment strategy included a combination of effect based methods ebms and a chemical target screening this approach is a well established strategy brack et al 2009 2019 for evaluation of the genotoxic risk of complex environmental chemicals mixtures altenburger et al 2010 in different matrices such as wastewater altenburger et al 2015 di paolo et al 2016 and sediment hollert et al 2009a 2009b the choice of the genotoxic ebms test battery was driven by the research findings of the last decades reifferscheid and grummt 2000 developed a graduated test battery comprising one bacterial test ames fluctuation test or umu test and one eukaryotic test comet assay kirkland et al 2011 modified this test battery using the ames fluctuation assay with different bacterial strains sensitive to different classes of compounds and the micronucleus assay as an eukaryotic assay with mammalian cells while in vitro bioassays described an overall sediment genotoxic potential chemical target analysis allowed the authors to prioritize its possible drivers in the wurm river and answer the following questions i how

river is presented in fig 1 the present study was a part of the demo3 ac project investigating multiple sites of the wurm river the four most relevant sampling sites were evaluated for the current case study the first sampling site was w2 located close to the urban area of aachen the following sampling site w3 was located downstream of the rainwater overflow basin of the aachen soers wwtp representing the possible impact of untreated wastewater and rainwater discharges the sampling site w4 was directly at the effluent of the aachen soers wwtp the last sampling site w5 was located 2 5 km downstream of the effluent at near natural conditions without known significant sources of pollution the first sampling campaign took place in june 2017 and was characterized by a long dry period and stable hydrological conditions scarid during dry weather the average precipitation rate in aachen within the last 21 d before the sampling campaign accounted for 1 l m2 wetterkontor gmbh 2017 the aachen soers wwtp used conventional wastewater treatment by mechanical biological and chemical steps with the subsequent sand filter during dry weather the effluent water portion in the wurm river accounts for 90 elwas web 2021 the second sampling campaign was performed in june 2018 after extensive rain events scrain the average precipitation rate in aachen within the last 21 d before the sampling campaign accounted for 5 l m2 wetterkontor gmbh 2018 six months before the scrain the wastewater treatment of the aachen soers wwtp was upgraded by full stream ozonation 2 3 sampling and sample preparation procedure sediment samples were collected from the first 10 cm in the cross and longitudinal profiles and united to one grab sample for the subsequent biotesting 25 g of freeze

cytogenetic test for detecting chemicals with clastogenic or aneugenic potential micronuclei are fragments of chromosomes that are not correctly transferred to the cell pole during the anaphase the micronucleus assay was performed with the v79 cell line chinese hamster lung cells with and without metabolic activation s9 according to the iso guideline 21 427 2 iso 2004 with some modifications see supplementary information si s1 and as detailed in reifferscheid et al 2008 organic sediment extracts were tested in three independent replicates differing condition days in the concentration of 25 g dw seq ml with a total dmso concentration of 0 1 in the test for each application day quality controls were carried out by preparing one plate with dmso as a negative control and one plate for the respective positive control substance the validity criteria of statistically significant differences between the negative and the positive control within single testing approaches were approved using the t test p 0 05 for the data evaluation procedure a percentage rate of micronuclei per 1000 cells was calculated statistically significant differences were evaluated using two way anova with a post hoc tukey test p 0 05 all statistical testing procedures were performed with the graphpad prism software v 9 for windows graphpad software inc 2 5 ames fluctuation assay the bacterial ames fluctuation assay was performed according to the iso guideline 11 350 international organization for standardisation 2012 and as detailed in reifferscheid et al 2012 salmonella typhimurium strains are modified by a point mutation in the histidine gene repeated mutations in the histidine gene can cause reversion to the wild type characterized by the own production of the growth essential histidine salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 and ta100 were used see si s2 due to the limitation of the enzymes found in a typical s9 mix in non detection of such ubiquitously distributed promutagens as nitroarenes iarc working group on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans 2014 and aromatic amines iarc working group on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans 2012 this gap was closed by adding additional bacterial strains yg1041 and yg1042 the latter have elevated levels of o acetyltransferase and nitroreductase making yg1041 and yg1042 more sensitive when these compound classes are present see si s2 sediment extracts were tested in three independent replicates differing condition days for each application day quality controls were carried out by preparing one plate with dmso as a negative control and one plate for the respective positive control substance in six dilution steps the resulting revertant counts at each dilution step 1 2 step 48 revertants were assessed with reference to the revertant count at the negative control plate as i negative in case of no concentration dependent increase ii reproducible in case of a visible concentration dependent increase and iii statistically significant in case of differences to the negative control evaluated by a statistical test international organisation for standardisation 2012 revertant numbers from three independent replicates within the range of six concentrations were tested against the revertant numbers in the negative control plate using two way anova with a post hoc tukey test p 0 05 based on achieved revertant numbers induction factors were calculated the induction factor represents a proportion between the revertant count in the respective concentration and the revertant count within the inner plate negative control an induction factor approach uniforms data making multiple comparisons possible for this purpose seitz et al 2008 developed an approach based on calculating concentration dependent induction factors a concentration dependent induction factor value represents the relationship between the induction factor and the respective concentration therefore concentration dependent induction factor values are independent of the tested concentrations and can be used for environmental samples mutagenicity ranking seitz et al 2008 all statistical procedures were carried out with

organic carbon see si s3 rather than on dry weight massei et al 2018 was extracted using the procedure described in chapter 2 3 before the analytical procedure the gained extracts were cleaned up using flash chromatography see si s4 organic sediment extracts for the analysis utilizing gas chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry gchrms were adjusted to 500 µl ethyl acetate and spiked with 1 µg ml internal standard mix in ethyl acetate organic sediment extracts for the analysis utilizing liquid chromatography lc were adjusted to 500 µl methanol and spiked with 1 µg ml internal

chemicals to observed genotoxic effects endpoint specific classification of target substances was performed for this purpose the following databases and qsar software were used 1 pubchem with

of mutagenicity and micronuclei induction activity for more details see si s9 3 results 3 1 assessment of the genotoxic potential using effect based methods organic sediment extracts revealed no statistically significant increase two way anova p 0 05 in micronuclei mnc in comparison to the negative control see si s10 the ames fluctuation assay results with salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta98 s9 indicated particle bound frameshift mutagens in all sediment samples collected during dry weather scarid however the sediment samples collected after extensive rain events scrain showed a strong increase of the particle bound mutagenic potential caused by both frameshift and base pair mutagens at all sampling sites see table 1 in addition exposure of yg1041 and yg 1042 s9 to organic sediment extracts indicated nitroarenes and aromatic amines at all sampling sites during all sampling campaigns analysis of the revertant count using a concentration dependent induction factors method showed mutagenic potential in sediment samples primarily outgoing from frameshift mutagens see fig 2 a stronger expression was observed after the metabolic activation mutagens causing base pair substitutions were less represented in the sediment in salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 s9 and ta100 s9 significantly higher two way anova with post hoc tukey test p 0 05 revertant induction was detected at the sampling site w4 at the effluent and w3 downstream of the rainwater overflow basin respectively during the scrain see fig 3 in contrast the sampling site w2 located upstream of the aachen soers wwtp showed significantly lower induction factors in the salmonella typhimurium strain yg1041 s9 than at w4 and w5 see fig 4 the salmonella typhimurium strain yg1042 s9 showed significantly higher revertant numbers at the sampling site w3 than at the other sampling sites during the dry weather furthermore the metabolic activation by the s9 mix led to a significantly higher revertant number and induction factors at w4 during scrain than during scarid the sampling sites downstream of the aachen soers wwtp w4 and w5 during scrain revealed significantly higher revertant numbers than at the sampling site w2 upstream of the aachen soers wwtp 3 2 chemical target screening 168 target substances were analyzed in organic sediment extracts and out of these 94 target compounds could be quantified see si s9 including aromatic amines carbazoles nitroarenes pahs pcbs phenanthrolines polycyclic heteroarenes plant protective agents dicofol diphenyl sulfone xanthone 4 4 ddmu and 2 4 dinitroaniline see table 2 extensive rain events scrain significantly t test p 0 05 enhanced the total chemical burden as summarized single concentrations at the sampling sites w3 and w4 which were located downstream of the rainwater overflow basin and the effluent of the aachen soers wwtp respectively at the sampling site w3 the total chemical burden during scarid increased from 386 ng mg oc to 4855 ng mg oc during scrain mainly driven by pahs and polycyclic heteroarenes at the sampling site w4 a mixture of trans stilbene nitroarenes pahs pcbs and polycyclic heteroarenes contributed to a pronounced higher chemical burden during scrain 25 695 ng mg oc than the situation a year ago 987 ng mg oc 3 3 assessment of possible drives for genotoxicity for evaluating chemical compounds that potentially contributed to detected mutagenic effects 59 quantified chemicals with expected genotoxicity were evaluated see si s9 due to the postulation that genotoxic compounds have no effect level belpomme et al 2007 detected concentrations were directly related to the analyzed sampling sites the chemical burden of genotoxic compounds at the sampling site w2 located upstream of the aachen soers wwtp and the rainwater overflow basin increased after extensive rain events due to pahs 51 4 aromatic amines 42 9 and other compounds 70 1 see table 3 while the concentration of nitroarenes decreased by 90 9 the concentration of genotoxic chemical compounds in the sediment of the sampling site w3 located after the rainwater overflow basin strongly increased due to aromatic amines 76 2 carbazoles 67 5 pahs 92 2 polycyclic heteroarenes 82 3 and other compounds 91 again a substantial decrease of nitroarenes by 95 8 was observed at the sampling site w3 the effluent sampling site w4 showed the most substantial concentration increase for genotoxic compounds 96 3 this tendency could be at least partially found at the sampling site w5 located 2 5 km downstream of the aachen soers wwtp thus increased concentration of carbazoles 72 pahs 47 7 polycyclic heteroarenes 47 9 and other compounds 76 8 could be observed after prolonged rain events scrain the concentration of genotoxic nitroarenes decreased by 83 3 during scrain in comparison to the scarid 4 discussion the present study was conceptualized as a case study investigating the genotoxic potential in freshwater sediments from a small receiving waterbody in germany under different weather conditions the wurm river as a study object exemplary represents multiple small water bodies in europe struggling with the eu wfd s goals of achieving a good chemical status the studied river s stretch comprised four sampling sites up and downstream of the aachen soers wwtp effluent discharge contributing 90 of the total water flow during dry weather sampling site w4 the time resolution of the sampling campaigns 2017 and 2018 allowed monitoring of sediments under different weather conditions and wwtp functionality effluent treatment rainwater overflow basin release combining effect based methods with a chemical target analysis under the mentioned environmental changes a complex evaluation of the genotoxic potential in the wurm river s sediments was possible 4 1 do weather conditions have an impact on sediment genotoxicity the present results showed a potential impact of weather conditions on the mutagenic potential of sediment samples in the ames fluctuation assay in contrast no impact on chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro micronucleus assay was observed this result was not in line with other studies showing in vitro micronuclei induction after the exposure of eucaryotic cells to pahs brinkmann et al 2014 and sediment extracts boettcher et al 2010 keiter et al 2009 however in situ investigations of micronuclei formation in erythrocytes of juvenile rainbow trouts at the same sampling sites also revealed no chromosomal aberrations data not shown the exposure of the salmonella typhimurium standard strains ta98 and ta100 to organic sediment extracts from the wurm river collected during a prolonged dry period scarid showed the presence of frameshift mutagens only additionally the mutagenic potential at the sampling sites upstream of the effluent w2 and w3 was characterized by promutagens which require metabolic activation by mammal liver enzymes s9 mix to become mutagenic at the effluent site w4 and 2 5 km downstream w5 sediment samples collected during dry weather scarid contained frameshift promutagens the additional inclusion of salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 strains could elucidate nitroarenes and aromatic amines in all sediment samples during dry weather giorgio et al 2011 showed positive results in the salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 s9 after exposure to non polar and polar sediment extracts from the berre lagoon france while the salmonella typhimurium strain yg1041 showed positive results after exposure to the polar extract only in the study by reifferscheid et al 2011 highly polluted sediments middle polar and polar fractions from the spittelwasser creek germany were investigated showing positive results in the salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 s9 in addition they confirmed a high sensitivity of the metabolically competent salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 s9 in contrast to dry weather intensified water flow and sediment perturbation due to extensive rain events during the sampling campaign scrain showed frameshift base pair substituting promutagens including nitroarenes aromatic amines in all investigated sediment samples in particular sediment samples collected at the sampling site w3 located downstream of the rainwater overflow basin showed significantly higher revertant numbers than the sampling campaign during dry weather due to base pair substitution mutagens remarkable was the effluent sampling site w4 indicating a significantly higher genotoxic potential outgoing from frameshift mutagens ta98 s9 nitroarenes and aromatic amines yg1041 s9 in addition the sampling site 2 5 km downstream of the effluent w5 showed significantly higher genotoxic potential after rain events due to nitroarenes and aromatic amines yg1041 s9 interestingly similarly high genotoxic potential independent of weathering conditions was already observed in sediments from large water bodies with pronounced anthropogenic activities in near surroundings for example sediments from the upper danube river higley et al 2012 and the spittelwasser creek reifferscheid et al 2011 in germany taquari river in brazil gameiro et al 2018 yongdinghe watershed ma et al 2003 and several sites within the three gorges reservoir floehr et al 2015 in china united the presence of particle bound frameshift and base pair direct mutagens and frequently promutagens the identification of promutagens was driven by ubiquitously presented lipophilic particle bound contaminants as pahs require metabolic activation before acting mutagenic phillipson and ioannides 1989 the present result indicated ubiquitous genotoxic potential in studied sediments while sediment perturbation as a consequence of rain events or rainwater overflow basin release led to its stronger pronouncement increasing risk to organisms contacting to sediment 4 2 can the observed genotoxic potential in sediments be explained by the target chemical analysis quantified chemical target compounds 94 in the investigated sediment samples comprised the groups of aromatic amines carbazoles nitroarenes pahs polycyclic heteroarenes and other chemical compounds 59 of them were classified as potentially genotoxic the total chemical burden in studied sediment samples remarkably increased after extensive rain events scrain mainly due to pahs classified as genotoxic thus the average concentration of 13 pahs detected in sediments from the wurm river rose by a factor of 7 5 3 mg kg dw during scarid and 34 38 mg kg dw during scrain cornelissen et al 2008 this result correlated with high mutagenic potential in the salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 up to induction factor 50 and yg1041 up to induction factor 75 after the metabolic activation mestankova et al 2014 pahs occur in the environment as combustion products of fossil fuels and can be involved in forming nitroarenes reaction with air nitrogen oxides rosenkranz and mermelstein 1983 tokiwa and ohnishi 1986 scrain took place four days after releasing over 75 000 m3 of a particle rich rainwater wastewater mixture from the rainwater overflow basin thus each rainwater overflow basin release acts as a flash flood with subsequent sediment perturbation which may bear the risk of releasing particle bound chemicals schertzinger et al 2019 shuliakevich et al 2022 wolf et al 2022 however after extensive rain events the concentration of nitroarenes strongly decreased at each sampling site this fact did not correlate with a significantly higher induction in the ames fluctuation assay yg1041 s9 at the sampling sites w4 and w5 than during scarid indicating other drivers of toxicity thus ubiquitously presented polycyclic heteroarenes were identified at each sampling site polycyclic heteroarenes as toxic metabolites of industrial chemicals petroleum hydrocarbons tire wear waste materials from the mining industry and wood preserving facilities could be a historical burden from the mining activity in the ore mining area north eifel incl aachen mkulnv nrw 2012 additionally two possible point sources of pollution are known to discharge their wastewater contaminated with mineral oil directly into the municipal canalization system of the aachen soers wwtp elwas web 2020b 2020a the total amount of tire wear particles entering surface waters in germany from runoffs the rainwater overflow basin and effluents is assumed for up to 20 000 t a baensch baltruschat et al 2021 the negative result in the conducted micronucleus assay was probably based on the nature of sediment extracts as a complex mixture with chemical compounds that inhibited genotoxic effects of single compounds with clastogenic activity brack et al 2005 the observed presence of genotoxic drivers in sediments from the wurm river indicated a temporal exposure of fish in the wurm river to a mixture of frameshift and base pair substituting promutagens in case of sediment perturbation combined with a permanent exposure to nitroarenes and aromatic amines identified genotoxic compounds might contribute to the current insufficient fish fauna status in the studied sector of the wurm river staatliches umweltamt aachen 2005 thus frameshift mutations and base pair substitutions can lead to faulty protein synthesis disrupted cell biochemistry and organic dystrophy the organismic level s consequences extend from inconspicuous effects to cell death severe organic disruptions and cancer flora et al 1993 on the population level possible consequences could include a population shift to adult fish due to embryotoxic effects accompanying genotoxicity koske et al 2019 and a population decline keiter et al 2006b for additional information about the quality characterization of sediments according to ahlf et al 2002 see si s11 4 3 are additional salmonella typhimurium strains suitable for the sediment genotoxicity testing a combination of the micronucleus and the ames fluctuation assays is a proven strategy for recognition of a representative number of in vitro and in vivo genotoxic compounds eastmond et al 2009 in sediment and suspended particulate matter aouadene et al 2008 biruk et al 2017 giorgio et al 2011 keiter et al 2009 rigaud et al 2012 moreover this ebms combination was suggested for its inclusion into the eu wfd the present study showed the application of additional bacterial strains in the ames fluctuation assay as a sensitive method for simultaneously detecting the genotoxic potential and respective chemical drivers moreover the present results concluded less sensitivity of ta100 than ta98 which was already described previously kosmehl et al 2004 reifferscheid et al 2011 sato et al 1985 additionally previous studies implementing yg strains described a higher sensitivity of the salmonella typhimurium strain yg1041 than its corresponding strain ta98 45 times 200 times azuma et al 1997 černá et al 1999 however our study showed a 2 fold higher sensitivity of the salmonella typhimurium stain yg1041 without metabolic activation by the s9 mix such sensitivity discrepancy could be explained by a different complexity and pollution grade of the tested matrixes air born particles in both studies vs sediment samples in the current study thus the present study confirmed the application of the metabolic active salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 as reliable and suitable for non fractionated organic sediment extract testing 5 conclusion the present study described sediments from a small anthropogenically impacted river without significant industrial impact as highly polluted by ubiquitous organic pollutants with strong genotoxic potential particularly contributing to failing the eu wfd the observed presence of genotoxic drivers in sediments from the wurm river indicated in case of sediment perturbation a temporal exposure of fish in the wurm river to a mixture of frameshift and base pair substituting promutagens combined with a permanent exposure to nitroarenes and aromatic amines furthermore rain initiated sediment perturbation and release of the rainwater overflow basin were elucidated as significant factors in increasing the genotoxic potential and concentration of chemicals in sediments the applied combination of the effect based methods was shown as informative and reliable especially implementation of the metabolic active salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 for non fractionated organic sediment extract testing contributed to gaining necessary information about commonly occurring genotoxic compounds further sediment investigations at different weather conditions and implementation of effect directed analysis for the identification of unknown genotoxicity drivers are necessary additionally a desirable goal for further investigation is monitoring the fish population in the wurm river credit authorship contribution statement

16434,wastewater treatment plant effluents and releases from rainwater overflow basins can contribute to the input of genotoxic micropollutants in aquatic ecosystems predominantly lipophilic genotoxic compounds tend to sorb to particulate matter making sediment a source and a sink of pollution therefore the present study aims to investigate the genotoxic potential of freshwater sediments i during the dry period and ii after extensive rain events by collecting sediment samples in one small anthropogenically impacted river in germany up and downstream of the local wastewater treatment plant the micronucleus and ames fluctuation assays with salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 ta100 yg1041 and yg1042 were used to assess the genotoxic potential of organic sediment extracts for evaluation of possible genotoxicity drivers target analysis for 168 chemical compounds was performed no clastogenic effects were observed while the genotoxic potential was observed at all sampling sites primarily driven by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons nitroarenes aromatic amines and polycyclic heteroarenes freshwater sediments genotoxic potential increased after extensive rain events due to sediment perturbation and the rainwater overflow basin release in the present study the rainwater overflow basin was a significant source for particle bound pollutants from untreated wastewater suggesting its role as a possible source of genotoxic potential the present study showed high sensitivity and applicability of the bacterial salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 to organic sediment extracts to assess the different classes of genotoxic compounds a combination of effect based methods and a chemical analysis was shown as a suitable tool for a genotoxic assessment of freshwater

1989 chapman and hollert 2006 hollert et al 2002 and the formation of the european demand driven sediment research network sednet in 2001 the problem of contaminated sediments in europe received increased attention however obligatory sediment monitoring entered the eu wfd not before 2008 and is limited by the analytical testing for at least 21 priority substances european parliament and council 2008 genotoxic chemicals are of primary concern for aquatic ecosystems as there is no environmental safety level hiding a risk at even low concentrations belpomme et al 2007 efsa 2008 multiple

nickel and fuchs 2019 are important pathways for the discharge of particle bound genotoxic chemicals the studied sector of the wurm river receives the effluent and rainwater basin overflows of one of the biggest wwtps in germany the aachen soers wwtp the wwtp effluent makes up about 90 of the total water flow of the wurm river during dry weather at the same time the latter regularly receives the content of the rainwater overflow basin after extensive rain events the study by könemann et al 2019 showed the accumulation of wastewater born chemicals in benthic living organisms like gammarus pulex collected in the wurm river downstream of the rainwater overflow basin and at the effluent site of the aachen soers wwtp the present study focuses on assessing the genotoxic potential in freshwater sediments from the wurm river to investigate different factors impacting the sediments genotoxic potential sampling campaigns were conducted at different weather dry weather and after extensive rain events combined with the rainwater overflow basin release the assessment strategy included a combination of effect based methods ebms and a chemical target screening this approach is a well established strategy brack et al 2009 2019 for evaluation of the genotoxic risk of complex environmental chemicals mixtures altenburger et al 2010 in different matrices such as wastewater altenburger et al 2015 di paolo et al 2016 and sediment hollert et al 2009a 2009b the choice of the genotoxic ebms test battery was driven by the research findings of the last decades reifferscheid

river is presented in fig 1 the present study was a part of the demo3 ac project investigating multiple sites of the wurm river the four most relevant sampling sites were evaluated for the current case study the first sampling site was w2 located close to the urban area of aachen the following sampling site w3 was located downstream of the rainwater overflow basin of the aachen soers wwtp representing the possible impact of untreated wastewater and rainwater discharges the sampling site w4 was directly at the effluent of the aachen soers wwtp the last sampling site w5 was located 2 5 km downstream of the effluent at near natural conditions without known significant sources of pollution the first sampling campaign took place in june 2017 and was characterized by a long dry period and stable hydrological conditions scarid during dry weather the average precipitation rate in aachen within the last 21 d before the sampling campaign accounted for 1 l m2 wetterkontor gmbh 2017 the aachen soers wwtp used conventional wastewater treatment by mechanical biological and chemical steps with the subsequent sand filter during dry weather the effluent water portion in the wurm river

cytogenetic test for detecting chemicals with clastogenic or aneugenic potential micronuclei are fragments of chromosomes that are not correctly transferred to the cell pole during the anaphase the micronucleus assay was performed with the v79 cell line chinese hamster lung cells with and without metabolic activation s9 according to the iso guideline 21 427 2 iso 2004 with some modifications see supplementary information si s1 and as detailed in reifferscheid et al 2008 organic sediment extracts were tested in three independent replicates differing condition days in the concentration of 25 g dw seq ml with a total dmso concentration of 0 1 in the test for each application day quality controls were carried out by preparing one plate with dmso as a negative control and one plate for the respective positive control substance the validity criteria of statistically significant differences between the negative and the positive control within single testing approaches were approved using the t test p 0 05 for the data evaluation procedure a percentage rate of micronuclei per 1000 cells was calculated statistically significant differences were evaluated using two way anova with a post

a point mutation in the histidine gene repeated mutations in the histidine gene can cause reversion to the wild type characterized by the own production of the growth essential histidine salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 and ta100 were used see si s2 due to the limitation of the enzymes found in a typical s9 mix in non detection of such ubiquitously distributed promutagens as nitroarenes iarc working group on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans 2014 and aromatic amines iarc working group on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans 2012 this gap was closed by adding additional bacterial strains yg1041 and yg1042 the latter have elevated levels of o acetyltransferase and nitroreductase making yg1041 and yg1042 more sensitive when these compound classes are present see si s2 sediment extracts were tested in three independent replicates differing condition days for each application day quality controls were carried out by preparing one plate with dmso as a negative control and one plate for the respective positive control substance in six dilution steps the resulting revertant counts at each dilution step 1 2 step 48 revertants were assessed with reference to the revertant count at the negative control plate as i negative in case of no concentration dependent increase ii reproducible in case of a visible concentration dependent increase and iii statistically significant in case of differences to the negative control evaluated by a statistical test international organisation for standardisation 2012 revertant numbers from three independent replicates within the range of six concentrations were tested against the revertant numbers in the negative control plate using two way anova with a post hoc tukey test p 0 05 based on achieved revertant numbers induction factors were calculated the induction factor represents a proportion between the revertant count in the respective concentration and the revertant count within the inner plate negative control an induction factor approach uniforms data making multiple comparisons possible for this purpose seitz et al 2008 developed an approach based on calculating concentration dependent induction factors a concentration dependent induction factor value represents the relationship between the induction factor and the respective concentration therefore concentration dependent induction factor values are independent of the tested concentrations and can be used for environmental samples mutagenicity ranking seitz et al 2008 all statistical procedures were carried out with

statistically significant increase two way anova p 0 05 in micronuclei mnc in comparison to the negative control see si s10 the ames fluctuation assay results with salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta98 s9 indicated particle bound frameshift mutagens in all sediment samples collected during dry weather scarid however the sediment samples collected after extensive rain events scrain showed a strong increase of the particle bound mutagenic potential caused by both frameshift and base pair mutagens at all sampling sites see table 1 in addition exposure of yg1041 and yg 1042 s9 to organic sediment extracts indicated nitroarenes and aromatic amines at all sampling sites during all sampling campaigns analysis of the revertant count using a concentration dependent induction factors method showed mutagenic potential in sediment samples primarily outgoing from frameshift mutagens see fig 2 a stronger expression was observed after the metabolic activation mutagens causing base pair substitutions were less represented in the sediment in salmonella typhimurium strains ta98 s9 and ta100 s9 significantly higher two way anova with post hoc tukey test p 0 05 revertant induction was detected at the sampling site w4 at the effluent and w3 downstream of the rainwater overflow basin respectively during the scrain see fig 3 in contrast the sampling site w2 located upstream of the aachen soers wwtp showed significantly lower induction factors in the salmonella typhimurium strain yg1041 s9 than at w4 and w5 see fig 4 the salmonella typhimurium strain yg1042 s9 showed significantly higher revertant numbers at the sampling site w3 than at the other sampling sites during the dry weather furthermore the metabolic activation by the s9 mix led to a significantly higher revertant number and induction factors at w4 during scrain than during scarid the sampling sites downstream of the aachen soers wwtp w4 and w5 during scrain revealed significantly higher revertant numbers than at the sampling site w2 upstream of the aachen soers wwtp 3 2 chemical target screening 168 target substances were analyzed in organic sediment extracts and out of these 94 target compounds could be quantified see si s9 including aromatic amines carbazoles nitroarenes pahs pcbs phenanthrolines polycyclic heteroarenes plant protective agents dicofol diphenyl sulfone xanthone 4 4 ddmu and 2 4 dinitroaniline see table 2 extensive rain events scrain significantly t test p 0 05 enhanced the total chemical burden as summarized single concentrations at the sampling sites w3 and w4 which were located downstream of the rainwater overflow basin and the effluent of the aachen soers wwtp respectively at the sampling site w3 the total chemical burden during scarid increased from 386 ng mg oc to 4855 ng mg oc during scrain mainly driven by pahs and polycyclic heteroarenes at the sampling site w4 a mixture of trans stilbene nitroarenes pahs pcbs and polycyclic heteroarenes contributed to a pronounced higher chemical burden during scrain 25 695 ng mg oc than the situation a year ago 987 ng mg oc 3 3 assessment of possible drives for genotoxicity for evaluating chemical compounds that potentially contributed to detected mutagenic effects 59 quantified chemicals with expected genotoxicity were evaluated see si s9 due to the postulation that genotoxic compounds have no effect level belpomme et al 2007 detected concentrations were directly related to the analyzed sampling sites the chemical burden of genotoxic compounds at the sampling site w2 located upstream of the aachen soers wwtp and the rainwater overflow basin increased after extensive rain events due to pahs 51 4 aromatic amines 42 9 and other compounds 70 1 see table 3 while the concentration of nitroarenes decreased by 90 9 the concentration of genotoxic chemical compounds in the sediment of the sampling site w3 located after the rainwater overflow basin strongly increased due to aromatic amines 76 2 carbazoles 67 5 pahs 92 2 polycyclic heteroarenes 82 3 and other compounds 91 again a substantial decrease of nitroarenes by 95 8 was observed at the sampling site w3 the effluent sampling site w4 showed the most substantial concentration increase for genotoxic compounds 96 3 this tendency could be at least partially found at the sampling site w5 located 2 5 km downstream of the aachen soers wwtp thus increased concentration of carbazoles 72 pahs 47 7 polycyclic heteroarenes 47 9 and other compounds 76 8 could be observed after prolonged rain events scrain the concentration of genotoxic nitroarenes decreased by 83 3 during scrain in comparison to the scarid 4 discussion the present study was conceptualized as a case study investigating the genotoxic potential in freshwater sediments from a small receiving waterbody in germany under different weather conditions the wurm river as a study object exemplary represents multiple small water bodies in europe struggling with the eu wfd s goals of achieving a good chemical status the studied river s stretch comprised four sampling sites up and downstream of the aachen soers wwtp effluent discharge contributing 90 of the total water flow during dry weather sampling site w4 the time resolution of the sampling campaigns 2017 and 2018 allowed monitoring of sediments under different weather conditions and wwtp functionality effluent treatment rainwater overflow basin release combining effect based methods with a chemical target analysis under the mentioned environmental changes a complex evaluation of the genotoxic potential in the wurm river s sediments was possible 4 1 do weather conditions have an impact on sediment genotoxicity the present results showed a potential impact of weather conditions on the mutagenic potential of sediment samples in the ames fluctuation assay in contrast no impact on chromosomal aberrations in the in vitro micronucleus assay was observed this result was not in line with other studies showing in vitro micronuclei induction after the exposure of eucaryotic cells to pahs brinkmann et al 2014 and sediment extracts boettcher et al 2010 keiter et al 2009 however in situ investigations of micronuclei formation in erythrocytes of juvenile rainbow trouts at the same sampling sites also revealed no chromosomal aberrations data not shown the exposure of the salmonella typhimurium standard strains ta98 and ta100 to organic sediment extracts from the wurm river collected during a prolonged dry period scarid showed the presence of frameshift mutagens only additionally the mutagenic potential at the sampling sites upstream of the effluent w2 and w3 was characterized by promutagens which require metabolic activation by mammal liver enzymes s9 mix to become mutagenic at the effluent site w4 and 2 5 km downstream w5 sediment samples collected during dry weather scarid contained frameshift promutagens the additional inclusion of salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 strains could elucidate nitroarenes and aromatic amines in all sediment samples during dry weather giorgio et al 2011 showed positive results in the salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 s9 after exposure to non polar and polar sediment extracts from the berre lagoon france while the salmonella typhimurium strain yg1041 showed positive results after exposure to the polar extract only in the study by reifferscheid et al 2011 highly polluted sediments middle polar and polar fractions from the spittelwasser creek germany were investigated showing positive results in the salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 s9 in addition they confirmed a high sensitivity of the metabolically competent salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 s9 in contrast to dry weather intensified water flow and sediment perturbation due to extensive rain events during the sampling campaign scrain showed frameshift base pair substituting promutagens including nitroarenes aromatic amines in all investigated sediment samples in particular sediment samples collected at the sampling site w3 located downstream of the rainwater overflow basin showed significantly higher revertant numbers than the sampling campaign during dry weather due to base pair substitution mutagens remarkable was the effluent sampling site w4 indicating a significantly higher genotoxic potential outgoing from frameshift mutagens ta98 s9 nitroarenes and aromatic amines yg1041 s9 in addition the sampling site 2 5 km downstream of the effluent w5 showed significantly higher genotoxic potential after rain events due to nitroarenes and aromatic amines yg1041 s9 interestingly similarly high genotoxic potential independent of weathering conditions was already observed in sediments from large water bodies with pronounced anthropogenic activities in near surroundings for example sediments from the upper danube river higley et al 2012 and the spittelwasser creek reifferscheid et al 2011 in germany taquari river in brazil gameiro et al 2018 yongdinghe watershed ma et al 2003 and several sites within the three gorges reservoir floehr et al 2015 in china united the presence of particle bound frameshift and base pair direct mutagens and frequently promutagens the identification of promutagens was driven by ubiquitously presented lipophilic particle bound contaminants as pahs require metabolic activation before acting mutagenic phillipson and ioannides 1989 the present result indicated ubiquitous genotoxic potential in studied sediments while sediment perturbation as a consequence of rain events or rainwater overflow basin release led to its stronger pronouncement increasing risk to organisms contacting to sediment 4 2 can the observed genotoxic potential in sediments be explained by the target chemical analysis quantified chemical target compounds 94 in the investigated sediment samples comprised the groups of aromatic amines carbazoles nitroarenes pahs polycyclic heteroarenes and other chemical compounds 59 of them were classified as potentially genotoxic the total chemical burden in studied sediment samples remarkably increased after extensive rain events scrain mainly due to pahs classified as genotoxic thus the average concentration of 13 pahs detected in sediments from the wurm river rose by a factor of 7 5 3 mg kg dw during scarid and 34 38 mg kg dw during scrain cornelissen et al 2008 this result correlated with high mutagenic potential in the salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 up to induction factor 50 and yg1041 up to induction factor 75 after the metabolic activation mestankova et al 2014 pahs occur in the environment as combustion products of fossil fuels and can be involved in forming nitroarenes reaction with air nitrogen oxides rosenkranz and mermelstein 1983 tokiwa and ohnishi 1986 scrain took place four days after releasing over 75 000 m3 of a particle rich rainwater wastewater mixture from the rainwater overflow basin thus each rainwater overflow basin release acts as a flash flood with subsequent sediment perturbation which may bear the risk of releasing particle bound chemicals schertzinger et al 2019 shuliakevich et al 2022 wolf et al 2022 however after extensive rain events the concentration of nitroarenes strongly decreased at each sampling site this fact did not correlate with a significantly higher induction in the ames fluctuation assay yg1041 s9 at the sampling sites w4 and w5 than during scarid indicating other drivers of toxicity thus ubiquitously presented polycyclic heteroarenes were identified at each sampling site polycyclic heteroarenes as toxic metabolites of industrial chemicals petroleum hydrocarbons tire wear waste materials from the mining industry and wood preserving facilities could be a historical burden from the mining activity in the ore mining area north eifel incl aachen mkulnv nrw 2012 additionally two possible point sources of pollution are known to discharge their wastewater contaminated with mineral oil directly into the municipal canalization system of the aachen soers wwtp elwas web 2020b 2020a the total amount of tire wear particles entering surface waters in germany from runoffs the rainwater overflow basin and effluents is assumed for up to 20 000 t a baensch baltruschat et al 2021 the negative result in the conducted micronucleus assay was probably based on the nature of sediment extracts as a complex mixture with chemical compounds that inhibited genotoxic effects of single compounds with clastogenic activity brack et al 2005 the observed presence of genotoxic drivers in sediments from the wurm river indicated a temporal exposure of fish in the wurm river to a mixture of frameshift and base pair substituting promutagens in case of sediment perturbation combined with a permanent exposure to nitroarenes and aromatic amines identified genotoxic compounds might contribute to the current insufficient fish fauna status in the studied sector of the wurm river staatliches umweltamt aachen 2005 thus frameshift mutations and base pair substitutions can lead to faulty protein synthesis disrupted cell biochemistry and organic dystrophy the organismic level s consequences extend from inconspicuous effects to cell death severe organic disruptions and cancer flora et al 1993 on the population level possible consequences could include a population shift to adult fish due to embryotoxic effects accompanying genotoxicity koske et al 2019 and a population decline keiter et al 2006b for additional information about the quality characterization of sediments according to ahlf et al 2002 see si s11 4 3 are additional salmonella typhimurium strains suitable for the sediment genotoxicity testing a combination of the micronucleus and the ames fluctuation assays is a proven strategy for recognition of a representative number of in vitro and in vivo genotoxic compounds eastmond et al 2009 in sediment and suspended particulate matter aouadene et al 2008 biruk et al 2017 giorgio et al 2011 keiter et al 2009 rigaud et al 2012 moreover this ebms combination was suggested for its inclusion into the eu wfd the present study showed the application of additional bacterial strains in the ames fluctuation assay as a sensitive method for simultaneously detecting the genotoxic potential and respective chemical drivers moreover the present results concluded less sensitivity of ta100 than ta98 which was already described previously kosmehl et al 2004 reifferscheid et al 2011 sato et al 1985 additionally previous studies implementing yg strains described a higher sensitivity of the salmonella typhimurium strain yg1041 than its corresponding strain ta98 45 times 200 times azuma et al 1997 černá et al 1999 however our study showed a 2 fold higher sensitivity of the salmonella typhimurium stain yg1041 without metabolic activation by the s9 mix such sensitivity discrepancy could be explained by a different complexity and pollution grade of the tested matrixes air born particles in both studies vs sediment samples in the current study thus the present study confirmed the application of the metabolic active salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 as reliable and suitable for non fractionated organic sediment extract testing 5 conclusion the present study described sediments from a small anthropogenically impacted river without significant industrial impact as highly polluted by ubiquitous organic pollutants with strong genotoxic potential particularly contributing to failing the eu wfd the observed presence of genotoxic drivers in sediments from the wurm river indicated in case of sediment perturbation a temporal exposure of fish in the wurm river to a mixture of frameshift and base pair substituting promutagens combined with a permanent exposure to nitroarenes and aromatic amines furthermore rain initiated sediment perturbation and release of the rainwater overflow basin were elucidated as significant factors in increasing the genotoxic potential and concentration of chemicals in sediments the applied combination of the effect based methods was shown as informative and reliable especially implementation of the metabolic active salmonella typhimurium strains yg1041 and yg1042 for non fractionated organic sediment extract testing contributed to gaining necessary information about commonly occurring genotoxic compounds further sediment investigations at different weather conditions and implementation of effect directed analysis for the identification of unknown genotoxicity drivers are necessary additionally a desirable goal for further investigation is monitoring the fish population in the wurm river credit authorship contribution statement
