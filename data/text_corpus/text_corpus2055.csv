10275,this study focuses on the analyses of influx and efflux of groundwater at the aquifer sea interface in response to the total groundwater extraction from a regional coastal aquifer the groundwater planning and management goal is formulated as a multi objective optimization problem to optimize the total pumping groundwater influx and efflux through the coastal boundary a four stage optimization strategy is implemented for solving this optimization problem whereby the first three stages are the iterative optimizations using the proposed multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and the analysis of pareto optimal solutions and the last stage is the selection of one bargaining solution using the kalai smorodinsky approach considering compromises among multiple objectives in order to improve the efficiency of the simulation optimization model deep neural networks emulators are fitted to approximate individual optimization objective and a novel dynamic sampling strategy is applied to adaptively improve the accuracy of the emulators this study demonstrates that accurate and efficient emulators can be achieved for the regional coastal aquifer with zone based pumping rate multipliers from eight bands band 1 to band 8 of increasing distance from the coastal boundary as the decision variables the results from the pareto front suggest that the abstractions of band 2 close to the sea can be reduced to the lower boundary of the rate multiplier 0 5 whereas the abstraction of farther bands can be significantly enhanced the water influx through the coastal boundary was decreased by 15 69 under the slight compromise of the total pumping and water efflux by the selected compromising pumping pattern in the regional model the final pareto optimal solution set and the compromised solution provide valuable information for the groundwater manager to plan sustainable groundwater use the proposed simulation optimization approach used in this study can be applied for a wide range of groundwater management problems graphical abstract ga1 keywords regional groundwater modelling pumping optimization deep neural networks machine learning

seascape groundwater resources in coastal aquifers are vulnerable to contamination from seawater intrusion narayan et al 2007 sreekanth and datta 2014 and submarine discharge of nutrients following groundwater contributes a considerable share of nutrient discharge to the marine environment cook 2011 johannes 1980 loads of pollutants discharging into the sea have been identified to pose a significant risk to the great barrier reef world heritage area in north eastern australian coast mckergow et al 2005a 2005b potential for the twin effects of contamination of groundwater by seawater intrusion werner et al 2013 and impact on marine water quality by the discharge of nutrients robinson et al 2018 makes such coastal aquifers and the associated ecosystems highly vulnerable to contamination risks one of the most important anthropogenic factors that affect the dynamic equilibrium of groundwater in coastal aquifers is groundwater extraction narayan et al 2007 in regions where significant volumes of groundwater are extracted for irrigation the dynamic equilibrium of flux interactions between the sea and aquifer can potentially be affected wang et al 2012 thus affecting the transport of salt from the sea and contaminants from the aquifer past studies have developed simulation optimization methods for identifying optimal pumping patterns for coastal aquifer management recent review papers have comprehensively reviewed different simulation optimization approaches that are employed for coastal aquifer management ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 roy and datta 2018 sreekanth and datta 2015 identifying optimal pumping schemes for a regional aquifer system by directly coupling the numerical groundwater model with an optimization algorithm requires hundreds of thousands of model runs to be executed within the optimization routine this may not always be computationally feasible even when parallel computing resources are available several studies asher et al 2015 razavi et al 2012 have presented the utility of computationally efficient surrogate models also known as emulators in coupled simulation optimization particle swarm optimization pso has been used in various fields successfully e g baltar and fontane 2008 feng et al 2012 gill et al 2006 juneja and nagar 2017 poli et al 2007 as opposed to evolutionary algorithms all particle members survive from the beginning to the ending and their interactions result in the quality improvement of problem solution eberhart and kennedy 1995 kennedy and eberhart 1995 in order to cope with the multi objective optimization problems multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm was developed coello and lechuga 2002 by adding a repository to store the global best locations that are used for guiding the movement of particles in later iterations coello and lechuga 2002 also showed that mopso is a highly competitive approach in comparison with the multi objective evolutionary algorithms applying with two metrics generational distance and spacing metric of multi objective optimization the performance of non dominated solutions indicated that the mospo algorithm outperformed the other evolutionary algorithms baltar and fontane 2008 it was tested that the mopso can provide a good approximation to the true non dominated pareto front gill et al 2006 however the previous studies baltar and fontane 2008 coello and lechuga 2002 coello et al 2004 gill et al 2006 siade et al 2019 employed a repository of limited size which sacrifices the diversity of solutions along the pareto front to some extent a variety of methods for response surface approximation or surrogate modelling have been developed and tested for emulating groundwater flow and transport variables of coastal groundwater management these include evolutionary polynomial regression hussain et al 2015 radial basis function christelis and mantoglou 2016a 2019 artificial neural networks aly and peralta 1999 rogers and dowla 1994 support vector machine asefa et al 2004 lal and datta 2018 kernel extreme learning machine song et al 2018 genetic programming sreekanth and datta 2011 2010 multivariate adaptive regression spline roy and datta 2019 and gaussian process regression rajabi and ketabchi 2017 siade et al 2020 deep neural networks dnn in the form of a new technique of emulator has shown great potential in reducing the computational burden associated with groundwater modelling e g groundwater surface water interaction rohmat et al 2019 high dimensional inverse problem mo et al 2019 the use of emulators in simulation optimization introduces additional uncertainties to the predictions therefore some studies siade et al 2020 song et al 2018 adopted the adaptive training of emulators to balance the computational burden and the accuracy the multiple objectives always play the competitive roles in the optimization problems in the hydrogeology literature of multi objective optimization a substantial number of studies focus on the improvement of the simulation optimization e g roy and datta 2019 siade et al 2019 song et al 2019 and optimization under uncertainty e g ouyang et al 2017 sreekanth et al 2016 white et al 2018 however when multi objective simulation optimization approach applying in the engineering problems one valuable contribution that assists in the decision making processes is the selection of one ideal solution from the pareto optimal front kalai and smorodinsky 1975 proposed a novel approach to select one ideal solution satisfying the monotonicity to the bargaining problem the benefits of all objectives are maximized according to their utility levels in the kalai smorodinsky ks solution kalai and smorodinsky 1975 this approach has been applied in some studies of multi objective optimization gaudrie et al 2018 oukennou et al 2018 to pick up one solution from the pareto optimal front but has not been applied in the hydrogeology many recent studies focused on managing pumping to control groundwater heads and salt concentrations in the aquifer within a prescribed management horizon for coastal aquifer management christelis and mantoglou 2016b dentoni et al 2015 javadi et al 2015 karatzas and dokou 2015 roy and datta 2017a 2017b song et al 2018 zekri et al 2015 in this study we focus on managing the flux of groundwater in and out along the coastal boundary note that the salt influx into the coastal aquifer and the contamination efflux into the sea are directly proportional to the inward and outward water flux from the aquifer sea interface respectively while head and concentration are measured and simulated at a point scale the adoption of groundwater flux as the control variable helps to maintain a regional focus for the coastal aquifer management model this is particularly important as saltwater intrusion can occur at point scale due to up coning as a result of over extraction from individual wells and management models that identify optimal pumping rates to manage concentrations at such locations need not necessarily prevent saltwater intrusion in a regional scale the use of flux as the control variable also helps to focus the management goal on the water balance of the coastal aquifer to the authors best knowledge the flux based approach has previously not been reported for regional coastal aquifer management when the simulation optimization model uses head and concentration values at point scale as the control variables it is often required to simulate these values at a large number of points within the aquifer to get a realistic understanding of the status quo of saltwater intrusion process this often makes simulation optimization methods based on emulators non scalable to regional scale problems this is because emulators must be developed to simulate the head concentration measurements at all the control points thus resulting in an increased computational burden on emulators training this challenge can easily be overcome by using only the total water influx through the coastal boundary as the control variable to characterize the effect of coastal boundary flux on the overall water balance and sustainability of the aquifer additionally quantification of the use of water efflux i e the discharge of groundwater out into the sea corresponding to different pumping schemes as a control variable helps to consider the health of the marine environment as part of the management goal in this study we demonstrate a simulation optimization framework for the optimal management of aquifer sea flux interactions using the data and model for a realistic coastal aquifer system in australia the trade off between three flux components abstractions water influx and efflux across the aquifer sea interface of the aquifer system under different pumping strategies is analyzed using pareto analysis developed by the proposed mopso algorithm the pareto analysis framework involves a calibrated groundwater model and multiple model emulators of dnn the novelty of this work includes i an efficient and effective simulation optimization framework that integrates mopso pareto analysis and dnn emulators for optimal coastal groundwater management ii the development of the mopso algorithm from the pso employed a repository of infinite size to store the non dominated solutions iii use of dnn emulators that are adaptively trained to improve optimization efficiency considering the convergence of the solutions and their diversity on the pareto optimal front iv selection of optimal compromise solution using the kalai smorodinsky ks approach from the pareto front in the context of the multi objective optimization of groundwater management to our knowledge this is the first application of kalai smorodinsky solution and dnn based emulators for coastal aquifer management the proposed approach in this study can be extended to other fields to solve the general multi objective simulation optimization problems the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area and the calibrated numerical groundwater model section 3 describes the implementation of the proposed simulation optimization approach section 4 presents and discusses important results that emerged from this study and section 5 concludes the paper by summarizing the major findings 2 study area and simulation model lower burdekin river catchment is in north queensland australia annual rainfall during the period 1890 2006 ranged from 178 mm to 2143 mm with an annual average of 1003 mm natural vegetation covers nearly 40 of the total area and 18 is covered by wetlands the remainder 36 of the land area is used for sugarcane cultivation groundwater is pumped from the shallow aquifers primarily for irrigating the sugarcane crop wang et al 2012 in this region the aquifer of the burdekin river delta is a complex assortment of deltaic fluvial sediments interbedded with marine deposits overlying bedrocks composed of granitic rocks wang et al 2012 the study area is shown in fig 1 an existing numerical groundwater model for this area covering 75 25 61 25 km2 was developed with the uniform discretization of 350 m in both x direction and y direction and it was calibrated by the queensland government wang et al 2012 the model was originally built as part of a hydrological modelling toolkit to support decision making process for water management in the lower burdekin specifically the model is intended to model changing water levels increased discharge of poor quality groundwater to the environment and seawater intrusion among other objectives therefore these are well aligned with our modelling purpose and warranted their use in our research this model was used in our study for training the dnn emulators and carrying out the pareto analysis 2 1 groundwater model the model wang et al 2012 was built with modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the model area was vertically discretized into three conceptual aquifer layers representing two shallow alluvial layers and a deeper layer of fractured weathered bedrock aquifer the diffuse recharge represented in the model using the modflow rch package accounts for infiltration from rainfall and irrigation water application that were estimated using lumped parameter soil moisture model apsim keating et al 2003 irrigation channel losses and artificial recharge in the region were also added to this recharge package one primary groundwater discharge from the aquifers is the extraction for the sugarcane irrigation the volume of withdrawal for irrigation was estimated using the apsim model by accounting for the irrigation demand which was then shared between surface water and groundwater abstraction wang et al 2012 in doing so 65 of the estimated irrigation demand was assigned to groundwater groundwater abstraction was represented using the modflow wel package accounting for extractions through 3119 wells in the region evaporation and uptake of water from the soil profile by the plant roots were represented using the modflow evt package the interactions between shallow aquifers and surface water features burdekin rivers and haughton rivers and barratta creek as well as freshwater storages ponds were represented using 1152 river cells in the models that govern the sw gw interactions depending on the water level difference between the river and groundwater the model also used the modflow drn package near the coastal boundaries to act as groundwater sinks when groundwater levels exceed the bed elevation of drainage feature a specified head of 0 m was used along the coastal boundary of the model the model was calibrated using the automatic calibration tool pest doherty and hunt 2010 the parameters considered for calibration comprised horizontal hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of all model layers vertical hydraulic conductivity of first and second layers storage co efficient of second and third layers river vertical hydraulic conductivity and drain vertical hydraulic conductivity a zonation approach was adopted for accounting for the spatial variability of the river and drain parameters whereas heterogeneity in hydraulic properties was accounted for by advanced spatial parameterization using pilot points the groundwater level data from 809 bores in the region were used as observations for model calibration the model was calibrated for a period of 10 years between july 1996 and june 2006 a detailed discussion of the model development and calibration is reported in wang et al 2012 the modflow swi2 bakker et al 2013 package was used in the current study to provide more accurate flux variations through the coastal boundary affected by the density dependent flow vertically integrated variable density groundwater flow in the aquifer the constant head cells along the coastal line squares in fig 1 were controlled by the ghb package as recommended by the documentation of swi2 bakker et al 2013 two zones freshwater and saltwater were assumed in this model and the ghb cells were set as the saltwater source in the cells of extraction wells pumping is prevented in cases where the saltwater zone elevation rises over half of the layer thickness for the setting of coastal ghb boundary the model domain was extended into the ocean to avoid the tip cells of the freshwater saltwater interface arriving into the seaward boundary cells the implementation of using the swi2 package was found to have no significant effect on the variations of the groundwater level the main impact of these modifications was the fluxes across the coastline increased influx and decreased efflux it should be noted that to match the observed seawater intrusion of the lower burdekin region foy and bajracharya 2012 this model was repeatedly run a large number of times 2 2 aquifer sea fluxes the groundwater level is close to the sea level in vast areas of the burdekin region near to the coast in the study area fig 1 in some patches near the coast groundwater level can drop below 0 m during some periods this implies that there can be an inward gradient of flow from the sea into the aquifer at other times when the head of groundwater in the aquifer is above the head of seawater groundwater flows into the sea the calibrated model was used to simulate the flux through this boundary for a period of 13 years from 2006 to 2019 fig 2a it is noteworthy that significant volumes of seawater could have entered the aquifer over the years low groundwater levels near the coastal boundary are an important trigger for seawater intrusion abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 yu et al 2019 where a large volume of water is extracted for irrigation over many decades this over extraction likely causes regional negative gradients towards the aquifer resulting in seawater intrusion this anthropogenic factor requires careful management of abstraction water efflux and water influx across the aquifer sea interface in this region to evaluate the effect of varying rates of groundwater extractions in the region the coastal aquifer was divided into eight distinct bands fig 1 the extraction wells in these areas were classified into these eight different bands from band 1 the closest one to the coastal boundary to band 8 farthest away from the coast the current zonation is based on the distance to the coast this however also could be determined by other metrics such as different water management areas identified by regulatory bodies distinct extraction schemes are adopted for the wells of the burdekin region according to the available data wang et al 2012 the number of extraction wells varies between bands with large differences in extractions most extractions were from the middle zone band 2 3 4 and 5 accounting for 91 7 21 3 24 0 27 9 and 18 5 respectively of the total extraction fig 2b band 1 contributed only 1 3 of the total extractions and the remainder was from the farther zones band 6 7 and 8 3 methodology 3 1 multi objective particle swarm optimization in the pso algorithm the particles chase the same objective keeping track of their best location in the search space and are affected by the best location obtained from their neighbours the pso algorithm can be described by the following equations 1 x id t 1 x id t v id t 1 2 v id t 1 ω v id t c 1 r 1 t p id t x id t c 2 r 2 t g id t x id t where x id t and x id t 1 are the best locations of the i th particle in the current iteration and the next iteration respectively similarly v id t and v id t 1 are the corresponding velocities of the current iteration and the next iteration respectively the superscript t denotes the iteration the subscripts i and d represent the number of particles and dimensions decision variables respectively p id t is the individual best location of the particle i and g id t is the global best location until the t th iteration ω denotes the inertial weight of the particle and c 1 and c 2 represent two constant parameters ω c 1 and c 2 were set to 0 7298 2 and 2 respectively clerc and kennedy 2002 r 1 t and r 2 t are the uniformly distributed random numbers in the t th iteration the best location of particle swarms is dependent on its fitness outperforming the fitness of others fitness is a measure of the solution s quality and can be compared in the optimization the maximum velocity was set as 1 3 of the initialization range of search space for more efficient swarm behaviour the reflective boundary condition was applied in updating particles locations and velocities when the particles exceeded the boundary of the search space nozohour leilabady and fazelabdolabadi 2016 once the particle exceeds the given range in the d th dimension it will be placed back into the domain with the equal distance to that boundary while the magnitude of its velocity remains unchanged its direction is reversed described as follows 3 x id t x b x id t x b 4 v id t v id t where x b is the boundary location of the d th dimension maximum or minimum in eq 4 addition applies when the particle s location exceeds the minimum of boundary location whereas the subtraction applies when the location exceeds the maximum as the trade off analysis of multi objective optimization is required in the lower burdekin region some alterations should be done to the pso algorithm firstly a repository with theoretically infinite size was used to store the best solutions that are not ever dominated by others i e the global best locations and their fitness vector this repository updates in each iteration where the new non dominated solutions are inserted and the solutions dominated by the new solutions are removed the repository is lexicographically sorted so that its first element has the best fitness of the first objective ever seen these solutions are numbered by their fitness vector and the next fitness is compared if the previous fitness is equal secondly two performance metrics hypervolume and crowding distance was used to examine the quality of the solution these indicators can present the diversity and the convergence of the near pareto front hypervolume hv is the most used performance metric in multi objective optimization riquelme et al 2015 which measures the hypervolume between the reference point and the non dominated solution set it has a positive correlation with pareto dominance the reference point could be any point where the value is numerically no less than the best fitness of each dimension following the increased pareto dominance the value of hv would gradually improve in each iteration nowak et al 2014 crowding distance cd denotes the diversity of the non dominated solution computing the average distance of each solution to its two neighbouring solutions in contrast the trend of this value decreases during the optimization this indicator is much more important to the mopso algorithm in guiding the particle to search the new non dominated solution taking account of the spread and distribution of the solutions raquel and naval 2005 note that the cd value of boundary solution within the highest or lowest fitness vector is set as an infinite value by default 3 2 dnn emulator dnn was employed to emulate the input output relationship between groundwater pumping coastal influx and efflux of a calibrated groundwater flow model within the simulation optimization framework in this study the fully connected multi layer perceptrons one architecture of the dnn is used a grid search analysis was implemented for the number of neurons and the number of hidden layers based on this one hidden layer was used for all emulators the computing equation used in the mlp emulator is given as follows 5 h out h 1 w l 1 l 2 b 1 φ x i l 0 w l 0 l 1 b 0 w l 1 l 2 b 1 where h out is the output vector of the dnn emulator and x i l 0 is the input matrix of the dnn emulator w l 0 l 1 and w l 1 l 2 are the weight matrixes used in the output calculation of the hidden layer and output layer respectively similarly b 0 and b 1 are the bias vectors of the hidden layer and output layer respectively h 1 is the output matrix of the hidden layer h 1 φ x i l 0 w l 0 l 1 b 0 where φ represents the activation function used in the hidden neurons the subscripts i l 0 l 1 and l 2 represent the fed instances input neurons hidden neurons and the output neuron respectively hyperparameters set for the dnn emulator include the lecun initializer kernel initializer lecun et al 2012 rectified linear unit function activation function and nadam optimization the optimizer of parameter learning dozat 2016 a dropout rate of 0 08 was set in the dropout layer behind the hidden layer to regularize the neural networks two call backs learning rate schedule and early stopping were set to improve the efficiency of the dnn emulator and avoid overfitting in this study dnn emulators were trained to emulate the functional relationship between input pumping multipliers eight zones and the interested objectives water influx and efflux across the aquifer sea interface total extraction flux the initial number of samples for emulator development is 1540 generated by latin hypercube sampling lhs helton and davis 2003 considering both the accuracy and computational time the hidden neurons for the emulators of efflux influx and total pumping flux were 77 33 and 50 respectively based on grid search the inputs for the emulators comprised of the multipliers in the range of 0 4 1 6 larger than the prescribed range will be discussed in section 4 1 for the pumping rates in eight different zones of the lower burdekin region the improved learning algorithms enabled the superior ability of data representation for the dnn géron 2019 therefore it is always used to emulate the complex relationships that are difficult to handle with other simpler emulators in this study we explored whether the dnn can also perform well as other emulators e g gaussian process regression in the predictions of the simpler input output relationships in hydrogeological modelling the analyses indicates that the process of developing dnn emulators for regional coastal aquifer management such as considered in this study is not difficult 3 3 surrogate based mopso algorithm the mopso algorithm fig 3b was constructed based on the deap framework fortin et al 2012 with the following procedures 1 initialization the ranges of parameter search space and the maximum particle velocity should be set from the beginning then the position vector and velocity vector of each particle are randomly generated within the given ranges a reference point that far from the pareto dominance is set for computing the hypervolume the initial iteration counter is set to 0 2 evaluate fitness vector for each particle a fitness vector is approximated from the trained three emulators 3 update pbest and gbest according to the definition particle s best location should be the one that dominates all previous locations of this particle however it often occurs for the multi objective optimization that no one location dominates the other in this context the current best location is randomly selected from the particle s previous best location and its current location as mentioned above a repository is used to store all the non dominated solutions global best locations lexicographically and updates in every iteration for the first iteration the individual best locations of the particles are initially set equal to their initial locations and global best locations are selected from these individual best locations 4 calculate hv and cd extracting the fitness values from the repository the hv value for the near pareto front is calculated also the cd value is computed for each near pareto optimal solution 5 select near pareto solutions the higher cd value of a solution indicates the subdomain around this solution is less crowded and worth to be further explored in order to improve the quantity and the quality of the non dominated solutions the solutions above the 95th percentile value are recorded thus guiding the update of particles locations and speeds if there are not enough near pareto optimal solutions to support one solution over the 95th percentile value may occur for the first iteration all non dominated solutions will be used to help update the velocities of particles 6 update particles locations and speeds the global best location of each particle is randomly selected from the subset of near pareto optimal solutions that over the 95th percentile value and the new velocity and location are calculated by the eqs 2 and 3 the approach can guide the particles to move towards the less crowded area the reflective boundary condition is adopted for those particles outside the search space 7 satisfy iterations increasing the iteration counter if the counter achieves the pre set iteration the particle swarms exit the loop and the multi objective optimization ends otherwise steps 2 6 are repeated 3 4 kalai smorodinsky solution pareto optimal solutions of the multi objective optimization demonstrate pumping solutions that can result in a wide range of influx and efflux through the coastal boundary however under some circumstances the decision makers may not have an explicit criterion for selecting one solution over another one from the pareto front as the improvement of preference criterion for one objective would cause at least one other preference criterion deteriorating the ks approach from the bargaining problem could aid the decision makers to pick up one ideal solution a simple interpretation applying the ks bargaining solution in the two objectives optimization problem is presented in fig 4 two pareto fronts α and β formed by different optimization strategies share the same nadir point a and every solution weakly better benefited to the objective 1 could be found from the pareto β the smaller the value the better the objective this bargaining axiom states that for the value of objective 1 the final bargaining solution in the pareto β should be no greater than the final bargaining solution in the pareto α there is one and only one solution satisfies this monotonicity kalai and smorodinsky 1975 to obtain this solution a line segment should be firstly defined by two important points the first point is the worst utility levels of objectives that do not cooperate with each other nadir point a and the second point is the best utility levels of the objectives ideal point b the ks solution is the intersection of the line segment to the pareto front the nadir point and the ideal point of each objective could be obtained by the single objective pso algorithm excluding the effect of other objectives the pso algorithm is quite similar to the proposed mopso algorithm but it is much simpler where the repository and performance metrics are not required for the pso algorithm steps 4 and 5 are not used and other steps are basically the same as the mopso algorithm in total the pso algorithm is implemented six times to obtain the nadir and ideal objective vectors then the line segment determined by the nadir point and ideal point and the near pareto front are used together computing the distance to the line segment for each dot of the near pareto front the dot with the shortest distance is approximately regarded as the ks solution 3 5 multi objective optimization model in this study we formulated a multi objective optimization problem to evaluate the trade off between three flux components of groundwater flow in and out of the coastal aquifer these are a groundwater pumping flux from the coastal aquifer pumping b water efflux into the sea efflux c water influx from the sea influx note that the pumping efflux and influx are the averaged flux over the entire simulation periods the optimization problem is formulated with three conflicting objectives as given below 6 maximize f p t 1 t z 1 z q t z α z t s 7 m inimize f e t 1 t q sea t s 8 minimize f i t 1 t q sea t s subject to 9 f p f 1 q t z α z 10 f e f 2 q t z α z 11 f i f 3 q t z α z 12 0 5 α z 1 5 where q t z l3 is the groundwater pumping from zone z at stress period t and q t z is a function of α z i e the multiplier of pumping rate adopted for zone z q sea l3 is the groundwater volumes discharged into the sea over the management time horizon and q sea l3 is the groundwater volumes into the aquifer from the sea over the management time horizon f p l3 t f e l3 t and f i l3 t are the objectives of pumping efflux and influx respectively t s t represents the time of the simulation as indicated by eqs 9 11 three objectives f p f e and f i are the functions of α z in areas like the burdekin where large volumes of water are extracted for irrigation which can influence the regional gradient of flow in and out of the coastal aquifer the functions f 1 f 2 and f 3 were obtained by training the emulators based on the dnn in this study this optimization formulation is used to investigate the trade off between the influx and efflux across the aquifer sea interface influenced by groundwater extraction from the aquifer a simulation optimization strategy with the following four stages was implemented fig 3a stage i design of experiment a total of 1540 samples of multipliers for eight bands are generated using lhs and used in groundwater model simulations the values of objectives are calculated from the simulation results for training data driven models three dnn emulators are trained and tested respectively for the objectives pumping efflux and influx the ratio of samples used for the training and testing is 0 8 0 2 note that this ratio is applied to all emulators of this study in combination with the emulators the near pareto optimal solutions of stage i are generated by the proposed mopso algorithm with the iterations of 1000 and the particles of 200 stage ii another 1000 samples are randomly chosen from the pareto front of stage i the selected multipliers instead of the multipliers generated from lhs are applied in the new simulations to change the pumping patterns of the lower burdekin aquifer these samples together with the samples of stage i total 2540 samples are adopted to retrain the emulators that are used in the optimization of stage ii the same parameters of the mopso are used and a new set of non dominated solutions is generated in stage ii stage iii like stage ii 1000 samples are selected and simulated in this stage a total of 3540 samples are used for developing the emulators and the final near pareto optimal solution set is generated the iterative optimization of stage i ii iii makes the non dominated solutions achieving better convergence stage iv pso optimization using the latest emulators from stage iii is adopted to obtain the maximum and minimum of individual objectives to support the application of ks selection iterations and particles are set to 1000 and 50 respectively during the pso optimization that is subject to the same constraint expressed in eq 12 the final bargaining solution is selected from the pareto front of stage iii using the ks approach based on the utility level of the objectives the groundwater flow simulation was implemented with flopy bakker et al 2016 and the emulators were developed in keras chollet et al 2015 a computer of 3 00 ghz intel i5 8500 processor with 8 gb ram was used the corresponding runtime of an individual simulation was around 15 min a single emulator training cost less than 1 min depending on the size of training samples the emulators that satisfied requirements were chosen and saved for speeding up the optimizations the surrogate based optimizations of the pso and the mopso algorithms took around 15 s and 10 min respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 dnn emulation results the sensitivity of the extractions from eight bands on the water influx and efflux through the coastal boundary was tested by a total of 1540 simulations it was found that the larger pumping fluxes lead to the increased water influx and decreased efflux across the aquifer sea interface fig 5 the influence of extractions in band 2 was the greatest to both fluxes in and out across the coast and the effect of pumping gradually weakened from band 2 to band 5 affected by the distance to the shoreline despite band 1 being the closest one to the sea an insignificant impact was observed because of the much smaller extractions of band 1 and the low ratio the small influence of band 6 7 8 on the aquifer sea fluxes was attributed to the greater distance from the sea and the lower ratios the results demonstrated that the effect of regional pumping patterns on the fluxes through the coastal boundary was significant prior to the numerical experiments normalization of the objective function was undertaken to obtain the improved training performances the outputs for the three objective functions pumping efflux and influx based on the process based model were normalized by dividing a factor of 1 85 106 6 17 103 and 6 17 104 respectively the response functions to the multipliers of eight bands were well developed with the examination of training performance and validation performance the dnn emulators were tested with a separate 20 of available samples at the corresponding stage 308 508 and 708 samples respectively for stage i ii iii these samples have not been seen by the dnn and can identify the over fitting if it occurs the predicted results of the emulators were in close agreement with the simulated ones in three stages fig 6 it indicates that 1540 lhs based samples can generate reliable dnn emulators for the three objectives the relationship between zone based pumping multipliers and the pumping objective function was slightly harder to learn than that other two objectives for the dnn emulator the testing performance of the trained emulator was slightly lower for the pumping r2 of 0 95 in comparison with r2 of 0 99 for the other two objectives r2 is the coefficient of determination it was because there was a more complicated nonlinear correlation for the multipliers and the pumping flux thus causing most samples located on the right side of the plot and a higher weight for that data during the dnn training as the samples increased from stage i to stage ii stage iii the performance of the dnn emulator improved for the total extractions r2 from 0 95 to 0 97 0 98 particularly for the samples close to the pareto optimal solutions that located on the right side the ratio of root mean square error rmse to the mean value also demonstrated the superior accuracy of the developed emulators fig 6 the performances of the dnn emulator predictions were improved in the later stage of the iterative optimization the use of the emulator invariably adds additional uncertainties in the model predictions there are several reasons for increased prediction uncertainties of the machine learning emulator in comparison to the physically based model one of the most important reasons for increased predictive uncertainties is due to extrapolation it is common that an emulator is trained for a specified parameter range but sometimes it has to be used out of the prescribed range that should be avoided as much as possible because the prediction power can deteriorate quickly outside the prescribed ranges for example the predictions of the emulator me1 were in good agreement with the simulated results to 1000 samples produced in stage iii but the predictions of the emulator me3 for 1540 samples produced in stage i were worse in comparison with the simulated results table 1 r2 of 1 00 versus r2 of 0 33 note that the me1 me2 and me3 were the emulators developed for the objective efflux only adopting the samples generated in stage i ii and iii respectively in the stage i me1 is trained with inputs from the range 0 4 1 6 for all variables where as in stage ii and stage iii the range is narrower based on the stage i pareto front hence it results in extrapolation when stage ii and stage iii dnn me2 and me3 is used for testing samples from stage i inputs leading to a poorr square values of 0 56 and 0 33 respectively this also shows that it is important to ensure that dnn is not used for extrapolation during optimization the formulation of the optimization problem and sequencing of the stages ensured that only interpolations are undertaken by the dnn in this study the second reason is that the complicated relationship between the input parameters and the output has not been thoroughly captured by the emulator this can be found with more test datasets and the emulator performance can be subsequently improved by increasing the sample size generally the emulator prediction for the input parameters close to the boundary of the trained range is worse than other positions it is caused by the weaker statistical correlation in the samples for the parameter values close to the boundary therefore it is suggested that the sampling space of decision variables for developing the emulator should be larger than the constraint used in optimization besides the distribution of both the input and output should also be considered in preparing the samples for the emulator development otherwise the performance of emulator prediction in some subrange of the prescribed range may be far lower than the other the sample size is highly dependent on the complexity of the input output relationship although the emulating relationship was from a regional coastal groundwater model where multiple processes are interactive nonlinearly the response functions efflux and influx were not too difficult for the dnn emulator development when the pumping bores were classified based on the distance to the coastline if more complicated correlations are required to learn the number of hidden layers could be increased to strengthen the learning ability of the dnn to approximate a more complicated input output relationship the sample size of training an emulator should also be increased if there are too many decision variables input parameters against the surrogate based optimization dimensionality reduction techniques could be combined with the emulator development siade et al 2020 furthermore data transformation to the emulating targets can also improve the performance of the machine learning emulator yu et al 2020 the emulators used in this study significantly reduce the computational burden for the proposed trade off analysis in the regional groundwater model of the lower burdekin it was a huge challenge to manipulate hundreds of thousands of runs of a regional groundwater model for the current optimization with the dnn emulators the process based model was only called 3500 times the trained dnn emulators based on the 3500 runs can be rapidly reloaded to provide prediction during the simulation optimization decision making efficiency has been improved significantly with the application of the dnn emulators we compared the performance of dnn emulator with a few other routinely used approaches including svm tree based methods and gaussian process gp emulators the commonly used svm and tree based methods did not deliver satisfying performance by testing the gp with different types of kernel functions we found that gp emulators with the matern kernel performed equally well as the dnn emulators in our application context however we also encountered the scalability issue with the gp emulators the training time of gp emulator increases dramatically when the training size is above 1000 samples especially when an anisotropic kernel is used that is necessary to allow desired performance 4 2 pareto front analysis a total of 2723 4259 and 4577 non dominated solutions were generated in stages i ii and iii by the mopso algorithm respectively three close pareto fronts were formed by the solutions fig 7 the objective function space was extended from stage i to stage ii iii through the iterative optimizations and the increase of non dominated solutions were attributed to the more accurate emulators the pareto front in stage iii outperformed the other two pareto fronts in favour of the trade off analysis with respect to the convergence and the diversity of the non dominated solutions also the number of solutions the performances of the non dominated solutions in three stages were compared by the metrics of hv and cd it was similar for the three stages that the hv and cd of the non dominated solutions changed rapidly at the first 100 iterations and gradually converged to some values after that fig 8 in these iterations the particles locations changed frequently and moved towards distinct best locations within the decision space the cd median value decreased slowly during the later iterations whereas the hv could still obtain some noticeable improvement in stage iii the hypervolume increased abruptly over some iterations it was because new non dominated solutions that can greatly extend the pareto dominance were identified in these iterations the number of non dominated solutions in stage iii was more than that in stage i and ii contributing to the slightly lower cd value and obvious higher hv value in stage iii fig 8 these indicators suggested that the performance of the proposed mopso algorithm was improved by the iterative optimizations during which the accuracies of the emulators were improved adaptively the final near pareto optimal solution set was generated by stage iii of the iterative optimization the distributions of optimal schemes multipliers in 8 bands were presented in fig 9 in the calibrated model the sum of groundwater extraction in band 6 7 and 8 contributed only 7 0 to the total extraction and these zones were far from the coastline so that the effect on both water influx and efflux through the coastal boundary was slight the optimized results showed that the multipliers for these zones can be increased for maximizing the pumping objective the medians indicated by the white dot of fig 9 of the multipliers in these bands were larger than 1 00 the density distribution in band 6 showed that most of the non dominated solutions likely increased the pumping for the band 6 significantly the contribution of band 1 was also small 1 3 to the total extraction however the other objectives efflux and influx were sensitive to the pumping in this zone since excessive pumping can lead to an obvious decline of the lateral hydraulic gradient the density distribution of the optimized multipliers in band 1 indicated that the total pumping in this zone did not need to be changed considering the trade off of the management goals the extractions in band 2 3 4 5 contributed significantly to the total pumping and were the important factors to the objective pumping the multipliers from the near pareto optimal solutions showed different density distributions for these zones in contrast to the density distribution in the distant zone of band 6 the largest density of the multipliers in band 2 was close to the lower boundary 0 5 the first quartile and the median were close to the values of 0 5 and 0 75 respectively this distribution demonstrated the unique importance of the extraction in band 2 to the objective of minimizing the influx due to its closeness to the coastal boundary if the management schemes allow the larger change to these zones further increasing the pumping water from other distant zones and reducing the pumping water from band 2 will benefit all the management goals the density distribution of the multipliers in band 4 was relatively uniform from 0 5 to 1 5 with the symmetrical values in the first quartile and the third quartile close to 0 75 and 1 25 the optimized results indicated that the extraction in band 4 was influential to both water influx and efflux across the sea aquifer interface and could be adjusted in the defined range depending on the pumping rates of the other bands the multipliers in band 3 favoured the larger values whereas the multipliers in band 5 were more to the smaller values the density distributions demonstrated that the pumping patterns in the coastal aquifer of the lower burdekin region can be changed for better groundwater management and it provided further guidance for the extraction schemes that are not only limited to the adopted multipliers range from 0 5 to 1 5 note that the distributions of multipliers may change under different optimization algorithms but these probability density distributions were the valuable information for the decision makers to manage the coastal aquifers 4 3 selection of single solution the trade off analysis presented the possible behaviours in eight zones for the formulated multi objective optimization problem any solution in the pareto front could become the practical scheme of water management in terms of the distinctive requirements of the decision makers if further information could be obtained by the decision makers that aided the selection of one solution the solution meeting these requirements should be the first choice in this study we provide an optional single solution for decision makers who don t want to impose additional objective subjective criteria in order to pick one solution a compromising solution can be selected based on the nadir and ideal objective vectors six rounds of pso optimizations were implemented to compute the minimum and maximum of the individual objective function and the computed results are presented in fig 7 nadir 1 40 106 1 75 104 1 34 105 ideal 2 67 106 9 03 103 3 10 104 with the order of pumping efflux influx when there exist too many objectives it is inconvenient to conduct single objective optimization the upper boundary and the lower boundary of each objective in the pareto front can then be used as the approximate nadir and ideal point as suggested by kalai and smorodinsky 1975 the selected bargaining solution will obtain an ideal value for the objective with a higher utility level from the pareto front and other objectives will be compromised corresponding to this it should also be noted that this bargaining solution satisfies the symmetry monotonicity and in variance with respect to the affine transformation kalai and smorodinsky 1975 so the transformation of the objectives during the emulator development didn t cause the change of the bargaining solution the approximate solution 2 17 106 1 22 104 7 10 104 was acquired from the pareto front of stage iii with the shortest distance to the line segment further the multipliers of eight bands for the ks solution were obtained white square in fig 9 the selected multipliers resulting from the compromised solution was not consistent with the medians of the final non dominated solution set in eight bands which tended to lower the extractions of band 1 and 2 but raise the extractions of the others applying the multipliers of the compromised solution into the simulation the obtained results showed that water influx was significantly reduced with a ratio of 15 69 compared with the result prior to optimization concurrently the total extraction was lowered by 1 08 and water efflux was increased by 7 96 it suggested that the objectives pumping and efflux compromised to the influx in this bargaining problem conforming to the current understanding to the lower burdekin aquifer that it is an over extraction system resulting in seawater intrusion narayan et al 2007 and that can be alleviated by adjusting the pumping patterns 4 4 limitations in this study we use estimates of changes in coastal boundary flux resulting from a change in groundwater extraction as the primary variable to manage and optimize the dynamic flux equilibrium it is important to note that saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifer and submarine discharge of groundwater are processes that occur at very fine spatiotemporal scales and warrant detailed flow and transport studies in conjunction with comprehensive monitoring for comprehensive quantification such a detailed assessment is not the subject of this study in this study we consider influx and efflux through the coastal aquifer boundary as a variable of interest for groundwater management and investigate the potential of the multi objective optimization approach for management the underpinning assumption is that large influxes into the coastal aquifer from the seaside over the long period of a management horizon would deteriorate the water quality and hence needs to be minimized such analysis that uses modelled flux through the coastal boundary can provide valuable information for medium to long term planning of sustainable limits of groundwater extraction from the coastal aquifer however comprehensive transport modelling and monitoring at finer will further be required to assess the water quality implications of management measures set based on long term planning models 5 summary and conclusions patterns of groundwater extraction from coastal aquifers can interfere with the groundwater flow dynamics through the aquifer boundary with the sea excessive pumping could result in inward flow from the seaside boundary that can cause salinity problems suboptimal pumping could also result in large volumes of freshwater being lost into the sea in this study a multi objective optimization problem was formulated and solved to investigate the effect of pumping on groundwater flux between aquifer and sea using a calibrated regional groundwater model of the lower burdekin region in australia three management goals considered were maximization of total extraction minimization of water influx from the sea and minimization of water efflux into the sea the multi objective optimization problem was solved by the proposed simulation optimization approach integrated the developed multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm deep neural networks dnn emulators and kalai smorodinsky ks approach in this approach all the non dominated solutions are stored in a repository with infinite size which is in favour of the approximation of the ks bargaining solution from pareto front this enables the decision makers to choose any of these non dominated solutions in consideration with other selection criteria the solutions in general indicated that decreasing the total pumping from zones closer to the coast and increasing the total pumping from zones farther away can achieve improved and optimal solutions in the long term an optional single solution was also derived considering the compromise of the objectives with the ks approach the results show that optimizing the pumping patterns can result in a range of scenarios of flow exchange between the aquifer and sea such analyses can help to make informed decisions for coastal aquifer management this study used an offline training framework the method could be extended for enabling online training of the emulator during simulation optimization cycles the feedback loop of simulation emulation and optimization could be optimized to improve the efficiency and efficacy of simulation optimization the dnn technique is powerful and it can also perform well in relatively simple functional relationship it should be applied more widely to help address hydrogeological challenges for not only the complex and dynamic

10275,this study focuses on the analyses of influx and efflux of groundwater at the aquifer sea interface in response to the total groundwater extraction from a regional coastal aquifer the groundwater planning and management goal is formulated as a multi objective optimization problem to optimize the total pumping groundwater influx and efflux through the coastal boundary a four stage optimization strategy is implemented for solving this optimization problem whereby the first three stages are the iterative optimizations using the proposed multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and the analysis of pareto optimal solutions and the last stage is the selection of one bargaining solution using the kalai smorodinsky approach considering compromises among multiple objectives in order to improve the efficiency of the simulation optimization model deep neural networks emulators are fitted to approximate individual optimization objective and a novel dynamic sampling strategy is applied to adaptively improve the accuracy of the emulators this study demonstrates that accurate and efficient emulators can be achieved for the regional coastal aquifer with zone based pumping rate multipliers from eight bands band 1 to band 8 of increasing distance from the coastal boundary as the decision variables the results from the pareto front suggest that the abstractions of band 2 close to the sea can be reduced to the lower boundary of the rate multiplier 0 5 whereas the abstraction of farther bands can be significantly enhanced the water influx through the coastal boundary was decreased by 15 69 under the slight compromise of the total pumping and water efflux by the selected compromising pumping pattern in the regional model the final pareto optimal solution set and the compromised solution provide valuable information for the groundwater manager to plan sustainable groundwater use the proposed simulation optimization approach used in this study can be applied for a wide range of groundwater management problems graphical abstract ga1 keywords regional groundwater modelling pumping optimization deep neural networks machine learning

seascape groundwater resources in coastal aquifers are vulnerable to contamination from seawater intrusion narayan et al 2007 sreekanth and datta 2014 and submarine discharge of nutrients following groundwater contributes a considerable share of nutrient discharge to the marine environment cook 2011 johannes 1980 loads of pollutants discharging into the sea have been identified to pose a significant risk to the great barrier reef world heritage area in north eastern australian coast mckergow et al 2005a 2005b potential for the twin effects of contamination of groundwater by seawater intrusion werner et al 2013 and impact on marine water quality by the discharge of nutrients robinson et al 2018 makes such coastal aquifers and the associated ecosystems highly vulnerable to contamination risks one of the most important anthropogenic factors that affect the dynamic equilibrium of groundwater in coastal aquifers is groundwater extraction narayan et al 2007 in regions where significant volumes of groundwater are extracted for irrigation the dynamic equilibrium of flux interactions between the sea and aquifer can potentially be affected wang et al 2012 thus affecting the transport of salt from the sea and contaminants from the aquifer past studies have developed simulation optimization methods for identifying optimal pumping patterns for coastal aquifer management recent review papers have comprehensively reviewed different simulation optimization approaches that are employed for coastal aquifer management ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 roy and datta 2018 sreekanth and datta 2015 identifying optimal pumping schemes for a regional aquifer system by directly coupling the numerical groundwater model with an optimization algorithm requires hundreds of thousands of model runs to be executed within the optimization routine this may not always be computationally feasible even when parallel computing resources are available several studies asher et al 2015 razavi et al 2012 have presented the utility of computationally efficient surrogate models also known as emulators in coupled simulation optimization particle swarm optimization pso has been used in various fields successfully e g baltar and fontane 2008 feng et al 2012 gill et al 2006 juneja and nagar 2017 poli et al 2007 as opposed to evolutionary algorithms all particle members survive from the beginning to the ending and their interactions result in the quality improvement of problem solution eberhart and kennedy 1995 kennedy and eberhart 1995 in order to cope with the multi objective optimization problems multi objective particle swarm optimization mopso algorithm was developed coello and lechuga 2002 by adding a repository to store the global best locations that are used for guiding the movement of particles in later iterations coello and lechuga 2002 also showed that mopso is a highly competitive approach in comparison with the multi objective evolutionary algorithms applying with two metrics generational distance and spacing metric of multi objective optimization the performance of non dominated solutions indicated that the mospo algorithm outperformed the other evolutionary algorithms baltar and fontane 2008 it was tested that the mopso can provide a good approximation to the true non dominated pareto front gill et al 2006 however the previous studies baltar and fontane 2008 coello and lechuga 2002 coello et al 2004 gill et al 2006 siade et al 2019 employed a repository of limited size which sacrifices the diversity of solutions along the pareto front to some extent a variety of methods for response surface approximation or surrogate modelling have been developed and tested for emulating groundwater flow and transport variables of coastal groundwater management these include evolutionary polynomial regression hussain et al 2015 radial basis function christelis and mantoglou 2016a 2019 artificial neural networks aly and peralta 1999 rogers and

reducing the computational burden associated with groundwater modelling e g groundwater surface water interaction rohmat et al 2019 high dimensional inverse problem mo et al 2019 the use of emulators in simulation optimization introduces additional uncertainties to the predictions therefore some studies siade et al 2020 song et al 2018 adopted the adaptive training of emulators to balance the computational burden and the accuracy the multiple objectives always play the competitive roles in the optimization problems in the hydrogeology literature of multi objective optimization a substantial number of studies focus on the improvement of the simulation optimization e g roy and datta 2019 siade et al 2019 song et al 2019 and optimization under uncertainty e g ouyang et al 2017 sreekanth et al 2016 white et al 2018 however when multi objective simulation optimization approach applying in the engineering problems one valuable contribution that assists in the decision making processes is the selection of one ideal solution from the pareto optimal front kalai and smorodinsky 1975 proposed a novel approach to select one ideal solution satisfying the monotonicity to the bargaining problem the benefits of all objectives are maximized according to their utility levels in the kalai smorodinsky ks solution kalai and smorodinsky 1975 this approach has been applied in some studies of multi objective optimization gaudrie et al 2018 oukennou et al 2018 to pick up one solution from the pareto optimal front but has not been applied in the hydrogeology many recent studies focused on managing pumping to control groundwater heads and salt concentrations in the aquifer within a prescribed management horizon for coastal aquifer management christelis and mantoglou 2016b dentoni et al 2015 javadi et al 2015 karatzas and dokou 2015 roy and datta 2017a 2017b song et al 2018 zekri et al 2015 in this study we focus on managing the flux of groundwater in and out along the coastal boundary note that the salt influx into the coastal aquifer and the contamination efflux into the sea are directly proportional to the inward and outward water flux from the aquifer sea interface respectively while head and concentration are measured and simulated at a point scale the adoption of groundwater flux as the control variable helps to maintain a regional focus for the coastal aquifer management model this is particularly important as saltwater intrusion can occur at point scale due to up coning as a result of over extraction from individual wells and management models that identify optimal pumping rates to manage concentrations at such locations need not necessarily prevent saltwater intrusion in a regional scale the use of flux as the control variable also helps to focus the management goal on the water balance of the coastal aquifer to the authors best knowledge the flux based approach has previously not been reported for regional coastal aquifer management when the simulation optimization model uses head and concentration values at point scale as the control variables it is often required to simulate these values at a large number of points within the aquifer to get a realistic understanding of the status quo of saltwater intrusion process this often makes simulation optimization methods based on emulators non scalable to regional scale problems this is because emulators must be developed to simulate the head concentration measurements at all the control points thus resulting in an increased computational burden on emulators training this challenge can easily be overcome by using only the total water influx through the coastal boundary as the control variable to characterize the effect of coastal boundary flux on the overall water balance and sustainability of the aquifer additionally quantification of the use of water efflux i e the discharge of groundwater out into the sea corresponding to different pumping schemes as a control variable helps to consider the health of the marine environment as part of the management goal in this study we demonstrate a simulation optimization framework for the optimal management of aquifer sea flux interactions using the data and model for a realistic coastal aquifer system in australia the trade off between three flux components abstractions water influx and efflux across the aquifer sea interface of the aquifer system under different pumping strategies is analyzed using pareto analysis developed by the proposed mopso algorithm the pareto analysis framework involves a calibrated groundwater model and multiple model emulators of dnn the novelty of this work includes i an efficient and effective simulation optimization framework that integrates mopso pareto analysis and dnn emulators for optimal coastal groundwater management ii the development of the mopso algorithm from the pso employed a repository of infinite size to store the non dominated solutions iii use of dnn emulators that are adaptively trained to improve optimization efficiency considering the convergence of the solutions and their diversity on the pareto optimal front iv selection of optimal compromise solution using the kalai smorodinsky ks approach from the pareto front in the context of the multi objective optimization of groundwater management to our knowledge this is the first application of kalai smorodinsky solution and dnn based emulators for coastal aquifer management the proposed approach in this study can be extended to other fields to solve the general multi objective simulation optimization problems the remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows section 2 provides a brief description of the study area and the calibrated numerical groundwater model section 3 describes the implementation of the proposed simulation optimization approach section 4 presents and discusses important results that emerged from this study and section 5 concludes the paper by summarizing the major findings 2 study area and simulation model lower burdekin river catchment is in north queensland australia annual rainfall during the period 1890 2006 ranged from 178 mm to 2143 mm with an annual average of 1003 mm natural vegetation covers nearly 40 of the total area and 18 is covered by wetlands the remainder 36 of the land area is used for sugarcane cultivation groundwater is pumped from the shallow aquifers primarily for irrigating the sugarcane crop wang et al 2012 in this region the aquifer of the burdekin river delta is a complex assortment of deltaic fluvial sediments interbedded with marine deposits overlying bedrocks composed of granitic rocks wang et al 2012 the study area is shown in fig 1 an existing numerical groundwater model for this area covering 75 25 61 25 km2 was developed with the uniform discretization of 350 m in both x direction and y direction and it was calibrated by the queensland government wang et al 2012 the model was originally built as part of a hydrological modelling toolkit to support decision making process for water management in the lower burdekin specifically the model is intended to model changing water levels increased discharge of poor quality groundwater to the environment and seawater intrusion among other objectives therefore these are well aligned with our modelling purpose and warranted their use in our research this model was used in our study for training the dnn emulators and carrying out the pareto analysis 2 1 groundwater model the model wang et al 2012 was built with modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the model area was vertically discretized into three conceptual aquifer layers representing two shallow alluvial layers and a deeper layer of fractured weathered bedrock aquifer the diffuse recharge represented in the model using the modflow rch package accounts for infiltration from rainfall and irrigation water application that were estimated using lumped parameter soil moisture model apsim keating et al 2003 irrigation channel losses and artificial recharge in the region were also added to this recharge package one primary groundwater discharge from the aquifers is the extraction for the sugarcane irrigation the volume of withdrawal for irrigation was estimated using the apsim model by accounting for the irrigation demand which was then shared between surface water and groundwater abstraction wang et al 2012 in doing so 65 of the estimated irrigation demand was assigned to groundwater groundwater abstraction was represented using the modflow wel package accounting for extractions through 3119 wells in the region evaporation and uptake of water from the soil profile by the plant roots were represented using the modflow evt package the interactions between shallow aquifers and surface water features burdekin rivers and haughton rivers and barratta creek as well as freshwater storages ponds were represented using 1152 river cells in the models that govern the sw gw interactions depending on the water level difference between the river and groundwater the model also used the modflow drn package near the coastal boundaries to act as groundwater sinks when groundwater levels exceed the bed elevation of drainage feature a specified head of 0 m was used along the coastal boundary of the model the model was calibrated using the automatic calibration tool pest doherty and hunt 2010 the parameters considered for calibration comprised horizontal hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of all model layers vertical hydraulic conductivity of first and second layers storage co efficient of second and third layers river vertical hydraulic conductivity and drain vertical hydraulic conductivity a zonation approach was adopted for accounting for the spatial variability of the river and drain parameters whereas heterogeneity in hydraulic properties was accounted for by advanced spatial parameterization using pilot points the groundwater level data from 809 bores in the region were used as observations for model calibration the model was calibrated for a period of 10 years between july 1996 and june 2006 a detailed discussion of the model development and calibration is reported in wang et al 2012 the modflow swi2 bakker et al 2013 package was used in the current study to provide more accurate flux variations through the coastal boundary affected by the density dependent flow vertically integrated variable density groundwater flow in the aquifer the constant head cells along the coastal line squares in fig 1 were controlled by the ghb package as recommended by the documentation of swi2 bakker et al 2013 two zones freshwater and saltwater were assumed in this model and the ghb cells were set as the saltwater source in the cells of extraction wells pumping is prevented in cases where the saltwater zone elevation rises over half of the layer thickness for the setting of coastal ghb boundary the model domain was extended into the ocean to avoid the tip cells of the freshwater saltwater interface arriving into the seaward boundary cells the implementation of using the swi2 package was found to have no significant effect on the variations of the groundwater level the main impact of these modifications was the fluxes across the coastline increased influx and decreased efflux it should be noted that to match the observed seawater intrusion of the lower burdekin region foy and bajracharya 2012 this model was repeatedly run a large number of times 2 2 aquifer sea fluxes the groundwater level is close to the sea level in vast areas of the burdekin region near to the coast in the study area fig 1 in some patches near the coast groundwater level can drop below 0 m during some periods this implies that there can be an inward gradient of flow from the sea into the aquifer at other times when the head of groundwater in the aquifer is above the head of seawater groundwater flows into the sea the calibrated model was used to simulate the flux through this boundary for a period of 13 years from 2006 to 2019 fig 2a it is noteworthy that significant volumes of seawater could have entered the aquifer over the years low groundwater levels near the coastal boundary are an important trigger for seawater intrusion abdoulhalik and ahmed 2018 yu et al 2019 where a large volume of water is extracted for irrigation over many decades this over extraction likely causes regional negative gradients towards the aquifer resulting in seawater intrusion this anthropogenic factor requires careful management of abstraction water efflux and water influx across the aquifer sea interface in this region to evaluate the effect of varying rates of groundwater extractions in the region the coastal aquifer was divided into eight distinct bands fig 1 the extraction wells in these areas were classified into these eight different bands from band 1 the closest one to the coastal boundary to band 8 farthest away from the coast the current zonation is based on the distance to the coast this however also could be determined by other metrics such as different water management areas identified by regulatory bodies distinct extraction schemes are adopted for the wells of the burdekin region according to the available data wang et al 2012 the number of extraction wells varies between bands with large differences in extractions most extractions were from the middle zone band 2 3 4 and 5 accounting for 91 7 21 3 24 0 27 9 and 18 5 respectively of the total extraction fig 2b band 1 contributed only 1 3 of the total extractions and the remainder was from the farther zones band 6 7 and 8 3 methodology 3 1 multi objective particle swarm optimization in the pso algorithm the particles chase the same objective keeping track of their best location in the search space and are affected by the best location obtained from their neighbours the pso algorithm can be described by the following equations 1 x id t 1 x id t v id t 1 2 v id t 1 ω v id t c 1 r 1 t p id t x id t c 2 r 2 t g id t x id t where x id t and x id t 1 are the best locations of the i th particle in the current iteration and the next iteration respectively similarly v id t and v id t 1 are the corresponding velocities of the current iteration and the next iteration respectively the superscript t denotes the iteration the subscripts i and d represent the number of particles and dimensions decision variables respectively p id t is the individual best location of the particle i and g id t is the global best location until the t th iteration ω denotes the inertial weight of the particle and c 1 and c 2 represent two constant parameters ω c 1 and c 2 were set to 0 7298 2 and 2 respectively clerc and kennedy 2002 r 1 t and r 2 t are the uniformly distributed random numbers in the t th iteration the best location of particle swarms is dependent on its fitness outperforming the fitness of others fitness is a measure of the solution s quality and can be compared in the optimization the maximum velocity was set as 1 3 of the initialization range of search space for more efficient swarm behaviour the reflective boundary condition was applied in updating particles locations and velocities when the particles exceeded the boundary of the search space nozohour leilabady and fazelabdolabadi 2016 once the particle exceeds the given range in the d th dimension it will be placed back into the domain with the equal distance to that boundary while the magnitude of its velocity remains unchanged its direction is reversed described as follows 3 x id t x b x id t x b 4 v id t v id t where x b is the boundary location of the d th dimension maximum or minimum in eq 4 addition applies when the particle s location exceeds the minimum of boundary location whereas the subtraction applies when the location exceeds the maximum as the trade off analysis of multi objective optimization is required in the lower burdekin region some alterations should be done to the pso algorithm firstly a repository with theoretically infinite size was used to store the best solutions that are not ever dominated by others i e the global best locations and their fitness vector this repository updates in each iteration where the new non dominated solutions are inserted and the solutions dominated by the new solutions are removed the repository is lexicographically sorted so that its first element has the best fitness of the first objective ever seen these solutions are numbered by their fitness vector and the next fitness is compared if the previous fitness is equal secondly two performance metrics hypervolume and crowding distance was used to examine the quality of the solution these indicators can present the diversity and the convergence of the near pareto front hypervolume hv is the most used performance metric in multi objective optimization riquelme et al 2015 which measures the hypervolume between the reference point and the non dominated solution set it has a positive correlation with pareto dominance the reference point could be any point where the value is numerically no less than the best fitness of each dimension following the increased pareto dominance the value of hv would gradually improve in each iteration nowak et al 2014 crowding distance cd denotes the diversity of the non dominated solution computing the average distance of each solution to its two neighbouring solutions in contrast the trend of this value decreases during the optimization this indicator is much more important to the mopso algorithm in guiding the particle to search the new non dominated solution taking account of the spread and distribution of the solutions raquel and naval 2005 note that the cd value of boundary solution within the highest or lowest fitness vector is set as an infinite value by default 3 2 dnn emulator dnn was employed to emulate the input output relationship between groundwater pumping coastal influx and efflux of a calibrated groundwater flow model within the simulation optimization framework in this study the fully connected multi layer perceptrons one architecture of the dnn is used a grid search analysis was implemented for the number of neurons and the number of hidden layers based on this one hidden layer was used for all emulators the computing equation used in the mlp emulator is given as follows 5 h out h 1 w l 1 l 2 b 1 φ x i l 0 w l 0 l 1 b 0 w l 1 l 2 b 1 where h out is the output vector of the dnn emulator and x i l 0 is the input matrix of the dnn emulator w l 0 l 1 and w l 1 l 2 are the weight matrixes used in the output calculation of the hidden layer and output layer respectively similarly b 0 and b 1 are the bias vectors of the hidden layer and output layer respectively h 1 is the output matrix of the hidden layer h 1 φ x i l 0 w l 0 l 1 b 0 where φ represents the activation function used in the hidden neurons the subscripts i l 0 l 1 and l 2 represent the fed instances input neurons hidden neurons and the output neuron respectively hyperparameters set for the dnn emulator include the lecun initializer kernel initializer lecun et al 2012 rectified linear unit function activation function and nadam optimization the optimizer of parameter learning dozat 2016 a dropout rate of 0 08 was set in the dropout layer behind the hidden layer to regularize the neural networks two call backs learning rate schedule and early stopping were set to improve the efficiency of the dnn emulator and avoid overfitting in this study dnn emulators were trained to emulate the functional relationship between input pumping multipliers eight zones and the interested objectives water influx and efflux across the aquifer sea interface total extraction flux the initial number of samples for emulator development is 1540 generated by latin hypercube sampling lhs helton and davis 2003 considering both the accuracy and computational time the hidden neurons for the emulators of efflux influx and total pumping flux were 77 33 and 50 respectively based on grid search the inputs for the emulators comprised of the multipliers in the range of 0 4 1 6 larger than the prescribed range will be discussed in section 4 1 for the pumping rates in eight different zones of the lower burdekin region the improved learning algorithms enabled the superior ability of data representation for the dnn géron 2019 therefore it is always used to emulate the complex relationships that are difficult to handle with other simpler emulators in this study we explored whether the dnn can also perform well as other emulators e g gaussian process regression in the predictions of the simpler input output relationships in hydrogeological modelling the analyses indicates that the process of developing dnn emulators for regional coastal aquifer management such as considered in this study is not difficult 3 3 surrogate based mopso algorithm the mopso algorithm fig 3b was constructed based on the deap framework fortin et al 2012 with the following procedures 1 initialization the ranges of parameter search space and the maximum particle velocity should be set from the beginning then the position vector and velocity vector of each particle are randomly generated within the given ranges a reference point that far from the pareto dominance is set for computing the hypervolume the initial iteration counter is set to 0 2 evaluate fitness vector for each particle a fitness vector is approximated from the trained three emulators 3 update pbest and gbest according to the definition particle s best location should be the one that dominates all previous locations of this particle however it often occurs for the multi objective optimization that no one location dominates the other in this context the current best location is randomly selected from the particle s previous best location and its current location as mentioned above a repository is used to store all the non dominated solutions global best locations lexicographically and updates in every iteration for the first iteration the individual best locations of the particles are initially set equal to their initial locations and global best locations are selected from these individual best locations 4 calculate hv and cd extracting the fitness values from the repository the hv value for the near pareto front is calculated also the cd value is computed for each near pareto optimal solution 5 select near pareto solutions the higher cd value of a solution indicates the subdomain around this solution is less crowded and worth to be further explored in order to improve the quantity and the quality of the non dominated solutions the solutions above the 95th percentile value are recorded thus guiding the update of particles locations and speeds if there are not enough near pareto optimal solutions to support one solution over the 95th percentile value may occur for the first iteration all non dominated solutions will be used to help update the velocities of particles 6 update particles locations and speeds the global best location of each particle is randomly selected from the subset of near pareto optimal solutions that over the 95th percentile value and the new velocity and location are calculated by the eqs 2 and 3 the approach can guide the particles to move towards the less crowded area the reflective boundary condition is adopted for those particles outside the search space 7 satisfy iterations increasing the iteration counter if the counter achieves the pre set iteration the particle swarms exit the loop and the multi objective optimization ends otherwise steps 2 6 are repeated 3 4 kalai smorodinsky solution pareto optimal solutions of the multi objective optimization demonstrate pumping solutions that can result in a wide range of influx and efflux through the coastal boundary however under some circumstances the decision makers may not have an explicit criterion for selecting one solution over another one from the pareto front as the improvement of preference criterion for one objective would cause at least one other preference criterion deteriorating the ks approach from the bargaining problem could aid the decision makers to pick up one ideal solution a simple interpretation applying the ks bargaining solution in the two objectives optimization problem is presented in fig 4 two pareto fronts α and β formed by different optimization strategies share the same nadir point a and every solution weakly better benefited to the objective 1 could be found from the pareto β the smaller the value the better the objective this bargaining axiom states that for the value of objective 1 the final bargaining solution in the pareto β should be no greater than the final bargaining solution in the pareto α there is one and only one solution satisfies this monotonicity kalai and smorodinsky 1975 to obtain this solution a line segment should be firstly defined by two important points the first point is the worst utility levels of objectives that do not cooperate with each other nadir point a and the second point is the best utility levels of the objectives ideal point b the ks solution is the intersection of the line segment to the pareto front the nadir point and the ideal point of each objective could be obtained by the single objective pso algorithm excluding the effect of other objectives the pso algorithm is quite similar to the proposed mopso algorithm but it is much simpler where the repository and performance metrics are not required for the pso algorithm steps 4 and 5 are not used and other steps are basically the same as the mopso algorithm in total the pso algorithm is implemented six times to obtain the nadir and ideal objective vectors then the line segment determined by the nadir point and ideal point and the near pareto front are used together computing the distance to the line segment for each dot of the near pareto front the dot with the shortest distance is approximately regarded as the ks solution 3 5 multi objective optimization model in this study we formulated a multi objective optimization problem to evaluate the trade off between three flux components of groundwater flow in and out of the coastal aquifer these are a groundwater pumping flux from the coastal aquifer pumping b water efflux into the sea efflux c water influx from the sea influx note that the pumping efflux and influx are the averaged flux over the entire simulation periods the optimization problem is formulated with three conflicting objectives as given below 6 maximize f p t 1 t z 1 z q t z α z t s 7 m inimize f e t 1 t q sea t s 8 minimize f i t 1 t q sea t s subject to 9 f p f 1 q t z α z 10 f e f 2 q t z α z 11 f i f 3 q t z α z 12 0 5 α z 1 5 where q t z l3 is the groundwater pumping from zone z at stress period t and q t z is a function of α z i e the multiplier of pumping rate adopted for zone z q sea l3 is the groundwater volumes discharged into the sea over the management time horizon and q sea l3 is the groundwater volumes into the aquifer from the sea over the management time horizon f p l3 t f e l3 t and f i l3 t are the objectives of pumping efflux and influx respectively t s t represents the time of the simulation as indicated by eqs 9 11 three objectives f p f e and f i are the functions of α z in areas like the burdekin where large volumes of water are extracted for irrigation which can influence the regional gradient of flow in and out of the coastal aquifer the functions f 1 f 2 and f 3 were obtained by training the emulators based on the dnn in this study this optimization formulation is used to investigate the trade off between the influx and efflux across the aquifer sea interface influenced by groundwater extraction from the aquifer a simulation optimization strategy with the following four stages was implemented fig 3a stage i design of experiment a total of 1540 samples of multipliers for eight bands are generated using lhs and used in groundwater model simulations the values of objectives are calculated from the simulation results for training data driven models three dnn emulators are trained and tested respectively for the objectives pumping efflux and influx the ratio of samples used for the training and testing is 0 8 0 2 note that this ratio is applied to all emulators of this study in combination with the emulators the near pareto optimal solutions of stage i are generated by the proposed mopso algorithm with the iterations of 1000 and the particles of 200 stage ii another 1000 samples are randomly chosen from the pareto front of stage i the selected multipliers instead of the multipliers generated from lhs are applied in the new simulations to change the pumping patterns of the lower burdekin aquifer these samples together with the samples of stage i total 2540 samples are adopted to retrain the emulators that are used in the optimization of stage ii the same parameters of the mopso are used and a new set of non dominated solutions is generated in stage ii stage iii like stage ii 1000 samples are selected and simulated in this stage a total of 3540 samples are used for developing the emulators and the final near pareto optimal solution set is generated the iterative optimization of stage i ii iii makes the non dominated solutions achieving better convergence stage iv pso optimization using the latest emulators from stage iii is adopted to obtain the maximum and minimum of individual objectives to support the application of ks selection iterations and particles are set to 1000 and 50 respectively during the pso optimization that is subject to the same constraint expressed in eq 12 the final bargaining solution is selected from the pareto front of stage iii using the ks approach based on the utility level of the objectives the groundwater flow simulation was implemented with flopy bakker et al 2016 and the emulators were developed in keras chollet et al 2015 a computer of 3 00 ghz intel i5 8500 processor with 8 gb ram was used the corresponding runtime of an individual simulation was around 15 min a single emulator training cost less than 1 min depending on the size of training samples the emulators that satisfied requirements were chosen and saved for speeding up the optimizations the surrogate based optimizations of the pso and the mopso algorithms took around 15 s and 10 min respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 dnn emulation results the sensitivity of the extractions from eight bands on the water influx and efflux through the coastal boundary was tested by a total of 1540 simulations it was found that the larger pumping fluxes lead to the increased water influx and decreased efflux across the aquifer sea interface fig 5 the influence of extractions in band 2 was the greatest to both fluxes in and out across the coast and the effect of pumping gradually weakened from band 2 to band 5 affected by the distance to the shoreline despite band 1 being the closest one to the sea an insignificant impact was observed because of the much smaller extractions of band 1 and the low ratio the small influence of band 6 7 8 on the aquifer sea fluxes was attributed to the greater distance from the sea and the lower ratios the results demonstrated that the effect of regional pumping patterns on the fluxes through the coastal boundary was significant prior to the numerical experiments normalization of the objective function was undertaken to obtain the improved training performances the outputs for the three objective functions pumping efflux and influx based on the process based model were normalized by dividing a factor of 1 85 106 6 17 103 and 6 17 104 respectively the response functions to the multipliers of eight bands were well developed with the examination of training performance and validation performance the dnn emulators were tested with a separate 20 of available samples at the corresponding stage 308 508 and 708 samples respectively for stage i ii iii these samples have not been seen by the dnn and can identify the over fitting if it occurs the predicted results of the emulators were in close agreement with the simulated ones in three stages fig 6 it indicates that 1540 lhs based samples can generate reliable dnn emulators for the three objectives the relationship between zone based pumping multipliers and the pumping objective function was slightly harder to learn than that other two objectives for the dnn emulator the testing performance of the trained emulator was slightly lower for the pumping r2 of 0 95 in comparison with r2 of 0 99 for the other two objectives r2 is the coefficient of determination it was because there was a more complicated nonlinear correlation for the multipliers and the pumping flux thus causing most samples located on the right side of the plot and a higher weight for that data during the dnn training as the samples increased from stage i to stage ii stage iii the performance of the dnn emulator improved for the total extractions r2 from 0 95 to 0 97 0 98 particularly for the samples close to the pareto optimal solutions that located on the right side the ratio of root mean square error rmse to the mean value also demonstrated the superior accuracy of the developed emulators fig 6 the performances of the dnn emulator predictions were improved in the later stage of the iterative optimization the use of the emulator invariably adds additional uncertainties in the model predictions there are several reasons for increased prediction uncertainties of the machine learning emulator in comparison to the physically based model one of the most important reasons for increased predictive uncertainties is due to extrapolation it is common that an emulator is trained for a specified parameter range but sometimes it has to be used out of the prescribed range that should be avoided as much as possible because the prediction power can deteriorate quickly outside the prescribed ranges for example the predictions of the emulator me1 were in good agreement with the simulated results to 1000 samples produced in stage iii but the predictions of the emulator me3 for 1540 samples produced in stage i were worse in comparison with the simulated results table 1 r2 of 1 00 versus r2 of 0 33 note that the me1 me2 and me3 were the emulators developed for the objective efflux only adopting the samples generated in stage i ii and iii respectively in the stage i me1 is trained with inputs from the range 0 4 1 6 for all variables where as in stage ii and stage iii the range is narrower based on the stage i pareto front hence it results in extrapolation when stage ii and stage iii dnn me2 and me3 is used for testing samples from stage i inputs leading to a poorr square values of 0 56 and 0 33 respectively this also shows that it is important to ensure that dnn is not used for extrapolation during optimization the formulation of the optimization problem and sequencing of the stages ensured that only interpolations are undertaken by the dnn in this study the second reason is that the complicated relationship between the input parameters and the output has not been thoroughly captured by the emulator this can be found with more test datasets and the emulator performance can be subsequently improved by increasing the sample size generally the emulator prediction for the input parameters close to the boundary of the trained range is worse than other positions it is caused by the weaker statistical correlation in the samples for the parameter values close to the boundary therefore it is suggested that the sampling space of decision variables for developing the emulator should be larger than the constraint used in optimization besides the distribution of both the input and output should also be considered in preparing the samples for the emulator development otherwise the performance of emulator prediction in some subrange of the prescribed range may be far lower than the other the sample size is highly dependent on the complexity of the input output relationship although the emulating relationship was from a regional coastal groundwater model where multiple processes are interactive nonlinearly the response functions efflux and influx were not too difficult for the dnn emulator development when the pumping bores were classified based on the distance to the coastline if more complicated correlations are required to learn the number of hidden layers could be increased to strengthen the learning ability of the dnn to approximate a more complicated input output relationship the sample size of training an emulator should also be increased if there are too many decision variables input parameters against the surrogate based optimization dimensionality reduction techniques could be combined with the emulator development siade et al 2020 furthermore data transformation to the emulating targets can also improve the performance of the machine learning emulator yu et al 2020 the emulators used in this study significantly reduce the computational burden for the proposed trade off analysis in the regional groundwater model of the lower burdekin it was a huge challenge to manipulate hundreds of thousands of runs of a regional groundwater model for the current optimization with the dnn emulators the process based model was only called 3500 times the trained dnn emulators based on the 3500 runs can be rapidly reloaded to provide prediction during the simulation optimization decision making efficiency has been improved significantly with the application of the dnn emulators we compared the performance of dnn emulator with a few other routinely used approaches including svm tree based methods and gaussian process gp emulators the commonly used svm and tree based methods did not deliver satisfying performance by testing the gp with different types of kernel functions we found that gp emulators with the matern kernel performed equally well as the dnn emulators in our application context however we also encountered the scalability issue with the gp emulators the training time of gp emulator increases dramatically when the training size is above 1000 samples especially when an anisotropic kernel is used that is necessary to allow desired performance 4 2 pareto front analysis a total of 2723 4259 and 4577 non dominated solutions were generated in stages i ii and iii by the mopso algorithm respectively three close pareto fronts were formed by the solutions fig 7 the objective function space was extended from stage i to stage ii iii through the iterative optimizations and the increase of non dominated solutions were attributed to the more accurate emulators the pareto front in stage iii outperformed the other two pareto fronts in favour of the trade off analysis with respect to the convergence and the diversity of the non dominated solutions also the number of solutions the performances of the non dominated solutions in three stages were compared by the metrics of hv and cd it was similar for the three stages that the hv and cd of the non dominated solutions changed rapidly at the first 100 iterations and gradually converged to some values after that fig 8 in these iterations the particles locations changed frequently and moved towards distinct best locations within the decision space the cd median value decreased slowly during the later iterations whereas the hv could still obtain some noticeable improvement in stage iii the hypervolume increased abruptly over some iterations it was because new non dominated solutions that can greatly extend the pareto dominance were identified in these iterations the number of non dominated solutions in stage iii was more than that in stage i and ii contributing to the slightly lower cd value and obvious higher hv value in stage iii fig 8 these indicators suggested that the performance of the proposed mopso algorithm was improved by the iterative optimizations during which the accuracies of the emulators were improved adaptively the final near pareto optimal solution set was generated by stage iii of the iterative optimization the distributions of optimal schemes multipliers in 8 bands were presented in fig 9 in the calibrated model the sum of groundwater extraction in band 6 7 and 8 contributed only 7 0 to the total extraction and these zones were far from the coastline so that the effect on both water influx and efflux through the coastal boundary was slight the optimized results showed that the multipliers for these zones can be increased for maximizing the pumping objective the medians indicated by the white dot of fig 9 of the multipliers in these bands were larger than 1 00 the density distribution in band 6 showed that most of the non dominated solutions likely increased the pumping for the band 6 significantly the contribution of band 1 was also small 1 3 to the total extraction however the other objectives efflux and influx were sensitive to the pumping in this zone since excessive pumping can lead to an obvious decline of the lateral hydraulic gradient the density distribution of the optimized multipliers in band 1 indicated that the total pumping in this zone did not need to be changed considering the trade off of the management goals the extractions in band 2 3 4 5 contributed significantly to the total pumping and were the important factors to the objective pumping the multipliers from the near pareto optimal solutions showed different density distributions for these zones in contrast to the density distribution in the distant zone of band 6 the largest density of the multipliers in band 2 was close to the lower boundary 0 5 the first quartile and the median were close to the values of 0 5 and 0 75 respectively this distribution demonstrated the unique importance of the extraction in band 2 to the objective of minimizing the influx due to its closeness to the coastal boundary if the management schemes allow the larger change to these zones further increasing the pumping water from other distant zones and reducing the pumping water from band 2 will benefit all the management goals the density distribution of the multipliers in band 4 was relatively uniform from 0 5 to 1 5 with the symmetrical values in the first quartile and the third quartile close to 0 75 and 1 25 the optimized results indicated that the extraction in band 4 was influential to both water influx and efflux across the sea aquifer interface and could be adjusted in the defined range depending on the pumping rates of the other bands the multipliers in band 3 favoured the larger values whereas the multipliers in band 5 were more to the smaller values the density distributions demonstrated that the pumping patterns in the coastal aquifer of the lower burdekin region can be changed for better groundwater management and it provided further guidance for the extraction schemes that are not only limited to the adopted multipliers range from 0 5 to 1 5 note that the distributions of multipliers may change under different optimization algorithms but these probability density distributions were the valuable information for the decision makers to manage the coastal aquifers 4 3 selection of single solution the trade off analysis presented the possible behaviours in eight zones for the formulated multi objective optimization problem any solution in the pareto front could become the practical scheme of water management in terms of the distinctive requirements of the decision makers if further information could be obtained by the decision makers that aided the selection of one solution the solution meeting these requirements should be the first choice in this study we provide an optional single solution for decision makers who don t want to impose additional objective subjective criteria in order to pick one solution a compromising solution can be selected based on the nadir and ideal objective vectors six rounds of pso optimizations were implemented to compute the minimum and maximum of the individual objective function and the computed results are presented in fig 7 nadir 1 40 106 1 75 104 1 34 105 ideal 2 67 106 9 03 103 3 10 104 with the order of pumping efflux influx when there exist too many objectives it is inconvenient to conduct single objective optimization the upper boundary and the lower boundary of each objective in the pareto front can then be used as the approximate nadir and ideal point as suggested by kalai and smorodinsky 1975 the selected bargaining solution will obtain an ideal value for the objective with a higher utility level from the pareto front and other objectives will be compromised corresponding to this it should also be noted that this bargaining solution satisfies the symmetry monotonicity and in variance with respect to the affine transformation kalai and smorodinsky 1975 so the transformation of the objectives during the emulator development didn t cause the change of the bargaining solution the approximate solution 2 17 106 1 22 104 7 10 104 was acquired from the pareto front of stage iii with the shortest distance to the line segment further the multipliers of eight bands for the ks solution were obtained white square in fig 9 the selected multipliers resulting from the compromised solution was not consistent with the medians of the final non dominated solution set in eight bands which tended to lower the extractions of band 1 and 2 but raise the extractions of the others applying the multipliers of the compromised solution into the simulation the obtained results showed that water influx was significantly reduced with a ratio of 15 69 compared with the result prior to optimization concurrently the total extraction was lowered by 1 08 and water efflux was increased by 7 96 it suggested that the objectives pumping and efflux compromised to the influx in this bargaining problem conforming to the current understanding to the lower burdekin aquifer that it is an over extraction system resulting in seawater intrusion narayan et al 2007 and that can be alleviated by adjusting the pumping patterns 4 4 limitations in this study we use estimates of changes in coastal boundary flux resulting from a change in groundwater extraction as the primary variable to manage and optimize the dynamic flux equilibrium it is important to note that saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifer and submarine discharge of groundwater are processes that occur at very fine spatiotemporal scales and warrant detailed flow and transport studies in conjunction with comprehensive monitoring for comprehensive quantification such a detailed assessment is not the subject of this study in this study we consider influx and efflux through the coastal aquifer boundary as a variable of interest for groundwater management and investigate the potential of the multi objective optimization approach for management the underpinning assumption is that large influxes into the coastal aquifer from the seaside over the long period of a management horizon would deteriorate the water quality and hence needs to be minimized such analysis that uses modelled flux through the coastal boundary can provide valuable information for medium to long term planning of sustainable limits of groundwater extraction from the coastal aquifer however comprehensive transport modelling and monitoring at finer will further be required to assess the water quality implications of management measures set based on long term planning models 5 summary and conclusions patterns of groundwater extraction from coastal aquifers can interfere with the groundwater flow dynamics through the aquifer boundary with the sea excessive pumping could result in inward flow from the seaside boundary that can cause salinity problems suboptimal pumping could also result in large volumes of freshwater being lost into the sea in this study a multi objective optimization problem was formulated and solved to investigate the effect of pumping on groundwater flux between aquifer and sea using a calibrated regional groundwater model of the lower burdekin region in australia three management goals considered were maximization of total extraction minimization of water influx from the sea and minimization of water efflux into the sea the multi objective optimization problem was solved by the proposed simulation optimization approach integrated the developed multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm deep neural networks dnn emulators and kalai smorodinsky ks approach in this approach all the non dominated solutions are stored in a repository with infinite size which is in favour of the approximation of the ks bargaining solution from pareto front this enables the decision makers to choose any of these non dominated solutions in consideration with other selection criteria the solutions in general indicated that decreasing the total pumping from zones closer to the coast and increasing the total pumping from zones farther away can achieve improved and optimal solutions in the long term an optional single solution was also derived considering the compromise of the objectives with the ks approach the results show that optimizing the pumping patterns can result in a range of scenarios of flow exchange between the aquifer and sea such analyses can help to make informed decisions for coastal aquifer management this study used an offline training framework the method could be extended for enabling online training of the emulator during simulation optimization cycles the feedback loop of simulation emulation and optimization could be optimized to improve the efficiency and efficacy of simulation optimization the dnn technique is powerful and it can also perform well in relatively simple functional relationship it should be applied more widely to help address hydrogeological challenges for not only the complex and dynamic

10276,the expansion of the earth s population has led to the overuse of land and water resources which has ultimately resulted in their scarcity changing climatic conditions and erratic weather behavior over the years has fueled the existing problems of land and water scarcity and continued to exact a toll on agriculture utilization of the latest technologies coupled with advanced methods of crop production will no doubt increase our capacity to deal with these modern challenges of the shortages of resources soilless or liquid culture may serve as an alternative to conventional soil based cultivation systems the present study was conducted to determine the suitability and viability of hydroponic cultivation as an alternative planting system to greenhouse soil based lettuce cultivation in temperate regions of northern india in the present study two hydroponic techniques viz deep water culture and nutrient film technique were evaluated and compared to the conventional soil based cultivation method under protected conditions crop performance water consumption and economy were the criteria chosen to assess the efficacy of planting techniques using tukey s multiple range test at a significance level of 0 05 deep water culture system was found to be the most desirable concerning the duration of the crop causing a reduction in the plant growth period by 15 days also higher values of most of the photosynthetic parameters were observed in the deep water culture system which translated into higher yield plant for the system the crop quality also improved under the deep water culture system which was reflected by the higher values of quality parameters like chlorophyll total soluble solids protein and crude fiber content both the hydroponic systems produced significantly higher yield and nutritionally superior produce in lesser time than the soil based system p 0 05 however there was a significant reduction in the dry matter content under hydroponic conditions nutrient film technique resulted in significant water savings of 64 than the other two techniques according to economic analysis indicators both hydroponic techniques performed better than the soil based systems having benefit cost ratios greater than 2 out of the two techniques tested deep water culture proved to be the most promising system for adoption under protected agriculture owing to its simplicity ease of operation higher yield economic feasibility and nutritionally superior produce the results of the study established hydroponic lettuce production as an appropriate and sustainable alternative to conventional soil based lettuce production keywords hydroponics soil less cultivation deep water culture nutrient film technique protected soil based cultivation lettuce 1 introduction conventional soil based agriculture is facing stern challenges in the form of depleted soil productivity in the cultivable areas poor soil fertility due to continuous cultivation over the years and most importantly decrease in per capita land availability lambin 2012 lal 2015 lehman et al 2015 besides these there are threats from climate change in the form of rising temperatures frequent dry periods the unpredictability of the weather patterns poor management of water resources within the watershed resulting from overuse of water for irrigation leading to wastage of huge amount of water unchecked pollution of water bodies and decline in groundwater levels st clair and lynch 2010 dhawan 2017 bhanja et al 2018 these challenges are a serious threat to conventional soil based agriculture systems due to which producing food nowadays is becoming a real challenge therefore the traditional soil based agricultural practices need to be complemented by more productive and ecologically sustainable forms of modern agriculture lambin and meyfroidt 2011 these modern forms of agriculture should take into cognizance the modern day challenges of reduced soil productivity depleted nutrient reserves of soil limited availability of water for irrigation and also help face the challenges of climate change one approach to tackle these modern challenges is to espouse cultivation systems that are not reliant on soils soilless or liquid culture techniques possibly could serve as complementary cultivation systems to provide a conceivable solution to the current problems of scarcity of fertile arable lands and water while minimizing the risks associated with soil based cultivation systems hydroponics or liquid culture is one such specialized technique that involves the growth of plants without soil although artificial it is based upon the same principles that nature has set up as the pattern of life and therefore is not an unnatural crop production method texier 2013 hydroponics may be perceived as an engineered way of growing plants that utilizes a soil less growing medium and a nutrient solution that is optimized to deliver the calculated resources essential for plant growth and development savvas 2003 with regard to water management it can be viewed as the art of managing water infusing it with the nutrition vital to plants and delivering it to their thirsty roots on an as needed basis so that the highest yields can be achieved in the same sized space while using much less water and labor eigenbrod and gruda 2015 plants grown hydroponically receive a well balanced diet due to which these plants are healthier than their soil grown counterparts bugbee 2004 hayden 2006 hydroponics unlike conventional agriculture facilitates complete control over the nutrition of the crop thus using no more than the amount of nutrients and water required by each crop leading to more efficient nutrient regulation and better water management rouphael et al 2004 tomasi et al 2014 due to the reasons aforementioned hydroponics is usually considered a superior form of agriculture in virtually all the countries of the world schmilewski 2009 hydroponic studies aimed at improving crop productivity of hydroponic systems and resolving their limitations have increased exponentially over the past several decades in the developed nations especially the us and china the technology is being increasingly implemented in the developed world and hydroponic cultivation of several crops including lettuce cucumbers tomatoes etc has been studied lee and lee 2015 however the technique is still in its juvenile phase in the developing nations and demands extensive research on various aspects before its adoption in crop production in india particularly the continued population growth has rendered a market that is willing to purchase locally grown hydroponic produce but the technique is far from enactment due to lack of evidence and research on the various aspects of the technology that would address the concerns of the growers while providing an insight into the production technique kashmir valley has undergone a steady transition of lands from agricultural to non agricultural uses over the past few decades reports reveal that in the last half decade alone over 20 of the farmlands have been converted for commercial or residential purposes rising kashmir 2019 this depletion in the reserves of arable land has hurt agricultural productivity in the state of jammu and kashmir which is reflected by the decrease in the gross domestic product of the state from 28 in 2004 05 16 05 in 2017 18 jammu and kashmir economic survey report 2017 18 in addition the indus water treaty between india and pakistan also poses an exceptional challenge to agriculture in the kashmir valley under the treaty the construction of reservoirs or dams and irrigation facilities is restricted unless there is prior approval of pakistan india s storage entitlement on river basins which are subjected to indus waters treaty provisions viz sindh jhelum and chenab are just 0 25 0 50 and 0 50 million acre feet respectively due to which less than 45 of the state has access to irrigation bansal 2013 consequentially these river basins are entirely dependent for their survival on the snowfall received in winter months however there are fears for the future particularly with receding glaciers and their impact on river flows investigations revealed that glaciers in kashmir himalaya have shrunk by 17 which if continued will have an adverse effect on the stream flows water supplies other dependent sectors in the region and will further decrease the availability of water for irrigation murtaza and romshoo 2017 using this limited available water efficiently and effectively for supporting agriculture will be the main challenge faced by the farming communities in the region in the near future apart from this depletion in productivity of soil as a consequence of the use of traditional soil based production systems with inefficient irrigation methods lack of proper drainage practices and excessive fertilizer application coupled with various environmental factors like soil erosion waterlogging and development of salinity have undesirably impacted crop production in the region in order to increase the productivity of conventional agriculture systems farmers of kashmir valley have resorted to the widespread use of pesticides and other agrochemicals as a result of which the overall incidence of cancer is on the rise in the valley dar et al 2013 wani et al 2014 hydroponic systems may be widely used in the valley to produce food with limited growing space and water especially during the harsh winters when the valley is mostly cut off from the rest of the world however the acceptance of this capital intensive technology amongst growers depends on its profitability and commercial viability although there are quite a few studies that have proven the better performance of hydroponic systems over traditional systems only a handful of studies drawing comparisons between the different hydroponic growing models have been conducted so far in addition hydroponic establishments are combined with protected cultivation so no separate growth trends for hydroponic systems are available de anda and shear 2017 researchers have concluded that hydroponic production can result in different outcomes under different crops and environmental conditions gashgari et al 2018 lettuce is a cool season crop of high economic importance due to its potential to return revenue and is extensively grown worldwide predominantly in temperate and subtropical regions mou 2008 kumar et al 2010 due to its nutritional value it can command higher market prices and therefore has been commercialized internationally abu rayyan et al 2004 lettuce cultivation under protected conditions is being promoted in recent years but the crop production techniques for lettuce have not been standardized yet kadayifci et al 2004 spehia et al 2018 the major challenge in greenhouse lettuce production is to standardize the growing systems that improve the quality and quantity of the produce ensure judicious water management and reduce environmental impacts schwarz et al 2009 acharya et al 2013 lettuce lactuca sativa l cultivation under several hydroponic models particularly water culture and nutrient film technique has been extensively studied all over the world kaiser and ernst 2012 safaei et al 2015 these studies confirm that hydroponic growing systems result in increased leaf yield barbosa et al 2015 petropoulos et al 2016 however there are concerns amongst consumers about the nutritional quality water consumption and economics that thwart expansion into the commercial sector the present investigation was undertaken to determine whether hydroponic cultivation presents a suitable and viable alternative to greenhouse soil based lettuce cultivation in the temperate regions of northern india on the basis of the performance of two hydroponic techniques viz deep water culture and nutrient film technique for greenhouse lettuce cultivation crop performance water consumption and economic analysis were chosen as indicators of suitability and viability for this study the study also aimed to evaluate the overall performance of deep water culture nutrient film technique in terms of the suitability and viability indicators and make a direct comparison of hydroponically grown lettuce with the soil based lettuce under protected conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 the experimental site the crop experiments were carried out under protected conditions in a plastic poly house with a north south orientation at the experimental farm of college of agricultural engineering sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology kashmir northern india it is situated at 34 08 30 5 n latitude and 74 51 42 0 e longitude and an elevation of 1605 m above mean sea level inside the poly house the only source of light was natural solar radiation while the relative humidity and temperature control were achieved through ventilation the experiments were carried out between july 2017 to july 2018 to study the effect of different hydroponic growing techniques on the performance of lettuce crop water consumption of the systems and economic analysis the overall performance of the deep water culture and nutrient film technique system was evaluated and compared with the protected soil based cultivation over two consecutive crop cycles c1 july 2017 december 2017 and c2 february 2018 july 2018 during this period the average minimum and maximum temperatures inside the poly house were 14 c and 27 c respectively and humidity in the poly house was in the desired range of 60 65 2 2 hydroponic seedling production for hydroponic systems the seeds were germinated and the seedlings are raised externally from the hydroponic growing systems to enable them to take hold of the growing substrate and avoid being washed away by the nutrient solution the hydroponic seedlings for the experiment were raised at transcriptomics laboratory division of plant biotechnology sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology kashmir and seeds were purchased from a local seed dealer a series of trials were conducted to standardize the growing media for raising lettuce seedlings for the hydroponic systems from the standardization trials it was established that the combination medium consisting of rockwool and sawdust performed the best for raising lettuce seedlings rockwool a fibrous wood or flock material manufactured at high temperatures ensuring substrate chemical and biological inertness has been a dominating media in soilless cultures previous studies have reported that rockwool as a growing media does not alter or limit the availability of nutrients and makes more than 98 of the fertilizer solution readily available for uptake by the growing crop bussell and mckennie 2004 savvas et al 2004 ready to use rockwool cubes under the trade name grow cube 333 38 38 mm starter plugs were ordered from radongrow surat online through their website these starter plugs were specially designed for seed and cutting propagation before transplanting into the growing systems sawdust was used as a growing medium due to its ready availability lightweight moisture retention properties and economic cost maas and adamson 1975 depardieu et al 2016 gonzález orozco et al 2018 deodar poplar and willow trees are in abundance in the valley and the sawdust obtained as a by product of woodworking operations has potential as a growing substrate for hydroponic cultivation due to high moisture retention properties and low cost owing which it can be discarded after each growing cycle sawdust was readily available from the carpentry shop of the agricultural engineering workshop sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology kashmir the standardized combination media of rockwool and sawdust in the ratio 1 1 5 respectively provided a suitable biological and chemical environment for the plant growth schmilewski 2008 as well as satisfied the practical and economic requirements of affordability easy availability and manageability pardossi et al 2011 barrett et al 2016 the lactuca sativa l var longifolia seedlings were raised in hydroponic net cups of 50 mm diameter sufficient to anchor the shallow root system of the lettuce crop prior to the filling of the net cups with the standardized growing media the cups were covered with polyethylene to avoid contamination the cups were filled with sawdust up to 38 mm depth and 3 4 seeds were placed on the sawdust layer rockwool cubes of height 25 mm were hydrated with plain water and placed on top of the sawdust layer all the net cups were placed in a plastic tray disinfected with 70 ethanol these net cups containing standardized growing media were used for raising lettuce seedlings for hydroponic systems the tray containing the net cups was placed under white fluorescent lamps which were known to cause compact and sturdy seedlings until radical emergence the seeds were watered twice a day with plain water and then the seedlings were irrigated daily with water supplemented with half strength i e 0 8 ds m 1 of the nutrient solution thinning was done after 15 days of sowing keeping the healthy growing seedlings for further observations and in this manner two seedlings were maintained per pot 2 3 growing systems the growing systems were evaluated under protected conditions poly house which provided temperature control reduced water loss due to evaporation and protected the crop against the elements of weather such as wind rain snow etc an essential requirement for hydroponic systems jensen 2002 a standard hydroponic fertilizer solution for leafy vegetables under the trade name radongrow leafy was used in both the hydroponic systems the solution came in the form of soluble solids and contained inorganic ions of all the elements essential for the growth and development of plants asao 2012 previous studies suggest that the electrical conductivity and ph are crucial parameters in determining the nutrient composition elemental speciation and the availability of nutrients in the nutrient solution too high or too low strengths of the nutrient solution have a negative influence on the growth and yield of the crop savvas and adamidis 1999 colla et al 2006 rosadi et al 2014 the nutrient solution in both systems was monitored for electrical conductivity and ph during the entire growing period discussed in detail in section 2 4 2 3 1 deep water culture dwc system deep water culture system was a modification of an already existing non circulating type of hydroponic system where pumps were not a necessity and the water depth in the system exceeded 200 mm maximum water use by lettuce usually varies depending upon location and time of planting and is approximately 4 mm of water per day martin et al 2009 based on the data obtained from the crop water requirement studies of leaf lettuce the water requirement of a single lettuce plant was taken as 3 8 mm per day which approximated to 0 0003 m3 per day on volumetric basis locally available trapezoidal plastic troughs having a capacity of 0 025 m3 each were selected to function as nutrient holding tanks of the growing system the tanks were fitted with removable lids containing holes for hydroponic net cups containing plants the lids blocked the light from entering into the growth tanks to promote root growth prevent nutrient solution contamination reduce evaporation losses and prevent algae growth the nutrient solution was drained periodically when depleted of its nutritional value through the outlet nozzle provided in each growth tank the growing system consisted of six nutrient holding tanks each containing four planting holes and an additional hole serving the dual purpose of air circulation and refilling the nutrient solution the staggered arrangement of planting holes was followed for the most effective utilization of growing space in the growth tanks the growth tanks were fitted on an iron stand since there was no artificial lightening system in the poly house the submergence of roots in stagnant nutrient solution all the time led to reliance upon auxiliary oxygen supply which was provided through aerators fitted on specially designed columns mounted on the iron stand each aerator supplied power to two air stones and therefore two growth tanks the air stones submerged in the growth tanks produced bubbles in the nutrient solution and supplied oxygen to the crop roots the flow rate of nutrient solution from the reservoir to the growth tanks was adjustable and was kept at a rate that did not disturb the delicate roots of the plants growing in the tank surface agitation from the falling water splashing around served as another excellent way of aerating the nutrient solution the isometric view of the deep water culture system is presented in fig 1 2 3 2 nutrient film technique nft system this system consisted of channels in which a constant flow of nutrient solution was maintained the net cups with plants were placed in these channels with plant roots dangling in the thin film of the nutrient solution passing by for the nutrient film technique system pvc pipes having a diameter of 110 mm served as growth channels the nutrient solution from the reservoir was pumped via a nutrient flow introduction mechanism into the growth channels the ends of which were sealed with plastic end caps of the same diameter as that of the channels at the receding end of each growth channel drainage holes were provided to facilitate the transfer of nutrient solution from one channel to another via driplines and finally back to the reservoir the reservoir which was placed beneath the growing system held 0 1 m3 and was covered to prevent impurities from contaminating the nutrient solution the design of the pump was based on the requirement that a 4 mm depth of nutrient solution had to be maintained in the 110 mm growing channels the discharge to be carried by the pump was calculated based on the open channel flow and taking into account pressure losses in the channel a submersible pump of capacity 0 3 m3 hour 1 and power 4 watt served well for the designed setup maxesla submersible pump 80 gph 300 l h the growth channels were supported on three 0 6 m high iron stands severe slopes of nutrient film technique are not recommended and a drop of 1 in 50 2 to 1 in 75 1 33 is considered suitable morgan 2011 accordingly each growth channel was given a slope of 2 1 in 50 the isometric view of the nutrient film technique system has been presented in fig 2 2 3 3 protected soil based cultivation cn system lettuce seeds were sown watered maintained and kept in the nursery for four weeks prior to transplanting the seedlings were raised under special care in the nursery which received about 4 6 h of sunlight per day four week old healthy and uniform sized lettuce seedlings were hand transplanted into the raised beds in the walk in tunnel type poly house during transplanting a recommended spacing of 0 30 m 0 40 m between row to row and plant to plant was maintained alahi et al 2014 after the establishment of the seedlings in the bed the plot was always kept under careful observation plants were assessed for growth periodically during which several indices were measured thinning weeding top dressing and other intercultural operations were carried out for better growth and development of lettuce seedlings the recommended dosage of npk fertilizers given by the division of vegetable science sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology kashmir was in the ratio of 40 60 60 respectively after a basal dose of entire farmyard manure at final land preparation urea muriate of potash mop diammonium phosphate dap were applied by top dressing in 3 equal installments at 10 20 and 30 days after transplanting university of california 1987 estimated the allowable depletion for lettuce to be between 40 and 50 of the available water the upper limit of this estimate was used to schedule irrigation which was scheduled at 50 depletion in the available soil moisture in the root zone the source of water for irrigation at the experimental site was a water tank from which water to the field was supplied through a siphon pipe 2 4 fertigation scheduling in hydroponic systems fertigation scheduling was based on the electrical conductivity and ph variation of the nutrient solution in the hydroponic growing environment the values of electrical conductivity and ph during the influx of nutrient solution were recorded during each growing cycle the respective values of the same parameters were measured daily an electrical conductivity meter hanna dist 4 waterproof ec tester was used for measuring the conductivity values while a ph meter apera instruments ai209 value series ph20 waterproof ph tester kit was used for measuring the ph values in the growth tanks of deep water culture system and the reservoir of nutrient film technique system continuous variations in the electrical conductivity and ph during the growing cycle can be attributed to the nutrient absorption by the plants as reported by domingues et al 2012 the conductivity values of the solution were linearly related to the equivalent salt concentration in the solution the conductivity values of the nutrient solution throughout the growing period during crop cycles c1 fig 3 and c2 fig 4 both for the deep water culture and nutrient film technique system have been presented graphically the conductivity of the full strength fresh and unused solution registered on the conductivity meter was 1 6 ds m 1 as nutrients were taken up by the plants the conductivity value was lowered since there were lesser salts in the solution alternatively there was an increase in the conductivity value when the removal of water from the solution took place either through evaporation or transpiration the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution was in the range 0 8 1 6 ds m 1 throughout the experiment crop cycle c1 and c2 after the nutrient solution was introduced into the growing systems and placed in contact with the plants nutrient uptake by the plants caused the conductivity which had an increased starting value to show a decreasing trend until solution replacement since both the hydroponic systems viz deep water culture system and nutrient film technique system were closed systems there was no loss of water from the systems and hence no positive deviations in the conductivity values during the growing period electrical conductivity gives a measure of all the salts present in the solution without indicating the nutrient balance of the solution bagley et al 1997 the salts present and their respective concentrations cannot be differentiated based on conductivity values alone as a matter of fact when the observed conductivity values are above or below the desired range it becomes compulsory to replace the nutrient solution so far the ideal conductivity range for hydroponic cultivation of lettuce has not been arrived upon and depends on the climatic conditions and the cultivar grown in hot weather regions the ideal conductivity range of the solution for hydroponic lettuce cultivation is between 1 6 and 1 8 ds m 1 while as for regions with high temperatures and high photosynthetic photon flux the conductivity values could be as low as 1 0 ds m 1 junior et al 2007 cometti et al 2013 when the conductivity values reached as low as 0 8 ds m 1 it was concluded that the nutrient availability in the solution was diminished and the system needed a solution replacement the ph of the solution in both the systems during both crop cycles was monitored and adjusted frequently to be kept in the range where the plants were not negatively influenced by the ph the optimum acidic ph range for hydroponic plants is essential as it affects the solubility availability and uptake of many essential nutrient ions the graphical representation of the nutrient solution ph throughout the growing period for the deep water culture system and nutrient film technique system for crop cycles c1 and c2 are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively ph values of the nutrient solution in both the systems were maintained in the range of 5 5 6 5 which according to taiz and zeiger 2002 is the optimum range for the highest availability of the maximum number of elements necessary for plants when proper ph levels are not maintained the plants lose their ability to absorb some of the essential elements required for the healthy growth and development the elements present in the solution are acidic which when consumed by the plants the natural reaction is a rise in ph which results in ph up swings once the plants were established a gradual and continual increase in ph over time was observed which was countered with the doses of ph down powder and regular replacement of the solution the interval of changing the nutrient solution varied with the growth and development stage of the plant in each crop cycle and was different for the deep water culture system and nutrient film technique system figs 7 and 8 show the time interval of changing the nutrient solution in the deep water culture system and nutrient film technique system respectively up to the seedling stage half strength of the nutrient solution was used it was observed that when the young seedlings were subjected to a full strength dosage there was restricted vegetative growth the graphs of the interval of changing the nutrient solution for the systems indicate that nutrient solution consumption by plants was maximum during the peak vegetative phase discussed in section 3 1 1 due to excessive nutrient and water requirements at the peak vegetation stage indicated by the rapidly decreasing conductivity values as well as the decrease in the solution level in the growing system frequent solution replacements were required 2 5 data collection and analysis for analysis one plant was randomly selected from each unit of the growing systems for the collection of data thus there were a total of six plants six replications of each growing system from which data was collected and recorded the sample plants from the three growing systems were analyzed for the duration photosynthetic growth and quality parameters listed in table 1 the methodologies for estimation of these crop parameters have been reported in table s1 the water consumption of the hydroponic systems was estimated by considering the average water requirement of each plant individually by taking into account the water loss due to evapotranspiration the number of irrigations and the amount of water given per irrigation by each growing system to produce the yield was measured for hydroponic systems the nutrient solution replacements and the volume of solution fed to the systems per replacement was used for estimation this estimate in combination with the yield values obtained for lettuce was used to create an average estimate of water usage for each growing system in units of lkg 1day 1 2 6 economic analysis using the engineering economics approach and capital budgeting techniques growing systems were compared from an economic viewpoint capital budgeting procedures involve estimating the expected costs and revenues to evaluate the economic viability of new and alternative agricultural technologies grafiadellis et al 2000 the economic feasibility of the growing systems was assessed using financial ratios viz net present value npv and benefit cost ratio bcr to compare the hydroponic systems with the conventional system the production costs and the revenues obtained from multiple pickings were used this study did not include the initial investment in greenhouse construction land rent and utility bills in the estimation of costs since the experiment was carried under controlled conditions in a plastic poly house investment analysis of the growing systems to later determine their profitability has been detailed in table s2 this data was used for the computation of the economic parameters mentioned above the costs and benefits were discounted at a rate of 8 in line with the long term interest rates exchange price variation and capital invested the economic useful life ul of the systems was taken as 20 years assuming that the systems would generate income for this period without requiring any major replacements helfert 2001 net present value describes the present worth of discounted future earnings at an appropriate discount rate and was calculated using the following formula souza et al 2019 1 npv t 1 n r t c t 1 i t benefit cost ratio on the other hand is a capital budgeting technique that indicates the present value of revenues relative to the present value of costs at a given discount rate gittinger 1982 and was calculated using the following formula 2 bcr t 1 n r t 1 i t t 1 n c t 1 i t where npv net present value bcr

simple completely randomized arrangement was followed for the experiment with the cultivation system as the single factor with four plants per each of six replicates thus the layout of the trials constituted six experimental units and each unit contained four plants from which data were collected and recorded for assessing the performance of plants under different treatments sample plants from each growing system were selected systematically and analyzed for various duration photosynthetic growth and quality parameters to evaluate the effect of growing systems on the overall performance of lettuce crop a one way analysis of variance was carried out in op stat sheoran et al 1998 treatment means were compared and differences between means were determined by tukey s multiple range test at the 5 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop performance data on the growth photosynthetic yield and quality parameters were recorded from the sample plants during the course of the experiment out of the three growing systems tested it was observed that growing systems had a significant influence on the performance of the plants crop duration photosynthetic growth and quality parameters were significantly influenced by the growing method 3 1 1 crop duration details of crop duration concerning days to transplanting days to maturity total growing days and number of pickings are presented in table 2 there are noticeable differences in the amount of time taken by different growing systems to produce the crop the days to transplanting for both the hydroponic systems and crop cycles were 22 days since the seedlings for the deep water culture system as well as for the nutrient film technique system were raised together lettuce planted in deep water culture system required as little as 40 5 days after transplanting dat to reach harvest maturity resulting in a reduction of the crop duration by 15 days the higher nutrient uptake to support the vegetative foliage and provide the structural support to the crop resulted in lower conductivity values for the hydroponic systems at the peak vegetation stage of the experiment results of plant growth indicate that total growing days were highest for conventional soil based cultivation system for both conventional cultivation and deep water culture system a total number of five lettuce pickings were performed during each growing cycle in the nutrient film technique system however five pickings were performed during c1 whereas only four pickings could be achieved during c2 deep water culture gave the best results and was most desirable with respect to the duration of the crop with a reduction in the crop growth period by 16 the decrease in the growing period in deep water culture can be explained by the capacity of the growth tanks to hold large volumes of the nutrient solution and the timely availability of the nutrients and water moreover the properly aerated growth tanks provided the perfect conditions for the uptake of available nutrients and water which resulted in the crop maturing early as compared to the other systems selma et al 2012 reported that to reach the same maturity stage in lettuce a longer growing period was needed in the soil than in the soilless systems which were 102 and 63 days after planting respectively in a tropical environment the lettuce crop cycle is about 70 days in conventional growth whereas in the hydroponics system it can be of 40 days cometti et al 2013 3 1 2 gas exchange analysis gas exchange analysis of the plants to quantify the photosynthetic rate at the leaf level was carried out during the peak vegetative stage of the crop the average values of photosynthetic parameters for both the cropping cycles under different treatments are presented in table 3 as is known gas exchange measurements provide a direct measure of the net rate of photosynthetic carbon assimilation and its results can be used as a substitute for measuring the photosynthetic rate long and bernacchi 2003 the photosynthetic rate being the primary driver of yield sets the upper limit on the productivity of a growing system limitations on photosynthesis with respect to different growing conditions are studied to understand the survival and adaptive responses of plants concerning growing conditions pask et al 2012 deep water culture plants registered higher values for all the photosynthetic parameters during both crop cycles excluding leaf temperature stomatal conductance and transpiration rate presented similar values in conventional and nutrient film technique systems and were significantly higher in the deep water culture system this could be due to the abundant water availability in the system facilitating higher water loss through the stomata of deep water culture plants these findings explain the shorter growing periods and higher yields of the deep water culture plants as previously reported by sinclair et al 2005 as suggested by drake et al 2013 stomatal conductance is correlated with plant photosynthetic productivity and water use efficiency indicating that deep water culture plants had higher photosynthetic productivity reflected in the yield discussed in the next section however higher stomatal conductance values with increased co2 assimilation rate in deep water culture were associated with lower water use efficiency of the system discussed later in the paper franks and farquhar 1999 3 1 3 crop growth crop growth analysis revealed significant differences in the growth parameters between the plants grown under different growing systems the analysis results are presented in table 4 despite the continuous variations in the ph and conductivity values of the nutrient solution hydroponic plants showed an excellent evolution in all the growing systems under study the highest yields for both crop cycles were recorded in deep water culture plants having significantly higher yields of 1 636 and 1 645 kg plant for cycles c1 and c2 respectively similar results for floating raft culture were earlier documented by fallovo et al 2009 and sapkota et al 2019 plants grown under conventional soil based cultivation system exhibited higher values for plant spread and leaf area the highest growth in terms of plant height and number of leaves was observed in deep water culture plants the number of leaves differed significantly among the different systems it was highest for deep water culture resulting in higher yields from the deep water culture plants despite having the lowest leaf area values lennard and leonard 2006 reported that deep flow technique systems produced 0 34 kg m 2 more lettuce lactuca sativa l than nutrient film technique systems in aquaponic production similar results were obtained in this study which recorded a lower yield per plant values in the nutrient film technique the reason for which could be the susceptibility to power outages 3 1 4 crop quality by analyzing the results and comparing the performance of plants significant differences were observed between the nutritional content of the produce from the different growing systems the effect of growing systems on crop quality is reported in table 5 the qualitative analysis of the plants revealed that plants of all the treatments were in satisfactory nutritional conditions the plants grown in deep water culture system performed better than all the other treatments concerning the crop quality parameters like chlorophyll content total soluble solids acidity protein content and crude fiber this better quality can be linked to precise control of nutrient availability through nutrient solution management while maintaining optimum growing conditions when compared to conventional and nutrient film technique grown lettuce literature data is deficient and inconclusive regarding the qualitative response of lettuce crop grown under hydroponics cultivation production in either system had no effect on the titratable acidity during cycle 1 but differed significantly during cycle 2 dry matter content was found highest in the soil based plants 8 43 g 100 g and 8 72 g 100 g for c1 c2 respectively the capacity of crop to produce dry matter using captured radiation through photosynthesis is directly proportional to the leaf area nasim et al 2016 this explains the lower dry matter values of deep water culture plants which registered significantly lower values of leaf area as discussed in the previous section additionally manzocco et al 2011 suggested that the lower values of dry matter in hydroponically grown plants are due to the interference of hydroponics with plant tissue hydration leading to weight loss 3 2 water consumption the comparison between the water demands of the growing systems in two crop cycles c1 and c2 to produce the yield is presented in fig 9 to make the comparison water consumption of the growing systems was normalized by yield which gave the average estimate of water consumption in units of lkg 1day 1 the conventional soil based cultivation system consumed the maximum water per day to produce a kilogram of dry weight which was 3 106 and 3 128 lkg 1day 1 for cycles 1 and 2 respectively water consumption values in the conventional soil based cultivation system differed significantly from the deep water culture system p 0 05 and nutrient film technique system p 0 01 the estimated water demand of the deep water culture system was significantly higher than that of the nutrient film technique p 0 05 significant water savings of around 64 were resulted from the nutrient film technique system compared to the other two production systems for both the crop cycles it can thus be concluded that the nutrient film technique system had a higher water use efficiency than the other two systems which was earlier reported by gonnella et al 2003 these results are also in close concordance with the findings of a previous study barbosa et al 2015 that showed hydroponic lettuce production had less water demand than conventional production when normalized by yield similarly sanyé mengual et al 2015 after a comparative analysis of the nutrient film floating and soil production concluded that the soil based lettuce production system was the least water efficient since soil production consumed the largest quantity of water as observed the water demand of the deep water culture system does not differ significantly from that of conventional soil based cultivation system this result can be explained considering the shallow root system of lettuce which was unable to utilize most of the water in the deep water culture system the analysis also revealed that the amount of water consumed per plant in the hydroponic systems did not differ from that grown using the conventional soil based cultivation system however the hydroponic systems delivered the water more efficiently as these systems expend a higher percentage of the water on plant evapotranspiration confirmed by the gas exchange analysis 3 3 economic assessment the npv estimates and b c ratios of the growing systems for crop cycles c1 and c2 respectively have been presented in table 6 comparisons based on actual yield data reveal that the npv values were higher for deep water culture for both crop cycles due to the comparatively lower cost of production and higher yields per picking the b c cost ratio of 2 350 was observed in the nutrient film technique system for crop cycle c1 having an economic working life ul of 20 years however the deep water culture system exhibited higher b c ratios of 2 113 and 2 125 for both cycles c1 and c2 respectively reinforcing the profitability of the system previously established by npv estimates both criteria indicate conventional soil based cultivation system as a low wealth generating technique compared to the hydroponic techniques recently maestre valero et al 2018 reported notably higher values of npv in hydroponic cultivation as compared to soil based lettuce cultivation a technique having npv value more than zero and b c ratio higher than one is considered economically feasible hanley et al 2009 all the growing systems have npv values greater than zero and bcr values greater than one indicating the economic viability of these growing techniques however economic assessment data from controlled small scale experimental testing of growing systems favor deep water culture as a system having better economic viability than others 4 conclusions and future work it can be concluded from the results of comparative analysis that the hydroponic systems studied were suitable for lettuce production under the temperate conditions of northern india the deep water culture and nutrient film technique proved to be promising hydroponic techniques that delivered nutritionally superior and higher yields as compared to the protected soil based cultivation system this study has efficaciously quantified the overall performance of deep water culture and nutrient film technique system deep water culture system is recommended as a potential growing system for cultivating lettuce and other leafy vegetables owing to its simplicity ease of operation reduced crop duration economic feasibility and high yield of superior quality on the other hand the nutrient film technique has a high water use efficiency and therefore has potential as an environment friendly technique both the hydroponic systems are proposed as practical alternatives for conventional soil culture of lettuce under protected conditions due to reduced crop duration higher yield of superior quality water savings higher benefit cost ratios and no dependency on soils in general hydroponic conditions promote a reduction in the days required for each harvest cycle consequential for multiple crops per year which may be commercially significant to producers hydroponic cultivation of leafy vegetables like lettuce could increase the possibility of minimizing water consumption as well as increasing yield and profitability of production leading to more sustainable food production the high economic viability designated the systems as sustainable farming systems in the future furthermore the ability to produce food year round locally without the occupation of arable lands is an added benefit indicating hydroponic systems as a sustainable cultivation system in the future because of the factors discussed above hydroponic cultivation of lettuce is deemed as an appropriate and viable alternative to conventional lettuce cultivation under protected conditions the results of this study can be beneficial in demonstrating and convincing the farming community of temperate regions for the adoption of hydroponic growing systems also the commercial viability of the hydroponic growing systems demonstrated in this paper will make possible faster uptake of hydroponic technology amongst farmers of the temperate regions of the country although hydroponic cultivation has a plethora of advantages over soil based cultivation a major disadvantage of using hydroponic systems is the pollution resulting from the discharge of used hydroponic solution hydroponic wastewater released into the surroundings has the potential to percolate into the soil leading to contamination of groundwater and negatively affecting the surrounding ecosystems and the environment as a whole the development of nutrient effluent treatment techniques is anticipated in future work in addition further studies could extend hydroponic

10276,the expansion of the earth s population has led to the overuse of land and water resources which has ultimately resulted in their scarcity changing climatic conditions and erratic weather behavior over the years has fueled the existing problems of land and water scarcity and continued to exact a toll on agriculture utilization of the latest technologies coupled with advanced methods of crop production will no doubt increase our capacity to deal with these modern challenges of the shortages of resources soilless or liquid culture may serve as an alternative to conventional soil based cultivation systems the present study was conducted to determine the suitability and viability of hydroponic cultivation as an alternative planting system to greenhouse soil based lettuce cultivation in temperate regions of northern india in the present study two hydroponic techniques viz deep water culture and nutrient film technique were evaluated and compared to the conventional soil based cultivation method under protected conditions crop performance water consumption and economy were the criteria chosen to assess the efficacy of planting techniques using tukey s multiple range test at a significance level of 0 05 deep water culture system was found to be the most desirable concerning the duration of the crop causing a reduction in the plant growth period by 15 days also higher values of most of the photosynthetic parameters were observed in the deep water culture system which translated into higher yield plant for the system the crop quality also improved under the deep water culture system which was reflected by the higher values of quality parameters like chlorophyll total soluble solids protein and crude fiber content both the hydroponic systems produced significantly higher yield and nutritionally superior produce in lesser time than the soil based system p 0 05 however there was a significant reduction in the dry matter content under hydroponic conditions nutrient film technique resulted in significant water savings of 64 than the other two techniques according to economic analysis indicators both hydroponic techniques performed better than the soil based systems having benefit cost ratios greater than 2 out of the two techniques tested deep water culture proved to be the most promising system for adoption under protected agriculture owing to its simplicity ease of operation higher yield economic feasibility and nutritionally superior produce the results of the study established hydroponic lettuce production as an appropriate and sustainable alternative to conventional soil based lettuce production keywords hydroponics soil less cultivation deep water culture nutrient film technique protected soil based cultivation lettuce 1 introduction conventional soil based agriculture is facing stern challenges in the form of depleted soil productivity in the cultivable areas poor soil fertility due to continuous cultivation over the years and most importantly decrease in per capita land availability lambin 2012 lal 2015 lehman et al 2015 besides these there are threats from climate change in the form of rising temperatures frequent dry periods the unpredictability of the weather patterns poor management of water resources within the watershed resulting from overuse of water for irrigation leading to wastage of huge amount of water unchecked pollution of water bodies and decline in groundwater levels st clair and lynch 2010 dhawan 2017 bhanja et al 2018 these challenges are a serious threat to conventional soil based agriculture systems due to which producing food nowadays is becoming a real challenge therefore the traditional soil based agricultural practices need to be complemented by more productive and ecologically sustainable forms of modern agriculture lambin and meyfroidt 2011 these modern forms of agriculture should take into cognizance the modern day challenges of reduced soil productivity depleted nutrient reserves of soil limited availability of water for irrigation and also help face the challenges of climate change one approach to tackle these modern challenges is to espouse cultivation systems that are not reliant on soils soilless or liquid culture techniques possibly could serve as complementary cultivation systems to provide a conceivable solution to the current problems of scarcity of fertile arable lands and water while minimizing the risks associated with soil based cultivation systems hydroponics or liquid culture is one such specialized technique that involves the growth of plants without soil although artificial it is based upon the same principles that nature has set up as the pattern of life and therefore is not an unnatural crop production method texier 2013 hydroponics may be perceived as an engineered way of growing plants that utilizes a soil less growing medium and a nutrient solution that is optimized to deliver the calculated resources essential for plant growth and development savvas 2003 with regard to water management it can be viewed as the art of managing water infusing it with the nutrition vital to plants and delivering it to their thirsty roots on an as needed basis so that the highest yields can be achieved in the same sized space while using much less water and labor eigenbrod and gruda 2015 plants grown hydroponically receive a well balanced diet due to which these plants are healthier than their soil grown counterparts bugbee 2004 hayden 2006 hydroponics unlike conventional agriculture facilitates complete control over the nutrition of the crop thus using no more than the amount of nutrients and water required by each crop leading to more efficient nutrient regulation and better water management rouphael et al 2004 tomasi et al 2014 due to the reasons aforementioned hydroponics is usually considered a superior form of agriculture in virtually all the countries of the world schmilewski 2009 hydroponic studies aimed at improving crop productivity of hydroponic systems and resolving their limitations have increased exponentially over the past several decades in the developed nations especially the us and china the technology is being increasingly implemented in the developed world and hydroponic cultivation of several crops including lettuce cucumbers tomatoes etc has been studied lee and lee 2015 however the technique is still in its juvenile phase in the developing nations and demands extensive research on various aspects before its adoption in crop production in india particularly the continued population growth has rendered a market that is willing to purchase locally grown hydroponic produce but the technique is far from enactment due to lack of evidence and research on the various aspects of the technology that would address the concerns of the growers while providing an insight into the production technique kashmir valley has undergone a steady transition of lands from agricultural to non agricultural uses over the past few decades reports reveal that in the last half decade alone over 20 of the farmlands have been converted for commercial or residential purposes rising kashmir 2019 this depletion in the reserves of arable land has hurt agricultural productivity in the state of jammu and kashmir which is reflected by the decrease in the gross domestic product of the state from 28 in 2004 05 16 05 in 2017 18 jammu and kashmir economic survey report 2017 18 in addition the indus water treaty between india and pakistan also poses an exceptional challenge to agriculture in the kashmir valley under the treaty the construction of reservoirs or dams and irrigation facilities is restricted unless there is prior approval of pakistan india s storage entitlement on river basins which are subjected to indus waters treaty provisions viz sindh jhelum and chenab are just 0 25 0 50 and 0 50 million acre feet respectively due to which less than 45 of the state has access to irrigation bansal 2013 consequentially these river basins are entirely dependent for their survival on the snowfall received in winter months however there are fears for the future particularly with receding glaciers and their impact on river flows investigations revealed that glaciers in kashmir himalaya have shrunk by 17 which if continued will have an adverse effect on the stream flows water supplies other dependent sectors in the region and will further decrease the availability of water for irrigation murtaza and romshoo 2017 using this limited available water efficiently and effectively for supporting agriculture will be the main challenge faced by the farming communities in the region in the near future apart from this depletion in productivity of soil as a consequence of the use of traditional soil based production systems with inefficient irrigation methods lack of proper drainage practices and excessive fertilizer application coupled with various environmental factors like soil erosion waterlogging and development of salinity have undesirably impacted crop production in the region in order to increase the productivity of conventional agriculture systems farmers of kashmir valley have resorted to the widespread use of pesticides and other agrochemicals as a result of which the overall incidence of cancer is on the rise in the valley dar et al 2013 wani et al 2014 hydroponic systems may be widely used in the valley to produce food with limited growing space and water especially during the harsh winters when the valley is mostly cut off from the rest of the world however the acceptance of this capital intensive technology amongst growers depends on its profitability and commercial viability although there are quite a few studies that have proven the better performance of hydroponic systems over traditional systems only a handful of studies drawing comparisons between the different hydroponic growing models have been conducted so far in addition hydroponic establishments are combined with protected cultivation so no separate growth trends for hydroponic systems are available de anda and shear 2017 researchers have concluded that hydroponic production can result in different outcomes under different crops and environmental conditions gashgari et al 2018 lettuce is a cool season crop of high economic importance due to its potential to return revenue and is extensively grown worldwide predominantly in temperate and subtropical regions mou 2008 kumar et al 2010 due to its nutritional value it can command higher market prices and therefore has been commercialized internationally abu rayyan et al 2004 lettuce cultivation under protected conditions is being promoted in recent years but the crop production techniques for lettuce have not been standardized yet kadayifci et al 2004 spehia et al 2018 the major challenge in greenhouse lettuce production is to standardize the growing systems that improve the quality and quantity of the produce ensure judicious water management and reduce environmental impacts schwarz et al 2009 acharya et al 2013 lettuce lactuca sativa l cultivation under several hydroponic models particularly water culture and nutrient film technique has been extensively studied all over the world kaiser and ernst 2012 safaei et al 2015 these studies confirm that hydroponic growing systems result in increased leaf yield barbosa et al 2015 petropoulos et al 2016 however there are concerns amongst consumers about the nutritional quality water consumption and economics that thwart expansion into the commercial sector the present investigation was undertaken to determine whether hydroponic cultivation presents a suitable and viable alternative to greenhouse soil based lettuce cultivation in the temperate regions of northern india on the basis of the performance of two hydroponic techniques viz deep water culture and nutrient film technique for greenhouse lettuce cultivation crop performance water consumption and economic analysis were chosen as indicators of suitability and viability for this study the study also aimed to evaluate the overall performance of deep water culture nutrient film technique in terms of the suitability and viability indicators and make a direct comparison of hydroponically grown lettuce with the soil based lettuce under protected conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 the experimental site the crop experiments were carried out under protected conditions in a plastic poly house with a north south orientation at the experimental farm of college of agricultural engineering sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology kashmir northern india it is situated at 34 08 30 5 n latitude and 74 51 42 0 e longitude and an elevation of 1605 m above mean sea level inside the poly house the only source of light was natural solar radiation while the relative humidity and temperature control were achieved through ventilation the experiments were carried out between july 2017 to july 2018 to study the effect of different hydroponic growing techniques on the performance of lettuce crop water consumption of the systems and economic analysis the overall performance of the deep water culture and nutrient film technique system was evaluated and compared with the protected soil based cultivation over two consecutive crop cycles c1 july 2017 december 2017 and c2 february 2018 july 2018 during this period the average minimum and maximum temperatures inside the poly house were 14 c and 27 c respectively and humidity in the poly house was in the desired range of 60 65 2 2 hydroponic seedling production for hydroponic systems the seeds were germinated and the seedlings are raised externally from the hydroponic growing systems to enable them to take hold of the growing substrate and avoid being washed away by the nutrient solution the hydroponic seedlings for the experiment were raised at transcriptomics laboratory division of plant biotechnology sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology kashmir and seeds were purchased from a local seed dealer a series of trials were conducted to standardize the growing media for raising lettuce seedlings for the hydroponic systems from the standardization trials it was established that the combination medium consisting of rockwool and sawdust performed the best for raising lettuce seedlings rockwool a fibrous wood or flock material manufactured at high temperatures ensuring substrate chemical and biological inertness has been a dominating media in soilless cultures previous studies have reported that rockwool as a growing media does not alter or limit the availability of nutrients and makes more than 98 of the fertilizer solution readily available for uptake by the growing crop bussell and mckennie 2004 savvas et al 2004 ready to use rockwool cubes under the trade name grow cube 333 38 38 mm starter plugs were ordered from radongrow surat online through their website these starter plugs were specially designed for seed and cutting propagation before transplanting into the growing systems sawdust was used as a growing medium due to its ready availability lightweight moisture retention properties and economic cost maas and adamson 1975 depardieu et al 2016 gonzález orozco et al 2018 deodar poplar and willow trees are in abundance in the valley and the sawdust obtained as a by product of woodworking operations has potential as a growing substrate for hydroponic cultivation due to high moisture retention properties and low cost owing which it can be discarded after each growing cycle sawdust was readily available from the carpentry shop of the agricultural engineering workshop sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology kashmir the standardized combination media of rockwool and sawdust in the ratio 1 1 5 respectively provided a suitable biological and chemical environment for the plant growth schmilewski 2008 as well as satisfied the practical and economic requirements of affordability easy availability and manageability pardossi et al 2011 barrett et al 2016 the lactuca sativa l var longifolia seedlings were raised in hydroponic net cups of 50 mm diameter sufficient to anchor the shallow root system of the lettuce crop prior to the filling of the net cups with the standardized growing media the cups were covered with polyethylene to avoid contamination the cups were filled with sawdust up to 38 mm depth and 3 4 seeds were placed on the sawdust layer rockwool cubes of height 25 mm were hydrated with plain water and placed on top of the sawdust layer all the net cups were placed in a plastic tray disinfected with 70 ethanol these net cups containing standardized growing media were used for raising lettuce seedlings for hydroponic systems the tray containing the net cups was placed under white fluorescent lamps which were known to cause compact and sturdy seedlings until radical emergence the seeds were watered twice a day with plain water and then the seedlings were irrigated daily with water supplemented with half strength i e 0 8 ds m 1 of the nutrient solution thinning was done after 15 days of sowing keeping the healthy growing seedlings for further observations and in this manner two seedlings were maintained per pot 2 3 growing systems the growing systems were evaluated under protected conditions poly house which provided temperature control reduced water loss due to evaporation and protected the crop against the elements of weather such as wind rain snow etc an essential requirement for hydroponic systems jensen 2002 a standard hydroponic fertilizer solution for leafy vegetables under the trade name radongrow leafy was used in both the hydroponic systems the solution came in the form of soluble solids and contained inorganic ions of all the elements essential for the growth and development of plants asao 2012 previous studies suggest that the electrical conductivity and ph are crucial parameters in determining the nutrient composition elemental speciation and the availability of nutrients in the nutrient solution too high or too low strengths of the nutrient solution have a negative influence on the growth and yield of the crop savvas and adamidis 1999 colla et al 2006 rosadi et al 2014 the nutrient solution in both systems was monitored for electrical conductivity and ph during the entire growing period discussed in detail in section 2 4 2 3 1 deep water culture dwc system deep water culture system was a modification of an already existing non circulating type of hydroponic system where pumps were not a necessity and the water depth in the system exceeded 200 mm maximum water use by lettuce usually varies depending upon location and time of planting and is approximately 4 mm of water per day martin et al 2009 based on the data obtained from the crop water requirement studies of leaf lettuce the water requirement of a single lettuce plant was taken as 3 8 mm per day which approximated to 0 0003 m3 per day on volumetric basis locally available trapezoidal plastic troughs having a capacity of 0 025 m3 each were selected to function as nutrient holding tanks of the growing system the tanks were fitted with removable lids containing holes for hydroponic net cups containing plants the lids blocked the light from entering into the growth tanks to promote root growth prevent nutrient solution contamination reduce evaporation losses and prevent algae growth the nutrient solution was drained periodically when depleted of its nutritional value through the outlet nozzle provided in each growth tank the growing system consisted of six nutrient holding tanks each containing four planting holes and an additional hole serving the dual purpose of air circulation and refilling the nutrient solution the staggered arrangement of planting holes was followed for the most effective utilization of growing space in the growth tanks the growth tanks were fitted on an iron stand since there was no artificial lightening system in the poly house the submergence of roots in stagnant nutrient solution all the time led to reliance upon auxiliary oxygen supply which was provided through aerators fitted on specially designed columns mounted on the iron stand each aerator supplied power to two air stones and therefore two growth tanks the air stones submerged in the growth tanks produced bubbles in the nutrient solution and supplied oxygen to the crop roots the flow rate of nutrient solution from the reservoir to the growth tanks was adjustable and was kept at a rate that did not disturb the delicate roots of the plants growing in the tank surface agitation from the falling water splashing around served as another excellent way of aerating the nutrient solution the isometric view of the deep water culture system is presented in fig 1 2 3 2 nutrient film technique nft system this system consisted of channels in which a constant flow of nutrient solution was maintained the net cups with plants were placed in these channels with plant roots dangling in the thin film of the nutrient solution passing by for the nutrient film technique system pvc pipes having a diameter of 110 mm served as growth channels the nutrient solution from the reservoir was pumped via a nutrient flow introduction mechanism into the growth channels the ends of which were sealed with plastic end caps of the same diameter as that of the channels at the receding end of each growth channel drainage holes were provided to facilitate the transfer of nutrient solution from one channel to another via driplines and finally back to the reservoir the reservoir which was placed beneath the growing system held 0 1 m3 and was covered to prevent impurities from contaminating the nutrient solution the design of the pump was based on the requirement that a 4 mm depth of nutrient solution had to be maintained in the 110 mm growing channels the discharge to be carried by the pump was calculated based on the open channel flow and taking into account pressure losses in the channel a submersible pump of capacity 0 3 m3 hour 1 and power 4 watt served well for the designed setup maxesla submersible pump 80 gph 300 l h the growth channels were supported on three 0 6 m high iron stands severe slopes of nutrient film technique are not recommended and a drop of 1 in 50 2 to 1 in 75 1 33 is considered suitable morgan 2011 accordingly each growth channel was given a slope of 2 1 in 50 the isometric view of the nutrient film technique system has been presented in fig 2 2 3 3 protected soil based cultivation cn system lettuce seeds were sown watered maintained and kept in the nursery for four weeks prior to transplanting the seedlings were raised under special care in the nursery which received about 4 6 h of sunlight per day four week old healthy and uniform sized lettuce seedlings were hand transplanted into the raised beds in the walk in tunnel type poly house during transplanting a recommended spacing of 0 30 m 0 40 m between row to row and plant to plant was maintained alahi et al 2014 after the establishment of the seedlings in the bed the plot was always kept under careful observation plants were assessed for growth periodically during which several indices were measured thinning weeding top dressing and other intercultural operations were carried out for better growth and development of lettuce seedlings the recommended dosage of npk fertilizers given by the division of vegetable science sher e kashmir university of agricultural sciences and technology kashmir was in the ratio of 40 60 60 respectively after a basal dose of entire farmyard manure at final land preparation urea muriate of potash mop diammonium phosphate dap were applied by top dressing in 3 equal installments at 10 20 and 30 days after transplanting university of california 1987 estimated the allowable depletion for lettuce to be between 40 and 50 of the available water the upper limit of this estimate was used to schedule irrigation which was scheduled at 50 depletion in the available soil moisture in the root zone the source of water for irrigation at the experimental site was a water tank from which water to the field was supplied through a siphon pipe 2 4 fertigation scheduling in hydroponic systems fertigation scheduling was based on the electrical conductivity and ph variation of the nutrient solution in the hydroponic growing environment the values of electrical conductivity and ph during the influx of nutrient solution were recorded during each growing cycle the respective values of the same parameters were measured daily an electrical conductivity meter hanna dist 4 waterproof ec tester was used for measuring the conductivity values while a ph meter apera instruments ai209 value series ph20 waterproof ph tester kit was used for measuring the ph values in the growth tanks of deep water culture system and the reservoir of nutrient film technique system continuous variations in the electrical conductivity and ph during the growing cycle can be attributed to the nutrient absorption by the plants as reported by domingues et al 2012 the conductivity values of the solution were linearly related to the equivalent salt concentration in the solution the conductivity values of the nutrient solution throughout the growing period during crop cycles c1 fig 3 and c2 fig 4 both for the deep water culture and nutrient film technique system have been presented graphically the conductivity of the full strength fresh and unused solution registered on the conductivity meter was 1 6 ds m 1 as nutrients were taken up by the plants the conductivity value was lowered since there were lesser salts in the solution alternatively there was an increase in the conductivity value when the removal of water from the solution took place either through evaporation or transpiration the electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution was in the range 0 8 1 6 ds m 1 throughout the experiment crop cycle c1 and c2 after the nutrient solution was introduced into the growing systems and placed in contact with the plants nutrient uptake by the plants caused the conductivity which had an increased starting value to show a decreasing trend until solution replacement since both the hydroponic systems viz deep water culture system and nutrient film technique system were closed systems there was no loss of water from the systems and hence no positive deviations in the conductivity values during the growing period electrical conductivity gives a measure of all the salts present in the solution without indicating the nutrient balance of the solution bagley et al 1997 the salts present and their respective concentrations cannot be differentiated based on conductivity values alone as a matter of fact when the observed conductivity values are above or below the desired range it becomes compulsory to replace the nutrient solution so far the ideal conductivity range for hydroponic cultivation of lettuce has not been arrived upon and depends on the climatic conditions and the cultivar grown in hot weather regions the ideal conductivity range of the solution for hydroponic lettuce cultivation is between 1 6 and 1 8 ds m 1 while as for regions with high temperatures and high photosynthetic photon flux the conductivity values could be as low as 1 0 ds m 1 junior et al 2007 cometti et al 2013 when the conductivity values reached as low as 0 8 ds m 1 it was concluded that the nutrient availability in the solution was diminished and the system needed a solution replacement the ph of the solution in both the systems during both crop cycles was monitored and adjusted frequently to be kept in the range where the plants were not negatively influenced by the ph the optimum acidic ph range for hydroponic plants is essential as it affects the solubility availability and uptake of many essential nutrient ions the graphical representation of the nutrient solution ph throughout the growing period for the deep water culture system and nutrient film technique system for crop cycles c1 and c2 are shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively ph values of the nutrient solution in both the systems were maintained in the range of 5 5 6 5 which according to taiz and zeiger 2002 is the optimum range for the highest availability of the maximum number of elements necessary for plants when proper ph levels are not maintained the plants lose their ability to absorb some of the essential elements required for the healthy growth and development the elements present in the solution are acidic which when consumed by the plants the natural reaction is a rise in ph which results in ph up swings once the plants were established a gradual and continual increase in ph over time was observed which was countered with the doses of ph down powder and regular replacement of the solution the interval of changing the nutrient solution varied with the growth and development stage of the plant in each crop cycle and was different for the deep water culture system and nutrient film technique system figs 7 and 8 show the time interval of changing the nutrient solution in the deep water culture system and nutrient film technique system respectively up to the seedling stage half strength of the nutrient solution was used it was observed that when the young seedlings were subjected to a full strength dosage there was restricted vegetative growth the graphs of the interval of changing the nutrient solution for the systems indicate that nutrient solution consumption by plants was maximum during the peak vegetative phase discussed in section 3 1 1 due to excessive nutrient and water requirements at the peak vegetation stage indicated by the rapidly decreasing conductivity values as well as the decrease in the solution level in the growing system frequent solution replacements were required 2 5 data collection and analysis for analysis one plant was randomly selected from each unit of the growing systems for the collection of data thus there were a total of six plants six replications of each growing system from which data was collected and recorded the sample plants from the three growing systems were analyzed for the duration photosynthetic growth and quality parameters listed in table 1 the methodologies for estimation of these crop parameters have been reported in table s1 the water consumption of the hydroponic systems was estimated by considering the average water requirement of each plant individually by taking into account the water loss due to evapotranspiration the number of irrigations and the amount of water given per irrigation by each growing system to produce the yield was measured for hydroponic systems the nutrient solution replacements and the volume of solution fed to the systems per replacement was used for estimation this estimate in combination with the yield values obtained for lettuce was used to create an average estimate of water usage for each growing system in units of lkg 1day 1 2 6 economic analysis using the engineering economics approach and capital budgeting techniques growing systems were compared from an economic viewpoint capital budgeting procedures involve estimating the expected costs and revenues to evaluate the economic viability of new and alternative agricultural technologies grafiadellis et al 2000 the economic feasibility of the growing systems was assessed using financial ratios viz net present value npv and benefit cost ratio bcr to compare the hydroponic systems with the conventional system the production costs and the revenues obtained from multiple pickings were used this study did not include the initial investment in greenhouse construction land rent and utility bills in the estimation of costs since the experiment was carried under controlled conditions in a plastic poly house investment analysis of the growing systems to later determine their profitability has been detailed in table s2 this data was used for the computation of the economic parameters mentioned above the costs and benefits were discounted at a rate of 8 in line with the long term interest rates exchange price variation and capital invested the economic useful life ul of the systems was taken as 20 years assuming that the systems would generate income for this period without requiring any major replacements helfert 2001 net present value describes the present worth of discounted future earnings at an appropriate discount rate and was calculated using the following formula souza et al 2019 1 npv t 1 n r t c t 1 i t benefit cost ratio on the other hand is a capital budgeting technique that indicates the present value of revenues relative to the present value of costs at a given discount rate gittinger 1982 and was calculated using the following formula 2 bcr t 1 n r t 1 i t t 1 n c t 1 i t where npv net present value bcr

simple completely randomized arrangement was followed for the experiment with the cultivation system as the single factor with four plants per each of six replicates thus the layout of the trials constituted six experimental units and each unit contained four plants from which data were collected and recorded for assessing the performance of plants under different treatments sample plants from each growing system were selected systematically and analyzed for various duration photosynthetic growth and quality parameters to evaluate the effect of growing systems on the overall performance of lettuce crop a one way analysis of variance was carried out in op stat sheoran et al 1998 treatment means were compared and differences between means were determined by tukey s multiple range test at the 5 significance level 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop performance data on the growth photosynthetic yield and quality parameters were recorded from the sample plants during the course of the experiment out of the three growing systems tested it was observed that growing systems had a significant influence on the performance of the plants crop duration photosynthetic growth and quality parameters were significantly influenced by the growing method 3 1 1 crop duration details of crop duration concerning days to transplanting days to maturity total growing days and number of pickings are presented in table 2 there are noticeable differences in the amount of time taken by different growing systems to produce the crop the days to transplanting for both the hydroponic systems and crop cycles were 22 days since the seedlings for the deep water culture system as well as for the nutrient film technique system were raised together lettuce planted in deep water culture system required as little as 40 5 days after transplanting dat to reach harvest maturity resulting in a reduction of the crop duration by 15 days the higher nutrient uptake to support the vegetative foliage and provide the structural support to the crop resulted in lower conductivity values for the hydroponic systems at the peak vegetation stage of the experiment results of plant growth indicate that total growing days were highest for conventional soil based cultivation system for both conventional cultivation and deep water culture system a total number of five lettuce pickings were performed during each growing cycle in the nutrient film technique system however five pickings were performed during c1 whereas only four pickings could be achieved during c2 deep water culture gave the best results and was most desirable with respect to the duration of the crop with a reduction in the crop growth period by 16 the decrease in the growing period in deep water culture can be explained by the capacity of the growth tanks to hold large volumes of the nutrient solution and the timely availability of the nutrients and water moreover the properly aerated growth tanks provided the perfect conditions for the uptake of available nutrients and water which resulted in the crop maturing early as compared to the other systems selma et al 2012 reported that to reach the same maturity stage in lettuce a longer growing period was needed in the soil than in the soilless systems which were 102 and 63 days after planting respectively in a tropical environment the lettuce crop cycle is about 70 days in conventional growth whereas in the hydroponics system it can be of 40 days cometti et al 2013 3 1 2 gas exchange analysis gas exchange analysis of the plants to quantify the photosynthetic rate at the leaf level was carried out during the peak vegetative stage of the crop the average values of photosynthetic parameters for both the cropping cycles under different treatments are presented in table 3 as is known gas exchange measurements provide a direct measure of the net rate of photosynthetic carbon assimilation and its results can be used as a substitute for measuring the photosynthetic rate long and bernacchi 2003 the photosynthetic rate being the primary driver of yield sets the upper limit on the productivity of a growing system limitations on photosynthesis with respect to different growing conditions are studied to understand the survival and adaptive responses of plants concerning growing conditions pask et al 2012 deep water culture plants registered higher values for all the photosynthetic parameters during both crop cycles excluding leaf temperature stomatal conductance and transpiration rate presented similar values in conventional and nutrient film technique systems and were significantly higher in the deep water culture system this could be due to the abundant water availability in the system facilitating higher water loss through the stomata of deep water culture plants these findings explain the shorter growing periods and higher yields of the deep water culture plants as previously reported by sinclair et al 2005 as suggested by drake et al 2013 stomatal conductance is correlated with plant photosynthetic productivity and water use efficiency indicating that deep water culture plants had higher photosynthetic productivity reflected in the yield discussed in the next section however higher stomatal conductance values with increased co2 assimilation rate in deep water culture were associated with lower water use efficiency of the system discussed later in the paper franks and farquhar 1999 3 1 3 crop growth crop growth analysis revealed significant differences in the growth parameters between the plants grown under different growing systems the analysis results are presented in table 4 despite the continuous variations in the ph and conductivity values of the nutrient solution hydroponic plants showed an excellent evolution in all the growing systems under study the highest yields for both crop cycles were recorded in deep water culture plants having significantly higher yields of 1 636 and 1 645 kg plant for cycles c1 and c2 respectively similar results for floating raft culture were earlier documented by fallovo et al 2009 and sapkota et al 2019 plants grown under conventional soil based cultivation system exhibited higher values for plant spread and leaf area the highest growth in terms of plant height and number of leaves was observed in deep water culture plants the number of leaves differed significantly among the different systems it was highest for deep water culture resulting in higher yields from the deep water culture plants despite having the lowest leaf area values lennard and leonard 2006 reported that deep flow technique systems produced 0 34 kg m 2 more lettuce lactuca sativa l than nutrient film technique systems in aquaponic production similar results were obtained in this study which recorded a lower yield per plant values in the nutrient film technique the reason for which could be the susceptibility to power outages 3 1 4 crop quality by analyzing the results and comparing the performance of plants significant differences were observed between the nutritional content of the produce from the different growing systems the effect of growing systems on crop quality is reported in table 5 the qualitative analysis of the plants revealed that plants of all the treatments were in satisfactory nutritional conditions the plants grown in deep water culture system performed better than all the other treatments concerning the crop quality parameters like chlorophyll content total soluble solids acidity protein content and crude fiber this better quality can be linked to precise control of nutrient availability through nutrient solution management while maintaining optimum growing conditions when compared to conventional and nutrient film technique grown lettuce literature data is deficient and inconclusive regarding the qualitative response of lettuce crop grown under hydroponics cultivation production in either system had no effect on the titratable acidity during cycle 1 but differed significantly during cycle 2 dry matter content was found highest in the soil based plants 8 43 g 100 g and 8 72 g 100 g for c1 c2 respectively the capacity of crop to produce dry matter using captured radiation through photosynthesis is directly proportional to the leaf area nasim et al 2016 this explains the lower dry matter values of deep water culture plants which registered significantly lower values of leaf area as discussed in the previous section additionally manzocco et al 2011 suggested that the lower values of dry matter in hydroponically grown plants are due to the interference of hydroponics with plant tissue hydration leading to weight loss 3 2 water consumption the comparison between the water demands of the growing systems in two crop cycles c1 and c2 to produce the yield is presented in fig 9 to make the comparison water consumption of the growing systems was normalized by yield which gave the average estimate of water consumption in units of lkg 1day 1 the conventional soil based cultivation system consumed the maximum water per day to produce a kilogram of dry weight which was 3 106 and 3 128 lkg 1day 1 for cycles 1 and 2 respectively water consumption values in the conventional soil based cultivation system differed significantly from the deep water culture system p 0 05 and nutrient film technique system p 0 01 the estimated water demand of the deep water culture system was significantly higher than that of the nutrient film technique p 0 05 significant water savings of around 64 were resulted from the nutrient film technique system compared to the other two production systems for both the crop cycles it can thus be concluded that the nutrient film technique system had a higher water use efficiency than the other two systems which was earlier reported by gonnella et al 2003 these results are also in close concordance with the findings of a previous study barbosa et al 2015 that showed hydroponic lettuce production had less water demand than conventional production when normalized by yield similarly sanyé mengual et al 2015 after a comparative analysis of the nutrient film floating and soil production concluded that the soil based lettuce production system was the least water efficient since soil production consumed the largest quantity of water as observed the water demand of the deep water culture system does not differ significantly from that of conventional soil based cultivation system this result can be explained considering the shallow root system of lettuce which was unable to utilize most of the water in the deep water culture system the analysis also revealed that the amount of water consumed per plant in the hydroponic systems did not differ from that grown using the conventional soil based cultivation system however the hydroponic systems delivered the water more efficiently as these systems expend a higher percentage of the water on plant evapotranspiration confirmed by the gas exchange analysis 3 3 economic assessment the npv estimates and b c ratios of the growing systems for crop cycles c1 and c2 respectively have been presented in table 6 comparisons based on actual yield data reveal that the npv values were higher for deep water culture for both crop cycles due to the comparatively lower cost of production and higher yields per picking the b c cost ratio of 2 350 was observed in the nutrient film technique system for crop cycle c1 having an economic working life ul of 20 years however the deep water culture system exhibited higher b c ratios of 2 113 and 2 125 for both cycles c1 and c2 respectively reinforcing the profitability of the system previously established by npv estimates both criteria indicate conventional soil based cultivation system as a low wealth generating technique compared to the hydroponic techniques recently maestre valero et al 2018 reported notably higher values of npv in hydroponic cultivation as compared to soil based lettuce cultivation a technique having npv value more than zero and b c ratio higher than one is considered economically feasible hanley et al 2009 all the growing systems have npv values greater than zero and bcr values greater than one indicating the economic viability of these growing techniques however economic assessment data from controlled small scale experimental testing of growing systems favor deep water culture as a system having better economic viability than others 4 conclusions and future work it can be concluded from the results of comparative analysis that the hydroponic systems studied were suitable for lettuce production under the temperate conditions of northern india the deep water culture and nutrient film technique proved to be promising hydroponic techniques that delivered nutritionally superior and higher yields as compared to the protected soil based cultivation system this study has efficaciously quantified the overall performance of deep water culture and nutrient film technique system deep water culture system is recommended as a potential growing system for cultivating lettuce and other leafy vegetables owing to its simplicity ease of operation reduced crop duration economic feasibility and high yield of superior quality on the other hand the nutrient film technique has a high water use efficiency and therefore has potential as an environment friendly technique both the hydroponic systems are proposed as practical alternatives for conventional soil culture of lettuce under protected conditions due to reduced crop duration higher yield of superior quality water savings higher benefit cost ratios and no dependency on soils in general hydroponic conditions promote a reduction in the days required for each harvest cycle consequential for multiple crops per year which may be commercially significant to producers hydroponic cultivation of leafy vegetables like lettuce could increase the possibility of minimizing water consumption as well as increasing yield and profitability of production leading to more sustainable food production the high economic viability designated the systems as sustainable farming systems in the future furthermore the ability to produce food year round locally without the occupation of arable lands is an added benefit indicating hydroponic systems as a sustainable cultivation system in the future because of the factors discussed above hydroponic cultivation of lettuce is deemed as an appropriate and viable alternative to conventional lettuce cultivation under protected conditions the results of this study can be beneficial in demonstrating and convincing the farming community of temperate regions for the adoption of hydroponic growing systems also the commercial viability of the hydroponic growing systems demonstrated in this paper will make possible faster uptake of hydroponic technology amongst farmers of the temperate regions of the country although hydroponic cultivation has a plethora of advantages over soil based cultivation a major disadvantage of using hydroponic systems is the pollution resulting from the discharge of used hydroponic solution hydroponic wastewater released into the surroundings has the potential to percolate into the soil leading to contamination of groundwater and negatively affecting the surrounding ecosystems and the environment as a whole the development of nutrient effluent treatment techniques is anticipated in future work in addition further studies could extend hydroponic cultivation into the vertical dimension and automate the growing process increasing the profitability many folds making the technique more appealing to the farmers all these factors would influence

10277,irrigation schedule is essential for improving crop production and allocating water resources in agricultural regions that heavily rely on irrigation this study designs a framework based on the aquacrop model to optimize the irrigation schedule of winter wheat under dry normal and wet hydrologic scenarios over a large region in china the model parameters were calibrated for one cultivar using observed data from three locations in the fenwei plain northern china and were shown to slightly vary spatially across this region regional weather data at high spatio temporal resolution were generated by interpolation and were combined with regional soil data on a 2 2 km grid to drive the model the irrigation schedule for the study area was optimized by combining a multi objective algorithm with the exponential efficacy coefficient method the optimization objectives included crop yield water use efficiency wue irrigation wue and economic irrigation benefit the results showed that the optimized irrigation schedule performed better than the current irrigation schedule applied by the farmers under studied hydrologic scenarios resulting in increased crop yield wue irrigation wue and irrigation economic benefit by 1 1 9 7 and decreased irrigation amount by 4 2 5 7 depending on regions within the study area the framework developed in this study reallocated irrigation water amounts between regions thereby improving water allocation to achieve optimal crop yield water use and economic benefit for the fenwei plain the results can also serve as a guide for local farmers and irrigation district managers graphical abstract ga1 list of abbreviations nsga ii improved non dominant sorting genetic algorithm eec exponential efficacy coefficient wue water use efficiency iwue

irrigation di deficit irrigation keywords irrigation management crop model regional scale multi objective optimization winter wheat 1 introduction the yellow river is a vital water resource of northern china and 80 of its water consumption is used for irrigation wang et al 2008 all rivers in the fenwei plain are tributaries of the yellow river and provide 40 of its water flow xu et al 2005 zhu et al 2004 the fenwei plain is also one of the most important agricultural regions in china crops grown in this area rely on irrigation which is supplemented at least once during their growth period an et al 2014 wang and wang 2009 the main irrigation consumption is by winter wheat during winter and early spring ji et al 2014 therefore efficient irrigation schedule for winter wheat in the fenwei plain is essential to the food security of northern china as well as the water resource security of the yellow river for a given agricultural region designing irrigation schedule requires knowledge on the local conditions of crops soils hydrology and climate the hydrologic and climate variables vary temporally and spatially and are associated with uncertainties and randomness li et al 2018 such variables generally conform to a specific probability distribution li et al 2016 therefore determining typical hydrologic conditions scenarios based on the probability distribution to provide hydrologic data sources is a way forward for designing irrigation schedule accordingly irrigation schedule under different hydrologic scenarios is a primary reference for the construction and management of irrigation systems and also for regional water allocation linker et al 2016 optimizing irrigation schedule can significantly improve irrigation efficacy and previous studies achieved good results on smaller scales such as field or irrigation district garcía vila and fereres 2012 li et al 2018 yang et al 2015 however few studies have focused on larger scales such as agricultural region comprising several irrigation districts even less so under different hydrologic conditions for the determination of hydrologic scenarios precipitation frequency analysis is often applied as groundwater recharge over irrigation district is relatively stable whereas inter annual precipitation varies greatly and causes significant differences in annual irrigation demand haygarth and jarvis 2002 li et al 2016 the more data from weather stations are used for precipitation frequency analysis the lower the uncertainty for determining hydrologic scenarios over a large scale mao and cherkauer 2009 zhou et al 2013 gridded precipitation data generated by data from multiple weather stations can accurately represent the precipitation pattern on regional scale zhao et al 2014 to the best of authors knowledge no studies have used gridded precipitation data to divide hydrologic scenarios for optimizing irrigation schedule information from field experiments are required for studying irrigation schedule however these are costly in time and resources therefore crop models have become a powerful tool for assessing agronomic and irrigation management guo et al 2018 horemans et al 2017 manevski et al 2019 the aquacrop model has been widely used for irrigation scheduling worldwide due to its sound and process based depiction of the soil plant atmosphere system and relative simplicity for usage garcía vila and fereres 2012 li et al 2018 linker et al 2016 applying crop models at regional scale requires capturing spatial variation of input data manevski et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 the spatial distribution of the input data to crop models such as soil type and crop parameters has been considered in regional simulations for irrigation scheduling in previous studies han et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 yang et al 2015 however few studies considered the spatial variation of weather data in the irrigation schedule optimization at the large scale which is the most important input for the crop model artificial intelligent algorithms are used for various nonlinear optimizations including irrigation scheduling li et al 2018 with the development of irrigated agriculture optimizing irrigation schedule for a single objective e g maximizing crop yield has gradually proceeded to focus on multiple objectives these multiple objectives are usually mutually contradictory in the optimization without a unique optimal solution for all objectives deb and jain 2013 however a set of optimal solutions can be found i e a pareto solution set which includes optimal solutions for one or two objectives that are non dominated to each other but are superior to the rest of solutions in the search space tabari and soltani 2013 crop yield water use efficiency wue and water costs are all determining factors for irrigation scheduling and water resource allocation wang et al 2008 and should be considered when optimizing irrigation schedule an improved non dominant sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii has been used for many multi objective optimizations esfe et al 2017 and this algorithm likely provides satisfactory results for the multi objective optimization of irrigation schedule the present study aims to optimize irrigation schedule for a large region under typical hydrologic scenarios differing in precipitation based on a framework that comprises crop model aquacrop artificial intelligent algorithm nsga ii and exponential efficacy coefficient eec the analysis was conducted for winter wheat in the fenwei plain northern china the optimization was implemented by three main steps i divide different hydrological scenarios over the agricultural region based on gridded precipitation data ii characterize the spatial variation of aquacrop crop parameters in the region iii assemble aquacrop nsga ii and eec into a framework to optimize irrigation schedule for multiple agro economic objectives over the region 2 materials and method 2 1 study region the study region includes most of the fenwei plain 34 42 35 72 n and 109 26 111 48 e and contains 16 irrigation districts xu et al 2005 and many tributaries of the yellow river fig 1 the climate in this region is semi arid with mean annual precipitation of 550 mm and average annual temperature of 14 4 c the elevation varies from 350 to 650 m agriculture is the dominant land use mainly with winter wheat maize double cropping the soil data 0 150 cm depth at 2 km resolution were obtained from soil sub center national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure http soil geodata cn fig 2 irrigation district is the basic unit to design and implement irrigation schedule therefore based on the distribution of irrigation district and soil type the study area was divided into three simulation regions fig 2 the distribution of irrigated cropland cultivated with winter wheat approximately 1 92 million ha was obtained from wenting and hui 2014 fig 2 in order to capture spatial difference of the crop parameters of aquacrop when applying the model on large scale the crop parameters were calibrated against data from field experiments conducted at the three locations corresponding to each of the three simulation regions fig 2 therefore one set of irrigation schedule with a corresponding set of calibrated crop parameters were applied in the simulation unit located in each region 2 2 determination of typical hydrologic scenarios historical precipitation data for multiple years are essential for the determination of typical hydrologic scenarios and the precipitation in the crop growing season reflects the actual water use conditions more accurately than annual precipitation mugalavai et al 2008 ngetich et al 2014 grided data better reflect the hydrological conditions at the large scale thus gridded 0 5 0 5 daily precipitation data 1972 2017 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the chinese meteorological administration fig 3 which had passed the interpolation error analysis and the generalized cross validation zhao et al 2014 for each grid a weight factor was calculated as the proportion of the study area that is within the grid the average daily precipitation for the study region was then calculated by summing the product of the weight and the precipitation of each grid and dividing the sum by the sum of the weights subsequently the daily precipitations were summed for the winter wheat growing season and these precipitation data of the growing season were used for characterizing the hydrologic scenarios for the study region the growing season of winter wheat was set from 15 october to 15 june in the following years according to the cultivation practice in the region probability distribution of pearson iii representing a generalized gamma distribution is suitable for presenting the hydrological pattern of china li et al 2018 and was used for determining the different hydrologic scenarios first historical precipitation for the growing seasons was ranked in descending order and these ranked series were recorded as x1 x2 xm xn second the accumulated frequency of each growing season was calculated as f m n 1 100 where m represents the number of greater than and equal to xm third different precipitation frequencies occurrence probabilities were divided based on the f and the number of growing seasons corresponding to these precipitation frequencies was counted last different precipitation frequency of each growing season was obtained by dividing the number of years of each growing season level by the total number of years li et al 2016 for this study three typical hydrologic scenarios precipitation frequency were determined based on commonly used classification standard for wet and dry conditions in china li et al 2018 i e wet normal and dry corresponding to precipitation frequency of 25 50 and 75 respectively the growing season in 1974 was determined as a wet scenarios with 220 mm precipitation over the entire study area 2012 was determined as a normal scenario with 182 mm precipitation and 2004 was determined as a dry scenario with 147 mm precipitation in order to obtain high resolution weather data over the study region anusplin was used to interpolate daily climate variables including evapotranspiration precipitation maximum and minimum temperature the anusplin is developed by the australian national university and is suitable for the interpolation of time series weather data since it uses the theory of thin plate splines function allowing covariate incorporation in addition to the independent spline variables hutchinson and xu 2004 in the present study the interpolation resolution was 2 km independent variables were longitude and latitude with elevation as covariate the weather data in the three hydrologic scenarios was used for the spatial interpolation based on the data from 45 weather stations in and around the study area fig 3 these weather and elevation data were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the chinese meteorological administration and the chinese national basic science data sharing service platform respectively the interpolation results showed that the daily mean 245 days signal of freedom degree was 19 2 and smaller than 22 5 half the number 45 of weather station which indicated acceptable results to pass the generalized cross validation hutchinson and xu 2004 and the interpolated data thus well reflect the spatial variation of weather data over the region 2 3 field experiment field experiments with winter wheat xiaoyan 22 a commonly grown cultivar in fenwei plain were conducted for two seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 at three locations in the study region i e wugong fuping and wenxi fig 3 the sowing date was october 15 in both 2017 and 2018 soil characteristics at each location were obtained from the soil sub center the national earth system science data center of the national science technology infrastructure table 1 the experiments applied a completely randomized design and each plot was 6 6 m2 with three replications the field management consisted of sowing depth of 3 5 cm and a density of 316 7 plants per m2 as well as full fertilization and crop protection there were three irrigation treatments full slight deficit and deficit the irrigation date of three treatments was the same and was determined when soil water content was monitored to reach 60 of field capacity in the soil profile 0 150 cm in the full irrigation treatment time domain reflectometry imko micromodultechnik gmbh germany was used to measure soil water content weekly with three replications along the soil profile at 0 3 m increment the irrigation amount differed and for the slight deficit and deficit irrigation treatments was 85 and 70 respectively of the full irrigation treatment the irrigation amount of the full irrigation treatment was calculated as follows 1 i a r fc q where i is the irrigation amount m3 a is plot area m2 fc is field capacity q is low limit of irrigation 60 of fc and r is effective rooting depth and was assumed to be 0 5 m from the seeding to the joining stage and 0 9 m from the joining to the maturity stage guo et al 2019 canopy cover cc was determined five times during the growing season using a digital camera and the software green crop tracker vanuytrecht et al 2014 aboveground biomass was measured five times in the growing season using the oven drying method and yield was determined for all plots guo et al 2019 crop wue was calculated as 2 wue y et where y is winter wheat yield per unit area t ha 1 et is the evapotranspiration calculated according to the water balance 3 et p i swc r d where p and i both in mm are precipitation and irrigation respectively swc mm is the changes in soil water content in the 1 5 m soil profile between sowing and harvesting d and r both in mm are respectively deep percolation and runoff which are assumed to be zero in the study area ji et al 2014 2 4 aquacrop evaluation and spatialization aquacrop version 6 0 used in this study focuses on simulating crop yield response to water and has a relatively low number of parameters vanuytrecht et al 2014 many studies show that aquacrop can satisfactorily simulate crop yield biomass and water productivity under various water supply conditions guo et al 2018 2019 horemans et al 2017 jin et al 2017 detailed description of the model is given by raes et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 calibration was done by the trial and error method to match the model outputs to the observed data from 2017 to 2018 of cc aboveground biomass yield and wue the observed data in 2018 2019 were used for validation these observed data were collected from the winter wheat under the three irrigation treatments at the three locations the calibrated parameters include time from sowing to maturity time of building up harvest index during yield formation length of the flowering stage time from sowing to flowering time from sowing to maximum rooting depth canopy growth coefficient reference harvest index and maximum canopy cover the performance of the model was evaluated by the relative error re the root mean squared error rmse the coefficient of determination r 2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency ef which were calculated as 4 re o i s i o i 100 where o i and s i are the observed and simulated values respectively 5 rmse o i s i 2 n where n is the number of observations n 5 for cc and biomass in a growing season the simulation shows good performance when the value of rmse approaches 0 6 r 2 s i s o i o s i s 2 o i o 2 2 where o and s are average values of the observed and simulated data respectively the r 2 value close to 1 indicates a good agreement between the observed and simulated data 7 ef 1 s i o i 2 o i o 2 similarly to r 2 ef close to 1 indicates a good agreement between the observed and simulated data if r 2 0 8 ef 0 6 and re is within 10 the model simulation performance can be considered as good krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 spatialization of the field scale aquacrop was performed by aquacrop gis which has been developed by fao to support simulations for multiple fields with different conditions such as climate scenarios field management and soil types lorite et al 2013 in order to balance between spatial resolution and computational time a 2 2 km resolution was applied in the present study and all regional data weather soils and field management were obtained at or resampled to this resolution the spatial resolution resulted in 4 811 fields of irrigated crops i e independent simulation units fig 2 for all fields the groundwater table was set to 5 m below soil surface wang et al 2018 management was fixed to no soil fertility stress 1 relative cover of weed and 15 cm height of soil bunds initial soil moisture was set to 70 of the total available soil water to ensure seedling emergence hillel and kozlowski 2012 2 5 framework for optimizing irrigation schedule the overall framework for optimizing the irrigation schedule is shown on fig 4 the regional weather soil and field management data as well as the calibrated crop parameters comprised the input to aquacrop gis for the optimization of agriculture water use and economic benefit three objectives were pursued maximum crop yield wue and minimum water cost for the entire study area the multi objective optimization algorithm naga ii combines aquacrop gis to pursue maximum yield wue and iwue by iteration operation and a pareto solution set is obtained through iteration this pareto solution set includes several preferable irrigation schedules subsequently one optimal irrigation schedule for all simulation region was selected from the pareto solution set based on the exponential efficacy coefficient eec method which considered constraint on water costs and irrigation frequency 2 5 1 genetic algorithm the decision variables were irrigation date the day after sowing and irrigation amount mm which were constrained by some conditions the three optimizing objectives are maximum yield crop

was set as larger than 10 days and no irrigation applied at 10 days before crop maturity 224 maximum irrigation amount i max was 120 mm and minimum irrigation amount i min 25 mm for guaranteeing uniform irrigation weibo et al 2012 the multi objective optimization was conducted with nsga ii an improved algorithm which applies the elite strategy to enlarge the sample space and operator of congestion degree and to accelerate coverage speed of the algorithm deb and jain 2013 real valued is used for the encoding of decision variables the algorithm implementation steps in the present study included random generate initial decision variables many combinations of irrigation date and amount nondominant sorting for all population calculation of crowding distance for each combination of irrigation date and amount normal genetic operation including selection crossover mutation and merge to generate combinations of new irrigation date and amount the new decision variables of each generation will be generated randomly under the constraining conditions which are implemented by abandoning the incongruent individuals the population size and evolution generation were set to 200 and 50 respectively considering calculation accuracy and computational time the time for a complete iteration running was about 72 h operated on a dell 289 xps8930 desktop computer the pareto solution set was obtained after multiple iteration runs 2 5 2 decision making the eec method is based on multi objective programming theory wang et al 2010 and requires certain user defined indicators to assess the merits of the solutions in the calculation of these indicators an unacceptable value and a satisfied value need to be determined that satisfies the practical objectives the larger efficacy coefficient the better performance of the treatment in the present study two indicators for the assessment were defined economic benefit of irrigation ieb and irrigation frequency greater ieb results in larger efficacy coefficients of ieb whereas lower irrigation frequency t results in larger efficacy coefficient of irrigation frequency because irrigation requires additional labor costs in this study area next the two efficacy coefficients for the irrigation schedules in the pareto solution set were calculated to a total efficacy coefficient the irrigation schedule with the largest total efficacy coefficient was selected as the optimal irrigation schedule the implemented formulas are as follow 10 ieb y wwp i wp iebs i 1 ieb i j 1 ieb j k 1 ieb k 11 c ieb e e ieb ieb 1 ieb 0 ieb 1 c

irrigation economic benefits of the entire study region wwp is winter wheat price 2 6 yuan kg 1 and wp the water price 0 28 yuan m 3 set according to rehman and jingdong 2017 c ieb and c t are efficacy coefficients of ieb and irrigation frequency respectively in a simulation unit and c iebs and c ts are efficacy coefficients of ieb and irrigation frequency respectively for the entire study region the values of i j and k are as mentioned in section 2 5 1 ieb 1 and t 1 are acceptable values of ieb 14 000 yuan and t 0 respectively the acceptable values of ieb and t denoted that these ieb and t can in reality be accepted by the farmers which are the optimization results from applying optimized irrigation schedule ieb 0 and t 0 are unacceptable values of ieb 13 000 yuan and t 4 respectively similarly the unacceptable values of ieb denoted that these ieb and t cannot be accepted by the farmers these values were collected from field investigations in the study area finally c t is total efficacy coefficient of an irrigation schedule in the practice of the study area the manager of irrigation districts will first determine the hydrological scenarios of the present year based on medium and long term hydrological forecast then the manager will select the corresponding irrigation schedule based on the determined hydrological scenarios and give the suggested irrigation schedule to farmers li et al 2016 information on local current irrigation schedules were collected from the field investigation and local standards of agriculture water use administration 2020 supervision 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of aquacrop the calibrated crop parameters of the aquacrop model for the three experimental locations are shown in table 2 these parameters were calibrated within normal ranges raes et al 2017 and they showed no aparent differences to previously reported in jin et al 2017 who used the same cultivar of winter wheat among the three parameter sets most of the calibrated parameters were the same whereas three parameters related to canopy growth coefficient cgc reference harvest index hio and maximum canopy cover ccx differed slightly between the three simulation regions for a given cultivar most of the calibrated parameters generally do not change with management practices geographic location or environmental conditions vanuytrecht et al 2014 however a few parameters may still need to be adjusted to the different environmental conditions for reducing uncertainty particularly for capturing their spatial variations as a basis for upscaling crop model simulations guo et al 2019 han et al 2019 lorite et al 2013 in the present study calibration result showed certain spatial variations in few calibrated parameters across the study area and considering these variations should provide confidence in the accuracy of the model regional application the results of the model evaluation show that the calibrated aquacrop model can successfully predict the cc biomass yield wue and soil water content of winter wheat under different water stress condition at the three experimental location table 3 figs 5 and 6 the re between observed and simulated yield were lower than 5 in the calibration and validation the rmse were also low and ranged from 3 7 to 6 7 for cc ranged from 0 59 to 1 38 t ha 1 for biomass ranged from 0 06 to 0 15 t ha 1 for yield and ranged from 0 01 to 0 02 kg m 3 for wue the r 2 values were greater than 0 9 and the ef values were greater than 0 6 the observed and simulated canopy cover biomass yield and wue of winter wheat were all distributed near the 1 1 line salemi et al 2011 and wang et al 2013 also used aquacrop to simulate canopy cover yield and biomass of winter wheat and reported similar results of satisfactory accuracy regarding soil water content dynamics simulated data were generally in accordance with measured data under different irrigation treatments at the three locations which indicated that the calibrated model could simulate the soil water content with a good performance hence the calibrated model was deemed suitable for assessing yield and water use of winter wheat under different water stress condition in the study region 3 2 comparison between optimized and local current irrigation schedule the optimized irrigation schedule ois for the study region is shown in table 4 including the comparison with the local current irrigation schedule lcis the irrigation date and amount of ois both changed compared with that of lcis for the three simulation regions in the ois all spring irrigation events which usually occur within 130 170 days after sowing were delayed for several days to a period that was more suitable for the critical stage for water demand of winter wheat i e the jointing stage ji et al 2014 compared with lcis ois improved the allocation of irrigation water by allocating more water in the late winter corresponding to the tillering stage of winter wheat under dry and normal hydrologic scenarios moreover the allocation of irrigation water between the three regions was improved by reducing the amounts of regions ii and iii and increasing the amounts of region i this allocation largely resulted from higher crop yield and wue in region i compared with the other regions under the same level of water supply this finding also corresponds with the field experiment results at the three locations which showed under the same level of water supply higher yield and wue in the soil condition at wugong compared with the other two locations fig 5 previous studies indicated that multiple irrigation events with low water amount can increase crop yield and wue garcía vila and fereres 2012 li et al 2018 however increasing irrigation frequency increases energy and labor costs which in ols has been set as a constraint condition in the optimization framework eq 12 therefore most of the ois maintained the same irrigation frequency as the lcis nevertheless the framework still achieved good performance in reducing the irrigation frequency for region ii under dry hydrologic scenarios and improving crop yield wue and ieb table 4 3 3 improved performance of the optimized irrigation schedule the performance of ois solved by the nsga ii and the eec method was generally better than that of lcis under the different hydrologic scenarios table 5 total yield and economic benefit of irrigation ieb for the study region using ois both increased compared to lcis and the increase ranged from 1 9 to 3 5 the average yield ieb wue and iwue for the study region using ois also increased compared to lcis and the increase ranged from 1 1 to 9 7 in particular ieb per hectare increased for 490 424 and 316 yuan under dry normal and wet hydrologic scenarios respectively the total irrigation amount under ois was reduced that ranged from 4 2 to 5 7 while yield and economic benefit increased among the different hydrologic scenarios the optimization performance of the normal scenarios was relatively better than for the wet scenarios and the performance of the dry scenarios was relatively better than for the normal scenarios similar results were reported by li et al 2018 in a study of irrigation schedule optimization for winter wheat under different hydrological scenarios this could be because the lower yield in the dry scenarios bear greater potential for increased production and more combinations of irrigation date and amount due to more irrigation times in the dry scenarios provide more scope for optimization li et al 2016 3 4 spatial analysis for applying optimized irrigation schedule the crop yield wue and iwue for the three regions are compared between ois and lcis in fig 7 for region i with applying ois crop yield and wue increased and iwue in some areas of this region slightly decreased compared to those applying lcis and the irrigation amount increased compared to that of applying lcis under all hydrologic scenarios table 4 this is probably due to the nonlinear relation between iwue and irrigation amount i e increasing irrigation amount would increase crop yield but reduce iwue after iwue reaches its maximum value hillel 2013 kang et al 2002 in contrast for region ii with applying ois crop yield and wue slightly decreased and iwue increased compared to those applying lcis and the irrigation amount reduced compared to that applying lcis under all hydrologic scenarios table 4 soil type has a great influence on the relation between crop yield water use and irrigation amount manevski et al 2019 tolk et al 1999 and the different response of crop yield and water use to irrigation between regions i and ii under all hydrologic scenarios may very well be due to the different soil conditions fig 2 the optimization results indicate the irrigation amount for lcis in region i and ii were respectively too low and too high for achieving the optimal yield water use and economic benefits and the ois improved the water resource allocation of these regions by reallocating the irrigation amount for region iii with applying ois irrigation amount slightly decreased compared to that applying lcis and the increases of yield wue and iwue were small in total the optimized irrigation schedule was implemented by balancing the increases and decreases of the three indicators yield wue and iwue in the optimizing objectives function eq 8 fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the optimized indicators when applying ois under different hydrologic scenarios crop yield wue and iwue in region i were overall higher compared to the other regions under all hydrologic scenarios for regions ii and iii only one or two of indicators showed high values in a given hydrologic scenarios water use efficiency and crop yield are normally opposing each other so that high wue cannot result in high yield thus achieving good balance between the two is important and complex especially at a regional scale hillel 2013 jiang et al 2019 this study shows that region i could achieve better performance in balancing water use and crop yield by the optimization than other regions which also accords with the field experiment results table 3 and fig 5 region ii showed relatively lower yield compared to the other regions under all hydrologic scenarios partly due to the crop parameters ccx and hio that have great effect on yield in aquacrop vanuytrecht et al 2014 and these calibrated parameters of region ii performed lower value than the other regions table 2 from the comparison between figs 8 and 2 the area with the soil type calcaric fluvisols showed lower level of yield wue and iwue under all hydrologic scenarios under different soil type the optimal irrigation schedule for pursuing highest crop yield and wue is different linker et al 2016 therefore in order to achieve maximum objective function in the study region eq 5 the framework chooses the optimal irrigation schedule which is more suitable for the soil type occupying larger area in the region to achieve overall higher yield wue and iwue the application of ois is associated with some uncertainties which should be further explored for instance in practice for the chinese irrigation districts the determination of hydrological scenarios and corresponding irrigation schedule for the present year is usually based on the medium and long term hydrological forecast thus the forecast uncertainty could affect the application performance of irrigation schedule moreover the error performance of weather data interpolation in this study was just acceptable due to the limited number of weather station in the study area which may also rise the uncertainty further optimization of irrigation schedule should use some methods to reduce the negative impact of uncertainty on the accuracy of optimization results e g high resolution interpolation and data from more weather stations 4 conclusions in this study a framework composed of the aquacrop model a multi objective optimization algorithm and the eec method was developed to optimize the irrigation schedule of winter wheat under different typical hydrologic scenarios over a large region in china prior to the optimization weather data were interpolated satisfactorily to represent the spatial variation under three typical hydrologic scenarios the calibrated aquacrop model was able to predict crop yield and water use of winter wheat under different water stress conditions in the study area the optimization results showed that the framework achieved satisfactory performance for improving winter wheat yield and water use and economic benefits for entire study area crop yield wue iwue and ieb applying optimized irrigation schedule all increased by 1 1 9 7 with concomitant decrease of irrigation compared to the local current irrigation schedule the spatial variation of soil type and crop parameters were found to exert notable effect on optimizing irrigation schedule for the study area the optimized irrigation schedule reallocated the irrigation water between different simulation regions and improved water resource allocation for achieving better system performance the present study mainly focuses on crop response to water whereas fertility stress is also an important factor for crop water use and should be considered in future optimization studies some irrigation districts adopt rotation irrigation that might not timely implement optimized irrigation schedule therefore studies should also

10277,irrigation schedule is essential for improving crop production and allocating water resources in agricultural regions that heavily rely on irrigation this study designs a framework based on the aquacrop model to optimize the irrigation schedule of winter wheat under dry normal and wet hydrologic scenarios over a large region in china the model parameters were calibrated for one cultivar using observed data from three locations in the fenwei plain northern china and were shown to slightly vary spatially across this region regional weather data at high spatio temporal resolution were generated by interpolation and were combined with regional soil data on a 2 2 km grid to drive the model the irrigation schedule for the study area was optimized by combining a multi objective algorithm with the exponential efficacy coefficient method the optimization objectives included crop yield water use efficiency wue irrigation wue and economic irrigation benefit the results showed that the optimized irrigation schedule performed better than the current irrigation schedule applied by the farmers under studied hydrologic scenarios resulting in increased crop yield wue irrigation wue and irrigation economic benefit by 1 1 9 7 and decreased irrigation amount by 4 2 5 7 depending on regions within the study area the framework developed in this study reallocated irrigation water amounts between regions thereby improving water allocation to achieve optimal crop yield water use and economic benefit for the fenwei plain the results can also serve as a guide for local farmers and irrigation district managers graphical abstract ga1 list of abbreviations nsga ii improved non dominant sorting genetic algorithm eec exponential efficacy coefficient wue water use efficiency iwue

irrigation di deficit irrigation keywords irrigation management crop model regional scale multi objective optimization winter wheat 1 introduction the yellow river is a vital water resource of northern china and 80 of its water consumption is used for irrigation wang et al 2008 all rivers in the fenwei plain are tributaries of the yellow river and provide 40 of its water flow xu et al 2005 zhu et al 2004 the fenwei plain is also one of the most important agricultural regions in china crops grown in this area rely on irrigation which is supplemented at least once during their growth period an et al 2014 wang and wang 2009 the main irrigation consumption is by winter wheat during winter and early spring ji et al 2014 therefore efficient irrigation schedule for winter wheat in the fenwei plain is essential to the food security of northern china as well as the water resource security of the yellow river for a given agricultural region designing irrigation schedule requires knowledge on the local conditions of crops soils hydrology and climate the hydrologic and climate variables vary temporally and spatially and are associated with uncertainties and randomness li et al 2018 such variables generally conform to a specific probability distribution li et al 2016 therefore determining typical hydrologic conditions scenarios based on the probability distribution to provide hydrologic data sources is a way forward for designing irrigation schedule accordingly irrigation schedule under different hydrologic scenarios is a primary reference for the construction and management of irrigation systems and also for regional water allocation linker et al 2016 optimizing irrigation schedule can significantly improve irrigation efficacy and previous studies achieved good results on smaller scales such as field or irrigation district garcía vila and fereres 2012 li et al 2018 yang et al 2015 however few studies have focused on larger scales such as agricultural region comprising several irrigation districts even less so under different hydrologic conditions for the determination of hydrologic scenarios precipitation frequency analysis is often applied as groundwater recharge over irrigation district is relatively stable whereas inter annual precipitation varies greatly and causes significant differences in annual irrigation demand haygarth and jarvis 2002 li et al 2016 the more data from weather stations are used for precipitation frequency analysis the lower the uncertainty for determining hydrologic scenarios over a large scale mao and cherkauer 2009 zhou et al 2013 gridded precipitation data generated by data from multiple weather stations can accurately represent the precipitation pattern on regional scale zhao et al 2014 to the best of authors knowledge no studies have used gridded precipitation data to divide hydrologic scenarios for optimizing irrigation schedule information from field experiments are required for studying irrigation schedule however these are costly in time and resources therefore crop models have become a powerful tool for assessing agronomic and irrigation management guo et al 2018 horemans et al 2017 manevski et al 2019 the aquacrop model has been widely used for irrigation scheduling worldwide due to its sound and process based depiction of the soil plant atmosphere system and relative simplicity for usage garcía vila and fereres 2012 li et al 2018 linker et al 2016 applying crop models at regional scale requires capturing spatial variation of input data manevski et al 2019 zhao et al 2015 the spatial distribution of the input data to crop models such as soil type and crop parameters has been considered in regional simulations for irrigation scheduling in previous studies han et al 2019 jiang et al 2019 yang et al 2015 however few studies considered the spatial variation of weather data in the irrigation schedule optimization at the large scale which is the most important input for the crop model artificial intelligent algorithms are used for various nonlinear optimizations including irrigation scheduling li et al 2018 with the development of irrigated agriculture optimizing irrigation schedule for a single objective e g maximizing crop yield has gradually proceeded to focus on multiple objectives these multiple objectives are usually mutually contradictory in the optimization without a unique optimal solution for all objectives deb and jain 2013 however a set of optimal solutions can be found i e a pareto solution set which includes optimal solutions for one or two objectives that are non dominated to each other but are superior to the rest of solutions in the search space tabari and soltani 2013 crop yield water use efficiency wue and water costs are all determining factors for irrigation scheduling and water resource allocation wang et al 2008 and should be considered when optimizing irrigation schedule an improved non dominant sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii has been used for many multi objective optimizations esfe et al 2017 and this algorithm likely provides satisfactory results for the multi objective optimization of irrigation schedule the present study aims to optimize irrigation schedule for a large region under typical hydrologic scenarios differing in precipitation based on a framework that comprises crop model aquacrop artificial intelligent algorithm nsga ii and exponential efficacy coefficient eec the analysis was conducted for winter wheat in the fenwei plain northern china the optimization was implemented by three main steps i divide different hydrological scenarios over the agricultural region based on gridded precipitation data ii characterize the spatial variation of aquacrop crop parameters in the region iii assemble aquacrop nsga ii and eec into a framework to optimize irrigation schedule for multiple agro economic objectives over the region 2 materials and method 2 1 study region the study region includes most of the fenwei plain 34 42 35 72 n and 109 26 111 48 e and contains 16 irrigation districts xu et al 2005 and many tributaries of the yellow river fig 1 the climate in this region is semi arid with mean annual precipitation of 550 mm and average annual temperature of 14 4 c the elevation varies from 350 to 650 m agriculture is the dominant land use mainly with winter wheat maize double cropping the soil data 0 150 cm depth at 2 km resolution were obtained from soil sub center national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure http soil geodata cn fig 2 irrigation district is the basic unit to design and implement irrigation schedule therefore based on the distribution of irrigation district and soil type the study area was divided into three simulation regions fig 2 the distribution of irrigated cropland cultivated with winter wheat approximately 1 92 million ha was obtained from wenting and hui 2014 fig 2 in order to capture spatial difference of the crop parameters of aquacrop when applying the model on large scale the crop parameters were calibrated against data from field experiments conducted at the three locations corresponding to each of the three simulation regions fig 2 therefore one set of irrigation schedule with a corresponding set of calibrated crop parameters were applied in the simulation unit located in each region 2 2 determination of typical hydrologic scenarios historical precipitation data for multiple years are essential for the determination of typical hydrologic scenarios and the precipitation in the crop growing season reflects the actual water use conditions more accurately than annual precipitation mugalavai et al 2008 ngetich et al 2014 grided data better reflect the hydrological conditions at the large scale thus gridded 0 5 0 5 daily precipitation data 1972 2017 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the chinese meteorological administration fig 3 which had passed the interpolation error analysis and the generalized cross validation zhao et al 2014 for each grid a weight factor was calculated as the proportion of the study area that is within the grid the average daily precipitation for the study region was then calculated by summing the product of the weight and the precipitation of each grid and dividing the sum by the sum of the weights subsequently the daily precipitations were summed for the winter wheat growing season and these precipitation data of the growing season were used for characterizing the hydrologic scenarios for the study region the growing season of winter wheat was set from 15 october to 15 june in the following years according to the cultivation practice in the region probability distribution of pearson iii representing a generalized gamma distribution is suitable for presenting the hydrological pattern of china li et al 2018 and was used for determining the different hydrologic scenarios first historical precipitation for the growing seasons was ranked in descending order and these ranked series were recorded as x1 x2 xm xn second the accumulated frequency of each growing season was calculated as f m n 1 100 where m represents the number of greater than and equal to xm third different precipitation frequencies occurrence probabilities were divided based on the f and the number of growing seasons corresponding to these precipitation frequencies was counted last different precipitation frequency of each growing season was obtained by dividing the number of years of each growing season level by the total number of years li et al 2016 for this study three typical hydrologic scenarios precipitation frequency were determined based on commonly used classification standard for wet and dry conditions in china li et al 2018 i e wet normal and dry corresponding to precipitation frequency of 25 50 and 75 respectively the growing season in 1974 was determined as a wet scenarios with 220 mm precipitation over the entire study area 2012 was determined as a normal scenario with 182 mm precipitation and 2004 was determined as a dry scenario with 147 mm precipitation in order to obtain high resolution weather data over the study region anusplin was used to interpolate daily climate variables including evapotranspiration precipitation maximum and minimum temperature the anusplin is developed by the australian national university and is suitable for the interpolation of time series weather data since it uses the theory of thin plate splines function allowing covariate incorporation in addition to the independent spline variables hutchinson and xu 2004 in the present study the interpolation resolution was 2 km independent variables were longitude and latitude with elevation as covariate the weather data in the three hydrologic scenarios was used for the spatial interpolation based on the data from 45 weather stations in and around the study area fig 3 these weather and elevation data were obtained from the national meteorological information center of the chinese meteorological administration and the chinese national basic science data sharing service platform respectively the interpolation results showed that the daily mean 245 days signal of freedom degree was 19 2 and smaller than 22 5 half the number 45 of weather station which indicated acceptable results to pass the generalized cross validation hutchinson and xu 2004 and the interpolated data thus well reflect the spatial variation of weather data over the region 2 3 field experiment field experiments with winter wheat xiaoyan 22 a commonly grown cultivar in fenwei plain were conducted for two seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 at three locations in the study region i e wugong fuping and wenxi fig 3 the sowing date was october 15 in both 2017 and 2018 soil characteristics at each location were obtained from the soil sub center the national earth system science data center of the national science technology infrastructure table 1 the experiments applied a completely randomized design and each plot was 6 6 m2 with three replications the field management consisted of sowing depth of 3 5 cm and a density of 316 7 plants per m2 as well as full fertilization and crop protection there were three irrigation treatments full slight deficit and deficit the irrigation date of three treatments was the same and was determined when soil water content was monitored to reach 60 of field capacity in the soil profile 0 150 cm in the full irrigation treatment time domain reflectometry imko micromodultechnik gmbh germany was used to measure soil water content weekly with three replications along the soil profile at 0 3 m increment the irrigation amount differed and for the slight deficit and deficit irrigation treatments was 85 and 70 respectively of the full irrigation treatment the irrigation amount of the full irrigation treatment was calculated as follows 1 i a r fc q where i is the irrigation amount m3 a is plot area m2 fc is field capacity q is low limit of irrigation 60 of fc and r is effective rooting depth and was assumed to be 0 5 m from the seeding to the joining stage and 0 9 m from the joining to the maturity stage guo et al 2019 canopy cover cc was determined five times during the growing season using a digital camera and the software green crop tracker vanuytrecht et al 2014 aboveground biomass was measured five times in the growing season using the oven drying method and yield was determined for all plots guo et al 2019 crop wue was calculated as 2 wue y et where y is winter wheat yield per unit area t ha 1 et is the evapotranspiration calculated according to the water balance 3 et p i swc r d where p and i both in mm are precipitation and irrigation respectively swc mm is the changes in soil water content in the 1 5 m soil profile between sowing and harvesting d and r both in mm are respectively deep percolation and runoff which are assumed to be zero in the study area ji et al 2014 2 4 aquacrop evaluation and spatialization aquacrop version 6 0 used in this study focuses on simulating crop yield response to water and has a relatively low number of parameters vanuytrecht et al 2014 many studies show that aquacrop can satisfactorily simulate crop yield biomass and water productivity under various water supply conditions guo et al 2018 2019 horemans et al 2017 jin et al 2017 detailed description of the model is given by raes et al 2009 and hsiao et al 2009 calibration was done by the trial and error method to match the model outputs to the observed data from 2017 to 2018 of cc aboveground biomass yield and wue the observed data in 2018 2019 were used for validation these observed data were collected from the winter wheat under the three irrigation treatments at the three locations the calibrated parameters include time from sowing to maturity time of building up harvest index during yield formation length of the flowering stage time from sowing to flowering time from sowing to maximum rooting depth canopy growth coefficient reference harvest index and maximum canopy cover the performance of the model was evaluated by the relative error re the root mean squared error rmse the coefficient of determination r 2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency ef which were calculated as 4 re o i s i o i 100 where o i and s i are the observed and simulated values respectively 5 rmse o i s i 2 n where n is the number of observations n 5 for cc and biomass in a growing season the simulation shows good performance when the value of rmse approaches 0 6 r 2 s i s o i o s i s 2 o i o 2 2 where o and s are average values of the observed and simulated data respectively the r 2 value close to 1 indicates a good agreement between the observed and simulated data 7 ef 1 s i o i 2 o i o 2 similarly to r 2 ef close to 1 indicates a good agreement between the observed and simulated data if r 2 0 8 ef 0 6 and re is within 10 the model simulation performance can be considered as good krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 spatialization of the field scale aquacrop was performed by aquacrop gis which has been developed by fao to support simulations for multiple fields with different conditions such as climate scenarios field management and soil types lorite et al 2013 in order to balance between spatial resolution and computational time a 2 2 km resolution was applied in the present study and all regional data weather soils and field management were obtained at or resampled to this resolution the spatial resolution resulted in 4 811 fields of irrigated crops i e independent simulation units fig 2 for all fields the groundwater table was set to 5 m below soil surface wang et al 2018 management was fixed to no soil fertility stress 1 relative cover of weed and 15 cm height of soil bunds initial soil moisture was set to 70 of the total available soil water to ensure seedling emergence hillel and kozlowski 2012 2 5 framework for optimizing irrigation schedule the overall framework for optimizing the irrigation schedule is shown on fig 4 the regional weather soil and field management data as well as the calibrated crop parameters comprised the input to aquacrop gis for the optimization of agriculture water use and economic benefit three objectives were pursued maximum crop yield wue and minimum water cost for the entire study area the multi objective optimization algorithm naga ii combines aquacrop gis to pursue maximum yield wue and iwue by iteration operation and a pareto solution set is obtained through iteration this pareto solution set includes several preferable irrigation schedules subsequently one optimal irrigation schedule for all simulation region was selected from the pareto solution set based on the exponential efficacy coefficient eec method which considered constraint on water costs and irrigation frequency 2 5 1 genetic algorithm the decision variables were irrigation date the day after sowing and irrigation amount mm which were constrained by some conditions the three optimizing objectives are maximum yield crop

was set as larger than 10 days and no irrigation applied at 10 days before crop maturity 224 maximum irrigation amount i max was 120 mm and minimum irrigation amount i min 25 mm for guaranteeing uniform irrigation weibo et al 2012 the multi objective optimization was conducted with nsga ii an improved algorithm which applies the elite strategy to enlarge the sample space and operator of congestion degree and to accelerate coverage speed of the algorithm deb and jain 2013 real valued is used for the encoding of decision variables the algorithm implementation steps in the present study included random generate initial decision variables many combinations of irrigation date and amount nondominant sorting for all population calculation of crowding distance for each combination of irrigation date and amount normal genetic operation including selection crossover mutation and merge to generate combinations of new irrigation date and amount the new decision variables of each generation will be generated randomly under the constraining conditions which are implemented by abandoning the incongruent individuals the population size and evolution generation were set to 200 and 50 respectively considering calculation accuracy and computational time the time for a complete iteration running was about 72 h operated on a dell 289 xps8930 desktop computer the pareto solution set was obtained after multiple iteration runs 2 5 2 decision making the eec method is based on multi objective programming theory wang et al 2010 and requires certain user defined indicators to assess the merits of the solutions in the calculation of these indicators an unacceptable value and a satisfied value need to be determined that satisfies the practical objectives the larger efficacy coefficient the better performance of the treatment in the present study two indicators for the assessment were defined economic benefit of irrigation ieb and irrigation frequency greater ieb results in larger efficacy coefficients of ieb whereas lower irrigation frequency t results in larger efficacy coefficient of irrigation frequency because irrigation requires additional labor costs in this study area next the two efficacy coefficients for the irrigation schedules in the pareto solution set were calculated to a total efficacy coefficient the irrigation schedule with the largest total efficacy coefficient was selected as the optimal irrigation schedule the implemented formulas are as follow 10 ieb y wwp i wp iebs i 1 ieb i j 1 ieb j k 1 ieb k 11 c ieb e e ieb ieb 1 ieb 0 ieb 1 c

irrigation economic benefits of the entire study region wwp is winter wheat price 2 6 yuan kg 1 and wp the water price 0 28 yuan m 3 set according to rehman and jingdong 2017 c ieb and c t are efficacy coefficients of ieb and irrigation frequency respectively in a simulation unit and c iebs and c ts are efficacy coefficients of ieb and irrigation frequency respectively for the entire study region the values of i j and k are as mentioned in section 2 5 1 ieb 1 and t 1 are acceptable values of ieb 14 000 yuan and t 0 respectively the acceptable values of ieb and t denoted that these ieb and t can in reality be accepted by the farmers which are the optimization results from applying optimized irrigation schedule ieb 0 and t 0 are unacceptable values of ieb 13 000 yuan and t 4 respectively similarly the unacceptable values of ieb denoted that these ieb and t cannot be accepted by the farmers these values were collected from field investigations in the study area finally c t is total efficacy coefficient of an irrigation schedule in the practice of the study area the manager of irrigation districts will first determine the hydrological scenarios of the present year based on medium and long term hydrological forecast then the manager will select the corresponding irrigation schedule based on the determined hydrological scenarios and give the suggested irrigation schedule to farmers li et al 2016 information on local current irrigation schedules were collected from the field investigation and local standards of agriculture water use administration 2020 supervision 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of aquacrop the calibrated crop parameters of the aquacrop model for the three experimental locations are shown in table 2 these parameters were calibrated within normal ranges raes et al 2017 and they showed no aparent differences to previously reported in jin et al 2017 who used the same cultivar of winter wheat among the three parameter sets most of the calibrated parameters were the same whereas three parameters related to canopy growth coefficient cgc reference harvest index hio and maximum canopy cover ccx differed slightly between the three simulation regions for a given cultivar most of the calibrated parameters generally do not change with management practices geographic location or environmental conditions vanuytrecht et al 2014 however a few parameters may still need to be adjusted to the different environmental conditions for reducing uncertainty particularly for capturing their spatial variations as a basis for upscaling crop model simulations guo et al 2019 han et al 2019 lorite et al 2013 in the present study calibration result showed certain spatial variations in few calibrated parameters across the study area and considering these variations should provide confidence in the accuracy of the model regional application the results of the model evaluation show that the calibrated aquacrop model can successfully predict the cc biomass yield wue and soil water content of winter wheat under different water stress condition at the three experimental location table 3 figs 5 and 6 the re between observed and simulated yield were lower than 5 in the calibration and validation the rmse were also low and ranged from 3 7 to 6 7 for cc ranged from 0 59 to 1 38 t ha 1 for biomass ranged from 0 06 to 0 15 t ha 1 for yield and ranged from 0 01 to 0 02 kg m 3 for wue the r 2 values were greater than 0 9 and the ef values were greater than 0 6 the observed and simulated canopy cover biomass yield and wue of winter wheat were all distributed near the 1 1 line salemi et al 2011 and wang et al 2013 also used aquacrop to simulate canopy cover yield and biomass of winter wheat and reported similar results of satisfactory accuracy regarding soil water content dynamics simulated data were generally in accordance with measured data under different irrigation treatments at the three locations which indicated that the calibrated model could simulate the soil water content with a good performance hence the calibrated model was deemed suitable for assessing yield and water use of winter wheat under different water stress condition in the study region 3 2 comparison between optimized and local current irrigation schedule the optimized irrigation schedule ois for the study region is shown in table 4 including the comparison with the local current irrigation schedule lcis the irrigation date and amount of ois both changed compared with that of lcis for the three simulation regions in the ois all spring irrigation events which usually occur within 130 170 days after sowing were delayed for several days to a period that was more suitable for the critical stage for water demand of winter wheat i e the jointing stage ji et al 2014 compared with lcis ois improved the allocation of irrigation water by allocating more water in the late winter corresponding to the tillering stage of winter wheat under dry and normal hydrologic scenarios moreover the allocation of irrigation water between the three regions was improved by reducing the amounts of regions ii and iii and increasing the amounts of region i this allocation largely resulted from higher crop yield and wue in region i compared with the other regions under the same level of water supply this finding also corresponds with the field experiment results at the three locations which showed under the same level of water supply higher yield and wue in the soil condition at wugong compared with the other two locations fig 5 previous studies indicated that multiple irrigation events with low water amount can increase crop yield and wue garcía vila and fereres 2012 li et al 2018 however increasing irrigation frequency increases energy and labor costs which in ols has been set as a constraint condition in the optimization framework eq 12 therefore most of the ois maintained the same irrigation frequency as the lcis nevertheless the framework still achieved good performance in reducing the irrigation frequency for region ii under dry hydrologic scenarios and improving crop yield wue and ieb table 4 3 3 improved performance of the optimized irrigation schedule the performance of ois solved by the nsga ii and the eec method was generally better than that of lcis under the different hydrologic scenarios table 5 total yield and economic benefit of irrigation ieb for the study region using ois both increased compared to lcis and the increase ranged from 1 9 to 3 5 the average yield ieb wue and iwue for the study region using ois also increased compared to lcis and the increase ranged from 1 1 to 9 7 in particular ieb per hectare increased for 490 424 and 316 yuan under dry normal and wet hydrologic scenarios respectively the total irrigation amount under ois was reduced that ranged from 4 2 to 5 7 while yield and economic benefit increased among the different hydrologic scenarios the optimization performance of the normal scenarios was relatively better than for the wet scenarios and the performance of the dry scenarios was relatively better than for the normal scenarios similar results were reported by li et al 2018 in a study of irrigation schedule optimization for winter wheat under different hydrological scenarios this could be because the lower yield in the dry scenarios bear greater potential for increased production and more combinations of irrigation date and amount due to more irrigation times in the dry scenarios provide more scope for optimization li et al 2016 3 4 spatial analysis for applying optimized irrigation schedule the crop yield wue and iwue for the three regions are compared between ois and lcis in fig 7 for region i with applying ois crop yield and wue increased and iwue in some areas of this region slightly decreased compared to those applying lcis and the irrigation amount increased compared to that of applying lcis under all hydrologic scenarios table 4 this is probably due to the nonlinear relation between iwue and irrigation amount i e increasing irrigation amount would increase crop yield but reduce iwue after iwue reaches its maximum value hillel 2013 kang et al 2002 in contrast for region ii with applying ois crop yield and wue slightly decreased and iwue increased compared to those applying lcis and the irrigation amount reduced compared to that applying lcis under all hydrologic scenarios table 4 soil type has a great influence on the relation between crop yield water use and irrigation amount manevski et al 2019 tolk et al 1999 and the different response of crop yield and water use to irrigation between regions i and ii under all hydrologic scenarios may very well be due to the different soil conditions fig 2 the optimization results indicate the irrigation amount for lcis in region i and ii were respectively too low and too high for achieving the optimal yield water use and economic benefits and the ois improved the water resource allocation of these regions by reallocating the irrigation amount for region iii with applying ois irrigation amount slightly decreased compared to that applying lcis and the increases of yield wue and iwue were small in total the optimized irrigation schedule was implemented by balancing the increases and decreases of the three indicators yield wue and iwue in the optimizing objectives function eq 8 fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of the optimized indicators when applying ois under different hydrologic scenarios crop yield wue and iwue in region i were overall higher compared to the other regions under all hydrologic scenarios for regions ii and iii only one or two of indicators showed high values in a given hydrologic scenarios water use efficiency and crop yield are normally opposing each other so that high wue cannot result in high yield thus achieving good balance between the two is important and complex especially at a regional scale hillel 2013 jiang et al 2019 this study shows that region i could achieve better performance in balancing water use and crop yield by the optimization than other regions which also accords with the field experiment results table 3 and fig 5 region ii showed relatively lower yield compared to the other regions under all hydrologic scenarios partly due to the crop parameters ccx and hio that have great effect on yield in aquacrop vanuytrecht et al 2014 and these calibrated parameters of region ii performed lower value than the other regions table 2 from the comparison between figs 8 and 2 the area with the soil type calcaric fluvisols showed lower level of yield wue and iwue under all hydrologic scenarios under different soil type the optimal irrigation schedule for pursuing highest crop yield and wue is different linker et al 2016 therefore in order to achieve maximum objective function in the study region eq 5 the framework chooses the optimal irrigation schedule which is more suitable for the soil type occupying larger area in the region to achieve overall higher yield wue and iwue the application of ois is associated with some uncertainties which should be further explored for instance in practice for the chinese irrigation districts the determination of hydrological scenarios and corresponding irrigation schedule for the present year is usually based on the medium and long term hydrological forecast thus the forecast uncertainty could affect the application performance of irrigation schedule moreover the error performance of weather data interpolation in this study was just acceptable due to the limited number of weather station in the study area which may also rise the uncertainty further optimization of irrigation schedule should use some methods to reduce the negative impact of uncertainty on the accuracy of optimization results e g high resolution interpolation and data from more weather stations 4 conclusions in this study a framework composed of the aquacrop model a multi objective optimization algorithm and the eec method was developed to optimize the irrigation schedule of winter wheat under different typical hydrologic scenarios over a large region in china prior to the optimization weather data were interpolated satisfactorily to represent the spatial variation under three typical hydrologic scenarios the calibrated aquacrop model was able to predict crop yield and water use of winter wheat under different water stress conditions in the study area the optimization results showed that the framework achieved satisfactory performance for improving winter wheat yield and water use and economic benefits for entire study area crop yield wue iwue and ieb applying optimized irrigation schedule all increased by 1 1 9 7 with concomitant decrease of irrigation compared to the local current irrigation schedule the spatial variation of soil type and crop parameters were found to exert notable effect on optimizing irrigation schedule for the study area the optimized irrigation schedule reallocated the irrigation water between different simulation regions and improved water resource allocation for achieving better system performance the present study mainly focuses on crop response to water whereas fertility stress is also an important factor for crop water use and should be considered in future optimization studies some irrigation districts adopt rotation irrigation that might not timely implement optimized irrigation schedule therefore studies should also consider the practical differences between irrigation districts declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

10278,highly efficient irrigation and conservative sowing practices are required at the farm level for sustainable crop production for the purpose a field experiment on autumn potato crop was conducted during the years 2014 15 and 2015 16 to maximize crop water productivity five treatments with two sowing configurations were designed i e ridge sowing under furrow irrigation rf bed sowing under furrow irrigation bf and three drip irrigation treatments for different management allowed depletion mad levels under bed sowing i e irrigation when 20 dir1 35 dir2 and 50 dir3 of the available plant water depleted from the soil results revealed that drip irrigation treatments influenced potato yield p 0 05 the highest yield during both the years were recorded in the control treatment rf measured as 49 65 and 42 55 tons ha 1 respectively the maximum number of total potato tubers m 2 were found in treatment dir2 while control treatment rf was at par of others in terms of marketable tubers the maximum percentage of green 3 81 3 75 rotten 2 95 2 20 damaged 2 10 2 87 and cracked 2 33 1 79 tubers were observed in ridge sowing under furrow irrigation rf during both years of

saving 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of the water resources that link to the production of essential food crops moreover the inaccessibility of freshwater is becoming restraint to agricultural productivity in most areas of the world more than 70 of freshwater is being utilized for farming whereas in pakistan water withdrawal for agricultural use was 94 i e 172 4 109 m3 year 1 in 2008 fao 2008 around 96 billion cubic meter bcm of water is being provided for major crops while the estimated requirement is 122 bcm choudhry et al 2013 according to the water security risk index pakistan ranked 7th in the list of countries facing the risk of water shortage maplecroft 2010 even under such water stressed conditions major irrigation systems i e basin border and furrow irrigation are still in practice in pakistan while these systems have very low application efficiency brouwer et al 1989 estimated field application efficiencies of surface basin border and furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems at 40 60 and 75 respectively while kalwij 1996 disclosed that on farm irrigation efficiency in punjab province of pakistan was 23 70 losses in the furrow irrigation system were found to be 18 22 with a minimum stream size of 30 58 ls 1 shaikh et al 2015 will we ever realize how much we ve wasted our scare water resources pressurized irrigation systems considered better in terms of achieving higher water productivity as drip irrigation systems can achieve an efficiency of more than 90 aamir et al 2012 hussain et al 2018 additionally higher values of fertilizer use efficiencies were also found in the drip irrigation system as compared to the furrow irrigation system asif et al 2016 drip irrigation as compared to surface irrigation methods offers several opportunities in terms of higher yield water and fertilizer use efficiency camp et al 2001 especially for high value crops like vegetables and fruits the use of modern irrigation and improved sowing techniques has significantly improved the production of various high value crops and potato is one of them potato solanum tubersum l has its place in the family of solanaceae herbaceous tuber and an industrial crop this ranks as the 4th major food crop in the world after rice wheat and maize with 388 191 million tons of production on 19 303 million ha area fao 2017 in pakistan potato was grown on an area of 0 177 million ha with 3 978 million tons of production resulting in 22 42 tons ha 1 of yield while in punjab province it was grown on 0 166 million hectares area with 3 811 million tons of production resulting in 23 03 tons ha 1 of yield during the year 2015 16 pakistan statistical yearbook 2016 which is less than the yields of other potato producing countries potato takes a significant place in world agriculture and contains nearly 80 water 2 protein and 18 starch qasim et al 2013 water is the main compound in potato approximately 63 87 w w and contains almost all important amino acids for the human body excluding methionine and cysteine storey 2007 potato is an important vegetable and a part of daily food for almost all the world populace mathur and das 2007 which yields more protein and dry matter ezelie 1999 it is a balanced food containing nourishing quality protein high energy essential minerals and vitamins mehdi et al 2008 therefore in pakistan importance of potato is increasing gradually due to increasing population pressure and balanced nutritional values malik and bashir 1994 potato is being planted on ridges and beds across the world similarly in pakistan it is normally sown on ridges under furrow irrigation method that allows water to infiltrate below the root zone recently sood and singh 2010 and qasim et al 2013 found it beneficial to grow potatoes on beds in terms of yield and water use efficiency similarly the ridge planting method with different geometries has also been studied for enhancing potato quality and yield vitos et al 2013 while hou et al 2010 suggested that a higher yield of potato can be achieved by adopting a drip irrigation system salih et al 2018 also suggested that enhancing irrigation interval delaying irrigation can improve the water use efficiency of the potato crop dahiya 2018 also reported similar findings and concluded that delayed irrigation facilitated deeper rooting and made seedlings drought resistant safdari et al 2018 reported a high grain yield of barley by scheduling irrigation at 30 management allowed depletion mad level moreover better economic production could be achieved by increasing more delay in irrigation as per literature review nattered prior different research studies have been carried out unconnectedly on potato crop to examine the effects of different planting geometries irrigation systems and irrigation levels on potato quality yield and water use efficiency while there has been limited work in the literature to compare the collective effects of different planting geometries and irrigation levels under different irrigation systems with local practice farmer s approach making this study novel and beneficial for potato farmers along with policymakers keeping in view the importance of potato crop based on the literature discussed above increasing demand of consumers and foreign importers the current research work was carried out to test the different planting geometries i e ridge and bed planting and irrigation regimens that fit best in the farm settings of pakistan a comparison was made using farmer practice control i e ridge sowing under furrow irrigation rf with bed sowing under furrow irrigation bf and three irrigation schedules mad levels i e 20 35 and 50 with drip irrigation system the objective of the study was to determine the effects of these treatments on potato yield and growth parameters secondly to enhance the water productivity of potato crop and higher crop returns to the farmers that will ensure food security for the ever growing population of pakistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments on potato were carried out during the winter growing season october march at water management research center university of agriculture faisalabad wmrc uaf punjab pakistan situated at 31 388 ºn 73 011 ºe and 179 57 m altitude during 2014 15 and 2015 16 the topography and climate of the study area were relatively flat and semi arid respectively with 350 mm of average annual rainfall ansari et al 2019 three soil samples each at the depth of 15 cm and 30 cm were taken from each experimental plot and analyzed in soil and water testing laboratory of wmrc uaf to access physico chemical traits of the soil field capacity permanent wilting point and bulk density of the soil were measured as 19 1 8 4

the crop dir3 ridge to ridge distance was maintained at 2 25 ft in ridge furrow planting pattern while top and bottom dimensions of each bed were 2 5 ft and 4 5 ft respectively followed by 2 0 ft wide furrow in bed furrow planting pattern fig 1 each experimental replicated plot was 20 ft 50 ft in dimension and comprising of eight ridges in ridge furrow and four beds in bed furrow sowing pattern there were two rows of potato plants in each bed to ensure equal plant population experimental plots were isolated by 5 0 ft wide ridges to avoid merging or lateral movement of inputs a well designed drip irrigation system was installed at the experimental site using 16 mm diameter lateral lines having built in emitters with an average discharge of 4 l hr emitter coefficients of variation cv

satisfactorily at 16 psi pressure with 0 076 cv and 92 43 eu the irrigation water samples from a skimming tube well were tested and results assure that groundwater was marginally fit for irrigation table 1 the local farmers were consulted regarding irrigation practices before finalizing irrigation scheduling for the control treatment and were done according to the schedules locally opt by the farmers i e plant observation method or feel and appearance of soil soil moisture based irrigation scheduling was done for rest of the treatments that were based on the percentage depletion of plant

achieved and total water application was assessed by accumulating individual volume of irrigations applied for monitoring soil moisture content the gravimetric method g g of soil moisture measurement was performed on daily basis by taking soil samples from the middle of the two plants in each experimental plot the first irrigation was applied four weeks before the land preparation and planting as it allowed annual weeds to germinate post sowing irrigation was also applied for the proper establishment of the crop and both irrigations were not included in total irrigation water calculations other irrigations were applied according to the irrigation scheduling done for each treatment except the control one the control treatment rf received first irrigation after 18 and 19 days after sowing during the first and second sowing years respectively while remaining irrigations were applied depending upon the climatic conditions and growth stage 2 3 crop management practices after complete land preparation i e ploughing and leveling ridge maker and bed planter were used to make designed ridges and beds respectively for the particular treatments recommended dose of fertilizers at the rate of 250 125 150 kg ha 1 as n p2o5 k2o was applied pervez et al 2013 during land preparation the half dose of nitrogen was applied whereas remaining was applied during earthing up potassium and phosphorus were applied at the time of sowing along with 10 kg zinc sulphate to cure zinc deficiency quality of seed is very important for gaining higher yield carr 2012 therefore disease free potato seeds of the prominent red skinned cultivar desiree possessing 2 3 eyes were selected thereafter seeds were sown manually on 19th october 2014 and 29th october 2015 at the top of ridges by maintaining 30 cm distance between the plants in control practice during both the years while in the case of bed sowing the distance between plants and rows were 30 cm and 45 cm respectively however the plant population was the same in each plot the recommended plant protection practices were also carried out including sprays and other traditional practices during the entire growing season at the pre mature growth stage fungicide ridomil gold against blight disease and bifenthrin to avoid pests were also used as per requirement 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 meteorological data meteorological data

square meter area from each replicated plot were tagged properly and growth parameters including the number of tillers plant 1 number of leaves plant 1 and height of plants cm were noted till maturity tubers were harvested on 7th march 2015 and 5th march 2016 in the first and second year respectively potato tubers were categorized into three classes i e non marketable category tuber nonmct having weight 50 g marketable category 1 tuber mc1t between 50 150 g in weight and marketable category 2 tuber mc2t were 150 g in weight the total number of tubers was calculated by adding these three categories and yield in tons ha 1 calculated by adding their weights three samples each of 1 m2 from every single replicated plot were harvested and category wise number of tubers were counted and

final results using statistix software analysis of variance anova gomez et al 1984 was performed with a comparison of means differences between the treatments by applying the lsd test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 meteorological parameters mean monthly metrological parameters are presented in fig 2 for both the years maximum mean monthly temperature was observed during the sowing month i e october for both the years with higher pan evaporation rates in mm while descending trend was observed in temperature up to the month of january likewise parallel trend was seen in the sunshine hours six effective rainfall events occurred in the first year having highest rainfall p i e 14 mm when the crop was near to harvest while during the second year there were four events cumulative effective rainfall was measured at 29 5 mm during the growing season of 2014 15 while 6 9 mm in 2015 16 3 2 plant growth parameters plant leaves are important for photosynthesis the number of leaves plant 1 was statistically significant at p 0 05 during the first and second years while focusing on the interactive effects of the treatments the maximum average number of leaves was found 104 56 and 103 00 in dir2 during both years respectively different planting geometries i e ridge and bed planting under furrow irrigation significantly affect the average number of leaves during both the years similarly the number of leaves plant 1 was not significantly affected by the different delayed irrigation treatments mad levels through drip irrigation system table 2 the number of tillers per plant was statistically significant during both the years respectively at p 0 05 while maximum tillers were found in bed planting under different irrigation methods table 2 whereas bed planting under furrow irrigation bf revealed a higher number of tillers 4 03 4 08 and leaves 97 100 therefore statistically at par with control practice rf for both the years maximum plant height was observed in treatment rf i e 45 67 cm during the second year while results of different treatments table 2 were statistically non significant p 0 05 for both the years the percentage of green rotten and cracked tubers were found statistically significant at p 0 05 as shown in table 2 these parameters were found maximum in treatment rf as compared to bf and other mad level irrigation treatments that yielded tubers with better and healthier physical appearance similarly the maximum percentage of damaged tubers 2 10 2 87 was reported in control practice rf during harvesting for both the years 3 3 tuber yield number of non marketable tuber nnonmct number of marketable category 1 tuber nmc1t number of marketable category 2 tuber nmc2t and the total number of tubers were influenced significantly at p 0 05 by the different treatments during both the years maximum nmc1t 26 33 27 44 were found in control practice rf while data of other treatments presented in table 3 likewise ridge planting under the furrow irrigation system rf was significantly at par with other treatments in terms of nmc2t 6 11 3 00 during both the years the study results revealed that planting method significantly affected the nnonmct at p 0 05 bed planting under both irrigation systems i e furrow and drip irrigation produced the maximum number of non marketable tubers during both the years while the maximum number of nonmct found in different delayed irrigation practices for both the years table 3 the total number of tubers was significantly affected by the different planting methods and mad levels through drip irrigation system during both the years at p 0 05 bed planting under the furrow irrigation method bf surpasses the control practice rf by yielding 62 33 62 78 tubers m 2 during both years respectively and these results agree with the findings of qasim et al 2013 however the results are non significant in different mad level treatments under bed sowing through the drip irrigation system similarly the yield of marketable and non marketable potato tubers was statistically significant at p 0 05 and the maximum yield of mc1t 28 92 26 17 and mc2t 12 21 7 33 in tons ha 1 was found in control practice rf for both the years while the maximum yield of nonmct was observed in different mad level irrigation treatments table 3 different treatments significantly p 0 05 affect the total yield in tons ha 1 and maximum yield for both the years was observed in rf i e 49 65 and 42 55 in tons ha 1 likewise irrigation regimens mad levels with drip irrigation under bed sowing significantly affect the total tuber yield at p 0 05 treatment dir2 was at par with the other mad level treatments during both the years by yielding 35 15 and 36 98 in tons ha 1 respectively table 3 3 4 irrigation water applied total net irrigation depth applied to the crop was 284 mm and 248 mm under rf ridge furrow setting control practice and bf respectively during the first year while in second year it was 273 mm and 222 mm inclusive of effective rainfall further calculations of water used hectare 1 showed that maximum water was applied to rf 4739 89 m3 ha 1 and 4549 37 m3 ha 1 in first and second year respectively fig 3 3 5 water saving and crop water productivity in terms of water saving bed planting under furrow irrigation and different irrigation schedules mad levels were significantly superior to control one rf the maximum volume of irrigation water was saved i e 50 33 and 42 66 in dir3 compared to control practice rf and a similar trend was observed while comparing with bf for both the seasons respectively fig 4 crop water productivity was found to be significantly higher under different mad level treatments maximum water productivity in kg m 3 i e 13 01 and 13 60 was observed in dir2 during the first and second year with savings of 42 99 and 37 88 irrigation water respectively comparative to control practice fig 4 different planting methods under furrow irrigation significantly affect the water productivity at p 0 05 maximum water productivity was observed in treatment bf during both the years and statistically at par with the control practice rf revealing the fact that planting potatoes on beds under furrow irrigation can increase water productivity 4 discussion 4 1 impact of different planting geometries and irrigation schedules on plant growth parameters morphological features and other growth parameters i e plant leaves tillers and height etc of the plants are significant determinants of the overall performance of plants therefore the optimization of such growth parameters has great potential in increasing crop yield mathan et al 2016 while different irrigation levels have a significant impact on plant growth parameters and yield sarker et al 2019 in this study we found that bed planting under furrow irrigation bf showed a higher number of tillers and leaves and statistically at par with control practice rf for both the years table 2 these findings differ with sharma et al 2014 they reported that the number of tillers compound leaves per plant and plant height were influenced significantly by the plant density but not affected by the planting method planting potatoes on beds under furrow irrigation bf was found better than the control practice rf in terms of compound leaves and tillers per plant which may be due to the provision of optimum soil moisture contents and beds geometry while plant height was slightly higher in the ridge furrow rf method but the results were statistically non significant and coincided with the findings of qasim et al 2013 they observed tallest plants in ridge sowing while beds offered the maximum number of tillers plant 1 on the contrary fakhari et al 2013 observed increased plant height and marketable potatoes by applying more irrigation water through drip trickle irrigation system the percentage of green rotten damaged and cracked tubers found higher in ridge furrow rf planting arrangement these results coincide with escobar and vander zaag 1988 they had reported fewer green potatoes in the bed planting method likewise the results are in agreement with the findings of qasim et al 2013 they found wide plain beds superior to ridge furrow planting in terms of a smaller number of green and damaged tubers 4 2 numbers and yield of potato tubers influenced by different treatments improving crop yield is considered vital for meeting increasing global food demands potato plays a significant role in food security in south asian countries while optimal use of irrigation water results in higher yield and improved quality of potato tubers sarker et al 2019 the amount timing and method of irrigation water are considered imperative for healthier plant growth parameters and yield of potato crop ati et al 2012 in the present study results revealed that nnonmct nmc1t nmc2t and the total number of tubers m 2 were significantly influenced by the different planting geometries and irrigation strategies table 3 control practice rf was at par with other treatments in terms of total marketable tubers nmc1t nmc2t while comparing the interactive effect of the treatments likewise different planting methods under furrow irrigation significantly affect the number of marketable tubers as maximum marketable tubers were found in the control practice rf these findings were similar to that of patel and patel 1993 these results revealed the fact that planting potatoes on beds under furrow irrigation and delayed irrigation practices mad levels through the drip irrigation system adversely affect the size of tubers this might be due to the inadequate availability of optimum moisture during the bulking stage these findings are consistent with sharma et al 2014 they found the maximum number and yield of mini tubers when planted on flat beds with different planting densities in this study different planting methods and mad levels through the drip irrigation system significantly influence the total number of potato tubers table 3 depicted that planting potatoes on beds under the furrow irrigation system bf yielded more tubers m 2 than ridge furrow plating pattern rf these results are in line with the findings of qasim et al 2013 they have reported the maximum number of potato tubers under bed sowing arrangement in the same way results revealed that planting potatoes on beds under a drip irrigation system yielded higher nonmct tubers while the total number of tubers was non significantly affected by different mad level treatments during both growing seasons i e 2014 15 and 2015 16 hence the increased number of tubers might be achieved due to the proper settings of mad level and optimum availability of soil moisture in bed planting geometry the maximum yield of marketable tubers was found in ridge furrow setting rf for both the years whereas the maximum yield of nonmct was observed in bf and other different mad level treatments under bed plating geometry this finding corresponds with patel and patel 1993 they observed significantly higher yield of smaller size potatoes nonmct in bed sowing while the overall potato crop yield significantly affected by the different planting geometries and irrigation strategies maximum crop yield was observed in control practice rf for both the years revealing the fact that potato crop yield significantly influenced by different planting methods under the furrow irrigation system these study findings are in consistence with ahuja et al 2014 they found higher tuber yield under ridge furrow planting as compared to bed furrow planting in north western plains of india under subtropical climate kahlon and khera 2015 also reported the higher tuber yield with increase in irrigation level moreover planting potatoes on beds under a drip irrigation system with different mad levels hit the potato yield treatment dir2 was superior to other irrigation regimens during both the years this might be due to the fact that this treatment dir2 had received optimum soil moisture and well scheduled at required time irrigation the lower marketable tuber yield was observed in different mad level treatments under the drip irrigation system that might be due to the scarce nutrients and moisture stress perceived by the plants during the bulking stage but in these treatments the total number of tubers were higher hence in future best nutrient management practices are required that could be the cause of higher marketable tuber s yield by increasing the size of tubers these results are also supported by the findings of abubaker et al 2014 they found that both excess and deficit water had adverse effects on yield similarly kashyap and panda 2003 also reported that increasing the mad level from 45 to 75 can significantly affect potato yield and other growth parameters therefore fewer yields observed in treatment dir3 might be due to the delayed availability of irrigation 4 3 irrigation crop water productivity and water saving irrigation water scarcity in the southern region of asia has now restraint the crop production during the dry periods murad et al 2018 islam et al 2019 water saving irrigation practices i e drip or sprinkler irrigation system are being opt progressively in the regions where water resources for irrigation purposes are inadequate and these approaches are considered vital in increasing crop yield and water productivity kang et al 2004 kumar et al 2009 ati et al 2012 the fundamental goal of irrigation practices at the farm level is to harvest maximum production per unit of consumed water and this can only be attained by adopting a suitable irrigation scheme zhang et al 2008 potatoes are mostly considered as one of the higher water consumption crops pereira and shock 2006 with seasonal etcrop ranging 350 625 mm pruitt 1984 in this study maximum irrigation water in m3 ha 1 was consumed by the control practice rf while on the contrary different mad level schedules through the drip irrigation system consumed less volume of irrigation water irrigation requirement was found to be higher at the end of the mid growth stage which was higher than that of other growth stages it reflects that water demand by the crop also depends on the growth stage wang et al 2011 the frequency of irrigation is another key factor for the production of tubers the maximum frequency of irrigation was in dir1 fig 3 therefore these results were contrary to the findings of wang et al 2006 they reported higher yield with increasing frequency of drip irrigation revealing the fact that both higher and lower irrigation frequencies can adversely affect the crop yield therefore optimum frequency and well scheduled irrigation might be an additional factor of yield increase in dir2 as compared to other drip irrigation treatments maximum savings in irrigation water was observed in bed planting arrangement under different irrigation methods than the ridge furrow practice rf hence irrigation water can be saved mainly through suitable application method improved timing and by applying the required depth of irrigation crop water productivity also conversant as crop water use efficiency is the crop yield per unit water consumption sarker et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 sivamani et al 2000 also calculated the water use efficiency as total dry mass produced divided by total irrigation water used the concept of water productivity mainly focuses at more crop per drop and increasing water productivity of potato crop is an important concern worldwide water productivity can be enhanced either through same production using less amount of water or more production using the same amount of water eq 4 delayed irrigation techniques applying irrigation when fixed percentage of asw consumed by the crop are reported as the favorable one to save irrigation water with improved water productivity or water use efficiency without significant reduction in potato yield in this study the water productivity of potato crop ranged from 9 35 to 13 60 kg m 3 fig 4 while previous research studies have reported the range of potato crop water productivity from 9 to 25 kg m 3 in different environments li et al 2007 ahmadi et al 2010 jovanovic et al 2010 planting potatoes on beds under both irrigation systems i e furrow and drip irrigation system exhibited enhanced water productivity kg m 3 with ample savings of irrigation water comparative to ridge furrow sowing rf practice maximum water productivity 13 01 13 60 kg m 3 during both the years was observed at 35 mad level dir2 while islam et al 1990 observed maximum yield 22 3 t ha 1 and wue 8 1 kg m 3 of potato crop at 40 depletion of asw similar findings were also reported by ierna and mauromicale 2018 ati et al 2012 and badr et al 2012 they found an increase in water productivity with deficit irrigation treatments and higher water consumption by furrows irrigation as compared to the drip system kahlon and khera 2015 observed considerably higher water productivity under drip irrigated beds while erdem et al 2006 also reported the improved water productivity values in drip irrigated treatments compared to the furrow irrigated ones agronomic practices also play a significant role in improving water productivity and this could be amplified from 25 to 40 using better agronomic practices hatfield et al 2001 ierna and mauromicale 2018 from the findings of this study and the above discussion it can be concluded that delayed irrigation practices and bed planting has the potential to improve different plant growth parameters number of potato tubers moreover delayed irrigation practices can enhance water productivity of potato crop as compared to full irrigation and significant savings in irrigation depth can also be made 5 conclusions crop water productivity and savings in irrigation water can be improved through delayed irrigation practices however this approach could affect yield and other plant growth parameters as we go beyond the optimum irrigation level nowadays agricultural productivity severely affected due to the alarming situation of water scarcity and inaccessibility of freshwater major irrigation methods i e basin border and furrow irrigation are still practiced even under such stressed conditions therefore there is need of the day to shift our irrigation and sowing practices from conventional to efficient methods that will enhance agricultural output as the research results have demonstrated that bed planting under furrow irrigation and under different mad levels through drip irrigation were superior to control practice in terms of plant growth parameters moreover the maximum number of green rotten damaged and cracked tubers were found in control practice rf control practice was at par with other treatments in terms of marketable tubers category 1 and category 2 and the total crop yield however the maximum number of total potato tubers was recorded in bed sowing under different irrigation methods and schedules the amount of irrigation water applied was maximum in rf causing a drop in crop water productivity while significant amount of water was saved through different drip irrigation treatments resulting in maximum water productivity therefore planting potatoes on beds under furrow irrigation and optimum mad level i e 35 of asw through drip system is recommended for potato crop because such practices dir2 gave higher number of tubers saved a significant amount of water 42 99 37 88 and improved crop water productivity 13 01 13 60 in kg m 3 in the current scenarios of water scarcity and yield barriers effective irrigation and sowing strategies are considered vital for improving agricultural productivity the finding of this study has some implications the study revealed the importance and impact of planting geometries and delayed irrigation practices on potato crop yield and water productivity moreover it offers notable guidelines for water managers and potato growers in valuable cultivation of potato crop additionally in order to enhance crop water productivity potato growers need to adopt proficient sowing and irrigation practices however apart from these findings there are some future research suggestions additional research on nutrients management is needed to transform non marketable tubers into marketable ones in bed planting method under different irrigation methods i e furrow and drip irrigation which will ultimately pave new ways to maximize the yield of the potato crop furthermore the current study should be replicated in a different environment or country to enhance the generalizability of the outcomes declaration of competing interest the authors

the first and second year of experiment respectively in conclusion bed planting under furrow and drip irrigation treatments proved superior to control practice rf in terms of water saving water productivity total number of tubers and different other plant growth parameters however further studies on nutrient management are recommended for the bulking of non marketable tubers in bed planting

saving 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of the water resources that link to the production of essential food crops moreover the inaccessibility of freshwater is becoming restraint to agricultural productivity in most areas of the world more than 70 of freshwater is being utilized for farming whereas in pakistan water withdrawal for agricultural use was 94 i e 172 4 109 m3 year 1 in 2008 fao 2008 around 96 billion cubic meter bcm of water is being provided for major crops while the estimated requirement is 122 bcm choudhry et al 2013 according to the water security risk index pakistan ranked 7th in the list of countries facing the risk of water shortage maplecroft 2010 even under such water stressed conditions major irrigation systems i e basin border and furrow irrigation are still in practice in pakistan while these systems have very low application efficiency brouwer et al 1989 estimated field application efficiencies of surface basin border and furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems at 40 60 and 75 respectively while kalwij 1996 disclosed that on farm irrigation efficiency in punjab province of pakistan was 23 70 losses in the furrow irrigation system were found to be 18 22 with a minimum stream size of 30 58 ls 1 shaikh et al 2015 will we ever realize how much we ve wasted our scare water resources pressurized irrigation systems considered better in terms of achieving higher water productivity as drip irrigation systems can achieve an efficiency of more than 90 aamir et al 2012 hussain et al 2018 additionally higher values of fertilizer use efficiencies were also found in the drip irrigation system as compared to the furrow irrigation system asif et al 2016 drip irrigation as compared to surface irrigation methods offers several opportunities in terms of higher yield water and fertilizer use efficiency camp et al 2001 especially for high value crops like vegetables and fruits the use of modern irrigation and improved sowing techniques has significantly improved the production of various high value crops and potato is one of them potato solanum tubersum l has its place in the family of solanaceae herbaceous tuber and an industrial crop this ranks as the 4th major food crop in the world after rice wheat and maize with 388 191 million tons of production on 19 303 million ha area fao 2017 in pakistan potato was grown on an area of 0 177 million ha with 3 978 million tons of production resulting in 22 42 tons ha 1 of yield while in punjab province it was grown on 0 166 million hectares area with 3 811 million tons of production resulting in 23 03 tons ha 1 of yield during the year 2015 16 pakistan statistical yearbook 2016 which is less than the yields of other potato producing countries potato takes a significant place in world agriculture and contains nearly 80 water 2 protein and 18 starch qasim et al 2013 water is the main compound in potato approximately 63 87 w w and contains almost all important amino acids for the human body excluding methionine and cysteine storey 2007 potato is an important vegetable and a part of daily food for almost all the world populace mathur and das 2007 which yields more protein and dry matter ezelie 1999 it is a balanced food containing nourishing quality protein high energy essential minerals and vitamins mehdi et al 2008 therefore in pakistan importance of potato is increasing gradually due to increasing population pressure and balanced nutritional values malik and bashir 1994 potato is being planted on ridges and beds across the world similarly in pakistan it is normally sown on ridges under furrow irrigation method that allows water to infiltrate below the root zone recently sood and singh 2010 and qasim et al 2013 found it beneficial to grow potatoes on beds in terms of yield and water use efficiency similarly the ridge planting method with different geometries has also been studied for enhancing potato quality and yield vitos et al 2013 while hou et al 2010 suggested that a higher yield of potato can be achieved by adopting a drip irrigation system salih et al 2018 also suggested that enhancing irrigation interval delaying irrigation can improve the water use efficiency of the potato crop dahiya 2018 also reported similar findings and concluded that delayed irrigation facilitated deeper rooting and made seedlings drought resistant safdari et al 2018 reported a high grain yield of barley by scheduling irrigation at 30 management allowed depletion mad level moreover better economic production could be achieved by increasing more delay in irrigation as per literature review nattered prior different research studies have been carried out unconnectedly on potato crop to examine the effects of different planting geometries irrigation systems and irrigation levels on potato quality yield and water use efficiency while there has been limited work in the literature to compare the collective effects of different planting geometries and irrigation levels under different irrigation systems with local practice farmer s approach making this study novel and beneficial for potato farmers along with policymakers keeping in view the importance of potato crop based on the literature discussed above increasing demand of consumers and foreign importers the current research work was carried out to test the different planting geometries i e ridge and bed planting and irrigation regimens that fit best in the farm settings of pakistan a comparison was made using farmer practice control i e ridge sowing under furrow irrigation rf with bed sowing under furrow irrigation bf and three irrigation schedules mad levels i e 20 35 and 50 with drip irrigation system the objective of the study was to determine the effects of these treatments on potato yield and growth parameters secondly to enhance the water productivity of potato crop and higher crop returns to the farmers that will ensure food security for the ever growing population of pakistan 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments on potato were carried out during the winter growing season october march at water management research center university of agriculture faisalabad wmrc uaf punjab pakistan situated at 31 388 ºn 73 011 ºe and 179 57 m altitude during 2014 15 and 2015 16 the topography and climate of the study area were relatively flat and semi arid respectively with 350 mm of average annual rainfall ansari et al 2019 three soil samples each at the depth of 15 cm and 30 cm were taken from each experimental plot and analyzed in soil and water testing laboratory of wmrc uaf to access physico chemical traits of the soil field capacity permanent wilting point and bulk density of the soil were measured as 19 1 8 4 and 1 55 g cm 3 respectively while the texture of soil was sandy loam 2 2 experimental design and irrigation scheduling the experiments were conducted in randomized complete block design rcbd and

the crop dir3 ridge to ridge distance was maintained at 2 25 ft in ridge furrow planting pattern while top and bottom dimensions of each bed were 2 5 ft and 4 5 ft respectively followed by 2 0 ft wide furrow in bed furrow planting pattern fig 1 each experimental replicated plot was 20 ft 50 ft in dimension and comprising of eight ridges in ridge furrow and four beds in bed furrow sowing pattern there were two rows of potato plants in each bed to ensure equal plant population experimental plots were isolated by 5 0 ft wide ridges to avoid merging or lateral movement of inputs a well designed drip irrigation system was installed at the experimental site using 16 mm diameter lateral lines having built in emitters with an average discharge of 4 l hr emitter coefficients of variation cv according to asif et al 2015 and emission uniformity eu according to keller and karmeli 1974 were determined for performance evaluation of the drip irrigation system for the purpose three emitters at the start mid and endpoint catch can method on three random laterals were selected for discharge measurement at varying pressures i e 12 14 16 18 and 20 psi the results support that system was working satisfactorily at 16 psi pressure with 0 076 cv and 92 43 eu the irrigation water samples from a skimming tube well were tested and results assure that groundwater was marginally fit for irrigation table 1 the local farmers were consulted regarding irrigation practices before finalizing irrigation scheduling for the control treatment and were done according to the schedules locally opt by the farmers i e plant observation method or feel and appearance of soil soil moisture based irrigation scheduling was done for rest of the treatments that were based on the percentage depletion of plant asw mad levels in the root zone and was estimated as follows eq 1 according to martin et al 1990 1 mad 100 1 n 1 n fc i θ i fc i wp where n is the number of sub divisions of the effective rooting

achieved and total water application was assessed by accumulating individual volume of irrigations applied for monitoring soil moisture content the gravimetric method g g of soil moisture measurement was performed on daily basis by taking soil samples from the middle of the two plants in each experimental plot the first irrigation was applied four weeks before the land preparation and planting as it allowed annual weeds to germinate post sowing irrigation was also applied for the proper establishment of the crop and both irrigations were not included in total irrigation water calculations other irrigations were applied according to the irrigation scheduling done for each treatment except the control one the control treatment rf received first irrigation after 18 and 19 days after sowing during the first and second sowing years respectively while remaining irrigations were applied depending upon the climatic conditions and growth stage 2 3 crop management practices after complete land preparation i e ploughing and leveling ridge maker and bed planter were used to make designed ridges and beds respectively for the particular treatments recommended dose of fertilizers at the rate of 250 125 150 kg ha 1 as n p2o5 k2o was applied pervez et al 2013 during land preparation the half dose of nitrogen was applied whereas remaining was applied during earthing up potassium and phosphorus were applied at the time of sowing along with 10 kg zinc sulphate to cure zinc deficiency quality of seed is very important for gaining higher yield carr 2012 therefore disease free potato seeds of the prominent red skinned cultivar desiree possessing 2 3 eyes were selected thereafter seeds were sown manually on 19th october 2014 and 29th october 2015 at the top of ridges by maintaining 30 cm distance between the plants in control practice during both the years while in the case of bed sowing the distance between plants and rows were 30 cm and 45 cm respectively however the plant population was the same in each plot the recommended plant protection practices were also carried out including sprays and other traditional practices during the entire growing season at the pre mature growth stage fungicide ridomil gold against blight disease and bifenthrin to avoid pests were also used as per requirement 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 meteorological data meteorological data

square meter area from each replicated plot were tagged properly and growth parameters including the number of tillers plant 1 number of leaves plant 1 and height of plants cm were noted till maturity tubers were harvested on 7th march 2015 and 5th march 2016 in the first and second year respectively potato tubers were categorized into three classes i e non marketable category tuber nonmct having weight 50 g marketable category 1 tuber mc1t between 50 150 g in weight and marketable category 2 tuber mc2t were 150 g in weight the total number of tubers was calculated by adding these three categories and yield in tons ha 1 calculated by adding their weights three samples each of 1 m2 from every single replicated plot were harvested and category wise number of tubers were counted and

final results using statistix software analysis of variance anova gomez et al 1984 was performed with a comparison of means differences between the treatments by applying the lsd test at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 meteorological parameters mean monthly metrological parameters are presented in fig 2 for both the years maximum mean monthly temperature was observed during the sowing month i e october for both the years with higher pan evaporation rates in mm while descending trend was observed in temperature up to the month of january likewise parallel trend was seen in the sunshine hours six effective rainfall events occurred in the first year having highest rainfall p i e 14 mm when the crop was near to harvest while during the second year there were four events cumulative effective rainfall was measured at 29 5 mm during the growing season of 2014 15 while 6 9 mm in 2015 16 3 2 plant growth parameters plant leaves are important for photosynthesis the number of leaves plant 1 was statistically significant at p 0 05 during the first and second years while focusing on the interactive effects of the treatments the maximum average number of leaves was found 104 56 and 103 00 in dir2 during both years respectively different planting geometries i e ridge and bed planting under furrow irrigation significantly affect the average number of leaves during both the years similarly the number of leaves plant 1 was not significantly affected by the different delayed irrigation treatments mad levels through drip irrigation system table 2 the number of tillers per plant was statistically significant during both the years respectively at p 0 05 while maximum tillers were found in bed planting under different irrigation methods table 2 whereas bed planting under furrow irrigation bf revealed a higher number of tillers 4 03 4 08 and leaves 97 100 therefore statistically at par with control practice rf for both the years maximum plant height was observed in treatment rf i e 45 67 cm during the second year while results of different treatments table 2 were statistically non significant p 0 05 for both the years the percentage of green rotten and cracked tubers were found statistically significant at p 0 05 as shown in table 2 these parameters were found maximum in treatment rf as compared to bf and other mad level irrigation treatments that yielded tubers with better and healthier physical appearance similarly the maximum percentage of damaged tubers 2 10 2 87 was reported in control practice rf during harvesting for both the years 3 3 tuber yield number of non marketable tuber nnonmct number of marketable category 1 tuber nmc1t number of marketable category 2 tuber nmc2t and the total number of tubers were influenced significantly at p 0 05 by the different treatments during both the years maximum nmc1t 26 33 27 44 were found in control practice rf while data of other treatments presented in table 3 likewise ridge planting under the furrow irrigation system rf was significantly at par with other treatments in terms of nmc2t 6 11 3 00 during both the years the study results revealed that planting method significantly affected the nnonmct at p 0 05 bed planting under both irrigation systems i e furrow and drip irrigation produced the maximum number of non marketable tubers during both the years while the maximum number of nonmct found in different delayed irrigation practices for both the years table 3 the total number of tubers was significantly affected by the different planting methods and mad levels through drip irrigation system during both the years at p 0 05 bed planting under the furrow irrigation method bf surpasses the control practice rf by yielding 62 33 62 78 tubers m 2 during both years respectively and these results agree with the findings of qasim et al 2013 however the results are non significant in different mad level treatments under bed sowing through the drip irrigation system similarly the yield of marketable and non marketable potato tubers was statistically significant at p 0 05 and the maximum yield of mc1t 28 92 26 17 and mc2t 12 21 7 33 in tons ha 1 was found in control practice rf for both the years while the maximum yield of nonmct was observed in different mad level irrigation treatments table 3 different treatments significantly p 0 05 affect the total yield in tons ha 1 and maximum yield for both the years was observed in rf i e 49 65 and 42 55 in tons ha 1 likewise irrigation regimens mad levels with drip irrigation under bed sowing significantly affect the total tuber yield at p 0 05 treatment dir2 was at par with the other mad level treatments during both the years by yielding 35 15 and 36 98 in tons ha 1 respectively table 3 3 4 irrigation water applied total net irrigation depth applied to the crop was 284 mm and 248 mm under rf ridge furrow setting control practice and bf respectively during the first year while in second year it was 273 mm and 222 mm inclusive of effective rainfall further calculations of water used hectare 1 showed that maximum water was applied to rf 4739 89 m3 ha 1 and 4549 37 m3 ha 1 in first and second year respectively fig 3 3 5 water saving and crop water productivity in terms of water saving bed planting under furrow irrigation and different irrigation schedules mad levels were significantly superior to control one rf the maximum volume of irrigation water was saved i e 50 33 and 42 66 in dir3 compared to control practice rf and a similar trend was observed while comparing with bf for both the seasons respectively fig 4 crop water productivity was found to be significantly higher under different mad level treatments maximum water productivity in kg m 3 i e 13 01 and 13 60 was observed in dir2 during the first and second year with savings of 42 99 and 37 88 irrigation water respectively comparative to control practice fig 4 different planting methods under furrow irrigation significantly affect the water productivity at p 0 05 maximum water productivity was observed in treatment bf during both the years and statistically at par with the control practice rf revealing the fact that planting potatoes on beds under furrow irrigation can increase water productivity 4 discussion 4 1 impact of different planting geometries and irrigation schedules on plant growth parameters morphological features and other growth parameters i e plant leaves tillers and height etc of the plants are significant determinants of the overall performance of plants therefore the optimization of such growth parameters has great potential in increasing crop yield mathan et al 2016 while different irrigation levels have a significant impact on plant growth parameters and yield sarker et al 2019 in this study we found that bed planting under furrow irrigation bf showed a higher number of tillers and leaves and statistically at par with control practice rf for both the years table 2 these findings differ with sharma et al 2014 they reported that the number of tillers compound leaves per plant and plant height were influenced significantly by the plant density but not affected by the planting method planting potatoes on beds under furrow irrigation bf was found better than the control practice rf in terms of compound leaves and tillers per plant which may be due to the provision of optimum soil moisture contents and beds geometry while plant height was slightly higher in the ridge furrow rf method but the results were statistically non significant and coincided with the findings of qasim et al 2013 they observed tallest plants in ridge sowing while beds offered the maximum number of tillers plant 1 on the contrary fakhari et al 2013 observed increased plant height and marketable potatoes by applying more irrigation water through drip trickle irrigation system the percentage of green rotten damaged and cracked tubers found higher in ridge furrow rf planting arrangement these results coincide with escobar and vander zaag 1988 they had reported fewer green potatoes in the bed planting method likewise the results are in agreement with the findings of qasim et al 2013 they found wide plain beds superior to ridge furrow planting in terms of a smaller number of green and damaged tubers 4 2 numbers and yield of potato tubers influenced by different treatments improving crop yield is considered vital for meeting increasing global food demands potato plays a significant role in food security in south asian countries while optimal use of irrigation water results in higher yield and improved quality of potato tubers sarker et al 2019 the amount timing and method of irrigation water are considered imperative for healthier plant growth parameters and yield of potato crop ati et al 2012 in the present study results revealed that nnonmct nmc1t nmc2t and the total number of tubers m 2 were significantly influenced by the different planting geometries and irrigation strategies table 3 control practice rf was at par with other treatments in terms of total marketable tubers nmc1t nmc2t while comparing the interactive effect of the treatments likewise different planting methods under furrow irrigation significantly affect the number of marketable tubers as maximum marketable tubers were found in the control practice rf these findings were similar to that of patel and patel 1993 these results revealed the fact that planting potatoes on beds under furrow irrigation and delayed irrigation practices mad levels through the drip irrigation system adversely affect the size of tubers this might be due to the inadequate availability of optimum moisture during the bulking stage these findings are consistent with sharma et al 2014 they found the maximum number and yield of mini tubers when planted on flat beds with different planting densities in this study different planting methods and mad levels through the drip irrigation system significantly influence the total number of potato tubers table 3 depicted that planting potatoes on beds under the furrow irrigation system bf yielded more tubers m 2 than ridge furrow plating pattern rf these results are in line with the findings of qasim et al 2013 they have reported the maximum number of potato tubers under bed sowing arrangement in the same way results revealed that planting potatoes on beds under a drip irrigation system yielded higher nonmct tubers while the total number of tubers was non significantly affected by different mad level treatments during both growing seasons i e 2014 15 and 2015 16 hence the increased number of tubers might be achieved due to the proper settings of mad level and optimum availability of soil moisture in bed planting geometry the maximum yield of marketable tubers was found in ridge furrow setting rf for both the years whereas the maximum yield of nonmct was observed in bf and other different mad level treatments under bed plating geometry this finding corresponds with patel and patel 1993 they observed significantly higher yield of smaller size potatoes nonmct in bed sowing while the overall potato crop yield significantly affected by the different planting geometries and irrigation strategies maximum crop yield was observed in control practice rf for both the years revealing the fact that potato crop yield significantly influenced by different planting methods under the furrow irrigation system these study findings are in consistence with ahuja et al 2014 they found higher tuber yield under ridge furrow planting as compared to bed furrow planting in north western plains of india under subtropical climate kahlon and khera 2015 also reported the higher tuber yield with increase in irrigation level moreover planting potatoes on beds under a drip irrigation system with different mad levels hit the potato yield treatment dir2 was superior to other irrigation regimens during both the years this might be due to the fact that this treatment dir2 had received optimum soil moisture and well scheduled at required time irrigation the lower marketable tuber yield was observed in different mad level treatments under the drip irrigation system that might be due to the scarce nutrients and moisture stress perceived by the plants during the bulking stage but in these treatments the total number of tubers were higher hence in future best nutrient management practices are required that could be the cause of higher marketable tuber s yield by increasing the size of tubers these results are also supported by the findings of abubaker et al 2014 they found that both excess and deficit water had adverse effects on yield similarly kashyap and panda 2003 also reported that increasing the mad level from 45 to 75 can significantly affect potato yield and other growth parameters therefore fewer yields observed in treatment dir3 might be due to the delayed availability of irrigation 4 3 irrigation crop water

irrigation practices i e drip or sprinkler irrigation system are being opt progressively in the regions where water resources for irrigation purposes are inadequate and these approaches are considered vital in increasing crop yield and water productivity kang et al 2004 kumar et al 2009 ati et al 2012 the fundamental goal of irrigation practices at the farm level is to harvest maximum production per unit of consumed water and this can only be attained by adopting a suitable irrigation scheme zhang et al 2008 potatoes are mostly considered as one of the higher water consumption crops pereira and shock 2006 with seasonal etcrop ranging 350 625 mm pruitt 1984 in this study maximum irrigation water in m3 ha 1 was consumed by the control practice rf while on the contrary different mad level schedules through the drip irrigation system consumed less volume of irrigation water irrigation requirement was found to be higher at the end of the mid growth stage which was higher than that of other growth stages it reflects that water demand by the crop also depends on the growth stage wang et al 2011 the frequency of irrigation is another key factor for the production of tubers the maximum frequency of irrigation was in dir1 fig 3 therefore these results were contrary to the findings of wang et al 2006 they reported higher yield with increasing frequency of drip irrigation revealing the fact that both higher and lower irrigation frequencies can adversely affect the crop yield therefore optimum frequency and well scheduled irrigation might be an additional factor of yield increase in dir2 as compared to other drip irrigation treatments maximum savings in irrigation water was observed in bed planting arrangement under different irrigation methods than the ridge furrow practice rf hence irrigation water can be saved mainly through suitable application method improved timing and by applying the required depth of irrigation crop water productivity also conversant as crop water use efficiency is the crop yield per unit water consumption sarker et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 sivamani et al 2000 also calculated the water use efficiency as total dry mass produced divided by total irrigation water used the concept of water productivity mainly focuses at more crop per drop and increasing water productivity of potato crop is an important concern worldwide water productivity can be enhanced either through same production using less amount of water or more production using the same amount of water eq 4 delayed irrigation techniques applying irrigation when fixed percentage of asw consumed by the crop are reported as the favorable one to save irrigation water with improved water productivity or water use efficiency without significant reduction in potato yield in this study the water productivity of potato crop ranged from 9 35 to 13 60 kg m 3 fig 4 while previous research studies have reported the range of potato crop water productivity from 9 to 25 kg m 3 in different environments li et al 2007 ahmadi et al 2010 jovanovic et al 2010 planting potatoes on beds under both irrigation systems i e furrow and drip irrigation system exhibited enhanced water productivity kg m 3 with ample savings of irrigation water comparative to ridge furrow sowing rf practice maximum water productivity 13 01 13 60 kg m 3 during both the years was observed at 35 mad level dir2 while islam et al 1990 observed maximum yield 22 3 t ha 1 and wue 8 1 kg m 3 of potato crop at 40 depletion of asw similar findings were also reported by ierna and mauromicale 2018 ati et al 2012 and badr et al 2012 they found an increase in water productivity with deficit irrigation treatments and higher water consumption by furrows irrigation as compared to the drip system kahlon and khera 2015 observed considerably higher water productivity under drip irrigated beds while erdem et al 2006 also reported the improved water productivity values in drip irrigated treatments compared to the furrow irrigated ones agronomic practices also play a significant role in improving water productivity and this could be amplified from 25 to 40 using better agronomic practices hatfield et al 2001 ierna and mauromicale 2018 from the findings of this study and the above discussion it can be concluded that delayed irrigation practices and bed planting has the potential to improve different plant growth parameters number of potato tubers moreover delayed irrigation practices can enhance water productivity of potato crop as compared to full irrigation and significant savings in irrigation depth can also be made 5 conclusions crop water productivity and savings in irrigation water can be improved through delayed irrigation practices however this approach could affect yield and other plant growth parameters as we go beyond the optimum irrigation level nowadays agricultural productivity severely affected due to the alarming situation of water scarcity and inaccessibility of freshwater major irrigation methods i e basin border and furrow irrigation are still practiced even under such stressed conditions therefore there is need of the day to shift our irrigation and sowing practices from conventional to efficient methods that will enhance agricultural output as the research results have demonstrated that bed planting under furrow irrigation and under different mad levels through drip irrigation were superior to control practice in terms of plant growth parameters moreover the maximum number of green rotten damaged and cracked tubers were found in control practice rf control practice was at par with other treatments in terms of marketable tubers category 1 and category 2 and the total crop yield however the maximum number of total potato tubers was recorded in bed sowing under different irrigation methods and schedules the amount of irrigation water applied was maximum in rf causing a drop in crop water productivity while significant amount of water was saved through different drip irrigation treatments resulting in maximum water productivity therefore planting potatoes on beds under furrow irrigation and optimum mad level i e 35 of asw through drip system is recommended for potato crop because such practices dir2 gave higher number of tubers saved a significant amount of water 42 99 37 88 and improved crop water productivity 13 01 13 60 in kg m 3 in the current scenarios of water scarcity and yield barriers effective irrigation and sowing strategies are considered vital for improving agricultural productivity the finding of this study has some implications the study revealed the importance and impact of planting geometries and delayed irrigation practices on potato crop yield and water productivity moreover it offers notable guidelines for water managers and potato growers in valuable cultivation of potato crop additionally in order to enhance crop water productivity potato growers need to adopt proficient sowing and irrigation practices however apart from these findings there are some future research suggestions additional research on nutrients management is needed to transform non marketable tubers into marketable ones in bed planting method under different irrigation methods i e furrow and drip irrigation which will ultimately pave new ways to maximize the yield of the

10279,profits from olive oil production are expected to benefit from regulated deficit irrigation rdi regimes designed to optimize yield and oil quality with minimal inputs of water we evaluated a number of potential strategies for implementing rdi including choosing phenological periods for reduced irrigation use of midday stem water potential swp for scheduling considering fruit load and irrigation to reach optimal fruit water content at harvest we base our discussion on the potentials and challenges of practical commercial rdi regimes on results from a 6 year orchard experiment on two olive oil cultivars used in intensive orchards barnea and askal in israel focusing on attempts for long tern optimization of yield and oil quality results showed a general trend of increased water productivity as a function of reduced irrigation but since yields tended to be reduced when irrigation was decreased there was not a clear benefit of rdi over sustained deficit irrigation the exception to this was a treatment based on swp where water application was reduced by some 40 compared to irrigation regimes bringing highest yields and a non significant accumulated yield reduction of less than 15 after 6 years in both cultivars oil quality measured in terms of free fatty acids and polyphenol content was often improved when irrigation was decreased with no dependence on the seasonal timing of deficit amounts and increased tree water stress keywords rdi olea europaea stem water potential pit hardening fruit load irrigation scheduling 1 introduction irrigated olives olea europaea l often are found to yield 3 4 times more than rain fed orchards in typical traditional growing areas lavee et al 1990 irrigation by itself obviously reduces water stress and subsequently increases tree and orchard productivity ben gal et al 2011b and increases the tree s capacity for mineral nutrient uptake zipori et al 2015 irrigation additionally allows movement of olive production into dry areas and intensification of orchard management including nutrient application via the irrigation system introduction of vigorous high yielding varieties bred to respond to water densely spaced trees and mechanized harvesting because of the importance of oil quality and a tendency for quality parameters to benefit from conditions causing water stress to the trees ben gal et al 2011a dag et al 2008 2015 optimization of irrigation of oil olives depends on maintaining at least some level of water deficit in previous work it was found that a sustained 70 80 supply of potential crop evapotranspiration etp throughout the whole irrigation season optimized yield and quality over time in a mature olive cv barnea and souri orchard in israel ben gal et al 2011a 2011b olives are biennial bearers with typical 2 year cycles with a high fruit load following a season with low fruit load lavee 2007 in israel such cycles are particularly drastic and depending on actual conditions and cultivar yields in on years can be 2 3 times those of off years dag et al 2009 response to irrigation in such cases was found to be sensitive to fruit load with high yielding years effected more strongly by the same relative water stress ben gal et al 2011b naor et al 2012 at least part of the explanation to such lies in the high need for assimilates from photosynthesis when fruit is a prominent sink and a tree s failure to trigger and process water saving mechanisms like stomatal closure which otherwise would be activated under conditions of limiting water bustan et al 2011 in a controlled lysimeter study trees with medium to high fruit yield were shown to consume 20 30 more water on a per canopy area basis compared to trees with little to no fruit bustan et al 2016 the stress measured as decreasing stem water potential swp was found to be consistently less in the first months of irrigation each year following winter rains and increased swp becoming more negative with time over the season until olive fruits were harvested swp in on years was typically 20 30 lower than in off years swp in may in the israeli studies was around 0 8 mpa in off years and 1 1 mpa in on years in july the values decreased to 1 7 mpa and 2 3 mpa and in september the swp readings were around 2 3 and 3 0 in off and on years respectively ben gal et al 2011b regulated deficit irrigation rdi exploits phenological stages in annual tree physiology allowing much lower water application than supplying full crop evapotranspiration demand during times when the stress has no or minimal effect on yields fereres and soriano 2006 in olive fruit pit hardening occurring over a 4 5 week period in the summer is believed to be such a stage where water stress has little or no influence on production over time gucci et al 2009 olive irrigation with rdi strategies has been reported previously particularly in spain and italy fernández et al 2013 and gómez del campo 2013 each evaluated rdi strategies on super high density arbequina olives in spain and both concluded that moderate di during july and august end of pit hardening were best for water savings in this way fernández et al 2013 showed water savings of 72 and yield decreases of 26 while gómez del campo 2013 saved 27 in water with a 15 decrease in oil production gucci et al 2019 evaluated rdi before or during harvesting on frantoio olives in italy and did not find advantages to either over full irrigation as both reduced water use and yield equivalently from the literature it seems therefore that deficit irrigation di strategies while succeeding to reduce water applied as irrigation are generally accompanied by yield reductions often are beneficial to oil quality and only sometimes increase water productivity similar results were found in attempts to schedule rdi based on midday stem water potential swp in experiments conducted in two locations in spain on cornicabra and morisca olives moriana et al 2012 evaluation of these studies must consider that the full irrigation regimes used to compare the rdi strategies vary from location to location none of these studies considered or adjusted for fruit load we hypothesized that deficit irrigation inducing stress in olives during fruit pit hardening would increase water productivity yield per applied irrigation volume without significantly decreasing oil yield or quality we additionally hypothesized that shifting timing and extent of deficit irrigation according to expected needs as a function of fruit load would add to the benefit based on these hypotheses our objective was to significantly reduce water application and increase water productivity and profit without corresponding yield reductions and without compromising oil quality this was evaluated by treatments including pre scheduled rdi regimes and a regime where irrigation was applied according to set points based on stem water potential measurements we present results of a 6 year field experiment conducted in israel and discuss them in terms of choice of periods for rdi success of rdi over sustained di use of swp for scheduling choice and use of thresholds fruit load considerations irrigation to reach optimal fruit water content at harvest and optimizing yield and oil quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 orchard and general management description the research was conducted on barnea and askal olive cultivars in a two hectare section of a 4 year old at onset of treatments commercial olive orchard with general upkeep and horticultural activities in accordance with accepted local commercial practice tree density was 7 m between rows and 4 m between trees in the rows 350 trees ha the orchard was located 31 78 n 34 82 e adjacent to revadim in the foothills of the judean hills in israel the soil of the orchard was a clay vertisol sand 20 clay 65 the experimental site has a typical mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and mild winters with annual precipitation averaging 500 mm falling exclusively from october until april and concentrated over november march irrigation began each season 3 4 weeks following the last significant more than 30 mm rainfall event in the spring and ended following rainfall of at least 40 mm within a week in the autumn annual rainfall irrigation seasonal start and finish dates and seasonal amounts are given in table 1 patterns of rainfall and reference et et0 are illustrated in fig 1 actual daily irrigation i was computed by 1 i etp irrlev 100 etp et 0 fc where etp is potential evapotranspiration irrlev is the level of irrigation for the different treatments and fc is a cover factor estimated by midday shaded area the irrlev fraction found in fig 2 for the various treatments is equivalent to a crop factor kc as found in fao crop water consumption methods allen et al 1998 the cover factor fc was estimated as 40 in 2012 and 60 from 2013 to 2018 frequency of irrigation events was twice weekly on sundays and wednesdays irrigation was via a single line of pressure compensated drippers uniram netafim hatzerim israel with flow rate of 1 6 l h spaced every 50 cm statistical design was a randomized block with five replicates per treatment the two cultivars were in separate adjacent fields each of the 25 experimental units consisted of three adjacent tree rows with at least 5 olive trees per row two of the three central trees of each cultivar were monitored while those surrounding them served as border guard trees the orchard was irrigated with effluent that originating as municipal wastewater in the city of jerusalem underwent secondary activated sludge treatment and was stored in a nearby reservoir nitrogen and potassium fertilizer was given with irrigation water as recommended by the local extension service equally to all treatments according to area based calculations including consideration of nutrients originating in the recycled wastewater erel et al 2019 seasonally a total of 200 kg nitrogen 22 kg phosphorous and 205 kg potassium including that originating in the water and that added as fertilizer were applied per hectare the effluent was low in salts and had no other characteristic expected to influence plant performance typical characteristics of the irrigation water have been previously published erel et al 2019 zipori et al 2015 2 2 irrigation treatments we applied a number of configurations of rdi treatments on two olive cultivars barnea and askal over 6 and 1 2 years initial season plus 3 potential biennial bearing cycles both are relatively new israeli cultivars bred for intensive irrigated cultivation lavee et al 2003 the treatments outlined in fig 2 included t1 a control with sustained regulated irrigation of 80 calculated crop et t2 rdi with irrigation reduced to 50 etp during the period leading up to and into pit hardening june july with no consideration of fruit yield t3 rdi with treatment identical to t2 in on years and the deficit period shifted to pit hardening and after in off years july august t4 rdi treatment with 40 supply of etp in the first half of the irrigation season beginning of annual irrigation through july in on years and 40 supply during pit hardening july august in off years and t5 a rdi treatment based on stem water potential thresholds each treatment for each cultivar was irrigated via an independently automated valve and main line including water meter and fertilizer pump and meter pit hardening beginning and end were determined by manual observations following first order estimations based on historical average data fig 2 the target swp levels for t5 were adapted from results from a previous experiment ben gal et al 2011b in on years target swp was 1 5 mpa from initiation of irrigation through may 3 0 mpa from may through july and 2 5 mpa in august september in off years the swp target was 2 5 mpa until the end of june and 3 5 mpa during july august swp in t5 was measured twice a week once the day before and once the day after an irrigation event and target values were set to be averages of these measurements determination of whether each cultivar was in an on or off year was made following fruit set each year based on visual observations table 1 all treatments other than the control were irrigated at the end of the season from the first week of september until harvest according to fruit water content aiming for 50 55 water in fruit arriving to the olive mill this fruit water content is thought to be optimum for commercial mill operation zipori et al 2016 following harvest irrigation continued at a rate of 40 etp until the first significant 40 mm rainfall event 2 3 measurements sampling and analyses plant water status was assessed by swp using a scholander type pressure chamber mrc israel according to shackel et al 1997 in treatments t1 t4 swp was measured three times a year early may mid season during pit hardening july and late august september actual dates of swp measurements were 28 may 23 july and 01 sept 2013 13 may 22 july and 26 august 2014 26 may 07 july and 11 aug 2015 31 may 02 aug and 30 aug 2016 16 may 11 july and 07 sept 2017 and 06 june 11 july and 29 aug 2018 vegetative growth rate was measured by annual measurement of trunk circumference at a marked point 40 cm above the ground on each tree each march beginning each season in august fruit water content was determined weekly before harvest by sampling 10 representative fruits from around the circumference of each measured tree at 2 2 5 m height and weighing before and after drying in an oven at 70 ºc yield was determined for each monitored tree a representative sample of 2 kg of fruit from each tree was analyzed cold pressed virgin oil was obtained with an abencor system mc2 ingenieria y sistemas seville spain as described by ben david et al 2010 oil and water percentage of harvested fruit was measured in olive paste by near infrared nir measurement naor et al 2012 zipori et al 2016 using olivescan foss denmark equipment calibrated with 3000 samples with soxhlet zipori et al 2016 water productivity was calculated as kg oil per

treatments tukey kramer was used for means separation all statistical analyzes were conducted at p 0 05 3 results annual status of bearing winter precipitation irrigation season dates and harvest dates are shown in table 1 for both cultivars observations of fruit load status indicated more on compared to off years barnea trees were determined to be on in three consecutive years from 2012 to 2014 and askal to be on from 2013 to 2015 in each of the last 4 years of the experiment the cultivars had opposite bearing level status table 1 the beginning and end of irrigation seasons were determined by winter rainfall particularly first and last effective more than 30 mm rain events fig 1 with irrigation starting between the end of march and beginning of may and ending between the beginning of october and end of november table 1 annual irrigation amounts for the control treatments t1 ranged from 446 to 557 mm for barnea and 417 493 for askal fig 3 since askal trees are harvested early in order to avoid problematic levels of free fatty acids in the oil their irrigation continued for quite some time following harvest harvest of barnea trees more typically coincided with first substantial winter rains and the end of seasonal irrigation deficit treatments applied less water the least amounts of water were consistently given to t5 the swp triggered treatment with annual amounts ranging from 96 to 336 mm barnea and 199 331 mm askal total 7 year irrigation application amounts table 2 for t1 reached 3243 mm for barnea and 2955 mm for askal the deficit treatments in barnea reduced this total water applied by 15 t2 17 t3 24 t4 and 47 t5 for askal the reductions were 14 t2 15 t3 25 t4 and 41 t5 3 1 vegetative growth trunk size increased each year with larger increases in off years and smaller increases in on years fig 4 average trunk circumference increased in barnea trees by 3 3 cm in off years and 6 3 cm in on years for askal trees the increase was 3 3 and 6 1 cm in off and on years respectively no effect of deficit irrigation treatment was found on trunk size for the first 4 years of the experiment a non significant tendency for reduced growth as a function of reduced irrigation water application appeared thereafter this tendency was stronger in barnea than askal trees between 2012 and the end of the experiment in the beginning of 2019 trunk circumference increased by up to 37 2 cm in barnea and 34 5 cm in askal table 2 while the differences to other treatments were not significant the lowest rates of trunk growth were found for the t5 treatments with 32 7 cm for barnea and 30 9 cm for askal 3 2 stem water potential stem water potential was highest less negative early in the season and lower during pit hardening and before harvest in the late summer table 3 average for all treatments swp measured for barnea trees in may was 2 mpa in july 3 mpa and in august september 2 8 mpa for askal trees the average swp was 1 82 mpa in may 3 29 mpa in july and 3 25 mpa in august september autumn and post harvest found increase in swp data not shown treatments of rdi were less evident in the early season and became more significant in july swp measured during pit hardening periods each year was consistently highest for t1 intermediate for t2 and t3 and t4 and lowest for t5 that sometimes reached values as low as 4 mpa differences between t1 and t5 for barnea averaged 1 mpa with t1 at 2 6 mpa and t5 at 3 4 mpa table 3 equivalent data from askal trees was 2 9 mpa for t1 and 3 8 mpa for t5 no significant differences were found between on and off years regarding the trends of measured swp and no significant effect of t3 which considered bearing level in its rdi strategy was found compared to t2 which did not treatment t4 with a more drastic deficit irrigation level often had significantly lower swp in july barnea and july and september askal 3 3 treatment t5 stem water potential patterns and target values are shown for the three final seasons 2016 2018 of the experiment fig 5 data from all 6 year of the experiment can be found in supplementary material fig s1 actual values followed the target values fig 2 with variations of between 1 and 5 mpa above the thresholds on days after irrigation and below the threshold on days prior to irrigation early in the season each year trees in off years were not irrigated as they took time to reach their target swp values also in interim periods when swp targets were lowered the trees had periods when they were not irrigated 3 4 fruit water content two way anova supplemental material table s1 of all the fruit water content at harvest data table 4 indicated significance of both year and treatment p 0 0001 for barnea and of year but not treatment for askal there was significant interaction between year and treatment for both cultivars barnea p 0 001 askal p 0 0035 barnea fruit which was harvested later in each season than the askal fruit reached the oil mill with relatively high percentage of water often higher than the targeted 50 55 table 4 average fruit water content at harvest for barnea was significantly higher for t1 compared to t2 t4 and t5 while t2 was not significantly different than any of the other treatments the askal fruit was often below the target level of 50 55 water at harvest evaluation of each year reveals that fruit water at harvest was consistently highest in t1 and lowest in t5 with the other treatments falling in between but this was not always significant table 4 askal fruit had significantly lower water content in t5 compared to t1 in 2012 and in t5 compared to t1 t2 and t3 in 2016 the other treatments were not significantly different than either t1 or t5 in those years for barnea fruit the trend of lower water content at harvest as a function of lower irrigation application level was significant in 2015 2016 and 2017 3 5 yields fruit yields of barnea trees fig 6 ranged from 60 kg tree in on years 2014 2016 and 2018 to 30 kg tree in off years 2013 2015 and 2017 two way anova for barnea fresh fruit yield indicated significant p 0 0001 differences between years but not for treatments and with no interaction supplementary table s1 fruit yields of askal trees fig 6 were also significantly influenced by only year p 0 0001 with no interaction between year and treatment yields for askal were greater 40 kg tree in the on years 2013 2015 and 2017 and lower 20 25 kg tree in the off years 2014 2016 and 2018 note that the bearing status was miss diagnosed at the beginning of the season in 2013 for barnea and in 2014 for askal when they were characterized as on in spite of ultimately having relatively low yields over the course of the experiment non significant non consistent trends of reduced yield as a function of reduced water application due to rdi strategies were found fig 6 average barnea fruit yield ranged from 20 to 40 kg tree 7 14 t ha in off years to 40 75 kg tree 14 26 t ha in on years yield of askal tended to be lower 10 30 kg tree 3 5 10 5 t ha in off years and 30 45 kg tree 10 5 16 t ha in on years fig 6 cumulative fruit yield table 2 summed for the last 6 years of the experiment from 2013 until 2018 ranged from 306 kg tree for t1 in barnea and 205 206 kg tree for t1 and t2 in askal to 244 kg tree for barnea t4 and 265 kg tree for t5 and 192 187 and 191 kg tree for t3 t4 and t5 respectively for askal 3 5 1 fruit oil content the general two way anova model indicated significance between years p 0 0001 but not treatments for oil content in fruit for both cultivars and no interaction between treatment and year fig 7 supplementary table s1 oil content in fruit as percentage of fresh weight tended to increase as a function of decreased annual irrigation increase water stress fig 7 no effect of bearing level was found on fruit oil percentage measured in paste in the mill fruit from askal typically reached between 24 and 29 oil based on nir and from barnea between 17 and 25 for barnea in some years differences between percent oil content in t1 and t5 were strongly significant with t5 having as much as 5 more oil in fruit in askal such differences were less drastic with t5 typically having 1 2 more oil per fresh weight than t1 and with the exception of the 2017 season when while fruit oil content in all treatments was low but t1 and t3 had only 18 oil while t5 had greater than 22 reflecting the contrasting trends of greater fruit yield and lower fruit oil percentage differences in cumulative oil yield table 2 summed for the last 6 years of the experiment from 2013 until 2018 were not statistically significant between the treatments total oil yield for the 6 years ranged from 20 t1 t2 to 18 t4 t ha for barnea and 17 t1 t2 to 15 t ha t3 for askal 3 6 oil quality 3 6 1 free fatty acids two way anova indicated significance of year p 0 0001 but not treatment and no interaction between them for free fatty acid in oil for both cultivars supplementary table s1 no significant differences were found in oil free fatty acid percentage as a function of treatment in any of the individual years in spite of that after the first 3 years free fatty acid percentage in oil from barnea fruit was consistently higher in t1 and lower in treatments with greater deficit irrigation regimes fig 8 from 2015 onwards treatment t5 tended to have the lowest free fatty acid level a similar trend was found for askal in the off years 2016 and 2018 noticeable are years 2015 and 2018 for barnea 2018 for askal when t1 fatty acid levels were above the 0 8 standard for extra virgin olive oil while rdi treatments and especially t5 were under the threshold 3 6 2 polyphenols both treatment and year were found to be significant factors p 0 0001 influencing oil polyphenol content fig 9 for both barnea and askal supplementary table s1 no interaction was found between year and treatment for either cultivar average polyphenols for askal were significantly highest in t5 oil 490 mg kg oil second highest in t4 oil 372 mg kg oil and lower in t1 279 mg kg t2 327 mg kg and t3 307 mg kg which were not significantly different one from another polyphenol content of the produced oil tended to increase as a function of decreased applied irrigation water starting in 2013 the first full season of treatments polyphenol content varied from season to season and ranged from 7 lower 2014 to 150 higher 2015 in t5 compared to t1 for barnea similar trends were found for askal with polyphenols 6 lower in t5 than t1 in 2012 but 30 385 higher in all subsequent years average polyphenol content was 250 mg kg for t1 t2 and t3 337 for t4 and 372 mg kg for t5 for barnea and between 260 and 320 for t1 t3 342 for t4 and 487 for t5 for askal in 2016 and 2018 both off years polyphenols in oil from the askal trees were significantly higher in t5 than in all of the other treatments 3 7 water productivity productivity of irrigation water calculated as kg oil per cubic meter of water irrigated fig 10 was obviously greater for treatments where decreases in irrigation were greater than consequential decreases in yields with an overall trend of increased productivity as a function of decreased irrigation amount in some of the years productivity of t5 was significantly greater than most of the other treatments in any given year water productivity ranged from under 0 5 to more than 1 5 kg oil m3 with obvious higher productivity in on compared to off years total 6 year water productivity fig 10 ranged from 0 68 to 0 78 kg oil m3 in barnea for treatments 1 4 with no significant difference while t5 was 1 28 kg oil m3 and significantly greater similarly askal had a non significant range of water productivity of 0 6 0 76 kg oil m3 water for treatments 1 4 and significantly higher 1 05 kg oil m3 in t5 fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 absolute values of yields the values measured for yields in the current experiment table 2 fig 6 were high average commercial yields of both fruit and oil are expected to be some 20 30 lower than those presented here we believe that there are several explanations for this first yield was measured only on pre determined trees in choosing the measured trees exceptional individuals particular small or low bearing trees were avoided the yield from measured trees was harvested and weighed individually per tree with little expected losses or missed fruit oil yield was calculated by multiplying fruit yield by percent oil in fruit oil in fruit was determined using nir a method that measures total oil while commercial mills typically recover only around 85 of the total the yields for fruit and oil therefore should be taken as high end potential rather than actual commercial quantities and best referred to relatively per treatment 4 2 choice of periods for rdi a number of phenological stages have been identified as potential for strategies for reduced irrigation with no or minimal negative effect on olive oil yield or quality we chose to evaluate regulated deficit irrigation in the early spring as water availability in soil following winter rains is relatively high and during the mid summer pit hardening period considered less sensitive to water stress similar rdi strategies with combinations of stress levels given in the spring with onset of irrigation and during pit hardening in the summer were found to also not effect yield significantly and to therefore increase water productivity in a sister experiment in jordan on nabali baladi and nabali muhasan olive trees naoum et al 2016 under typical mediterranean and middle eastern conditions the soil in olive orchards tends to have substantial tree available water in the springtime following winter rains this was particularly true for the case study reported here where the local soil was heavy and could hold large amounts of water this on one hand supports the claim that little if any irrigation is needed during this period while on the other hand limits the potential for significant water savings certainly there is major importance in determination of when irrigation should be initiated each spring in the current study the t5 treatment based on swp trigger values fig 5 indicated that common practice tends to begin irrigation earlier than necessary and to over irrigate olives in the first month or more of the season depending of course on the extent and pattern of the previous winter s rainfall trentacoste et al 2019 found that rdi in spring was effective in saving water and reducing undesirable vegetative growth in super intensive hedgerow cv arbosana olives in argentina lavee et al 2007 tested seven rdi strategies in israel on muhasan olives and found the most efficient irrigation schedule was based on withholding water application until the end of endocarp pit hardening applying all the annual water from that stage until 2 weeks prior to harvest they found 4 year reduction of yield relative to full irrigation of 12 5 oil with 50 savings in water fernández et al 2013 practiced rdi from late june to late august in that study midday swp fell to between 2 and 3 5 mpa when irrigation was reduced to 60 and 3 and 4 5 mpa when reduced further to 30 of full irrigation total yield after three experimental years was reduced 25 30 by the rdi treatments with no differences between them water productivity was 2 5 kg oil ha 1 per mm for full irrigation 2 8 for the 30 treatment and 6 4 for the 60 treatment 4 3 success or not of rdi over di we ask the question does rdi actually have advantage over or difference from sustained di regimes there have been few studies comparing di to rdi directly and these are inconsistent in their findings iniesta et al 2009 in a study in cordoba southern spain on arbequina olives compared sustained di to rdi with midsummer july 1 to september 10 15 without irrigation both treatments were around 25 of calculated full et needs and received the same total annual irrigation during stress period swp fell to below 2 mpa for di and 3 mpa for rdi oil yield was reduced for both treatments compared to full control irrigation by around 20 but no differences were found between them moriana et al 2003 had an rdi treatment where swp decreased to 7 mpa in summer during the deficit while sustained di of same annual deficit decreased only to 3 8 mpa in order to evaluate if rdi had added benefit compared to full season sustained di we compare results from the current experiment with previously published data from di studies in fig 11 water production curves are shown based on a di trial on barnea olives located in the same area as the current study ben gal et al 2011a and on the 2003 experiment on picual olives by moriana et al 2003 in spain where both di and rdi treatments were studied ben gal et al 2011a found a curve with reduced yields when irrigation water was less than fully satisfying potential et requirements moriana et al 2003 suggested a single response curve for both di and rdi treatments suggesting no added benefit for rdi as both treatments reduced yields by 15 20 the curve from moriana et al 2003 was similar to ben gal et al 2011a but steeper larger response to relative decreases in applied water they published a best fit curve for their oil yield data where yield 2 78 0 11 et 0 0006 10 3 et2 the data from the current study for the most part follow the previously published response curves with decreased seasonal water application leading to decreased yields with the exception of t5 which had clearly greater water productivity 4 4 use of swp for scheduling in the current study the swp guided irrigation treatment based on dynamic thresholds ranging from 1 5 to 2 5 mpa in the spring in on and off years respectively reduced to 3 to 3 5 mpa on and off years during pit hardening and increasing back to 2 5 mpa later in the season during the oil accumulation stage fig 2 these target set points were based on measurements in a previous experiment ben gal et al 2011a 2011b where seasonal swp measurements in well irrigated treatments followed a pattern ranging from 1 5 mpa in the spring to 2 5 mpa pre harvest in september each year and where di treatments had swp values of 3 to 3 5 mpa during it hardening as mentioned already this treatment consistently led to the least amount of applied irrigation water and the greatest water productivity and was the only treatment suggesting true advantage of rdi over di fig 11 midday stem water potential used for evaluating water status and scheduling irrigation was reported previously moriana et al 2012 moriana et al 2012 evaluated swp in two locations in spain based on thresholds of 2 mpa for di while full irrigation maintained from 1 2 mpa to 1 4 mpa from pit hardening the di treatment led to 70 80 reduction in irrigation reduced vegetative growth and around 15 reduction in fruit yield contrary to our current study there was significant rainfall during the irrigation seasons in the moriana et al 2012 trial ahumada orellana et al 2017 evaluated swp thresholds for irrigation in a super high density arbequina orchard in chile they compared thresholds of 1 4 2 2 mpa considered full irrigation to treatments initiating irrigation at swp thresholds of 3 4 4 5 and 6 mpa after irrigation was triggered all treatments were irrigated at 100 level a threshold for irrigation initiation of 3 4 mpa did not affect yield while saving 20 25 water threshold of 4 5 mpa saved 24 40 water with decrease of 30 in fruit yield while 6 mpa threshold saved 30 45 water at a cost of 40 decreased yield it is not at all clear in the current study if the chosen threshold values were optimal or if the differences in thresholds between on and off years contributed to their success while the treatment and its results are of great interest the large cost particularly in labor to conduct them is expected to be prohibitive for many commercial operations certainly more work is needed to fine tune the ultimate threshold values for best results including evaluation of other cultivars and environments we suggest that better alternatives could be developed either to build crop factor reference et rdi protocols based on the results of this and other studies or to find a proxy for the manual pressure bomb based measurements possibly using continuous measurements of swp itself dixon and tyree 1984 meron et al 2015 or some other water status sensitive plant based sensor method ben gal et al 2010 possible methods are sap flow sensors or dendrometers although they have not proven effective in monitoring olive trees to date carr 2013 and thermal based crops water stress indices from remote imaging or proximal sensing agam et al 2013 4 5 identifying and managing fruit load fruit load has been successfully identified as a driver for olive tree water status and transpiration ben gal et al 2011b showed minimum seasonal stem water in on compared to off barnea and souri trees for a large range of deficit irrigation levels as well as for well watered trees with swp values as much as 0 5 mpa lower in on trees in may and as much as 1 mpa lower in september bustan et al 2016 quantified as much as 30 greater tree scale transpiration of barnea trees as a function of fruit load when comparing loaded to low load or fruitless trees naor et al 2012 studied interactions between irrigation during oil accumulation and fruit yield of koroneiki olives by irrigating according to varied swp thresholds oil yield was practically unaffected by irrigation rate at low crop loads but significantly increased with increased irrigation at high crop loads moriana et al 2003 considered fruit load by applying full irrigation during bearing on years and no irrigation at all rainfed in off years this strategy was found undesirable as the alternate year irrigation decreased yields by 25 in their 3 year experiment in the current study while we were confident in the logic behind the treatments with differential rdi strategies between high and low load years we were often challenged in correctly defining on vs off years in the springtime while treatments were based on binary on or off situations in many of the years the actual load levels fell somewhere in between fig 6 furthermore flowering level is not always correlated to final yield especially when unfavorable climatic conditions occur during flowering and harm the fruit set our results ended up showing little or no benefit to changing irrigation practice according to fruit load likely due to this issue that said compared to the preliminary study under the same environment as in the current experiment ben gal et al 2011a water status measured as minimum swp were much more similar even when comparing high and low yield trees and years table 3 this may be due to the differential rdi treatments but may also be due to less extreme fruit load conditions 4 6 irrigation to reach optimal fruit water content at harvest in the current study we attempted to use measurements of fruit water content in order to direct end of season irrigation such as to reach the olive mill at optimum status in order to promote mill efficiency and oil quality and to avoid early ripening due to water stress table 4 the approach has additional logic and potential value based on strong established relationships between tree water status and fruit water content fernandes et al 2018 the strategy was practically challenged by a number of issues first the method for determining water content was time consuming sampling weighing drying and re weighing took between 4 and 7 days to supply results second response of fruit water content to changes in irrigation were slow taking sometimes up to 2 weeks to be quantified this combination meant that the technique had low sensitivity and limited effectiveness what more there appeared to be disconnect between water content values measured from the sampling process and those determined on samples from harvest this could be due to lack of representation of the chosen representative fruit taken from one certain height from the ground around the tree s circumference compared to actual averaged samples of all fruit from the entire tree commercial measurements of water in fruit based on large volume samples and water content evaluation using nir on olive paste after milling would expedite the method the approach could become even more practical in the future following successful development of sensors for accurate and rapid determination of fruit water in the field trapani et al 2017 4 7 optimizing yield and oil quality total polyphenols and oxidative stability decrease with increased irrigation while free acidity increases we found profound improvement in oil quality as a function of lowered seasonal irrigation figs 8 and 9 this is not surprising as prior studies have indicated the same including for barnea koroneiki and souri ben gal et al 2011a dag et al 2008 2015 the connection between water stress and higher polyphenols is well established artajo et al 2006 suggested that the water status of trees affects phenol production in olive fruit and consequently the phenol content of the olive paste and oil they and others tovar et al 2002 indicate that water stress triggers augmented phenol synthesis the phenomenon where acidity is decreased under increased water stress is less evident in the literature and may be dependent on climate and cultivar since studies reporting the response tend to be based in regions outside of the traditional center of olive production in southwestern europe berenguer et al 2006 dag et al 2008 2015 ghrab et al 2014 toplu et al 2009 of interest in the current study s results is that the timing of stress did not seem to have effect on its influence on oil quality even treatments where stress was mostly felt by trees early in the season and when the last several months prior to harvest were irrigated at minimal deficit levels the positive effects on oil quality measured by increased polyphenols and decreased free fatty acid content were evident 5 conclusions regulated deficit irrigation of olives in which commercial irrigation application levels were reduced 30 40 alternatively during springtime april june or mid summer pit hardening led to reductions in accumulated multi seasonal water application by 15 25 the rdi treatments had a non significant trend of reduced yield as a function of reduced applied irrigation water with yields decreased up to 12 compared to the control treatment furthermore quality parameters were consistently improved under the rdi treatments in both cultivars an attempt to consider alternate bearing and shift rdi treatment periods accordingly did not appear to be beneficial as long term water savings yields and water productivity were unchanged we believe that while fruit load is obviously important to water requirements and response to water stress identification of actual bearing level and matching irrigation levels prove to be hard to achieve or at least need to be determined only after fruit set around the end of may attempts to irrigate according to pre set target values of swp did significantly increase water productivity as accumulated water applied was reduced by 40 and yield decreased by less than 15 non significantly over the 6 years of the experiment choice of optimal swp threshold needs further study including its universality across environments and cultivars while swp based irrigation scheduling seems to be effective in driving rdi its high labor demand and cost make its practicality in commercial olive orchards questionable we therefore hope for and await reliable proxies based on continuous or remote sensing of traits related to tree water status end of season irrigation designed to bring fruit to oil mills with optimal water concentration was also found to be less than successful this due to an overly long response time both for measuring fruit water content and for the measure to respond to changes in irrigation in situ sensing of fruit water could improve this method oil quality measured in terms of decreased fatty acids and increased polyphenols was improved by reductions in applied irrigation water with no dependence on when the reductions occurred over the irrigation season we understand that we were looking for marginal benefits of sometime nuanced differences in water application strategies we still believe that such investigation for subtle increases in water productivity can be important to profitability of irrigated olives particularly as oil prices decrease and water becomes more valuable while much of our results regarding superiority of rdi were not significant we believe that the discussion of them and the potential and challenges in applying them have value it appears that rdi can indeed be more beneficial than sustained di as seen in our experiment s results regarding the treatment t5 where swp was used to guide irrigation those results indicate that irrigation levels during deficit periods in spring and during pit hardening could be significantly lower than those chosen in the study regardless of whether they are a product of swp measurements or more simple adaptation as

10279,profits from olive oil production are expected to benefit from regulated deficit irrigation rdi regimes designed to optimize yield and oil quality with minimal inputs of water we evaluated a number of potential strategies for implementing rdi including choosing phenological periods for reduced irrigation use of midday stem water potential swp for scheduling considering fruit load and irrigation to reach optimal fruit water content at harvest we base our discussion on the potentials and challenges of practical commercial rdi regimes on results from a 6 year orchard experiment on two olive oil cultivars used in intensive orchards barnea and askal in israel focusing on attempts for long tern optimization of yield and oil quality results showed a general trend of increased water productivity as a function of reduced irrigation but since yields tended to be reduced when irrigation was decreased there was not a clear benefit of rdi over sustained deficit irrigation the exception to this was a treatment based on swp where water application was reduced by some 40 compared to irrigation regimes bringing highest yields and a non significant accumulated yield reduction of less than 15 after 6 years in both cultivars oil quality measured in terms of free fatty acids and polyphenol content was often improved when irrigation was decreased with no dependence on the seasonal timing of deficit amounts and increased tree water stress keywords rdi olea europaea stem water potential pit hardening fruit load irrigation scheduling 1 introduction irrigated olives olea europaea l often are found to yield 3 4 times more than rain fed orchards in typical traditional growing areas lavee et al 1990 irrigation by itself obviously reduces water stress and subsequently increases tree and orchard productivity ben gal et al 2011b and increases the tree s capacity for mineral nutrient uptake zipori et al 2015 irrigation additionally allows movement of olive production into dry areas and intensification of orchard management including nutrient application via the irrigation system introduction of vigorous high yielding varieties bred to respond to water densely spaced trees and mechanized harvesting because of the importance of oil quality and a tendency for quality parameters to benefit from conditions causing water stress to the trees ben gal et al 2011a dag et al 2008 2015 optimization of irrigation of oil olives depends on maintaining at least some level of water deficit in previous work it was found that a sustained 70 80 supply of potential crop evapotranspiration etp throughout the whole irrigation season optimized yield and quality over time in a mature olive cv barnea and souri orchard in israel ben gal et al 2011a 2011b olives are biennial bearers with typical 2 year cycles with a high fruit load following a season with low fruit load lavee 2007 in israel such cycles are particularly drastic and depending on actual conditions and cultivar yields in on years can be 2 3 times those of off years dag et al 2009 response to irrigation in such cases was found to be sensitive to fruit load with high yielding years effected more strongly by the same relative water stress ben gal et al 2011b naor et al 2012 at least part of the explanation to such lies in the high need for assimilates from photosynthesis when fruit is a prominent sink and a tree s failure to trigger and process water saving mechanisms like stomatal closure which otherwise would be activated under conditions of limiting water bustan et al 2011 in a controlled lysimeter study trees with medium to high fruit yield were shown to consume 20 30 more water on a per canopy area basis compared to trees with little to no fruit bustan et al 2016 the stress measured as decreasing stem water potential swp was found to be consistently less in the first months of irrigation each year following winter rains and increased swp becoming more negative with time over the season until olive fruits were harvested swp in on years was typically 20 30 lower than in off years swp in may in the israeli studies was around 0 8 mpa in off years and 1 1 mpa in on years in july the values decreased to 1 7 mpa and 2 3 mpa and in september the swp readings were around 2 3 and 3 0 in off and on years respectively ben gal et al 2011b regulated deficit irrigation rdi exploits phenological stages in annual tree physiology allowing much lower water application than supplying full crop evapotranspiration demand during times when the stress has no or minimal effect on yields fereres and soriano 2006 in olive fruit pit hardening occurring over a 4 5 week period in the summer is believed to be such a stage where water stress has little or no influence on production over time gucci et al 2009 olive irrigation with rdi strategies has been reported previously particularly in spain and italy fernández et al 2013 and gómez del campo 2013 each evaluated rdi strategies on super high density arbequina olives in spain and both concluded that moderate di during july and august end of pit hardening were best for water savings in this way fernández et al 2013 showed water savings of 72 and yield decreases of 26 while gómez del campo 2013 saved 27 in water with a 15 decrease in oil production gucci et al 2019 evaluated rdi before or during harvesting on frantoio olives in italy and did not find advantages to either over full irrigation as both reduced water use and yield equivalently from the literature it seems therefore that deficit irrigation di strategies while succeeding to reduce water applied as irrigation are generally accompanied by yield reductions often are beneficial to oil quality and only sometimes increase water productivity similar results were found in attempts to schedule rdi based on midday stem water potential swp in experiments conducted in two locations in spain on cornicabra and morisca olives moriana et al 2012 evaluation of these studies must consider that the full irrigation regimes used to compare the rdi strategies vary from location to location none of these studies considered or adjusted for fruit load we hypothesized that deficit irrigation inducing stress in olives during fruit pit hardening would increase water productivity yield per applied irrigation volume without significantly decreasing oil yield or quality we additionally hypothesized that shifting timing and extent of deficit irrigation according to expected needs as a function of fruit load would add to the benefit based on these hypotheses our objective was to significantly reduce water application and increase water productivity and profit without corresponding yield reductions and without compromising oil quality this was evaluated by treatments including pre scheduled rdi regimes and a regime where irrigation was applied according to set points based on stem water potential measurements we present results of a 6 year field experiment conducted in israel and discuss them in terms of choice of periods for rdi success of rdi over sustained di use of swp for scheduling choice and use of thresholds fruit load considerations irrigation to reach optimal fruit water content at harvest and optimizing yield and oil quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 orchard and general management description the research was conducted on barnea and askal olive cultivars in a two hectare section of a 4 year old at onset of treatments commercial olive orchard with general upkeep and horticultural activities in accordance with accepted local commercial practice tree density was 7 m between rows and 4 m between trees in the rows 350 trees ha the orchard was located 31 78 n 34 82 e adjacent to revadim in the foothills of the judean hills in israel the soil of the orchard was a clay vertisol sand 20 clay 65 the experimental site has a typical mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and mild winters with annual precipitation averaging 500 mm falling exclusively from october until april and concentrated over november march irrigation began each season 3 4 weeks following the last significant more than 30 mm rainfall event in the spring and ended following rainfall of at least 40 mm within a week in the autumn annual rainfall irrigation seasonal start and finish dates and seasonal amounts are given in table 1 patterns of rainfall and reference et et0 are illustrated in fig 1 actual daily irrigation i was computed by 1 i etp irrlev 100 etp et 0 fc where etp is potential evapotranspiration irrlev is the level of irrigation for the different treatments and fc is a cover factor estimated by midday shaded area the irrlev fraction found in fig 2 for the various treatments is equivalent to a crop factor kc as found in fao crop water consumption methods allen et al 1998 the cover factor fc was estimated as 40 in 2012 and 60 from 2013 to 2018 frequency of irrigation events was twice weekly on sundays and wednesdays irrigation was via a single line of pressure compensated drippers uniram netafim hatzerim israel with flow rate of 1 6 l h spaced every 50 cm statistical design was a randomized block with five replicates per treatment the two cultivars were in separate adjacent fields each of the 25 experimental units consisted of three adjacent tree rows with at least 5 olive trees per row two of the three central trees of each cultivar were monitored while those surrounding them served as border guard trees the orchard was irrigated with effluent that originating as municipal wastewater in the city of jerusalem underwent secondary activated sludge treatment and was stored in a nearby reservoir nitrogen and potassium fertilizer was given with irrigation water as recommended by the local extension service equally to all treatments according to area based calculations including consideration of nutrients originating in the recycled wastewater erel et al 2019 seasonally a total of 200 kg nitrogen 22 kg phosphorous and 205 kg potassium including that originating in the water and that added as fertilizer were applied per hectare the effluent was low in salts and had no other characteristic expected to influence plant performance typical characteristics of the irrigation water have been previously published erel et al 2019 zipori et al 2015 2 2 irrigation treatments we applied a number of configurations of rdi treatments on two olive cultivars barnea and askal over 6 and 1 2 years initial season plus 3 potential biennial bearing cycles both are relatively new israeli cultivars bred for intensive irrigated cultivation lavee et al 2003 the treatments outlined in fig 2 included t1 a control with sustained regulated irrigation of 80 calculated crop et t2 rdi with irrigation reduced to 50 etp during the period leading up to and into pit hardening june july with no consideration of fruit yield t3 rdi with treatment identical to t2 in on years and the deficit period shifted to pit hardening and after in off years july august t4 rdi treatment with 40 supply of etp in the first half of the irrigation season beginning of annual irrigation through july

independently automated valve and main line including water meter and fertilizer pump and meter pit hardening beginning and end were determined by manual observations following first order estimations based on historical average data fig 2 the target swp levels for t5 were adapted from results from a previous experiment ben gal et al 2011b in on years target swp was 1 5 mpa from initiation of irrigation through may 3 0 mpa from may through july and 2 5 mpa in august september in off years the swp target was 2 5 mpa until the end of june and 3 5 mpa during july august swp in t5 was measured twice a week once the day before and once the day after an irrigation event and target values were set to be averages of these measurements determination of whether each cultivar was in an on or off year was made following fruit set each year based on visual observations table 1 all treatments other than the control were irrigated at the end of the season from the first week of september until harvest according to fruit water content aiming for 50 55 water in fruit arriving to the olive mill this fruit water content is thought to be optimum for commercial mill operation zipori et al 2016 following harvest irrigation continued at a rate of 40 etp until the first significant 40 mm rainfall event 2 3 measurements sampling and analyses plant water status was assessed by swp using a scholander type pressure chamber mrc israel according to shackel et al 1997 in treatments t1 t4 swp was measured three times a year early may mid season during pit hardening july and late august

sept 2017 and 06 june 11 july and 29 aug 2018 vegetative growth rate was measured by annual measurement of trunk circumference at a marked point 40 cm above the ground on each tree each march beginning each season in august fruit water content was determined weekly before harvest by sampling 10 representative fruits from around the circumference of each measured tree at 2 2 5 m height and weighing before and after drying in an oven at 70 ºc yield was determined for each monitored tree a representative sample of 2 kg of fruit from each tree was analyzed cold pressed virgin oil was

determined by winter rainfall particularly first and last effective more than 30 mm rain events fig 1 with irrigation starting between the end of march and beginning of may and ending between the beginning of october and end of november table 1 annual irrigation amounts for the control treatments t1 ranged from 446 to 557 mm for barnea and 417 493 for askal fig 3 since askal trees are harvested early in order to avoid problematic levels of free fatty acids in the oil their irrigation continued for quite some time following harvest harvest of barnea trees more typically coincided with first substantial winter rains and the end of seasonal irrigation deficit treatments applied less water the least amounts of water were consistently given to t5 the swp triggered treatment with annual amounts ranging from 96 to 336 mm barnea and 199 331 mm askal total 7 year irrigation application amounts table 2 for t1 reached 3243 mm for barnea and 2955 mm for askal the deficit treatments

increases in off years and smaller increases in on years fig 4 average trunk circumference increased in barnea trees by 3 3 cm in off years and 6 3 cm in on years for askal trees the increase was 3 3 and 6 1 cm in off and on years respectively no effect of deficit irrigation treatment was found on trunk size for the first 4 years of the experiment a non significant tendency for reduced growth as a function of reduced irrigation water application appeared thereafter this tendency was stronger in barnea than askal trees between 2012 and the end of the experiment in the beginning of 2019 trunk circumference increased by up to 37 2 cm in barnea and 34 5 cm in askal table 2 while the differences to other treatments were not significant the lowest rates of trunk growth were found for the t5

supplemental material table s1 of all the fruit water content at harvest data table 4 indicated significance of both year and treatment p 0 0001 for barnea and of year but not treatment for askal there was significant interaction between year and treatment for both cultivars barnea p 0 001 askal p 0 0035 barnea fruit which was harvested later in each season than the askal fruit reached the oil mill with relatively high percentage of water often higher than the targeted 50 55 table 4 average fruit water content at harvest for barnea was significantly higher for t1 compared to t2 t4 and t5 while t2 was not significantly different than any of the other treatments the askal fruit was often below the target level of 50 55 water at harvest evaluation of each year reveals that fruit water at harvest was consistently highest in t1 and lowest in t5 with the other treatments falling in between but this was not always significant table 4 askal fruit had significantly lower water content in t5 compared to t1 in 2012 and in t5 compared to t1 t2 and t3 in 2016 the other treatments were not significantly different than either t1 or t5 in those years for barnea fruit the trend of lower water content at harvest as a function of lower irrigation application level was significant in 2015 2016 and 2017 3 5 yields fruit yields of barnea trees fig 6 ranged from 60 kg tree in on years 2014 2016 and 2018 to 30 kg tree in off years 2013 2015 and 2017 two way anova for barnea fresh fruit yield indicated significant p 0 0001 differences between years but not for treatments and with no interaction supplementary table s1 fruit yields of askal trees fig 6 were also significantly influenced by only year p 0 0001 with no interaction between year and treatment yields for askal were greater 40 kg tree in the on years 2013 2015 and 2017 and lower 20 25 kg tree in the off years 2014 2016 and 2018 note that the bearing status was miss diagnosed at the beginning of the season in 2013 for barnea and in 2014 for askal when they were characterized as on in spite of ultimately having relatively low yields over the course of the experiment non significant non consistent trends of reduced yield as a function of reduced water application due to rdi strategies were found fig 6 average barnea fruit yield ranged from 20 to 40 kg tree 7 14 t ha in off years to 40 75 kg tree 14 26 t ha in on years yield of askal tended to be lower 10 30 kg tree 3 5 10 5 t ha in off years and 30 45 kg tree 10 5 16 t ha in on years fig 6 cumulative fruit yield table 2 summed for the last 6 years of the experiment from 2013 until 2018 ranged from 306 kg tree for t1 in barnea and 205 206 kg tree for t1 and t2 in askal to 244 kg tree for barnea t4 and 265 kg tree for t5 and 192 187 and 191 kg tree for t3 t4 and t5 respectively for askal 3 5 1 fruit oil content the general two way anova model indicated significance between years p 0 0001 but not treatments for oil content in fruit for both cultivars and no interaction between treatment and year fig 7 supplementary table s1 oil content in fruit as percentage of fresh weight tended to increase as a function of decreased annual irrigation increase water stress fig 7 no effect of bearing level was found on fruit oil percentage measured in paste in the mill fruit from askal typically reached between 24 and 29 oil based on nir and from barnea between 17 and 25 for barnea in some years differences between percent oil content in t1 and t5 were strongly significant with t5 having as much as 5 more oil in fruit in askal such differences were less drastic with t5 typically having 1 2 more oil per fresh weight than t1 and with the exception of the 2017 season when while fruit oil content in all treatments was low but t1 and t3 had only 18 oil while t5 had greater than 22 reflecting the contrasting trends of greater fruit yield and lower fruit oil percentage differences in cumulative oil yield table 2 summed for the last 6 years of the experiment from 2013 until 2018 were not statistically significant between the treatments total oil yield for the 6 years ranged from 20 t1 t2 to 18 t4 t ha for barnea and 17 t1 t2 to 15 t ha t3 for askal 3 6 oil quality 3 6 1 free fatty acids two way anova indicated significance of year p 0 0001 but not treatment and no interaction between them for free fatty acid in oil for both cultivars supplementary table s1 no significant differences were found in oil free fatty acid percentage as a function of treatment in any of the individual years in spite of that after the first 3 years free fatty acid percentage in oil from barnea fruit was consistently higher in t1 and lower in treatments with greater deficit irrigation regimes fig 8 from 2015 onwards treatment t5 tended to have the lowest free fatty acid level a similar trend was found for askal in the off years 2016 and 2018 noticeable are years 2015 and 2018 for barnea 2018 for askal when t1 fatty acid levels were above the 0 8 standard for extra virgin olive oil while rdi treatments and especially t5 were under the threshold 3 6 2 polyphenols both treatment and year were found to be significant factors p 0 0001 influencing oil polyphenol content fig 9 for both barnea and askal supplementary table s1 no interaction was found between year and treatment for either cultivar average polyphenols for askal were significantly highest in t5 oil 490 mg kg oil second highest in t4 oil 372 mg kg oil and lower in t1 279 mg kg t2 327 mg kg and t3 307 mg kg which were not significantly different one from another polyphenol content of the produced oil tended to increase as a function of decreased applied irrigation water starting in 2013 the first full season of treatments polyphenol content varied from season to season and ranged from 7 lower 2014 to 150 higher 2015 in t5 compared to t1 for barnea similar trends were found for askal with polyphenols 6 lower in t5 than t1 in 2012 but 30 385 higher in all subsequent years average polyphenol content was 250 mg kg for t1 t2 and t3 337 for t4 and 372 mg kg for t5 for barnea and between 260 and 320 for t1 t3 342 for t4 and 487 for t5 for askal in 2016 and 2018 both off years polyphenols in oil from the askal trees were significantly higher in t5 than in all of the other treatments 3 7 water productivity productivity of irrigation water calculated as kg oil per cubic meter of water irrigated fig 10 was obviously greater for treatments where decreases in irrigation were greater than consequential decreases in yields with an overall trend of increased productivity as a function of decreased irrigation amount in some of the years productivity of t5 was significantly greater than most of the other treatments in any given year water productivity ranged from under 0 5 to more than 1 5 kg oil m3 with obvious higher productivity in on compared to off years total 6 year water productivity fig 10 ranged from 0 68 to 0 78 kg oil m3 in barnea for treatments 1 4 with no significant difference while t5 was 1 28 kg oil m3 and significantly greater similarly askal had a non significant range of water productivity of 0 6 0 76 kg oil m3 water for treatments 1 4 and significantly higher 1 05 kg oil m3 in t5 fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 absolute values of yields the values measured for yields in the current experiment table 2 fig 6 were high average commercial yields of both fruit and oil are expected to be some 20 30 lower than those presented here we believe that there are several explanations for this first yield was measured only on pre determined trees in choosing the measured trees exceptional individuals particular small or low bearing trees were avoided the yield from measured trees was harvested and weighed individually per tree with little expected losses or missed fruit oil yield was calculated by multiplying fruit yield by percent oil in fruit oil in fruit was determined using nir a method that measures total oil while commercial mills typically recover only around 85 of the total the yields for fruit and oil therefore should be taken as high end potential rather than actual commercial quantities and best referred to relatively per treatment 4 2 choice of periods for rdi a number of phenological stages have been identified as potential for strategies for reduced irrigation with no or minimal negative effect on olive oil yield or quality we chose to evaluate regulated deficit irrigation in the early spring as water availability in soil following winter rains is relatively high and during the mid summer pit hardening period considered less sensitive to water stress similar rdi strategies with combinations of stress levels given in the spring with onset of irrigation and during pit hardening in the summer were found to also not effect yield significantly and to therefore increase water productivity in a sister experiment in jordan on nabali baladi and nabali muhasan olive trees naoum et al 2016 under typical mediterranean and middle eastern conditions the soil in olive orchards tends to have substantial tree available water in the springtime following winter rains this was particularly true for the case study reported here where the local soil was heavy and could hold large amounts of water this on one hand supports the claim that little if any irrigation is needed during this period while on the other hand limits the potential for significant water savings certainly there is major importance in determination of when irrigation should be initiated each spring in the current study the t5 treatment based on swp trigger values fig 5 indicated that common practice tends to begin irrigation earlier than necessary and to over irrigate olives in the first month or more of the season depending of course on the extent and pattern of the previous winter s rainfall trentacoste et al 2019 found that rdi in spring was effective in saving water and reducing undesirable vegetative growth in super intensive hedgerow cv arbosana olives in argentina lavee et al 2007 tested seven rdi strategies in israel on muhasan olives and found the most efficient irrigation schedule was based on withholding water application until the end of endocarp pit hardening applying all the annual water from that stage until 2 weeks prior to harvest they found 4 year reduction of yield relative to full irrigation of 12 5 oil with 50 savings in water fernández et al 2013 practiced rdi from late june to late august in that study midday swp fell to between 2 and 3 5 mpa when irrigation was reduced to 60 and 3 and 4 5 mpa when reduced further to 30 of full irrigation total yield after three experimental years was reduced 25 30 by the rdi treatments with no differences between them water productivity was 2 5 kg oil ha 1 per mm for full irrigation 2 8 for the 30 treatment and 6 4 for the 60 treatment 4 3 success or not of rdi over di we ask the question does rdi actually have advantage over or difference from sustained di regimes there have been few studies comparing di to rdi directly and these are inconsistent in their findings iniesta et al 2009 in a study in cordoba southern spain on arbequina olives compared sustained di to rdi with midsummer july 1 to september 10 15 without irrigation both treatments were around 25 of calculated full et needs and received the same total annual irrigation during stress period swp fell to below 2 mpa for di and 3 mpa for rdi oil yield was reduced for both treatments compared to full control irrigation by around 20 but no differences were found between them moriana et al 2003 had an rdi treatment where swp decreased to 7 mpa in summer during the deficit while sustained di of same annual deficit decreased only to 3 8 mpa in order to evaluate if rdi had added benefit compared to full season sustained di we compare results from the current experiment with previously published data from di studies in fig 11 water production curves are shown based on a di trial on barnea olives located in the same area as the current study ben gal et al 2011a and on the 2003 experiment on picual olives by moriana et al 2003 in spain where both di and rdi treatments were studied ben gal et al 2011a found a curve with reduced yields when irrigation water was less than fully satisfying potential et requirements moriana et al 2003 suggested a single response curve for both di and rdi treatments suggesting no added benefit for rdi as both treatments reduced yields by 15 20 the curve from moriana et al 2003 was similar to ben gal et al 2011a but steeper larger response to relative decreases in applied water they published a best fit curve for their oil yield data where yield 2 78 0 11 et 0 0006 10 3 et2 the data from the current study for the most part follow the previously published response curves with decreased seasonal water application leading to decreased yields with the exception of t5 which had clearly greater water productivity 4 4 use of swp for scheduling in the current study the swp guided irrigation treatment based on dynamic thresholds ranging from 1 5 to 2 5 mpa in the spring in on and off years respectively reduced to 3 to 3 5 mpa on and off years during pit hardening and increasing back to 2 5 mpa later in the season during the oil accumulation stage fig 2 these target set points were based on measurements in a previous experiment ben gal et al 2011a 2011b where seasonal swp measurements in well irrigated treatments followed a pattern ranging from 1 5 mpa in the spring to 2 5 mpa pre harvest in september each year and where di treatments had swp values of 3 to 3 5 mpa during it hardening as mentioned already this treatment consistently led to the least amount of applied irrigation water and the greatest water productivity and was the only treatment suggesting true advantage of rdi over di fig 11 midday stem water potential used for evaluating water status and scheduling irrigation was reported previously moriana et al 2012 moriana et al 2012 evaluated swp in two locations in spain based on thresholds of 2 mpa for di while full irrigation maintained from 1 2 mpa to 1 4 mpa from pit hardening the di treatment led to 70 80 reduction in irrigation reduced vegetative growth and around 15 reduction in fruit yield contrary to our current study there was significant rainfall during the irrigation seasons in the moriana et al 2012 trial ahumada orellana et al 2017 evaluated swp thresholds for irrigation in a super high density arbequina orchard in chile they compared thresholds of 1 4 2 2 mpa considered full irrigation to treatments initiating irrigation at swp thresholds of 3 4 4 5 and 6 mpa after irrigation was triggered all treatments were irrigated at 100 level a threshold for irrigation initiation of 3 4 mpa did not affect yield while saving 20 25 water threshold of 4 5 mpa saved 24 40 water with decrease of 30 in fruit yield while 6 mpa threshold saved 30 45 water at a cost of 40 decreased yield it is not at all clear in the current study if the chosen threshold values were optimal or if the differences in thresholds between on and off years contributed to their success while the treatment and its results are of great interest the large cost particularly in labor to conduct them is expected to be prohibitive for many commercial operations certainly more work is needed to fine tune the ultimate threshold values for best results including evaluation of other cultivars and environments we suggest that better alternatives could be developed either to build crop factor reference et rdi protocols based on the results of this and other studies or to find a proxy for the manual pressure bomb based measurements possibly using continuous measurements of swp itself dixon and tyree 1984 meron et al 2015 or some other water status sensitive plant based sensor method ben gal et al 2010 possible methods are sap flow sensors or dendrometers although they have not proven effective in monitoring olive trees to date carr 2013 and thermal based crops water stress indices from remote imaging or proximal sensing agam et al 2013 4 5 identifying and managing fruit load fruit load has been successfully identified as a driver for olive tree water status and transpiration ben gal et al 2011b showed minimum seasonal stem water in on compared to off barnea and souri trees for a large range of deficit irrigation levels as well as for well watered trees with swp values as much as 0 5 mpa lower in on trees in may and as much as 1 mpa lower in september bustan et al 2016 quantified as much as 30 greater tree scale transpiration of barnea trees as a function of fruit load when comparing loaded to low load or fruitless trees naor et al 2012 studied interactions between irrigation during oil accumulation and fruit yield of koroneiki olives by irrigating according to varied swp thresholds oil yield was practically unaffected by irrigation rate at low crop loads but significantly increased with increased irrigation at high crop loads moriana et al 2003 considered fruit load by applying full irrigation during bearing on years and no irrigation at all rainfed in off years this strategy was found undesirable as the alternate year irrigation decreased yields by 25 in their 3 year experiment in the current study while we were confident in the logic behind the treatments with differential rdi strategies between high and low load years we were often challenged in correctly defining on vs off years in the springtime while treatments were based on binary on or off situations in many of the years the actual load levels fell somewhere in between fig 6 furthermore flowering level is not always correlated to final yield especially when unfavorable climatic conditions occur during flowering and harm the fruit set our results ended up showing little or no benefit to changing irrigation practice according to fruit load likely due to this issue that said compared to the preliminary study under the same environment as in the current experiment ben gal et al 2011a water status measured as minimum swp were much more similar even when comparing high and low yield trees and years table 3 this may be due to the differential rdi treatments but may also be due to less extreme fruit load conditions 4 6 irrigation to reach optimal fruit water content at harvest in the current study we attempted to use measurements of fruit water content in order to direct end of season irrigation such as to reach the olive mill at optimum status in order to promote mill efficiency and oil quality and to avoid early ripening due to water stress table 4 the approach has additional logic and potential value based on strong established relationships between tree water status and fruit water content fernandes et al 2018 the strategy was practically challenged by a number of issues first the method for determining water content was time consuming sampling weighing drying and re weighing took between 4 and 7 days to supply results second response of fruit water content to changes in irrigation were slow taking sometimes up to 2 weeks to be quantified this combination meant that the technique had low sensitivity and limited effectiveness what more there appeared to be disconnect between water content values measured from the sampling process and those determined on samples from harvest this could be due to lack of representation of the chosen representative fruit taken from one certain height from the ground around the tree s circumference compared to actual averaged samples of all fruit from the entire tree commercial measurements of water in fruit based on large volume samples and water content evaluation using nir on olive paste after milling would expedite the method the approach could become even more practical in the future following successful development of sensors for accurate and rapid determination of fruit water in the field trapani et al 2017 4 7 optimizing yield and oil quality total polyphenols and oxidative stability decrease with increased irrigation while free acidity increases we found profound improvement in oil quality as a function of lowered seasonal irrigation figs 8 and 9 this is not surprising as prior studies have indicated the same including for barnea koroneiki and souri ben gal et al 2011a dag et al 2008 2015 the connection between water stress and higher polyphenols is well established artajo et al 2006 suggested that the water status of trees affects phenol production in olive fruit and consequently the phenol content of the olive paste and oil they and others tovar et al 2002 indicate that water stress triggers augmented phenol synthesis the phenomenon where acidity is decreased under increased water stress is less evident in the literature and may be dependent on climate and cultivar since studies reporting the response tend to be based in regions outside of the traditional center of olive production in southwestern europe berenguer et al 2006 dag et al 2008 2015 ghrab et al 2014 toplu et al 2009 of interest in the current study s results is that the timing of stress did not seem to have effect on its influence on oil quality even treatments where stress was mostly felt by trees early in the season and when the last several months prior to harvest were irrigated at minimal deficit levels the positive effects on oil quality measured by increased polyphenols and decreased free fatty acid content were evident 5 conclusions regulated deficit irrigation of olives in which commercial irrigation application levels were reduced 30 40 alternatively during springtime april june or mid summer pit hardening led to reductions in accumulated multi seasonal water application by 15 25 the rdi treatments had a non significant trend of reduced yield as a function of reduced applied irrigation water with yields decreased up to 12 compared to the control treatment furthermore quality parameters were consistently improved under the rdi treatments in both cultivars an attempt to consider alternate bearing and shift rdi treatment periods accordingly did not appear to be beneficial as long term water savings yields and water productivity were unchanged we believe that while fruit load is obviously important to water requirements and response to water stress identification of actual bearing level and matching irrigation levels prove to be hard to achieve or at least need to be determined only after fruit set around the end of may attempts to irrigate according to pre set target values of swp did significantly increase water productivity as accumulated water applied was reduced by 40 and yield decreased by less than 15 non significantly over the 6 years of the experiment choice of optimal swp threshold needs further study including its universality across environments and cultivars while swp based irrigation scheduling seems to be effective in driving rdi its high labor demand and cost make its practicality in commercial olive orchards questionable we therefore hope for and await reliable proxies based on continuous or remote sensing of traits related to tree water status end of season irrigation designed to bring fruit to oil mills with optimal water concentration was also found to be less than successful this due to an overly long response time both for measuring fruit water content and for the measure to respond to changes in irrigation in situ sensing of fruit water could improve this method oil quality measured in terms of decreased fatty acids and increased polyphenols was improved by reductions in applied irrigation water with no dependence on when the reductions occurred over the irrigation season we understand that we were looking for marginal benefits of sometime nuanced differences in water application strategies we still believe that such investigation for subtle increases in water productivity can be important to profitability of irrigated olives particularly as oil prices decrease and water becomes more valuable while much of our results regarding superiority of rdi were not significant we believe that the discussion of them and the potential and challenges in applying them have value it appears that rdi can indeed be more beneficial than sustained di as seen in our experiment s results regarding the treatment t5 where swp was used to guide irrigation those results indicate that irrigation levels during deficit periods in spring and during pit hardening could be significantly lower than those chosen in the study regardless of whether they are a product of swp measurements or more simple adaptation as crop factors for irrigation according to reference et declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
