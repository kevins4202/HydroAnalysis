15140,understanding microplastic particles mps accumulation and transport along rivers represents a major task due to the complexity and heterogeneity of rivers and their interactions with their wider corridor the identification of mps hotspots and their potential sources is especially challenging in coarse bed rivers transporting a wide range of particle sizes with a high degree of variability in time and space this research focuses on the gravel bed ain river rhône river tributary france which is managed by means of various dams and also hosts one of the major plastic production centres in europe oyonnax and bienne plastic valleys in this research i geographical information systems gis were used to locate plastic factories and to characterise the land use of the ain river watershed ii on the field sediment samples were extracted from the hyporheic zone hz of mobile gravel bar heads while hydro sedimentary settings were measured in order to describe site conditions sampling sites were especially established in downwelling areas i e where the surface water entered the hyporheic zone upstream and downstream of dams and plastic factories iii after density separation and organic matter digestion of sediment mps were characterised with a µftir device followed by data processing via the simple software this work highlighted the trapping efficiency of alluvial bars for mps the highest mps concentrations were found along the plastic valleys up to 4400 mps kg while the lower river was less contaminated by mps after grain size correction a significant breakpoint was identified in the area of the main dams revealing their major influence on mps distribution the variability in mps concentrations and types suggested a local origin for most of mps a particular feature was the dominance of polypropylene pp which appears as a critical industrial heritage as the studied region is specialised in the manufacturing of hard plastics indeed multivariate analyses also revealed that mps concentrations and types were mostly driven by the vicinity of plastic factories and urban areas this relationship between the land use the presence of dams and mps characteristics provides key

hugely increased and became significantly more diversified borrelle et al 2020 zalasiewicz et al 2016 plastics and their chemical makeup including additives are so ubiquitous in the environment that

bank and hansson 2019 rivers and freshwater ecosystems have been recognised as playing a key role in the transport and accumulation of plastics from the uplands to the oceans krause et al 2021 lebreton et al 2017 siegfried et al 2017 jambeck et al 2015 plastics are found in river systems in very different sizes from macro to micro and nano plastics in various shapes and polymer compositions van emmerik and schwarz 2020 especially for mps which are lower than 5 mm arthur et al 2009 rivers can receive plastic particles from urban and industrial areas wastewaters runoff and intentional releases from agricultural areas sewage sludge application degradation of mulching films and tarpaulins etc and from the atmosphere allen et al 2019 dris et al 2018 hurley and nizzetto 2018 rochman 2018 cole et al 2011 the assessment of the contamination level of aquatic ecosystems with mps is an important challenge as mps can be transported and deposited along rivers reworked by floods or human activities diluted by tributary inputs along the watercourse or even accumulated in the hyporheic zone drummond et al 2022 laermanns et al 2021 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 understanding the distribution of mps in sediments along rivers is a topic of growing importance for instance research works achieved along the elbe rhine or inde rivers in germany laermanns et al 2021 lechthaler et al 2021 scherer et al 2020 klein et al 2015 mani et al 2015 as well as on the tame river trent river tributary in the united kingdom tibbetts et al 2018 were pioneering in terms of mps assessment counting and classification more recently mp estimates from aquatic sediment developed along several rivers worldwide on the maozhou pearl and wei rivers in china wu et al 2020 ding et al 2019 yan et al 2019 on kaveri killa chinthamani tiruchirappalli and ganga rivers in india maheswaran et al 2022 sarkar et al 2019 or on namibian rivers in africa faulstich et al 2022 as well as along the upper garonne river in france reis de carvalho et al 2021 or along the barrow river in ireland murphy et al 2022 these studies confirmed the presence of mps in various concentrations and types around urban industrial areas however the effect of land use dams and other hydro sedimentary settings on mps dynamics remains ambiguous for instance some studies indicated a decrease in mps downstream of dams watkins et al 2019 while others did not shown any influence weideman et al 2019 thus further research needs to question the effect of dams and other river barriers land use aspects including in the presence of plastic factories and hydro sedimentological settings grain size hyporheic exchanges on the distribution of mps along a river miller and orbock miller 2020 nel et al 2018 baldwin et al 2016 to address these questions this research aims i to characterise longitudinal concentrations of mps along a coarse bed river and ii to discuss the mps distribution concentrations and types in relation to hydro sedimentological and socio environmental factors grain size flow sediment obstacles land use and waste water treatment plants this study focuses on sediment from the hyporheic zone hz because it is a key zone of water and particle exchanges between surface water and groundwater dole olivier et al 2019 vervier et al 2009 malard et al 2002a moreover downwelling sites i e where the surface water enters into the hz along coarse bed rivers have been demonstrated as suitable environments for the accumulation of mps during a specified season drummond et al 2022 frei et al 2019 lewandowski et al 2019 in this research we focused on the ain river which is a gravel bed tributary of the rhône river france offering a heterogeneous land use with the notable presence of plastic production sites and major dams thus a representative case study of managed coarse bed rivers worldwide 2 material and methods 2 1 the ain river continuum geomorphological and land use insights the ain river is a 190 km long meandering river flowing from the french jura mountains to the rhône river upstream of the city of lyon fig 1 a near the confluence with the rhône river the ain presents a coarse bed load d50 26 15 mm and transports annually ca 15 000 m3 of sediment szewczyk et al 2022 rollet and piégay 2013 piégay et al 2008 bravard 1986 the river course presents three distinct sections fig 1 a i a hilly upper section where the river is meandering ii a middle section constrained into gorges 100 300 m width with a succession of dams and iii the lower ain river downstream of pont d ain pda which corresponds to a pebble floodplain 1 to 1 5 km width two tributaries supply the middle ain river fig 1 b the bienne 69 km long and the lange oignin lao rivers ca 40 km long gravel bars are typical geomorphic features occurring along the whole hydrosystem which are also key zones of water sediment oxygen and temperature exchanges critical for the biota dole olivier et al 2019 wawrzyniak et al 2016 mermillod blondin et al 2015 water downwellings along these gravel bars have been demonstrated as key sites for particle accumulation and transfer from riffle pool sequences mermillod blondin et al 2000 to a greater scale datry et al 2008 in terms of land use the upper ain river section is dominated by forestry and agricultural activities mainly pastures for milk and cheese production then the middle ain valley presents 22 of urban and industrial areas especially along the lao and bienne rivers at oyonnax nantua and saint claude fig 1 c this area is suspected to offer a high potential for microplastic pollution due to the historical presence of plastic factories since 1889 this region is still a leading centre for the plastics industry in france and europe desgouttes and bertrand 2015 dyvrande 1980 see also the haut bugey tourist office and oyonnax town websites the middle ain river also hosts major dams such as the vouglans arch dam height 103 m while run of the river dams are established at coiselet cize bolozon cb and allement all on the ain river itself and at charmines and etables on the lao and bienne rivers respectively fig 1 a and 1 b the middle and the lower ain valley also offer recreational water zones for fishing whitewater canoeing swimming and hiking where waste and pollution issues can be very harmful for water quality 2 2 geographical information system gis approach a geographical information system gis approach was used to collect socio environmental data on the ain catchment area we especially focus on four data available at the scale of the river catchment which are likely to influence the release and accumulation of microplastics the land use coming from corine land cover v 2018 location and nameplate capacity of waste water treatment plants wwtp systraitementeauxusees database v 10 12 2021 available at www sandre eaufrance fr the presence of dam and other river obstacles 1 high obs database from www sandre eaufrance fr as well as the distribution of plastic factories this last item required a particular methodological development the number of plastic factories that have historically been active in the plastic sector was assessed by collecting data from corporate directories plastipolis and polyvia for 2000s and 2010s historical mentions from georisques and current street views based on this review density maps were computed using qgis v 3 16 2 2 3 sampling strategy and method twelve sampling sites were selected along the ain river continuum fig 1 a and 1 b table 1 and fig a 1 i on the upper ain river one site is upstream of dams influence cha1 ii on the middle ain valley five sites were selected to monitor mps along the oyonnax plastic valley on the lao river mar10 bri6 7 8 per5 one site at dortan dor3 at the outlet of the bienne plastic valley and two sites downstream of the coiselet and allement dams in the zone influenced by dams coi4 and all2 iii three sites are then distributed along the lower ain river pda1 gev19 smg40 the sediment samples were obtained in june 2021 low water period at 20 cm deep at the head of mobile gravel bars in each bar piezometric heads were measured in the river and in the hz to select sampling zones with negative vertical hydraulic gradients vhg characterising downwelling conditions see table a 1 for details after this selection composite samples were collected at each site based on three samples of pore waters and interstitial sediment collected with the bou rouch pumping method bou and rouch 1967 malard et al 2002b temperature electric conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured with a portable device ponsel odeon bulk sediment samples ca 5 kg coming from the hz were also collected at 20 cm deep by using a metallic shovel and a stainless steel 100 µm mesh sieve in order to assess the overall proportion of sands silts and clays ssc in the river bed sediments all samples were stored at 4 c before analysis 2 4 microplastic extraction and characterisation protocol for mps extraction the sediment samples were sorted into two fractions by using a 500 µm stainless steel sieve and a 20 µm stainless steel sieve lower limit at the lab the two fractions 500 µm and 500 µm were dried for 3 to 4 days at 55 c in an oven and then immersed for 24 h in a zncl2 solution density 1 5 kg l to separate heavy inorganic materials from lighter particles quinn et al 2017 the floating material was recovered by sieving with vacuum filtered ultra pure water vfup whatman gf c filters porosity 1 2 µm the material was digested for 24 h with fenton s reagent 30 h2o2 associated with an iron catalyst h2so4 feso4 h2o 0 05 m to remove the organic matter ruggero et al 2020 after digestion the remaining material was filtered and placed on alumina filters whatman anodisc diameter 25 mm and porosity 0 2 µm mps counting and polymer type analyses were achieved by using a µft ir fourier transform infra red spectrometer perkinselmer spotlight 400 in transmittance mode pixel resolution 25 µm spectra resolution 8 cm 1 the spectral map obtained for each filter was then treated by using the simple software version 18 09 2020 this software performs multiple correlations based on a spectra database in order to identify the nature of the analysed particles plastic or natural origin i e plant animal furs quartz and charcoal through a probabilistic approach primpke et al 2018 polyamide pa particles were excluded from the analysis due to a high probability of confusion with spectra associated with natural particles quality control was based on three steps step 1 a known number of different mps and organic matter particles wood leaves and chitin was added in three samples see table a 2 for the sample composition three replicates for each sample were processed and recovery rates were calculated after the simple treatment table a 2 step 2 in order to consider the background presence of mps negative controls filtered with vfup at 20 µm mesh were processed the number of mps identified by the software in those negative controls corresponds to a false prediction of mps caused by misinterpretation of the spectra and was integrated in error bars table a 3 step 3 the level of accepted probabilities in simple was increased based on the step 1 results to improve the robustness of the analysis see table a 4 for details 2 5 sediment particle size distributions all sediment samples were dried at 55 c during 1 week bulk sediment samples collected at 20 cm deep at each site were manually sieved by using a sieve column meshes from 20 µm to 63 mm we assume that this measurement is a reliable representation of the overall proportion of cobbles gravels and ssc sands silts and clays in the sediment for each site table a 5 as the bou rouch pumping method extracted relatively fine sediments table a 5 and as mps were predominantly associated with ssc the number of mps was normalised to the proportion of ssc assessed in each site as follows 1 1 mps in sedimen t environment mps in sample x ssc in the above formula mps in sediment environment represents the overall concentration of mps in the river sediment kg dry weight dw mps in sample represents mps concentrations in each sample kg dw and the ssc represents the percentage of sands silts and clays at 20 cm deep on each sampled site 2 6 data treatments based on mps distribution data concentrations and types hydro sedimentological and socio environmental data land use river obstacles grain size wwtp multiple linear regressions were performed in order to evaluate which hydro sedimentological and socio environmental factors can potentially explain mps concentrations along the ain river all statistical analyses were achieved in r v 4 1 2 r core team 2021 the mcp package and functions were used to identify significant breakpoints and to fit linear segments in the data series lindelov 2022 a hierarchical cluster analysis hca using ward s distance was also performed in order to identify assemblage groups based on the mps composition after re scaling and centering of the data a redundancy analysis was performed by using the vegan package oksanen et al 2022 to compare the distribution of mps types with the former variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 densities of plastic manufacturing sites the distribution of plastic manufacturing businesses and factories within the ain river catchment was represented by a density map and a histogram fig 2 more than 550 factories active in the plastic sector during the 2000s 2010s and or before according the accessed sources have been identified on the ain river watershed they included compounders moulding shops storage areas transformation and manufacture of finished products one site may be involved in several activities a very high density of plastic factories was found along the lao river near oyonnax which corresponded to the main plastic valley fig 2 b this centre comprised 71 of the plastic factories n 393 average density d 6 factories km² the bienne river also hosted a high density of manufacturing sites with 26 of the listed plastic factories n 145 with a main centre located between saint claude and dortan n 45 d 3 factories km² fig 2 a in the other parts of the watershed plastic factories were scattered over the most upstream section near champagnole and foncine le bas in the high jura region n 14 to the middle and lower sections 27 plastic factories between clairvaux les lacs and moirans en montagne 30 factories in the lower ain river following the expected links between the distribution of plastic factories and the mps contamination mps concentrations in sediments are expected to be higher along the lao and bienne rivers than in other sites 3 2 spatial distribution of mps in streambed sediments the quantification of mps in streambed sediment samples revealed high numbers of mps fragments in the finest sediment fraction i e between 20 and 500 µm fig 3 sediments taken in the plastic valley along the lao and bienne rivers mar10 to dor3 sites had the highest mps concentrations both in the sediment sample fig 3 a and in the sediment environment estimates after the grain size correction fig 3 b see also table a 5 the main hotspot was mar10 ca 4000 mps kg dw located downstream of the oyonnax conurbation and its wwtp table a 6 along the oyonnax plastic valley mps concentrations varied between 609 and 1070 mps kg dw while the site located at the outlet of the bienne plastic valley dor3 also presented 1287 mps kg dw such concentrations are quite high for coarse bed river sediments and only a few studies reported comparable concentrations 1971 62 mps kg in sediments from the nakdong river in south korea eo et al 2019 or 228 to 3763 mps kg in sediments from an urban industrial section of the main river in germany klein et al 2015 concentrations lower than 600 mps kg in general have been measured along other urban industrial rivers in canada vernaire et al 2017 in the united kingdom tibbetts et al 2018 or in asia ding et al 2019 sarkar et al 2019 wu et al 2020 another recent research on the loire river revealed a median of 1500 mps kg maximal concentration of 7800 mps kg in coarse river deposits dhivert et al 2022 as demonstrated by drummond et al 2022 mps significantly accumulated in the hz of small rivers such as the bienne and lao rivers such concentrations found in the coarse environments of the ain river will contribute to the total contamination of the rhône river by plastic particles castro jiménez et al 2019 interestingly mps concentrations varied strongly along the oyonnax plastic valley fig 3 and no uniform decrease was highlighted downstream of the martignat hotspot mar10 it suggests that mps in the hz sediment were more likely associated to local contaminations and not due to a unique transport downstream of the martignat hotspot for instance mps found at per5 could have been released from the géovrissiat nantua wwtp from the drainage waters and the runoff from the izernore landfill and industrial zone such mps behaviour has been modelled along the dommel river netherlands where the authors underlined that micro and millimetre sized plastics were preferentially retained in the sediment at short distances from their sources besseling et al 2017 downstream of per5 and dor3 sites sediments enter in the most intensively managed section of the ain river with several run of the river dams and reservoirs coi4 and all2 sites displayed the lowest mps concentrations fig 3 a and table a 6 the gap with the mps concentrations observed upstream increases when normalised by the grain size fig 3 b as loa and bienne sediments were richer in sands silts and clays ssc than the middle and lower ain river sections see table a 5 for summary the link between mps and ssc was also reported along the wei river and provided details about the mps bearing phase ding et al 2019 finally the coiselet dam area 85 39 km upstream of the ain rhône confluence was identified as a breakpoint in the mps data series it gives a rough location of a change in the mps distribution and implies that hydro sedimentological changes due to the presence of dams influenced the mps distribution the uncertainty associated with this spatial change was very large 40 of the river length but this change referred without doubt to the river section from the arch dam of vouglans to the run of the river dam of allement all after this breakpoint very low mps concentrations were measured 250 350 mps kg dw the lower ain river has a higher flow rate 46 53 m3 s and a greater stream width than upstream 100 m on average see table 1 in comparison with upstream sites the potential storage area in the river bed increases and the flow of small tributaries carrying mps is diluted into larger volumes such dilution mechanism has been already demonstrated by van emmerik et al 2018 who highlighted a decrease in mps concentrations when the discharge increased along the saigon river vietnam this mechanism also suggests a relatively constant amount and mass of plastic diluted along the ain river and limited local plastic sources 3 3 mps chemical properties and characteristics along the ain river based on mps types three groups of sites were clearly identified along the river fig 4 a first group comprised the upper ain cha1 and the plastic valley sites mar10 to dor3 with mainly pp 42 on average pe 27 and ps 11 such polymers are frequently found in household and food packaging and toys see for instance https plasticoceans org 7 types of plastic the pp pe ps triad is well highlighted in other urban industrial environments however the dominance of pp is rather rare near busan south korea the high pp level in the freshwater sediment is interpreted by the authors as a consequence of hydro sedimentary processes in relation with the polymer densities eo et al 2019 hydro sedimentary processes associated with the intrinsic density of polymers have been also interpreted as one of the main factors controlling the mp distribution along the villerest dam on the loire river dhivert et al 2022 while near durban south africa govender et al 2020 link the relative importance of pp in river sediments to urban industrial releases along the ain river present study sediments of group 1 were collected along urban industrial stretches of the plastic valley which is specialised in manufacturing hard plastics a likely hypothesis is to consider this mps assemblage as an industrial heritage as also evidenced hereafter by statistical analyses see section 3 4 within group 1 several sites also contained i artificial or modified cellulose at cha1 and mar10 2 to 11 ii a significant part of pom polyoxometalate at bri7 and bri8 5 to 21 i e near the lange oignin confluence which might be explained by the local presence of high technology factories pom being used in electronic circuit boards for instance iii pc polycarbonate downstream of the lange oignin confluence 2 to 6 which is mainly used in safety glasses electronics and automobile parts polyester polymers pes pet pvc and the pur a v group were also found in low amounts at the sites of group 1 the presence of cha1 in this group which is a more rural area could be explained 1 by the potential influence of plastic factories found near champagnole i e upstream of cha1 and 2 by releases from one the biggest wwtp of the river corridor located at a short distance upstream of the sampling site see fig 2 a second group was identified on the middle ain river and characterised by pp coi4 ps and pet all2 however as shown in fig 3 this group only presented small concentrations of mps n 124 and thus it should be considered with caution or eventually as a sub group table a 6 these low mp concentrations in the hz of coi4 and all2 were probably due to their location between two reservoirs dams are known to attenuate sediment supply to downstream locations skalak et al 2013 and may also limit mps supply a third group is represented by the three lower ain sites fig 4 samples from these sites were characterised by the prevalence of pp and a significant proportion of pe 20 to 33 artificialized or modified cellulose cell am and pc were also found locally in variable abundance apart from this clustering it is also worth to note that pet fragments were also regularly found at some sites along the ain all2 dor3 gev19 mar10 bri8 3 4 which factors can potentially explain the mps distribution along the river multiple linear regressions were run to determine which factors could influence the observed mp distribution along the ain river different combinations of variables that could influence the mps concentrations were tested including land use at each sampling site urban industrial and transport network areas arable lands pasture moorlands landfills and quarries water recreation areas the number of plastic factories located 10 km upstream of the sampling site and the nameplate capacity of the closest wwtp according to this test the most significant variables were urban areas km² and the number of plastic factories table 2 it was surprising that the presence of river obstacles dams and weirs 1 m high was not significant in the analysis it was probably due to a low statistical value of river barriers which are few and very limited in the dataset other parameters not considered in the present study such as hydro geochemical processes and geological changes affecting the erosion deposition transport processes might also have influenced mps concentrations in sediments as demonstrated by richards et al 2022 along the ganga river india to go further about the understanding of the factors explaining the mp distribution along the river a redundancy analysis rda was performed to determine whether the distribution of mps polymer types could be related to the above cited land use or hydro sedimentological settings fig 5 according to this analysis 64 of the total variance was contained in the two first axes of the rda axes rda1 and rda2 plastic factories 10 km upstream of the sampling site and pastures were the most significant variables according to the rda analysis p 0 05 the other variables located on the right side of fig 5 influenced the community matrix at a secondary level ssc industrial areas and transport networks indus t in the upper quadrant and urban areas in the lower quadrant three main patterns were observed i pp pe and cell am were displayed together on fig 5 and thus found on common sites close to plastic factories industrial zones and transport networks the most suitable site was mar10 ii ps pet and pur a v were associated with urban industrial zones and transport networks these polymers could also be found on pastures in association with pes at cha1 iii pvc pc and pom which were among the densest polymers identified in this work seemed largely linked to the ssc proportion the sites that are the closest in fig 5 presented most similar mps assemblages on the one hand bri6 bri7 bri8 pda1 smg40 and on the other hand coi4 all2 gev19 overall these results provided interesting insights about the contributions of local mp inputs and sources on mps contamination of riverbed sediments 4 conclusions this research proposed a cross approach combining field measurements hydro sedimentary settings laboratory analyses grain size mps concentrations and types and socio environmental information land use plastic factories wwtp nameplate capacity river flow obstacles to assess key factors explaining the distribution of mps accumulated in the hyporheic zone of bar heads along coarse bed rivers as most of mps was contained in the 20 500 µm fraction a grain size based correction was used to discuss the mps distribution along the river the sediment sampled in the hyporheic zone hz from gravel bars along the middle section of the ain river especially loa and bienne rivers presented the highest mps concentrations up to 4400 mps kg dw this part of the valley corresponds to an urban industrial corridor specialised in hard plastic production mps seem to enter in the hydrosystem at various places along the oyonnax plastic valley as suggested by a large variability in concentrations and types a significant breakpoint was identified at the end of the middle ain river section where low mps concentrations were found in the hz sediment this breakpoint matched with the presence of major dams the role of the dams regarding mps transport and pathways can be questioned because most of them are run of the river dams while only few structures constitute major flow and sediment obstacles such as vouglans and charmines dams in addition the decrease in mps concentrations also occurred where the river bed widens and suggested a dilution effect in the most downstream sections thus the decrease of the mps distribution along the ain river corridor was most certainly driven by a combination of factors plastic types were dominated by pp pe and ps in order of importance along the ain river the dominance of pp is rare worldwide and can be explained by local industrial history as the lange oignin and the bienne valleys were specialized in the manufacturing of hard plastics moreover the influence of plastic factories and urban areas was emphasised by the multivariate analysis finally the methodology developed in the present research i e

al 2019 on kaveri killa chinthamani tiruchirappalli and ganga rivers in india maheswaran et al 2022 sarkar et al 2019 or on namibian rivers in africa faulstich et al 2022 as well as along the upper garonne river in france reis de carvalho et al 2021 or along the barrow river in ireland murphy et al 2022 these studies confirmed the presence of mps in various concentrations and types around urban industrial areas however the effect of land use dams and other hydro sedimentary settings on mps dynamics remains ambiguous for instance some studies indicated a decrease in mps downstream of dams watkins et al 2019 while others did not shown any influence weideman et al 2019 thus further research needs to question the effect of dams and other river barriers land use aspects including in the presence of plastic factories and hydro sedimentological settings grain size hyporheic exchanges on the distribution of mps along a river miller and orbock miller 2020 nel et al 2018 baldwin et al 2016 to address these questions this research aims i to characterise longitudinal concentrations of mps along a coarse bed river and ii to discuss the mps distribution concentrations and types in relation to hydro sedimentological and socio environmental factors grain size flow sediment obstacles land use and waste water treatment plants this study focuses on sediment from the hyporheic zone hz because it is a key zone of water and particle exchanges between surface water and groundwater dole olivier et al 2019 vervier et al 2009 malard et al 2002a moreover downwelling sites i e where the surface water enters into the hz along coarse bed rivers have been demonstrated as suitable environments for the accumulation of mps during a specified season drummond et al 2022 frei et al 2019 lewandowski et al 2019 in this research we focused on the ain river which is a gravel bed tributary of the rhône river france offering a heterogeneous land use with the notable presence of plastic production sites and major dams thus a representative case study of managed coarse bed rivers worldwide 2 material and methods 2 1 the ain river continuum geomorphological and land use insights the ain river is a 190 km long meandering river flowing from the french jura mountains to the rhône river upstream of the city of lyon fig 1 a near the confluence with the rhône river the ain presents a coarse bed load d50 26 15 mm and transports annually ca 15 000 m3 of sediment szewczyk et al 2022 rollet and piégay 2013 piégay et al 2008 bravard 1986 the river course presents three distinct sections fig 1 a i a hilly upper section where the river is meandering ii a middle section constrained into gorges 100 300 m width with a succession of dams and iii the lower ain river downstream of pont d ain pda which corresponds to a pebble floodplain 1 to 1 5 km width two tributaries supply the middle ain river fig 1 b the bienne 69 km long and the lange oignin lao rivers ca 40 km long gravel bars are typical geomorphic features occurring along the whole hydrosystem which are also key zones of water sediment oxygen and temperature exchanges critical for the biota dole olivier et al 2019 wawrzyniak et al 2016 mermillod blondin et al 2015 water downwellings along these gravel bars have been demonstrated as key sites for particle accumulation and transfer from riffle pool sequences mermillod blondin et al 2000 to a greater scale datry et al 2008 in terms of land use the upper ain river section is dominated by forestry and agricultural activities mainly pastures for milk and cheese production then the middle ain valley presents 22 of urban and industrial areas especially along the lao and bienne rivers at oyonnax nantua and saint claude fig 1 c this area is suspected to offer a high potential for microplastic pollution due to the historical presence of plastic factories since 1889 this region is still a leading centre for the plastics industry in france and europe desgouttes and bertrand 2015 dyvrande 1980 see also the haut bugey tourist office and oyonnax town websites the middle ain river also hosts major dams such as the vouglans arch dam height 103 m while run of the river dams are established at coiselet cize bolozon cb and allement all on the ain river itself and at charmines and etables on the lao and bienne rivers respectively fig 1 a and 1 b the middle and the lower ain valley also offer recreational water zones for fishing whitewater canoeing swimming and hiking where waste and pollution issues can be very harmful for water quality 2 2 geographical information system gis approach a geographical information system gis approach was used to collect socio environmental data on the ain catchment area we especially focus on four data available at the scale of the river catchment which are likely to influence the release and accumulation of microplastics the land use coming from corine land cover v 2018 location and nameplate capacity of waste water treatment plants wwtp systraitementeauxusees database v 10 12 2021 available at www sandre eaufrance fr the presence of dam and other river obstacles 1 high obs database from www sandre eaufrance fr as well as the distribution of plastic factories this last item required a particular methodological development the number of plastic factories that have historically been active in the plastic sector was assessed by collecting data from corporate directories plastipolis and polyvia for 2000s and 2010s historical mentions from georisques and current street views based on this review density maps were computed using qgis v 3 16 2 2 3 sampling strategy and method twelve sampling sites were selected along the ain river continuum fig 1 a and 1 b table 1 and fig a 1 i on the upper ain river one site is upstream of dams influence cha1 ii on the middle ain valley five sites were selected to monitor mps along the oyonnax plastic valley on the lao river mar10 bri6 7 8 per5 one site at dortan dor3 at the outlet of the bienne plastic valley and two sites downstream of the coiselet and allement dams in the zone influenced by dams coi4 and all2 iii three sites are then distributed along the lower ain river pda1 gev19 smg40 the sediment samples were obtained in june 2021 low water period at 20 cm deep at the head of mobile gravel bars in each bar piezometric heads were measured in the river and in the hz to select sampling zones with negative vertical hydraulic gradients vhg characterising downwelling conditions see table a 1 for details after this selection composite samples were collected at each site based on three samples of pore waters and interstitial sediment collected with the bou rouch pumping method bou and rouch 1967 malard et al 2002b temperature electric conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured with a portable device ponsel odeon bulk sediment samples ca 5 kg coming from the hz were also collected at 20 cm deep by using a metallic shovel and a stainless steel 100 µm mesh sieve in order to assess the overall proportion of sands silts and clays ssc in the river bed sediments all samples were stored at 4 c before analysis 2 4 microplastic extraction and characterisation protocol for mps extraction the sediment samples were sorted into two fractions by using a 500 µm stainless steel sieve and a 20 µm stainless steel sieve lower limit at the lab the two fractions 500 µm and 500 µm were dried for 3 to 4 days at 55 c in an oven and then immersed for 24 h in a zncl2 solution density 1 5 kg l to separate heavy inorganic materials from lighter particles quinn et al 2017 the floating material was recovered by sieving with vacuum filtered ultra pure water vfup whatman gf c filters porosity 1 2 µm the material was digested for 24 h with fenton s reagent 30 h2o2 associated with an iron catalyst h2so4 feso4 h2o 0 05 m to remove the organic matter ruggero et al 2020 after digestion the remaining material was filtered and placed on alumina filters whatman anodisc diameter 25 mm and porosity 0 2 µm mps counting and polymer type analyses were achieved by using a µft ir fourier transform infra red spectrometer perkinselmer spotlight 400 in transmittance mode pixel resolution 25 µm spectra resolution 8 cm 1 the spectral map obtained for each filter was then treated by using the simple software version 18 09 2020 this software performs multiple correlations based on a spectra database in order to identify the nature of the analysed particles plastic or natural origin i e plant animal furs quartz and charcoal through a probabilistic approach primpke et al 2018 polyamide pa particles were excluded from the analysis due to a high probability of confusion with spectra associated with natural particles quality control was based on three steps step 1 a known number of different mps and organic matter particles wood leaves and chitin was added in three samples see table a 2 for the sample composition three replicates for each sample were processed and recovery rates were calculated after the simple treatment table a 2 step 2 in order to consider the background presence of mps negative controls filtered with vfup at 20 µm mesh were processed the number of mps identified by the software in those negative controls corresponds to a false prediction of mps caused by misinterpretation of the spectra and was integrated in error bars table a 3 step 3 the level of accepted probabilities in simple was increased based on the step 1 results to improve the robustness of the analysis see table a 4 for details 2 5 sediment particle size distributions all sediment samples were dried at 55 c during 1 week bulk sediment samples collected at 20 cm deep at each site were manually sieved by using a sieve column meshes from 20 µm to 63 mm we assume that this measurement is a reliable representation of the overall proportion of cobbles gravels and ssc sands silts and clays in the sediment for each site table a 5 as the bou rouch pumping method extracted relatively fine sediments table a 5 and as mps were predominantly associated with ssc the number of mps was normalised to the proportion of ssc assessed in each site as follows 1 1 mps in sedimen t environment mps in sample x ssc in the above formula mps in sediment environment represents the overall concentration of mps in the river sediment kg dry weight dw mps in sample represents mps concentrations in each sample kg dw and the ssc represents the percentage of sands silts and clays at 20 cm deep on each sampled site 2 6 data treatments based on mps distribution data concentrations and types hydro sedimentological and socio environmental data land use river obstacles grain size wwtp multiple linear regressions were performed in order to evaluate which hydro sedimentological and socio environmental factors can potentially explain mps concentrations along the ain river all statistical analyses were achieved in r v 4 1 2 r core team 2021 the mcp package and functions were used to identify significant breakpoints and to fit linear segments in the data series lindelov 2022 a hierarchical cluster analysis hca using ward s distance was also performed in order to identify assemblage groups based on the mps composition after re scaling and centering of the data a redundancy analysis was performed by using the vegan package oksanen et al 2022 to compare the distribution of mps types with the former variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 densities of plastic manufacturing sites the distribution of plastic manufacturing businesses and factories within the ain river catchment was represented by a density map and a histogram fig 2 more than 550 factories active in the plastic sector during the 2000s 2010s and or before according the accessed sources have been identified on the ain river watershed they included compounders moulding shops storage areas transformation and manufacture of finished products one site may be involved in several activities a very high density of plastic factories was found along the lao river near oyonnax which corresponded to the main plastic valley fig 2 b this centre comprised 71 of the plastic factories n 393 average density d 6 factories km² the bienne river also hosted a high density of manufacturing sites with 26 of the listed plastic factories n 145 with a main centre located between saint claude and dortan n 45 d 3 factories km² fig 2 a in the other parts of the watershed plastic factories were scattered over the most upstream section near champagnole and foncine le bas in the high jura region n 14 to the middle and lower sections 27 plastic factories between clairvaux les lacs and moirans en montagne 30 factories in the lower ain river following the expected links between the distribution of plastic factories and the mps contamination mps concentrations in sediments are expected to be higher along the lao and bienne rivers than in other sites 3 2 spatial distribution of mps in streambed sediments the quantification of mps in streambed sediment samples revealed high numbers of mps fragments in the finest sediment fraction i e between 20 and 500 µm fig 3 sediments taken in the plastic valley along the lao and bienne rivers mar10 to dor3 sites had the highest mps concentrations both in the sediment sample fig 3 a and in the sediment environment estimates after the grain size correction fig 3 b see also table a 5 the main hotspot was mar10 ca 4000 mps kg dw located downstream of the oyonnax conurbation and its wwtp table a 6 along the oyonnax plastic valley mps concentrations varied between 609 and 1070 mps kg dw while the site located at the outlet of the bienne plastic valley dor3 also presented 1287 mps kg dw such concentrations are quite high for coarse bed river sediments and only a few studies reported comparable concentrations 1971 62 mps kg in sediments from the nakdong river in south korea eo et al 2019 or 228 to 3763 mps kg in sediments from an urban industrial section of the main river in germany klein et al 2015 concentrations lower than 600 mps kg in general have been measured along other urban industrial rivers in canada vernaire et al 2017 in the united kingdom tibbetts et al 2018 or in asia ding et al 2019 sarkar et al 2019 wu et al 2020 another recent research on the loire river revealed a median of 1500 mps kg maximal concentration of 7800 mps kg in coarse river deposits dhivert et al 2022 as demonstrated by drummond et al 2022 mps significantly accumulated in the hz of small rivers such as the bienne and lao rivers such concentrations found in the coarse environments of the ain river will contribute to the total contamination of the rhône river by plastic particles castro jiménez et al 2019 interestingly mps concentrations varied strongly along the oyonnax plastic valley fig 3 and no uniform decrease was highlighted downstream of the martignat hotspot mar10 it suggests that mps in the hz sediment were more likely associated to local contaminations and not due to a unique transport downstream of the martignat hotspot for instance mps found at per5 could have been released from the géovrissiat nantua wwtp from the drainage waters and the runoff from the izernore landfill and industrial zone such mps behaviour has been modelled along the dommel river netherlands where the authors underlined that micro and millimetre sized plastics were preferentially retained in the sediment at short distances from their sources besseling et al 2017 downstream of per5 and dor3 sites sediments enter in the most intensively managed section of the ain river with several run of the river dams and reservoirs coi4 and all2 sites displayed the lowest mps concentrations fig 3 a and table a 6 the gap with the mps concentrations observed upstream increases when normalised by the grain size fig 3 b as loa and bienne sediments were richer in sands silts and clays ssc than the middle and lower ain river sections see table a 5 for summary the link between mps and ssc was also reported along the wei river and provided details about the mps bearing phase ding et al 2019 finally the coiselet dam area 85 39 km upstream of the ain rhône confluence was identified as a breakpoint in the mps data series it gives a rough location of a change in the mps distribution and implies that hydro sedimentological changes due to the presence of dams influenced the mps distribution the uncertainty associated with this spatial change was very large 40 of the river length but this change referred without doubt to the river section from the arch dam of vouglans to the run of the river dam of allement all after this breakpoint very low mps concentrations were measured 250 350 mps kg dw the lower ain river has a higher flow rate 46 53 m3 s and a greater stream width than upstream 100 m on average see table 1 in comparison with upstream sites the potential storage area in the river bed increases and the flow of small tributaries carrying mps is diluted into larger volumes such dilution mechanism has been already demonstrated by van emmerik et al 2018 who highlighted a decrease in mps concentrations when the discharge increased along the saigon river vietnam this mechanism also suggests a relatively constant amount and mass of plastic diluted along the ain river and limited local plastic sources 3 3 mps chemical properties and characteristics along the ain river based on mps types three groups of sites were clearly identified along the river fig 4 a first group comprised the upper ain cha1 and the plastic valley sites mar10 to dor3 with mainly pp 42 on average pe 27 and ps 11 such polymers are frequently found in household and food packaging and toys see for instance https plasticoceans org 7 types of plastic the pp pe ps triad is well highlighted in other urban industrial environments however the dominance of pp is rather rare near busan south korea the high pp level in the freshwater sediment is interpreted by the authors as a consequence of hydro sedimentary processes in relation with the polymer densities eo et al 2019 hydro sedimentary processes associated with the intrinsic density of polymers have been also interpreted as one of the main factors controlling the mp distribution along the villerest dam on the loire river dhivert et al 2022 while near durban south africa govender et al 2020 link the relative importance of pp in river sediments to urban industrial releases along the ain river present study sediments of group 1 were collected along urban industrial stretches of the plastic valley which is specialised in manufacturing hard plastics a likely hypothesis is to consider this mps assemblage as an industrial heritage as also evidenced hereafter by statistical analyses see section 3 4 within group 1 several sites also contained i artificial or modified cellulose at cha1 and mar10 2 to 11 ii a significant part of pom polyoxometalate at bri7 and bri8 5 to 21 i e near the lange oignin confluence which might be explained by the local presence of high technology factories pom being used in electronic circuit boards for instance iii pc polycarbonate downstream of the lange oignin confluence 2 to 6 which is mainly used in safety glasses electronics and automobile parts polyester polymers pes pet pvc and the pur a v group were also found in low amounts at the sites of group 1 the presence of cha1 in this group which is a more rural area could be explained 1 by the potential influence of plastic factories found near champagnole i e upstream of cha1 and 2 by releases from one the biggest wwtp of the river corridor located at a short distance upstream of the sampling site see fig 2 a second group was identified on the middle ain river and characterised by pp coi4 ps and pet all2 however as shown in fig 3 this group only presented small concentrations of mps n 124 and thus it should be considered with caution or eventually as a sub group table a 6 these low mp concentrations in the hz of coi4 and all2 were probably due to their location between two reservoirs dams are known to attenuate sediment supply to downstream locations skalak et al 2013 and may also limit mps supply a third group is represented by the three lower ain sites fig 4 samples from these sites were characterised by the prevalence of pp and a significant proportion of pe 20 to 33 artificialized or modified cellulose cell am and pc were also found locally in variable abundance apart from this clustering it is also worth to note that pet fragments were also regularly found at some sites along the ain all2 dor3 gev19 mar10 bri8 3 4 which factors can potentially explain the mps distribution along the river multiple linear regressions were run to determine which factors could influence the observed mp distribution along the ain river different combinations of variables that could influence the mps concentrations were tested including land use at each sampling site urban industrial and transport network areas arable lands pasture moorlands landfills and quarries water recreation areas the number of plastic factories located 10 km upstream of the sampling site and the nameplate capacity of the closest wwtp according to this test the most significant variables were urban areas km² and the number of plastic factories table 2 it was surprising that the presence of river obstacles dams and weirs 1 m high was not significant in the analysis it was probably due to a low statistical value of river barriers which are few and very limited in the dataset other parameters not considered in the present study such as hydro geochemical processes and geological changes affecting the erosion deposition transport processes might also have influenced mps concentrations in sediments as demonstrated by richards et al 2022 along the ganga river india to go further about the understanding of the factors explaining the mp distribution along the river a redundancy analysis rda was performed to determine whether the distribution of mps polymer types could be related to the above cited land use or hydro sedimentological settings fig 5 according to this analysis 64 of the total variance was contained in the two first axes of the rda axes rda1 and rda2 plastic factories 10 km upstream of the sampling site and pastures were the most significant variables according to the rda analysis p 0 05 the other variables located on the right side of fig 5 influenced the community matrix at a secondary level ssc industrial areas and transport networks indus t in the upper quadrant and urban areas in the lower quadrant three main patterns were observed i pp pe and cell am were displayed together on fig 5 and thus found on common sites close to plastic factories industrial zones and transport networks the most suitable site was mar10 ii ps pet and pur a v were associated with urban industrial zones and transport networks these polymers could also be found on pastures in association with pes at cha1 iii pvc pc and pom which were among the densest polymers identified in this work seemed largely linked to the ssc proportion the sites that are the closest in fig 5 presented most similar mps assemblages on the one hand bri6 bri7 bri8 pda1 smg40 and on the other hand coi4 all2 gev19 overall these results provided interesting insights about the contributions of local mp inputs and sources on mps contamination of riverbed sediments 4 conclusions this research proposed a cross approach combining field measurements hydro sedimentary settings laboratory analyses grain size mps concentrations and types and socio environmental information land use plastic factories wwtp nameplate capacity river flow obstacles to assess key factors explaining the distribution of mps accumulated in the hyporheic zone of bar heads along coarse bed rivers as most of mps was contained in the 20 500 µm fraction a grain size based correction was used to discuss the mps distribution along the river the sediment sampled in the hyporheic zone hz from gravel bars along the middle section of the ain river especially loa and bienne rivers presented the highest mps concentrations up to 4400 mps kg dw this part of the valley corresponds to an urban industrial corridor specialised in hard plastic production mps seem to enter in the hydrosystem at various places along the oyonnax plastic valley as suggested by a large variability in concentrations and types a significant breakpoint was identified at the end of the middle ain river section where low mps concentrations were found in the hz sediment this breakpoint matched with the presence of major dams the role of the dams regarding mps transport and pathways can be questioned because most of them are run of the river dams while only few structures constitute major flow and sediment obstacles such as vouglans and charmines dams in addition the decrease in mps concentrations also occurred where the river bed widens and suggested a dilution effect in the most downstream sections thus the decrease of the mps distribution along the ain river corridor was most certainly driven by a combination of factors plastic types were dominated by pp pe and ps in order of importance along the ain river the dominance of pp is rare worldwide and can be explained by local industrial history as the lange oignin and the bienne valleys were specialized in the manufacturing of hard plastics moreover the influence of plastic factories and urban areas was emphasised by the multivariate analysis finally the methodology developed in the present research i e

15141,bioelectrochemical system bes can effectively promote the reductive dechlorination of chlorophenols cps however the complete degradation of cps with sequential dechlorination and mineralization processes has rarely achieved from the bes here a dual working electrode bes was constructed and applied for the complete degradation of pentachlorophenol pcp combined with dna stable isotope probing dna sip the biofilms attached on the anodic and cathodic electrode in the bes were analyzed to explore the dechlorinating and mineralizing microorganisms results showed that pcp removal efficiency in the dual working bes 84 for 21 days was 4 1 and 4 7 times higher than those of conventional bess with a single anodic or cathodic working electrode respectively based on dna sip and high throughput sequencing analysis the cathodic working electrode harbored the potential dechlorinators comamonas pseudomonas methylobacillus and dechlorosoma and the anodic working enriched the potential intermediate mineralizing bacteria comamonas stenotrophomonas and geobacter indicating that pcp could be completely degraded under the synergetic effect of these functional microorganisms besides the potential autotrophic functional bacteria that might be involved in the pcp dechlorination were also identified by sip labeled with 13c nahco3 our results proved that the dual working bes could accelerate the complete degradation of pcp and enrich separately the functional microbial consortium for the pcp dechlorination and mineralization which has broad potential for bioelectrochemical techniques in the treatment of wastewater contaminated with cps or other halogenated organic compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorophenols stable isotope probing functional degrading bacteria dechlorination mineralization complete degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chlorophenols cps are persistent organic pollutants which are commonly used as herbicides insecticide and preservatives vallecillo et al 1999 pentachlorophenol pcp is the most toxic representative among the cps and regulated as one of the priority pollutants by the us environment protection agency keith and telliard 1979 due to its toxicity and recalcitrance pcp residues have adverse effects on the ecological environments and humans puglisi et al 2009 previous studies had revealed that pcp could be degraded by chemical photochemical and microbial processes el bialy et al 2018 lin et al 2014 silva et al 2001 in terms of microbial biodegradation reductive dichlorination of pcp by anaerobic microbes has been identified as the primary biotransformation mechanism under anerobic conditions shi et al 2022 however the anaerobic dichlorination rate was relatively low due to the high toxicity of pcp and the lack of sustainable electron donors in nature environments moreover current studies have mainly focused on the reductive degradation process of pcp and less attention has been paid to the complete degradation of pcp and the underlying microbial mechanisms bioelectrochemical system bes which combines biological redox with an in vitro electrochemical reaction is a comprehensive microbial electrochemical energy conversion process for oxidation or and reduction using electroactive bacteria eab as catalysts modin and aulenta 2017 the eab can not only output electrons from cells to extracellular electron acceptors but also receive electrons from extracellular electron donors into cells zhang et al 2014 found that a cathodic potential of 500 mv vs standard hydrogen electrode could support the biological dechlorination of pcp to phenol two main mechanisms were previously used to explain pcp dechlorination in the bess kong et al 2014 one was reductive dechlorination in the anode chamber based on the anaerobic co metabolism in which pcp served as a carbon source huang et al 2011a huang et al 2013 the other was reductive dechlorination in the cathode in which pcp accepted the electrons transferred from the bioanode huang et al 2013 based on this theory kong et al 2014 found that it could realize the complete degradation of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp in a sequential biocathode bioanode bes in which 4 cp was dechlorinated at the biocathode and the generated products were further degraded at the bioanode in this regard the combination of biocathode with bioanode was confirmed to be able to achieve the simultaneous dechlorination and mineralization of pcp the sequential biocathode bioanode bes was operated in a two chamber configuration with external circulation of electrolyte solution which required relatively high cost membrane and quite complicated operations moreover current studies have mainly focused on exploring the degradation efficiency of cps in the bes or indirectly verified the role of certain microorganisms in cps degradation through bioaugmentation a more efficiency bes for the complete degradation of pcp is highly desired and the underlying microbial mechanisms in such an integrated degradation process has remained unexplored to date several anaerobic pcp degrading bacteria have been isolated and identified as pseudomonas acinetobacter sphingomonas flavobacterium and desulfitobacterium with cultivation based method lee et al 1998 nohynek et al 1995 saber and crawford 1985 sharma et al 2009 villemur 2013 however these strains represented only a small proportion in nature and most of microbes in biotreatment system or environment are not culturable in addition the cultivation based method cannot account for the complex interactions among individuals within microbial communities cultivation independent stable isotope probing sip is a powerful technique for identifying microbial activities and functions to improve our understanding of bioremediation process li et al 2017b it has been successfully employed stable isotope 13c or 15n to analyze isotope labeled intracellular components rna dna or proteins of functional degraders providing the opportunity to link microbial identities to their functions li et al 2018 currently dna based sip with 13c pcp as a substrate could explore the functional microorganisms responsible for pcp mineralization li et al 2015 tong et al 2015 the sip technique is currently unavailable for identifying directly those dehalogentated bacteria from complex environments because the isotope labeled c in the pcp might not be metabolized by the cells therefore the sip technique could not distinguish those dehalogentated bacteria from the mineralization microbes because some strains might have dual functions by combining the dna sip technique with the dual working electrode bes that could separate the dechlorinating and mineralizing microbes the accurate identification of functional microorganism for the dechlorination and mineralization might be possible thus in this study to degrade efficiently pcp and explore the key microorganisms involved in the complete pcp degradation a dual working electrode bes with a cathodic and anodic working electrode in one reactor was constructed and the functional microorganisms of two processes were spatially separated on the anode and cathode by dna sip with 13c pcp as the only organic substrate the pcp degradation performances in this dual working electrode bes have also been investigated in addition 13c labeled sodium bicarbonate a possible inorganic carbon source for autotrophic microorganisms was used to trace the key autotrophs that might contribute potentially to the pcp dechlorination under oligotrophic environment overall our findings suggest that the dual working electrode bes coupled with dna sip is a powerful tool to identify and distinguish the active microbes responsible for the complete degradation of pcp in the bess 2 materials and methods 2 1 the construction of the bes and pcp degradation the dual working electrode bes reactor was constructed using a 120 ml serum bottle and the bes reactor configuration is shown in fig 1 a carbon cloth 7 cm2 titanium wire and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the working counter and reference electrodes respectively there were two working electrodes in the same bes including an anodic and a cathodic electrode that controlled by a multi potentiostat chi 1000c chenhua co ltd shanghai china a potential of 500 mv and 200 mv vs sce were applied to the cathodic and anodic working electrodes in the bes respectively which were optimal potential values for acclimation of dechlorinating and mineralizing biofilms for the pcp degradation cai et al 2020 li et al 2017a the bess were inoculated with the mixed bacteria from the pre screened microbes for pcp degradation and details of the microbial screening and enrichment methods were provided in supporting information si the bess were filled with 100 ml of culture medium solution containing 1 l 10 mg of labeled 13c pcp

labeled 13c nahco3 or unlabeled nahco3 were also set up to explore autotrophic dechlorinating bacteria in biofilms in total three treatments were performed including 12c pcp nahco3 12c pcp and 12c nahco3 13c pcp 13c pcp and 12c nahco3 and 13c nahco3 12c pcp and 13c nahco3 pcp degradation performances in the dual working electrode bes have also been investigated which were compared with the traditional three electrode bes configured with a single working electrode in addition control experiments were performed with the open circuit bess to determine the role of pcp acclimatized biofilm in pcp removal in the bess all reactors were operated in triplicate at room temperature without lighting 2 2 analytical methods of the biofilms and pcp the i t curve was recorded with chi1000c the electrochemical properties of the anodic and cathodic biofilm at non turnover conditions were determined with chi660e according to the method previously described hu et al 2022 zhuang et al 2020 the biofilms formed on the carbon cloth were imaged using scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan the live dead baclight viability l7012 thermo fisher scientific usa was applied to observe the viability and thickness of biofilm using a laser confocal scanning microscope clsm leica tcs sp2 germany in addition analyses methods of pcp and intermediate were provided in si file 2 3 biofilm dna extraction and ultracentrifugation the biofilm samples on working electrode after three stable cycles of acclimation were collected from 13c labeled or unlabeled pcp experiments the microbial dna samples were extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa details regarding dna ultracentrifugation and purification were provided in si the bacterial 16s rdna gene was amplified by pcr using the primer set 515f 806r gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa aacgcacgctag ccggactacvsgggtatctaat the pcr products were sequenced using an illumina miseq platform with paired end 2 250 bp pe technology valentino et al 2014 in sip microcosms microorganisms involved in pcp mineralization were distinguished from operational taxonomic units otus enriched in the 13c dna fractions by comparing the anode biofilms of the 13c pcp treatments to that of the 12c pcp microcosms phylogenetic tree analysis was performed by using a previous described procedure li et al 2014 2 4 construction of microbial interaction network in the biofilms the co occurrence ecological network was constructed with the molecular ecological network analysis mena as previously described deng et al 2012 which was applied to investigate the interactions among different microbial lineages within the whole communities of the anodic or cathodic biofilms in the traditional three electrode bes and the dual working electrode bes respectively the network was visualized with the interactive platform gephi 0 9 2 heymann and le grand 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical activities of anodic and cathodic biofilms the bess were operated by feeding nutrient medium containing 10 mg l pcp for 25 d the anodic biocurrent of bes progressively increased and reached a peak of 5 μa fig 1b which indicated that the electroactive bacteria were enriched in anodic biofilms following incubation the cathodic biocurrent was also observed which took 15 d to reach the maximum value 1 8 μa fig 1b obviously the anodic process produced higher current than the cathodic process it was likely because electroactive bacteria donated electrons in the anodic process more efficiently than uptook electrons from electrodes in the cathodic process for each fed batch cycle with the prolonged operation time substrates on the bioanode and biocathode were gradually consumed and depleted resulting in a decrease of biocurrent non turnover cyclic voltammographs cvs were performed to reveal the biocatalytic activities of the anodic and cathodic biofilms enriched with pcp four oxidation peaks of 0 32 ma at 0 42 v e 1 0 50 ma at 0 37 v e 2 0 68 ma at 0 33 v e 3 and 0 431 ma at 0 14 v e 4 and two reduction peaks of 0 29 ma at 0 53 v e 5 and 0 37 ma at 0 43 v e 6 were observed in the anodic biofilms respectively fig 1c comparatively two oxidation peaks of 0 04 ma at 0 42 v e 1 and 0 03 ma at 0 14 v e 4 and one reduction peak of 0 05 ma at 0 53 v e 5 appeared in the cathodic biofilms fig 1c the difference in the number of redox peaks and their potentials reflected that interfacial redox active proteins directly interacted with electrodes were affected by the electrode potentials peng et al 2016 yang et al 2019a the formal potentials between anodic and cathodic biofilms were significantly different which indicated that different electron transfer conduits were used by electroactive bacteria for accepting electrons from electrode and donating electrons toward electrodes however cvs of both anodic and cathodic biofilms had a pair of redox peaks e 1 and e 5 where their midpoint redox potential was around 0 45 v these redox peaks represented the presence of main extracellular cytochrome c such as omcs and omcz which were specific redox proteins possessed by electroactive bacteria and could mediate the extracellular electron transfer process yang et al 2019b 3 2 pcp degradation performance of the dual working electrode bes the dual working electrode bes allowed the reductive dechlorination of pcp in the cathodic working electrode and the oxidative mineralization in the anodic working electrode the comparison of bes inoculated with mixed bacteria and abiotic electrochemical system es was investigated to explore the electrochemical and bioelectrochemical degradation of pcp fig 1d and s1 the bes had a remarkable dechlorination activity with pcp dechlorination efficiency of 11 73 while the es had almost no degraded within 9 days the open circuit bes displayed the microbial dechlorination efficiency of pcp 22 fig s1 which was much lower than that of the dual working electrode bes indicating the significance of bioelectrochemical stimulation in dechlorination the feasibility of the dual working electrode bes in pcp removal could be well recognized in fig 1d where the synthetic wastewater with 10 mg l of pcp was faster decontaminated in the dual working electrode bes 84 for 21 days however the removal efficiency of pcp by the anodic or cathodic biofilm alone in a typical three electrode bes was only 17 6 and 20 3 in 21 days respectively an apparent kinetic constant k of 0 098 d 1 could be observed for the bes with the dual working electrode model which was 12 3 and 8 9 fold higher than that of the bes with a single anodic 0 008 d 1 or cathodic 0 011 d 1 working electrode respectively demonstrating the superiority of the dual working electrode bes over traditional bes with a single electrode for the pcp removal the products generated in the constructed bes were detected and ten intermediates i e tecp tcp dcp and mcp were identified fig 1e the intermediate products accumulated on days 10 to 13 and then decreased which suggested that these intermediates could be further degraded by the bioelectrode in the bes the decrease of intermediates indicated the possible mineralization process in the bes which should be performed by the anodic biofilm nonorganic matter content was added in the indigenous medium table s1 this mineralization process could be recognized from the observed biocurrent because it should be generated from the oxidation of organic matters by the anodic biofilm in the bes as reported by previous studies chen et al 2012 olaniran et al 2006 some of cps such as dces and dichloromethane could be used as electron donors for the anaerobic respiration of some microorganisms however the anaerobic dechlorination process of cps was very slow which thereby limited the further mineralization of the pcp in natural environments the as constructed dual working electrode bes had realized the dichlorination of pcp on the cathodic biofilm and mineralization of the degradation products on the anodic biofilm in the same time which provided a new route for the complete degradation of pcp 3 3 physical and community structure of the biofilms in the bes the sem images showed that both anodic and cathodic biofilms were composed of road shaped bacterial cells fig 2 confirming the successful formation of biofilms on the dual working electrode of bes with fluorescence microscopy the distribution of live dead bacteria on biofilms in the start up phase could be revealed fig s2 during the first cycle of the dual working bes the thickness of anodic and cathodic biofilms reached to 36 88 and 31 73 μm respectively table s2 the clsm images showed that the mature anodic biofilm was dense with high cell viability while the cathodic biofilm was clustered with less viability fig 2 the low viability of biofilm on the cathodic working electrode in the bes might attribute to the negative effect of dechlorinated intermediates generated during the reductive dechlorination of pcp xu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 as shown in fig s3 the bacterial community structures for the anodic and cathodic biofilms were highly similar in the bes while bacterial relative abundance varied greatly the abundant bacterial phyla with relative abundance 1 were proteobacteria 93 4 2 5 firmicutes 5 0 1 3 and bacteroidetes 1 2 0 98 in the anodic biofilm however the relative abundance of proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in the cathodic biofilm were 64 5 3 6 16 6 1 2 10 2 1 7 and 3 2 1 1 respectively the most abundant bacterial phyla identified in the both anodic and cathodic biofilms were usually identified in electroactive biofilms marine sediment petroleum contaminated soil and hot water spring lam et al 2019 mani et al 2020 milner et al 2016 zafar et al 2019 at genu level pseudomonas sedimentibacter geobacter achromobacter and comamonas were the dominant genus relative abundance 2 in the anodic biofilm however the dominant genera on the cathodic biofilm were pseudomonas sedimentibacter achromobacter comamonas dysgonomonas petrimonas and dechlorosoma species including pseudomonas geobacter achromobacter and comamonas were commonly identified as electrogenic bacteria subha et al 2019 yu et al 2015 the percentages of pseudomonas and geobacter in the anodic biofilm were higher than those in the cathodic biofilm which might be due to the applied anodic potential that was favorable for the growth of these strains on the electrode feng et al 2018 in additional dysgonomonas petrimonas and dechlorosoma were found to be the predominant microorganisms in the cathodic biofilms in p nitrophenol pnp triphenyl phosphate tphp and 2 chlorophenol degradation hou et al 2019 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2021a which might be key strains for the reductive degradation of pcp on the cathodic electrode 3 4 functional bacteria involved in the complete pcp degradation as revealed by dna sip with 13c pcp the pcp and intermediates concentration was analyzed every 3 days during the 21 day operation cycle 40 of pcp was degraded after 6 days and the content of the residual intermediates content in the system were at a low level thus to better label the pcp degraders biofilms samples from each treatment were harvested on day 6 for dna extraction and ultracentrifugation as shown in fig s3 the relative abundance of microbial communities at phylum and genus levels showed slight difference between the sample from the 12c pcp and 13c pcp treatments in the anodic or cathodic biofilms in both the anodic and cathodic biofilms bacterial 16s rrna levels in fractions with bd values of 1 73 to 1 77 g ml heavy dna fractions were higher for 13c labeled biofilms than those for 12c labeled biofilms fig 3 by comparing the relative abundances of specific otus in each fraction from the 13c pcp and 12c pcp treatments the microorganisms on biofilms responsible for 13c labeled substrate assimilation were identified in the anodic biofilm fig 4 a three bacterial lineages represented by otu 4 otu 104 and otu 135 were enriched in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c pcp treatment indicating their involvement in the pcp mineralization similarly for the cathodic biofilms the relative abundances of otu 4 otu 10 otu 70 and otu 94 were significantly higher only in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c pcp treatments fig 4b indicating that the microorganisms represented by these otus played a primary role in metabolism of pcp intermediates according to blast searches in genbank the representative sequences of the 10 sip identified otus were aligned with sequences of different genera a neighbor joining tree based on partial 16s rrna gene sequences exhibited the phylogenetic positions of these active degraders and other related taxa fig 5 a among the functional bacteria revealed by dna sip only otu 4 was enriched in both anodic and cathodic biofilms suggesting that it had the possibility of bidirectional electron transfer as electron donor or acceptor and played a vital role in both pcp dechlorination and mineralization otu 4 was assigned to the genus comamonas which shared 97 similarity with comamonas testosterone strain y62 genbank accession number mt453860 1 comamonas had been reported for decolorization of various azo dyes and was able to utilize of phenol as the major carbon source arai et al 1999 dave et al 2015 therefore comamonas could participate in the pcp dechlorination in the dual electrode bes moreover dna sip identified that comamonas might involve in the mineralization process of pcp intermediates in both the anodic and cathodic biofilms otu 104 and otu 135 were enriched in 13c dna of the anodic biofilm which provided evidence that otu 104 and otu 135 were responsible for pcp mineralization process otu 104 was classified in the genus of stenotrophomonas and shared 100 similarity with strains stenotrophomonas pictorum uc4105 67 accession number mt435040 1 distinct properties of stenotrophomonas has been proved to be capable of anaerobic nitrate reduction electrode respiration and metabolize petroleum hydrocarbons venkidusamy and megharaj 2016 otu 135 was belonged to the genus geobacter and share 100 similarity with strains unclassified geobacter sp clone fb5 accession number mn866009 1 so far geobacter has been known to be able to remove nitroaromatic compounds by oxidation and chlorinated nitroaromatic compounds by reduction xu et al 2019 however little attention has been paid to investigate whether it is actually involved in the degradation of these pollutants strycharz et al demonstrated that graphite electrodes could provide electrons directly to geobacter lovleyi for microbially catalyzed reductive dechlorination strycharz et al 2008 geobacter only identified in 13c dna of the anodic biofilms indicating that geobacter was involved in the mineralization of pcp otu 10 otu 70 and otu 94 were enriched in the cathodic biofilm tending to possess the function of reductive dechlorination which were also identified as pcp mineralized bacteria by dna sip otu 10 was characterized as pseudomonas which shared 100 similarity with unclassified pseudomonas sp clone otu57 accession number mh549494 it has been reported that pseudomonas could perform reductive dechlorination and denitrification with an electrode as the sole electron donor su et al 2012 wang et al 2015 otu 70 was belonged to the genus methylobacillus and shared 100 similarity with strains methylobacillus flagellates kt accession number nr 074178 1 previous study indicated that methylobacillus exhibited denitrifying and triclosan degrading properties lolas et al 2012 wu et al 2022 in addition methylobacillus was also proved to utilize methanol methylamine protocatechuate kumar and maitra 2016 madhaiyan et al 2013 otu 94 was classified in the genera dechlorosoma which was reported to be able to achieve dechlorination of several cps mezgebe et al 2017 sturchio et al 2003 and might also participate in the degradation of phenol in the bioanode huang et al 2016 several species including pseudomonas methylobacillus and dechlorosoma were found to be responsible for both oxidation and reduction of cps which were verified in the present study 3 5 autotrophic bacteria involved in pcp as revealed by dna sip with 13c nahco3 cps contaminated sites such as aquifer or groundwater environments were frequently oligotrophic in anaerobic or anoxic environment lapworth et al 2012 ye et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to understand the autotrophic dechlorination respiratory bacteria on biocathode using the 13c nahco3 dna sip which will be helpful to understand the underlying microbial mechanisms in the as constructed dual working electrode bes 13c nahco3 as external carbon substates was established for pcp degradation to investigate the potential autotrophic pcp degradation population as the 13c nahco3 dna sip revealed otu 14 otu 24 and otu 33 were enriched in 13c dna in the anodic biofilms fig s4a suggesting they were capable of chemolithoautotrophic metabolism and anode respiration specifically otu 14 belonged to the genus pseudomonas sharing 56 similarity with unclassified pseudomonas sp clone biofilm3 4 accession number eu119034 1 some pseudomonas species such as pseudomonas sp c27 accession number gq241351 and pseudomonas sp h117 accession number ku194211 can perform both autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification chen et al 2013 su et al 2017 besides su et al isolated a novel anaerobic fe ii oxidizing denitrifier strain pseudomonas sp szf15 accession number kp265301 from the sediment who was also an autotrophic bacterium fong et al 2017 otu 24 also assigned to the order burkholderiales but was characterized as belonging to the family burkholderiaceae and shared 89 similarity with delftia lacustris strain 45 accession number mf457528 1 delftia species are facultative chemolithoautotrophic bacteria and are capable for selenite or erythromycin reduction sulfur oxidization and heavy metal resistance liu et al 2018 ren et al 2021 roy and roy 2019 otu 33 was classified in the genera azoarcus which was reported to derive energy for growth from metal oxidation coupled with co2 fixation rhine et al 2006 application of biocathodes benefited the microbial reduction of cps by supplying continuous electrons or providing a favorable redox environment huang et al 2011b otu 4 otu 10 otu 14 and otu 37 were enriched in 13c dna in the cathodic biofilms fig s4b and they were capable of chemolithoautotrophic metabolism reductive dechlorination and cathode respiration a similar phenomena had been observed in the autotrophic biocathode of nitrobenzene tetrachloroethylene and 2 chlorophenol reduction chen et al 2018 liang et al 2014 yang et al 2021b otu 4 and otu 10 were assigned to the genus comamonas and pseudomonas as mentioned above respectively otu 37 was classified in the genus sedimentibacter and shared 100 similarity with unclassified sedimentibacter sp clone b8259127 c04 014 accession number gu216600 1 interestingly comamonas and pseudomonas were enriched in 13c dna extracted from the 13c pcp biofilms on both the anode and cathode suggesting they had dual functions to catalyze both the dichlorination and mineralization furthermore comamonas and pseudomonas were enriched in 13c dna extracted from the cathodic biofilm in the presence of 13c pcp or 13c nahco3 verifying that they might uptake the 13co2 generated from the mineralization of pcp by the anodic biofilm for their growth in the cathodic biofilm 3 6 co occurrence ecological network between eabs enriched on the dual working electrodes it is helpful to understand the microbial degradation mechanisms of target pollutants by exploring the complex interactions between the functional degradation bacteria and other members within the communities luo et al 2021 song et al 2019 the co occurrence ecological networks between the active dechlorinating and mineralizing bacteria for pcp and other core otus in the conventional bes or the dual working electrode bes were performed which were used to explain the complex relationships among the microbial communities during pcp biodegradation fig 5b d generally the 16s rrna gene based network in anode cathode or dual working electrode microcosms consisted of 30 17 nodes 53 33 nodes and 301 35 nodes pairs of significant correlations respectively notably compared with the conventional three electrode bes the functional degradation microorganisms exhibited stronger connections with other core microbes in the dual working electrode bes indicating that the combination of anodic and cathodic strategies could increase the intro interactions of the functional degradation microorganisms within the communities however as the concentrations and types of cps have been proven to affect the degradation performance and microbial community succession ho and liu 2011 sun et al 2012 our results did not fully match the real cps degraders in wastewater but still provided clues to their potential association it was important to note that some bacterial lineages were shared in bioanode or biocathode although the dna sip results showed that different functional degradation microorganisms were involved in dechlorination and mineralization process of pcp our results obtained by dna sip combined with 16s rrna gene sequencing which collaborated on different stages of pcp degradation and were functioning in parallel in the microcosms 4 conclusions in this study a dual working electrode bes and dna sip were combined to explore the potential functional microorganisms in the whole process of pcp degradation in cps contaminated wastewater microbes such as comamonas pseudomonas methylobacillus and dechlorosoma were enriched in the cathodic biofilm for reduction dechlorination of pcp in the dual working electrode bes and their involvement in pcp degradation was confirmed by sip experiments comamonas and pseudomonas were identified to contribute to both reduction dechlorination and mineralization of pcp indicating its pivotal roles in pcp degradation during the microbial remediation pseudomonas unclassified burkholderiaceae azoarcus comamonas and sedimentibacter were enriched on the dual working electrodes by using 13nahco3 dna sip which identified the participation of autotrophic strains in the microbial electrochemical degradation of pcp in the dual working electrode bes under an oligotrophic condition the interactions among the core microbes increased in the dual working electrode bes than that in the traditional single electrode bes which was complied with the increased trends of pcp degradation overall our findings expand more potential of the bes in the field of wastewater treatment and improve our understanding of cps degrading community diversity in wastewater credit authorship contribution statement xixi cai conceptualization methodology writing original draft jibing

15141,bioelectrochemical system bes can effectively promote the reductive dechlorination of chlorophenols cps however the complete degradation of cps with sequential dechlorination and mineralization processes has rarely achieved from the bes here a dual working electrode bes was constructed and applied for the complete degradation of pentachlorophenol pcp combined with dna stable isotope probing dna sip the biofilms attached on the anodic and cathodic electrode in the bes were analyzed to explore the dechlorinating and mineralizing microorganisms results showed that pcp removal efficiency in the dual working bes 84 for 21 days was 4 1 and 4 7 times higher than those of conventional bess with a single anodic or cathodic working electrode respectively based on dna sip and high throughput sequencing analysis the cathodic working electrode harbored the potential dechlorinators comamonas pseudomonas methylobacillus and dechlorosoma and the anodic working enriched the potential intermediate mineralizing bacteria comamonas stenotrophomonas and geobacter indicating that pcp could be completely degraded under the synergetic effect of these functional microorganisms besides the potential autotrophic functional bacteria that might be involved in the pcp dechlorination were also identified by sip labeled with 13c nahco3 our results proved that the dual working bes could accelerate the complete degradation of pcp and enrich separately the functional microbial consortium for the pcp dechlorination and mineralization which has broad potential for bioelectrochemical techniques in the treatment of wastewater contaminated with cps or other halogenated organic compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorophenols stable isotope probing functional degrading bacteria dechlorination mineralization complete degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chlorophenols cps are persistent organic pollutants which are commonly used as herbicides insecticide and preservatives vallecillo et al 1999 pentachlorophenol pcp is the most toxic representative among the cps and regulated as one of the priority pollutants by the us environment protection agency keith and telliard 1979 due to its toxicity and recalcitrance pcp residues have adverse effects on the ecological environments and humans puglisi et al 2009 previous studies had revealed that pcp could be degraded by chemical photochemical and microbial processes el bialy et al 2018 lin et al 2014 silva et al 2001 in terms of microbial biodegradation reductive dichlorination of pcp by anaerobic microbes has been identified as the primary biotransformation mechanism under anerobic conditions shi et al 2022 however the anaerobic dichlorination rate was relatively low due to the high toxicity of pcp and the lack of sustainable electron donors in nature environments moreover current studies have mainly focused on the reductive degradation process of pcp and less attention has been paid to the complete degradation of pcp and the underlying microbial mechanisms bioelectrochemical system bes which combines biological redox with an in vitro electrochemical reaction is a comprehensive microbial electrochemical energy conversion process for oxidation or and reduction using electroactive bacteria eab as catalysts modin and aulenta 2017 the eab can not only output electrons from cells to extracellular electron acceptors but also receive electrons from extracellular electron donors into cells zhang et al 2014 found that a cathodic potential of 500 mv vs standard hydrogen electrode could support the biological dechlorination of pcp to phenol two main mechanisms were previously used to explain pcp dechlorination in the bess kong et al 2014 one was reductive dechlorination in the anode chamber based on the anaerobic co metabolism in which pcp served as a carbon source huang et al 2011a huang et al 2013 the other was reductive dechlorination in the cathode in which pcp accepted the electrons transferred from the bioanode huang et al 2013 based on this theory kong et al 2014 found that it could realize the complete degradation of 4 chlorophenol 4 cp in a sequential biocathode bioanode bes in which 4 cp was dechlorinated at the biocathode and the generated products were further degraded at the bioanode in this regard the combination of biocathode with bioanode was confirmed to be able to achieve the simultaneous dechlorination and mineralization of pcp the sequential biocathode bioanode bes was operated in a two chamber configuration with external circulation of electrolyte solution which required relatively high cost membrane and quite complicated operations moreover current studies have mainly focused on exploring the degradation efficiency of cps in the bes or indirectly verified the role of certain microorganisms in cps degradation through bioaugmentation a more efficiency bes for the complete degradation of pcp is highly desired and the underlying microbial mechanisms in such an integrated degradation process has remained unexplored to date several anaerobic pcp degrading bacteria have been isolated and identified as pseudomonas acinetobacter sphingomonas flavobacterium and desulfitobacterium with cultivation based method lee et al 1998 nohynek et al 1995 saber and crawford 1985 sharma et al 2009 villemur 2013 however these strains represented only a small proportion in nature and most of microbes in biotreatment system or environment are not culturable in addition the cultivation based method cannot account for the complex interactions among individuals within microbial communities cultivation independent stable isotope probing sip is a powerful technique for identifying microbial activities and functions to improve our understanding of bioremediation process li et al 2017b it has been successfully employed stable isotope 13c or 15n to analyze isotope labeled intracellular components rna dna or proteins of functional degraders providing the opportunity to link microbial identities to their functions li et al 2018 currently dna based sip with 13c pcp as a substrate could explore the functional microorganisms responsible for pcp mineralization li et al 2015 tong et al 2015 the sip technique is currently unavailable for identifying directly those dehalogentated bacteria from complex environments because the isotope labeled c in the pcp might not be metabolized by the cells therefore the sip technique could not distinguish those dehalogentated bacteria from the mineralization microbes because some strains might have dual functions by combining the dna sip technique with the dual working electrode bes that could separate the dechlorinating and mineralizing microbes the accurate identification of functional microorganism for the dechlorination and mineralization might be possible thus in this study to degrade efficiently pcp and explore the key microorganisms involved in the complete pcp degradation a dual working electrode bes with a cathodic and anodic working electrode in one reactor was constructed and the functional microorganisms of two processes were spatially separated on the anode and cathode by dna sip with 13c pcp as the only organic substrate the pcp degradation performances in this dual working electrode bes have also been investigated in addition 13c labeled sodium bicarbonate a possible inorganic carbon source for autotrophic microorganisms was used to trace the key autotrophs that might contribute potentially to the pcp dechlorination under oligotrophic environment overall our findings suggest that the dual working electrode bes coupled with dna sip is a powerful tool to identify and distinguish the active microbes responsible for the complete degradation of pcp in the bess 2 materials and methods 2 1 the construction of the bes and pcp degradation the dual working electrode bes reactor was constructed using a 120 ml serum bottle and the bes reactor configuration is shown in fig 1 a carbon cloth 7 cm2 titanium wire and saturated calomel electrode sce were used as the working counter and reference electrodes respectively there were two working electrodes in the same bes including an anodic and a cathodic electrode that controlled by a multi potentiostat chi 1000c chenhua co ltd shanghai china a potential of 500 mv and 200 mv vs sce were applied to the cathodic and anodic working electrodes in the bes respectively which were optimal potential values for acclimation of dechlorinating and mineralizing biofilms for the pcp degradation cai et al 2020 li et al 2017a the bess were inoculated with the mixed bacteria from the pre screened microbes for pcp degradation and details of the microbial screening and enrichment methods were provided in supporting information si the bess were filled with 100 ml of culture medium solution containing 1 l 10 mg of labeled 13c pcp

labeled 13c nahco3 or unlabeled nahco3 were also set up to explore autotrophic dechlorinating bacteria in biofilms in total three treatments were performed including 12c pcp nahco3 12c pcp and 12c nahco3 13c pcp 13c pcp and 12c nahco3 and 13c nahco3 12c pcp and 13c nahco3 pcp degradation performances in the dual working electrode bes have also been investigated which were compared with the traditional three electrode bes configured with a single working electrode in addition control experiments were performed with the open circuit bess to determine the role of pcp acclimatized biofilm in pcp removal in the bess all reactors were operated in triplicate at room temperature without lighting 2 2 analytical methods of the biofilms and pcp the i t curve was recorded with chi1000c the electrochemical properties of the anodic and cathodic biofilm at non turnover conditions were determined with chi660e according to the method previously described hu et al 2022 zhuang et al 2020 the biofilms formed on the carbon cloth were imaged using scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan the live dead baclight viability l7012 thermo fisher scientific usa was applied to observe the viability and thickness of biofilm using a laser confocal scanning microscope clsm leica tcs sp2 germany in addition analyses methods of pcp and intermediate were provided in si file 2 3 biofilm dna extraction and ultracentrifugation the biofilm samples on working electrode after three stable cycles of acclimation were collected from 13c labeled or unlabeled pcp experiments the microbial dna samples were extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa details regarding dna ultracentrifugation and purification were provided in si the bacterial 16s rdna gene was amplified by pcr using the primer set 515f 806r gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa aacgcacgctag ccggactacvsgggtatctaat the pcr products were sequenced using an illumina miseq platform with paired end 2 250 bp pe technology valentino et al 2014 in sip microcosms microorganisms involved in pcp mineralization were distinguished from operational taxonomic units otus enriched in the 13c dna fractions by comparing the anode biofilms of the 13c pcp treatments to that of the 12c pcp microcosms phylogenetic tree analysis was performed by using a previous described procedure li et al 2014 2 4 construction of microbial interaction network in the biofilms the co occurrence ecological network was constructed with the molecular ecological network analysis mena as previously described deng et al 2012 which was applied to investigate the interactions among different microbial lineages within the whole communities of the anodic or cathodic biofilms in the traditional three electrode bes and the dual working electrode bes respectively the network was visualized with the interactive platform gephi 0 9 2 heymann and le grand 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical activities of anodic and cathodic biofilms the bess were operated by feeding nutrient medium containing 10 mg l pcp for 25 d the anodic biocurrent of bes progressively increased and reached a peak of 5 μa fig 1b which indicated that the electroactive bacteria were enriched in anodic biofilms following incubation the cathodic biocurrent was also observed which took 15 d to reach the maximum value 1 8 μa fig 1b obviously the anodic process produced higher current than the cathodic process it was likely because electroactive bacteria donated electrons in the anodic process more efficiently than uptook electrons from electrodes in the cathodic process for each fed batch cycle with the prolonged operation time substrates on the bioanode and biocathode were gradually consumed and depleted resulting in a decrease of biocurrent non turnover cyclic voltammographs cvs were performed to reveal the biocatalytic activities of the anodic and cathodic biofilms enriched with pcp four oxidation peaks of 0 32 ma at 0 42 v e 1 0 50 ma at 0 37 v e 2 0 68 ma at 0 33 v e 3 and 0 431 ma at 0 14 v e 4 and two reduction peaks of 0 29 ma at 0 53 v e 5 and 0 37 ma at 0 43 v e 6 were observed in the anodic biofilms respectively fig 1c comparatively two oxidation peaks of 0 04 ma at 0 42 v e 1 and 0 03 ma at 0 14 v e 4 and one reduction peak of 0 05 ma at 0 53 v e 5 appeared in the cathodic biofilms fig 1c the difference in the number of redox peaks and their potentials reflected that interfacial redox active proteins directly interacted with electrodes were affected by the electrode potentials peng et al 2016 yang et al 2019a the formal potentials between anodic and cathodic biofilms were significantly different which indicated that different electron transfer conduits were used by electroactive bacteria for accepting electrons from electrode and donating electrons toward electrodes however cvs of both anodic and cathodic biofilms had a pair of redox peaks e 1 and e 5 where their midpoint redox potential was around 0 45 v these redox peaks represented the presence of main extracellular cytochrome c such as omcs and omcz which were specific redox proteins possessed by electroactive bacteria and could mediate the extracellular electron transfer process yang et al 2019b 3 2 pcp degradation performance of the dual working electrode bes the dual working electrode bes allowed the reductive dechlorination of pcp in the cathodic working electrode and the oxidative mineralization in the anodic working electrode the comparison of bes inoculated with mixed bacteria and abiotic electrochemical system es was investigated to explore the electrochemical and bioelectrochemical degradation of pcp fig 1d and s1 the bes had a remarkable dechlorination activity with pcp dechlorination efficiency of 11 73 while the es had almost no degraded within 9 days the open circuit bes displayed the microbial dechlorination efficiency of pcp 22 fig s1 which was much lower than that of the dual working electrode bes indicating the significance of bioelectrochemical stimulation in dechlorination the feasibility of the dual working electrode bes in pcp removal could be well recognized in fig 1d where the synthetic wastewater with 10 mg l of pcp was faster decontaminated in the dual working electrode bes 84 for 21 days however the removal efficiency of pcp by the anodic or cathodic biofilm alone in a typical three electrode bes was only 17 6 and 20 3 in 21 days respectively an apparent kinetic constant k of 0 098 d 1 could be observed for the bes with the dual working electrode model which was 12 3 and 8 9 fold higher than that of the bes with a single anodic 0 008 d 1 or cathodic 0 011 d 1 working electrode respectively demonstrating the superiority of the dual working electrode bes over traditional bes with a single electrode for the pcp removal the products generated in the constructed bes were detected and ten intermediates i e tecp tcp dcp and mcp were identified fig 1e the intermediate products accumulated on days 10 to 13 and then decreased which suggested that these intermediates could be further degraded by the bioelectrode in the bes the decrease of intermediates indicated the possible mineralization process in the bes which should be performed by the anodic biofilm nonorganic matter content was added in the indigenous medium table s1 this mineralization process could be recognized from the observed biocurrent because it should be generated from the oxidation of organic matters by the anodic biofilm in the bes as reported by previous studies chen et al 2012 olaniran et al 2006 some of cps such as dces and dichloromethane could be used as electron donors for the anaerobic respiration of some microorganisms however the anaerobic dechlorination process of cps was very slow which thereby limited the further mineralization of the pcp in natural environments the as constructed dual working electrode bes had realized the dichlorination of pcp on the cathodic biofilm and mineralization of the degradation products on the anodic biofilm in the same time which provided a new route for the complete degradation of pcp 3 3 physical and community structure of the biofilms in the bes the sem images showed that both anodic and cathodic biofilms were composed of road shaped bacterial cells fig 2 confirming the successful formation of biofilms on the dual working electrode of bes with fluorescence microscopy the distribution of live dead bacteria on biofilms in the start up phase could be revealed fig s2 during the first cycle of the dual working bes the thickness of anodic and cathodic biofilms reached to 36 88 and 31 73 μm respectively table s2 the clsm images showed that the mature anodic biofilm was dense with high cell viability while the cathodic biofilm was clustered with less viability fig 2 the low viability of biofilm on the cathodic working electrode in the bes might attribute to the negative effect of dechlorinated intermediates generated during the reductive dechlorination of pcp xu et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 as shown in fig s3 the bacterial community structures for the anodic and cathodic biofilms were highly similar in the bes while bacterial relative abundance varied greatly the abundant bacterial phyla with relative abundance 1 were proteobacteria 93 4 2 5 firmicutes 5 0 1 3 and bacteroidetes 1 2 0 98 in the anodic biofilm however the relative abundance of proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and chloroflexi in the cathodic biofilm were 64 5 3 6 16 6 1 2 10 2 1 7 and 3 2 1 1 respectively the most abundant bacterial phyla identified in the both anodic and cathodic biofilms were usually identified in electroactive biofilms marine sediment petroleum contaminated soil and hot water spring lam et al 2019 mani et al 2020 milner et al 2016 zafar et al 2019 at genu level pseudomonas sedimentibacter geobacter achromobacter and comamonas were the dominant genus relative abundance 2 in the anodic biofilm however the dominant genera on the cathodic biofilm were pseudomonas sedimentibacter achromobacter comamonas dysgonomonas petrimonas and dechlorosoma species including pseudomonas geobacter achromobacter and comamonas were commonly identified as electrogenic bacteria subha et al 2019 yu et al 2015 the percentages of pseudomonas and geobacter in the anodic biofilm were higher than those in the cathodic biofilm which might be due to the applied anodic potential that was favorable for the growth of these strains on the electrode feng et al 2018 in additional dysgonomonas petrimonas and dechlorosoma were found to be the predominant microorganisms in the cathodic biofilms in p nitrophenol pnp triphenyl phosphate tphp and 2 chlorophenol degradation hou et al 2019 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2021a which might be key strains for the reductive degradation of pcp on the cathodic electrode 3 4 functional bacteria involved in the complete pcp degradation as revealed by dna sip with 13c pcp the pcp and intermediates concentration was analyzed every 3 days during the 21 day operation cycle 40 of pcp was degraded after 6 days and the content of the residual intermediates content in the system were at a low level thus to better label the pcp degraders biofilms samples from each treatment were harvested on day 6 for dna extraction and ultracentrifugation as shown in fig s3 the relative abundance of microbial communities at phylum and genus levels showed slight difference between the sample from the 12c pcp and 13c pcp treatments in the anodic or cathodic biofilms in both the anodic and cathodic biofilms bacterial 16s rrna levels in fractions with bd values of 1 73 to 1 77 g ml heavy dna fractions were higher for 13c labeled biofilms than those for 12c labeled biofilms fig 3 by comparing the relative abundances of specific otus in each fraction from the 13c pcp and 12c pcp treatments the microorganisms on biofilms responsible for 13c labeled substrate assimilation were identified in the anodic biofilm fig 4 a three bacterial lineages represented by otu 4 otu 104 and otu 135 were enriched in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c pcp treatment indicating their involvement in the pcp mineralization similarly for the cathodic biofilms the relative abundances of otu 4 otu 10 otu 70 and otu 94 were significantly higher only in the heavy dna fractions of the 13c pcp treatments fig 4b indicating that the microorganisms represented by these otus played a primary role in metabolism of pcp intermediates according to blast searches in genbank the representative sequences of the 10 sip identified otus were aligned with sequences of different genera a neighbor joining tree based on partial 16s rrna gene sequences exhibited the phylogenetic positions of these active degraders and other related taxa fig 5 a among the functional bacteria revealed by dna sip only otu 4 was enriched in both anodic and cathodic biofilms suggesting that it had the possibility of bidirectional electron transfer as electron donor or acceptor and played a vital role in both pcp dechlorination and mineralization otu 4 was assigned to the genus comamonas which shared 97 similarity with comamonas testosterone strain y62 genbank accession number mt453860 1 comamonas had been reported for decolorization of various azo dyes and was able to utilize of phenol as the major carbon source arai et al 1999 dave et al 2015 therefore comamonas could participate in the pcp dechlorination in the dual electrode bes moreover dna sip identified that comamonas might involve in the mineralization process of pcp intermediates in both the anodic and cathodic biofilms otu 104 and otu 135 were enriched in 13c dna of the anodic biofilm which provided evidence that otu 104 and otu 135 were responsible for pcp mineralization process otu 104 was classified in the genus of stenotrophomonas and shared 100 similarity with strains stenotrophomonas pictorum uc4105 67 accession number mt435040 1 distinct properties of stenotrophomonas has been proved to be capable of anaerobic nitrate reduction electrode respiration and metabolize petroleum hydrocarbons venkidusamy and megharaj 2016 otu 135 was belonged to the genus geobacter and share 100 similarity with strains unclassified geobacter sp clone fb5 accession number mn866009 1 so far geobacter has been known to be able to remove nitroaromatic compounds by oxidation and chlorinated nitroaromatic compounds by reduction xu et al 2019 however little attention has been paid to investigate whether it is actually involved in the degradation of these pollutants strycharz et al demonstrated that graphite electrodes could provide electrons directly to geobacter lovleyi for microbially catalyzed reductive dechlorination strycharz et al 2008 geobacter only identified in 13c dna of the anodic biofilms indicating that geobacter was involved in the mineralization of pcp otu 10 otu 70 and otu 94 were enriched in the cathodic biofilm tending to possess the function of reductive dechlorination which were also identified as pcp mineralized bacteria by dna sip otu 10 was characterized as pseudomonas which shared 100 similarity with unclassified pseudomonas sp clone otu57 accession number mh549494 it has been reported that pseudomonas could perform reductive dechlorination and denitrification with an electrode as the sole electron donor su et al 2012 wang et al 2015 otu 70 was belonged to the genus methylobacillus and shared 100 similarity with strains methylobacillus flagellates kt accession number nr 074178 1 previous study indicated that methylobacillus exhibited denitrifying and triclosan degrading properties lolas et al 2012 wu et al 2022 in addition methylobacillus was also proved to utilize methanol methylamine protocatechuate kumar and maitra 2016 madhaiyan et al 2013 otu 94 was classified in the genera dechlorosoma which was reported to be able to achieve dechlorination of several cps mezgebe et al 2017 sturchio et al 2003 and might also participate in the degradation of phenol in the bioanode huang et al 2016 several species including pseudomonas methylobacillus and dechlorosoma were found to be responsible for both oxidation and reduction of cps which were verified in the present study 3 5 autotrophic bacteria involved in pcp as revealed by dna sip with 13c nahco3 cps contaminated sites such as aquifer or groundwater environments were frequently oligotrophic in anaerobic or anoxic environment lapworth et al 2012 ye et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to understand the autotrophic dechlorination respiratory bacteria on biocathode using the 13c nahco3 dna sip which will be helpful to understand the underlying microbial mechanisms in the as constructed dual working electrode bes 13c nahco3 as external carbon substates was established for pcp degradation to investigate the potential autotrophic pcp degradation population as the 13c nahco3 dna sip revealed otu 14 otu 24 and otu 33 were enriched in 13c dna in the anodic biofilms fig s4a suggesting they were capable of chemolithoautotrophic metabolism and anode respiration specifically otu 14 belonged to the genus pseudomonas sharing 56 similarity with unclassified pseudomonas sp clone biofilm3 4 accession number eu119034 1 some pseudomonas species such as pseudomonas sp c27 accession number gq241351 and pseudomonas sp h117 accession number ku194211 can perform both autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification chen et al 2013 su et al 2017 besides su et al isolated a novel anaerobic fe ii oxidizing denitrifier strain pseudomonas sp szf15 accession number kp265301 from the sediment who was also an autotrophic bacterium fong et al 2017 otu 24 also assigned to the order burkholderiales but was characterized as belonging to the family burkholderiaceae and shared 89 similarity with delftia lacustris strain 45 accession number mf457528 1 delftia species are facultative chemolithoautotrophic bacteria and are capable for selenite or erythromycin reduction sulfur oxidization and heavy metal resistance liu et al 2018 ren et al 2021 roy and roy 2019 otu 33 was classified in the genera azoarcus which was reported to derive energy for growth from metal oxidation coupled with co2 fixation rhine et al 2006 application of biocathodes benefited the microbial reduction of cps by supplying continuous electrons or providing a favorable redox environment huang et al 2011b otu 4 otu 10 otu 14 and otu 37 were enriched in 13c dna in the cathodic biofilms fig s4b and they were capable of chemolithoautotrophic metabolism reductive dechlorination and cathode respiration a similar phenomena had been observed in the autotrophic biocathode of nitrobenzene tetrachloroethylene and 2 chlorophenol reduction chen et al 2018 liang et al 2014 yang et al 2021b otu 4 and otu 10 were assigned to the genus comamonas and pseudomonas as mentioned above respectively otu 37 was classified in the genus sedimentibacter and shared 100 similarity with unclassified sedimentibacter sp clone b8259127 c04 014 accession number gu216600 1 interestingly comamonas and pseudomonas were enriched in 13c dna extracted from the 13c pcp biofilms on both the anode and cathode suggesting they had dual functions to catalyze both the dichlorination and mineralization furthermore comamonas and pseudomonas were enriched in 13c dna extracted from the cathodic biofilm in the presence of 13c pcp or 13c nahco3 verifying that they might uptake the 13co2 generated from the mineralization of pcp by the anodic biofilm for their growth in the cathodic biofilm 3 6 co occurrence ecological network between eabs enriched on the dual working electrodes it is helpful to understand the microbial degradation mechanisms of target pollutants by exploring the complex interactions between the functional degradation bacteria and other members within the communities luo et al 2021 song et al 2019 the co occurrence ecological networks between the active dechlorinating and mineralizing bacteria for pcp and other core otus in the conventional bes or the dual working electrode bes were performed which were used to explain the complex relationships among the microbial communities during pcp biodegradation fig 5b d generally the 16s rrna gene based network in anode cathode or dual working electrode microcosms consisted of 30 17 nodes 53 33 nodes and 301 35 nodes pairs of significant correlations respectively notably compared with the conventional three electrode bes the functional degradation microorganisms exhibited stronger connections with other core microbes in the dual working electrode bes indicating that the combination of anodic and cathodic strategies could increase the intro interactions of the functional degradation microorganisms within the communities however as the concentrations and types of cps have been proven to affect the degradation performance and microbial community succession ho and liu 2011 sun et al 2012 our results did not fully match the real cps degraders in wastewater but still provided clues to their potential association it was important to note that some bacterial lineages were shared in bioanode or biocathode although the dna sip results showed that different functional degradation microorganisms were involved in dechlorination and mineralization process of pcp our results obtained by dna sip combined with 16s rrna gene sequencing which collaborated on different stages of pcp degradation and were functioning in parallel in the microcosms 4 conclusions in this study a dual working electrode bes and dna sip were combined to explore the potential functional microorganisms in the whole process of pcp degradation in cps contaminated wastewater microbes such as comamonas pseudomonas methylobacillus and dechlorosoma were enriched in the cathodic biofilm for reduction dechlorination of pcp in the dual working electrode bes and their involvement in pcp degradation was confirmed by sip experiments comamonas and pseudomonas were identified to contribute to both reduction dechlorination and mineralization of pcp indicating its pivotal roles in pcp degradation during the microbial remediation pseudomonas unclassified burkholderiaceae azoarcus comamonas and sedimentibacter were enriched on the dual working electrodes by using 13nahco3 dna sip which identified the participation of autotrophic strains in the microbial electrochemical degradation of pcp in the dual working electrode bes under an oligotrophic condition the interactions among the core microbes increased in the dual working electrode bes than that in the traditional single electrode bes which was complied with the increased trends of pcp degradation overall our findings expand more potential of the bes in the field of wastewater treatment and improve our understanding of cps degrading community diversity in wastewater credit authorship contribution statement xixi cai conceptualization methodology writing original draft jibing

15142,per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas are recalcitrant synthetic chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment because of their widespread use in a variety of consumer and industrial products pfas contamination has become an increasing issue in recent years which needs to be urgently addressed foam fractionation is emerging as a potential remediation option that removes pfas by adsorption to the surface of rising air bubbles which are removed from the system as a foam pfas concentrations in the environment are often not sufficient to allow for formation of a foam by itself and often a co foaming agent is required to be added to enhance the foamability of the solution in this study the effect of different classes of co foaming agents anionic non ionic zwitterionic and cationic surfactants on the removal of pfas with varying fluorocarbon chain length from 3 to 8 in a foam fractionation process have been investigated evaluation of the air water interface partitioning coefficient k in addition with surface tension and pfas removal results support the contention that using a co foaming agent with the opposite charge to the pfas in question significantly facilitates the adsorption of pfas to the air water interface enhancing the efficiency of the process using the non ionic surfactant no headgroup electrostatic interaction with pfas as a reference it was observed in terms of pfas separation and rate of pfas removal that anionic co surfactant performed worst zwitterionic was better and cationic co surfactant performed best all of the pfas species were able to be removed below the limit of detection 0 05 µg l after 45 minutes of foaming time with the cationic surfactant keywords foam fractionation pfas water treatment emerging contaminants groundwater data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction pfas are a group of synthetic compounds resistant to thermal microbial and chemical degradation the fluorinated carbon chain imparts desirable oleophobic and hydrophobic properties resulting in the widespread use of pfas in consumer and industrial products such as paper leather lubricants cement metal cleaners and floor polishes as well as its use in foam based fire extinguishers ahrens and bundschuh 2014 prevedouros et al 2006 landfills are the final stage in the life cycle of most of these products and hence the presence of pfas is ubiquitous in landfill leachates even though pfas began to be phased out of many markets in late 2011 contaminated products with extended user lifespans continue to be discarded to landfill and there are also contaminated sites where pfas containing products were dumped before 2011 the long history of pfas use means that closed landfills also contain significant amounts of products that contain pfas and thus the leachates will remain a source of pfas release into the environment for a long time to come the continued release of pfas combined with their recalcitrant nature and large migration potential has led to public exposure through consumption of contaminated food drinking water and dust inhalation begley et al 2008 schaider et al 2017 kaboré et al 2018 björklund et al 2009 bräunig et al 2017 benskin et al 2012 sunderland et al 2019 munoz et al 2017 foam fractionation is a physiochemical process in which surface active compounds such as pfas can be separated from solution by extraction into a rising foam buckley et al 2022 the hydrophobicity imparted by the perfluoroalkyl moieties result in a strong affinity towards the air water interface consequently pfas adsorb to the surface of rising air bubbles and are carried from the liquid into the foam phase which accumulates on the surface of the liquid pool as the foam rises the liquid between adjacent bubbles drains back to the liquid pool and by harvesting the foam at a suitable height above the pool a low volume highly concentrated waste stream can be obtained the foam captures a high concentration of the surfactant pfas at the air liquid interfaces along with a small quantity of interstitial liquid which can be further processed by an energy intensive defluorination or destruction process such as thermal plasma oxidative and reduction technologies and ultrasonication nzeribe et al 2019 the effectiveness of foam fractionation in removal of pfas is related to their hydrophobicity and is subsequently a function of their fluorocarbon carbon chain length with long chain pfas compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa c 6 being more readily removed than short chain compounds c 6 although foam fractionation of anionic pfas has only been reported in the literature it is hypothesised that removal of cationic non ionic and zwitterionic pfas species by foam fractionation will also be similar for species of comparable affinity for the air water interface but not necessarily fluorocarbon chain length it has been reported by smith et al smith et al 2022 and mccleaf et al mccleaf et al 2021 that perfluorinated sulfonic acids are more readily removed by foam fractionation compared to perfluorinated carboxylic acids and sulfonamido acetic acids such as n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid n etfosaa many countries impose regulatory limits on pfas e g in australia the drinking water standard requires less than 0 07 µg l as sum of pfos and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs recently the united states environmental protection agency us epa released interim updated drinking water health advisories for pfos pfoa perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs and ammonium 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoro 2 heptafluoropropoxy propanoate genx of 0 004 0 02 10 and 2000 ng l respectively pfas concentrations in contaminated water systems cover a wide range of concentrations generally in the order of several ng l to µg l bräunig et al 2017 sunderland et al 2019 munoz et al 2017 benskin et al 2012 kurwadkar et al 2022 thompson et al 2011 lenka et al 2021 these molar concentrations are not high enough to impact the physical and chemical properties of the solution for example the surface tension of a dilute solution of pfoa does not exhibit a discernible change until the concentration reaches above approximately 1 mg l or 1000 µg l costanza et al 2019 brusseau 2019 concentrations rarely seen in wastewater or in contaminated public environments it is therefore necessary in a foam fractionation separation process to add a co foaming agent to create a foam layer that can be harvested lowering of the surface tension by adding a co foaming agent also has the beneficial effect of reducing the size of bubbles sparged into the system by inhibiting the bubble coalescence amani et al 2021 amani and firouzi 2022 the smaller bubble size increases the amount of bubble surface area available for pfas adsorption and removal buckley et al 2022 co foaming additives are typically hydrocarbon surfactants however the specific choice of agent or even the class of co foaming agent or the best concentration for this duty is not well established another consideration is that short chain pfas i e with fluorocarbon tails less than 5 carbons long do not respond well in sorption based technologies including activated carbon park et al 2020 ross et al 2018 cantoni et al 2021 pauletto and bandosz 2022 gagliano et al 2020 ion exchange ross et al 2018 woodard et al 2017 murray et al 2021 boyer et al 2021 and foam fractionation buckley et al 2022 burns et al 2021 burns et al 2022 a co foaming agent may also offer an opportunity for use as a collector by electrostatically pairing with the pfas and removing the conjoined species in a mechanism similar to metal ion foam fractionation ghosh et al 2019 despite reports on the use of co foaming agents to facilitate pfas removal buckley et al 2022 taseidifar 2020 there is lack of information related to the phenomenological behaviour explaining the influence of co surfactants on pfas and its removal behaviour 1 1 use of co foaming agent for pfas separation from landfill leachate the applicability of foam fractionation to remediation of pfas from landfill leachate has been extensively demonstrated in the literature smith et al 2022 mccleaf et al 2021 burns et al 2022 vo et al 2023 in our earlier investigation we examined the effect of different classes of co foaming agents on the foam fractionation of pfas from landfill leachate and extracted the air water partitioning coefficient k vo et al 2023 the complexity of the leachate matrix provided a hindrance to understanding and deducing the mechanistic behaviour of the different co surfactants on the separation fig 1 shows the results from vo et al vo et al 2023 showing the air water partitioning coefficient determined for different pfas in each system with different co foaming agents the molar volume is a size descriptor for the pfas molecules similar to the molar mass where short chain pfas such as pfba and pfbs have a molar volume of 129 5 and 185 5 cm3 mol respectively whilst larger molecules such as pfos has a molar volume of 297 5 cm3 mol vo et al 2023 the data showed the decreasing trend of pfas separation as the c f chain length related to the species hydrophobicity reduced with a sharp reduction in the separation factor for small pfas species the order of separation effectiveness follows the charge of the co foaming surfactant headgroup with cationic performing the best followed by zwitterionic and then non ionic however the presence of other contaminants in the leachate such as salts and dissolved organic matter also contributed to the overall separation and the adsorption of pfas k therefore there is a need to investigate the interactions in a system free from other contaminants so the removal mechanisms for each co foaming agent can be elucidated 1 2 scope the focus of this paper is on the interaction between pfas and the co foaming agent in question therefore to isolate this effect as much as possible we performed experiments in a system of ro water with minimal background salt concentration in this work co foaming agents from different surfactant classes having anionic sodium dodecyl sulphate sds non ionic triton x 100 zwitterionic lauryl sulfobetaine sb3 12 and cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab headgroups are used to determine their comparative behaviour for removal of pfas by foam fractionation and to test their relative effectiveness as collectors especially for removal of short chain pfas the pfas chosen for this study were pfos pfoa pfhxs perfluorobutanoic acid pfba pfbs and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulphonate 6 2 fts 2 conceptual development for simplicity we assume i for the low concentrations in water usually applied to pfas remediation mixed surfactant entities in solution behave in accordance with ideal solution theory i e at equilibrium the surface excess of each species is proportional to the concentration in the associated bulk liquid and they act independently this applies when the surface coverage of the gas liquid interface is low e g for low surfactant concentrations and high surface availability ii the surface excess isotherm is linear brusseau and van glubt 2021 brusseau 2021 i e a langmuir isotherm applies to all species at low concentrations it is hypothesised that for foam fractionation an appropriate co surfactant may also act as a collector by interacting and binding with other surfactants here pfas present particularly if the electrostatic charge of the headgroups is opposite to that of the pfas this effectively forms a new surface active moiety in solution fig 2 shows a visual representation of the proposed mechanism for removal of pfas from each system in summary we are proposing that pfas removal takes place through two mechanisms 1 pfas adsorbs to the air water interface due to its own surface activity and does not interact significantly with the co foaming agent 2 pfas with opposing charge to the co foaming agent binds with the co foaming agent in solution or at the interface and the conjoined entity collects at the interface removal by the first mechanism can be predicted based on the surface activity or adsorption isotherm of the pfas species in question which provides the surface excess and hence increased amount of pfas removed on each bubble surface brusseau 2019 in systems where the co foaming agent has the same or opposite charge to the pfas the removal will be either decreased or increased respectively due to the electrostatic interactions between the surfactants headgroups this is especially of interest for pfas with low surface activity i e the short chain pfas which remain solvated in the liquid and are poorly removed by foam fractionation together with oppositely charged co foaming agent the relatively high concentration of co foaming agent on the interface high ratio of co foaming agent to pfas in the liquid pool of approximately 1000 1 with an attractively positively charged headgroup presenting in the liquid fig 2 bottom left and right affords additional opportunity for conjoining with the pfas which we propose provides a mechanism for enhanced separation and capture 3 materials and method 3 1 apparatus and setup six different types of pfas were procured from different sources to the best available purity pfhxs 97 purity was purchased from boc sciences 6 2 fts 98 purity was purchased from apollo scientific pfos 40 purity pfoa 95 purity pfbs 97 purity and pfba 97 purity in acid form were purchased from merck the co surfactants sds ctab triton x 100 and sb3 12 and sodium chloride nacl were procured from merck acs reagent 99 purity all solutions for foam fractionation tests were prepared using ro water with electrical conductivity of 10 1 µs cm2 nacl was also added in the foam fractionation stock solution to provide a background salt concentration of 0 5 mm all solutions for surface tension measurements were prepared using milli q water with resistivity of 18 2 mω the foam fractionation column is the same as described in an earlier report buckley et al 2022 and a schematic diagram is shown in fig 3 in brief the foam fraction column is a perspex column 60 cm tall with internal diameter of 14 cm containing 8 l of liquid and with adequate headspace for foam formation liquid is drawn from the base of the column by a pump and recirculated into the column after passing through a mazzei c venturi which draws air into the recirculating liquid and the aerated liquid is introduced back into the column the liquid recirculation flowrate was kept constant at 15 l min by throttling the flow with a gate valve the flowrate of air drawn through the venturi was also measured using an inline flowmeter in the air suction line of the venturi the injected bubbles travel upwards in the column at a rate determined by the bubble rise velocity which depends on the bubble size the bubble size is a function of recirculation liquid and induced gas flowrates venturi design and liquid properties predominantly surface tension the liquid recirculation line also includes an inline plate heat exchanger to maintain the system temperature at 23 c a solution of the co foaming agent was continuously introduced during an experiment through a peristaltic dosing pump which injected the co surfactant into the suction pipe of the liquid recirculation line at a constant flowrate of 0 5 ml min a sample port at the bottom of the column was used to extract 10 ml of solution at predetermined intervals of time a vacuum pump connected to a funnel was placed 28 cm above the liquid level of the column to extract the foam and to maintain the foam height for the duration of the experiment 3 2 semi batch foam fractionation experiments the experiments were run in semi batch mode that is the main body of liquid in the column is processed as a batch with respect to pfas and the concentration of pfas changes dynamically over the course of the experiments but the co surfactant is continuously fed into the system at a rate of 2 5 mg min and consequently attains and runs in the process at a steady concentration having a constant co surfactant concentration ensures consistent bubble formation and foam behaviour over the test duration before each experiment the column the recirculation pump and connecting pvc pipes were washed thoroughly with ro water a pfas standard solution containing a fixed amount of all 6 pfas i e pfba pfbs pfhxs pfoa 6 2 fts and pfos was used for the batch foam fractionation experiments and was added to the column prior to each experiment the average initial pfas concentration used in all experiments was standard deviation 46 5 3 5 6 7 0 8 43 4 4 6 48 0 7 0 23 4 8 1 and 58 6 1 µg l for pfba pfbs pfhxs pfoa pfos and 6 2 fts respectively the solution in the column was topped up with ro water to a desired initial level and the liquid was well mixed by running the recirculation pump for 2 minutes without sparging air through the venturi this was followed by acquiring the initial liquid sample from the sample port sample at t 0 min pfas loss due to adsorption to the perspex column and auxiliary piping is expected to be negligible due to the low surface area compared to the area of air water interfacial area in the column 2000 m2 during the experiment the foam height was monitored over time which grew at an increasing rate as co surfactant concentration in the liquid increased slowly until the foam reached the extraction height the bubbly liquid pool is observed to be well mixed since the recirculation rate 15 l min is large compared to the volume of liquid in the foam fractionation column 8 l and there is also a significant amount of turbulence as a result of jet mixing this is confirmed by the very high calculated peclet number pe the binary diffusion coefficients for pe and other important characteristics of the co foaming agents are provided in table 1 samples were taken from the liquid pool in the column after 5 10 20 30 45 and 60 minutes when the foam reached the collection height which was set at 28 cm above the liquid pool the vacuum pump was turned on and used to extract the foam from the system the experiment was stopped after 60 minutes runtime or if the vacuum pump collection vessel became full representing a total foamate volume of approximately 1400 ml 3 3 surface tension measurements solutions of different surfactant in combination with pfoa were prepared and analysed using pat 1m bubble drop profile analysis tensiometer from sinterface germany the tensiometer was calibrated using the reference liquid method with milli q water having resistivity of 18 2 mω all measurements were carried out using the buoyant bubble method at 25 c and calibration was carried out prior to each different sample with each sample being analysed 3 times to ensure repeatability and accuracy of the results 3 4 pfas sample preparation and analysis a total of six different pfas were analysed in this study using the isotope dilution method the native isotopically labelled pfas standards used included 13c4 pfba 13c3 pfbs 18o2 pfhxs 13c4 pfoa 13c4 pfos and 13c2 6 2 fts a 0 5 ml aliquot of pfas sample was added to a high density polyethylene hdpe vial and spiked with 10 µl of the mass labelled internal standard 0 2 mg l and vortexed pfas samples were analysed with a shimadzu high pressure liquid chromatography hplc system coupled with mass spectrometer qtrap ms 5500 qqq ms 6500 ab sciex operating in electronic spray ionization esi and multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode a volume of 7 µl of sample was injected into a 100 2 1 mm 3 µm column restek 19051323 c18 maintained at a constant temperature of 40 c separation of pfas was achieved by gradient elution from the column using 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0 05 acetic acid in milli q water and methanol for the aqueous and organic phases respectively a pre column cartridge is installed between the solvent mixer and the injector to trap non target compounds present in the samples the limit of quantification loq value did not exceed 0 05 µg l for all pfas samples identification and confirmation of peaks was completed using retention times and comparing ratios of mrm transition area between the samples and calibration standards in the same analytical batch calibration standards were prepared in the concentration range of 0 05 100 µg l data acquisition and processing was carried out using analyst and multiquant 3 03 sciex software a set of procedural blanks milli q water were analysed together with the batch samples to monitor contamination during sample preparation and as carry over calibration standards were run before and after pfas samples to monitor sensitivity drift the concentration of pfas in all of the carry over and blank samples were below the limit of detection the peak areas of the internal standards used in the analysis were compared to a reference sample called non extraction side spiked ness sample that was injected with each batch the ness was prepared by adding analytical grade methanol and milli q water spiked with a known concentration of pfas compounds using stock made from analytical standards and the same internal standards that were spiked to each of the samples the recoveries of each internal standard in the injected samples were calculated to be average 95 ci 83 9 2 7 for 13c4 pfba 88 3 2 4 for 13c3 pfbs 88 0 3 3 for 18o2 pfhxs 85 5 3 3 for 13c4 pfoa 81 8 4 5 for 13c2 6 2fts and 71 5 6 7 for 13c4 pfos and all samples used had internal standard recoveries within the tolerable limit of 50 150 for each sample and pfas analyte investigated in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 effectiveness of pfas removal using different surfactants the removal of different pfas into the foam phase is calculated by eq 1 where cfeed is the concentration of each pfas in the column before the recirculation pump that initiated the air drawn by the venturi was turned on and bubbles were sparged into the system ct 30 is the concentration of pfas in the liquid pool after sparging air into the system for 30 minutes 1 removal 1 c t 30 c f e e d the removal is specific to the process configuration since it is affected by process considerations e g the duration of an experiment the arrangement e g the foam collection height equipment e g bubble generation mechanism and chemistry the composition and concentration of co surfactant in the liquid pool amongst others however it provides a useful initial comparison of the effectiveness of the foam separation process and of the different co surfactants which were investigated since most of these factors affecting separation are consistent between experiments in order to assist with the comparison of the different systems the removal data after 30 minutes of operating the foam fractionation system is shown despite the total experiment runtime being 60 minutes a simple observation from fig 4 confirms that short chain pfas e g pfba are removed more poorly lower recovery than pfas with longer fluorocarbon chains e g pfos except when a cationic surfactant was used as the co foaming agent also the removal of pfas species follows the order of cationic co surfactant best followed by the zwitterionic surfactant and then the non ionic and anionic surfactants the trend is distinct in the case of shorter chain pfas such as pfba pfbs pfhxs though less discernible for pfoa pfos and 6 2fts since these are essentially completely removed in 30 minutes for all of the co surfactants in fig 4 the removal after 30 minutes is shown as a percentage however if we were to instead consider the removal after a shorter period then the removal of pfas using each species would show the removal trend follows the order of cationic zwitterionic non ionic anionic as also shown later in fig 5 similarly if we consider the removal after t infinity then the removal of each species would be 100 for each co surfactant we consider 30 mins to be indicative of a reasonable residence time for a commercial process and chose to evaluate the removal after this time we may consider first as the reference case where there is no electrostatic interaction between the co foaming agent and the pfas i e for a non ionic surfactant for pfba which is the least surface active pfas in the mixture there was effectively zero removal for the longer fluorocarbon chain pfas the relative removal of the different species follows their surface activity as reported elsewhere brusseau 2019 tamaki et al 1989 lunkenheimer et al 2015 silva et al 2021 i e removal of pfba pfbs pfhxs pfoa 6 2 fts pfos the cationic co surfactant facilitated almost complete removal of all the three shorter chain pfas viz pfba pfbs and pfhxs mainly due to the electrostatic interaction attraction between the head groups of the cationic co surfactant and anionic pfas which supports more effective capture the zwitterionic surfactant which contains both positive and negative charges also exhibited better removal of short chain pfas in comparison to the non ionic co surfactant with greater than 99 8 removal for pfbs and pfhxs the anionic co surfactant which has a repulsive interaction with the adsorbed pfas was even lower than that of non ionic thus indicating a negative effect in comparison to non ionic co foaming agent all of these observations are qualitatively consistent with the explanations above related to fig 2 in the following sections we seek to quantify the process relationships 4 2 rate of pfas removal using different surfactants the governing principles for foam fractionation are based on the mass and equilibrium balances that apply within the system at steady state the rate of pfas removal from the column can be expressed as 2 d v c b d t s b γ w f 0 c b here v is the liquid pool volume which changes as foam is extracted from the system cb is the bulk concentration of pfas in the liquid pool µg l sb is the rate at which bubble surface area is generated into the foam m2 min г is the amount of pfas adsorbed on the surface of bubbles per unit area µg m2 and wf 0 is the net flowrate of liquid being removed from the system by the foam extraction system m3 min the foam formation system is assumed to be at steady state hence to maintain continuity the liquid flowrate at the foam liquid interface wf0 is equal to that extracted by the vacuum foam collection system the pfas surface excess г is assumed to be related to the bulk concentration cb by a linear isotherm see section 2 conceptual development with k representing the partitioning coefficient eq 3 3 γ k c b the surface area flux sb m2 min is given by 4 s b 3 g r b g is the air flow rate into the system through the venturi m3 min and rb is the average bubble size in the liquid pool m in this work the balance eqs 2 4 are solved as described below the left hand term in eq 2 d v c b d t represents the rate at which pfas species are removed from the liquid pool and provides an indication as to which pfas can be successfully removed by foam fractionation with different co foaming agents this is shown in fig 5 from the data shown in fig 5 it is immediately apparent that the long chain pfas are quickly extracted with the pool concentration dropping below the detection limit within 20 minutes of operation for all types of co surfactants except anionic substitution of eq 3 into eq 2 shows that the rate of decline on pfas is 1st order with respect to pool concentration cb provided that the values of sb and wf0 are constant both of these are overwhelmingly dominated by the co surfactant which is at a much higher concentration than the pfas since the co surfactant is continuously fed into the system at a constant rate over the course of an experiment its concentration in the pool becomes steady after an initial short stabilisation period once this occurs sb and wf0 become constant and the first order removal kinetics for pfas are established a trend which is confirmed by the experimental outcomes and which is quantified later in the paper this study seeks to illuminate how the interaction between co surfactant and pfas species changes the foam fractionation effectiveness so it is necessary to remove the confounding influences the co surfactant in a particular system design causes changes to the process terms in eqs 2 4 through three main mechanisms i the average bubble size rb which determines the rate at which interfacial area is made available for separation at a particular air supply rate ii the extent of interstitial liquid drainage before the foam is harvested which affects the value of v the liquid pool volume and iii possible interactions with the pfas species changing the surface excess i e the partitioning coefficient between the liquid concentration and the air water interface in order to evaluate the third mechanism iii it is necessary to remove the confounding factors of i and ii and this may be accomplished by direct measurement the pool volume v in these experiments declines slowly as foam is harvested the quantity of which is measured the quantity of foam that is removed depends on the dryness of the foam a function of the position i e height of the foam column above the liquid foam interface and the drainage rate of the foam and thereby size of bubbles in these experiments the amount of foam harvested is small compared with the starting volume so v hardly changes but it is important from a practical perspective since it has a large effect on the enrichment a measure of the effectiveness of the process separation the balances namely eqs 2 and 4 are most conveniently made at the liquid pool foam interface at this location the bubbles are in direct contact with the well mixed liquid pool so the associated concentration is equivalent to the bulk pool concentration cb it also provides a consistent position for measuring the size distribution of bubbles that is in the first layer of foam before any coalescence or ripening occurs and then obtaining rb as the sauter mean of the distribution at this level in the column bubble size was measured using a usb digital microscope and imagej image processing software and is shown in table 2 the surface area flux was then obtained from average bubble surface area and the total airflow rate g 5 2 slpm introduced into the system which was measured on a digital flowmeter the steady state concentration of the co surfactant in the pool is estimated as follows noting that the foam was recovered at a constant rate using a vacuum extraction unit at a fixed height of 28 cm above the liquid foam interface steady state in the co surfactant mass flux through the column occurs when foam harvesting commences the time taken to reach the extraction height multiplied by the co surfactant dosing rate dr therefore provides the steady state amount of co surfactant in the column which includes the mass in the liquid pool and in the foam just below the extraction point the liquid fraction in the foam leaving the column ε is obtained by dividing the foamate collection rate wf0 by the sum of the air flowrate g and foamate collection rate at the point where the foam is first harvested and the system has reached steady state with respect to co surfactant liquid pool concentration cco the rate of removal of co surfactant in the foam is equal to the rate at which co surfactant is being added to the system using the measured liquid fraction the surface excess of co surfactant гco in the foamate can be obtained eq 5 5 d r γ co 3 g r b ε g c c o the above balance is subject to the assumption that the foam held up inside the column is taken to have composition and density comparable to the extracted foamate this is true if the foam extraction height is small subsequently from a simple mass balance co surfactant content may be calculated and hence steady state quantity and concentration of co surfactant in the liquid pool estimated table 2 the residual co foaming agent concentration in the liquid pool may contribute to an increased chemical oxygen demand cod or dissolved organic carbon doc content in the process effluent depending on the site specific requirements for the foam fractionation process and where the effluent stream is being discharged e g to groundwater aquifer sewer system or natural waterway the toxicity of the chosen hydrocarbon co foaming agent may need to be considered and further treatment steps taken to further reduce the concentration in the liquid pool this could include for example a secondary foam fractionation step with a treatment objective of reducing the concentration of the co foaming agent since the same dosing rate was maintained for all the co surfactants and the extraction height was fixed the minimum liquid pool concentration for a given co surfactant determines the period of unsteady state foam growth in the column as ctab the cationic co surfactant had the lowest liquid pool concentration the foam growth rate was fastest with larger bubble size on the contrary the anionic and zwitterionic co surfactant exhibited a slow foam growth frequent bubble collapsing during the initial phase of foam formation until the steady state foam formation and extraction commences a comparison of the chemical interaction effects of different co surfactants for various pfas species is provided by considering their removal with respect to interfacial surface area passed through the fractionator as opposed to bubbling time using eq 4 to provide the transposition the gas rate is constant in all the experiments but using cumulative surface area serves to present the results in a way that also accounts for the different bubble size associated with each of the various co surfactants we only consider the data collected after the foam harvesting has commenced and steady state has been reached and omit the initial unsteady period where the co foaming agent is still accumulating in the column the results are shown in fig 6 from fig 6 it is immediately apparent that the removal rates for all pfas species are significantly affected by the type of co surfactant with the effectiveness being cationic zwitterionic non ionic anionic for short chain pfas the same trend is observed for long chain pfas however the difference between cationic and zwitterionic co surfactant is less pronounced due to the near complete removal of these pfas species by the first data point collected after the system had reached steady state once steady state is achieved with respect to the bubbling and foaming regime i e the co foaming agent concentration in the pool has become constant the pfas removal follows a first order trend with time buckley et al 2022 we now address the evaluation of the constant k in the equilibrium eq 3 which is necessary in order to solve the process design eqs 2 4 it provides key insights into the interactions between the pfas species and the co foaming agents 4 3 estimation of pfas air water partitioning coefficient k the modelling of the removal of pfas was carried out following the same method as our previous study buckley et al 2022 eqs 2 and 4 were solved simultaneously by fitting k to the experimental data using a sum of squares regression the resultant k values from the model fitting are shown in table 3 the k values in table 3 represent the partitioning of individual pfas species by both mechanisms previously explained under the heading conceptual development we consider the non ionic surfactant as the reference case where there is no effect from the charge of the surfactant headgroup on the pfas removal and the removal of pfas only occurs as a direct result of their surface activity i e only by mechanism 1 comparatively the k values for the anionic surfactant sds were significantly lower which may be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between surfactant headgroups adsorbed at the interface reducing the pfas removal values for k could not be calculated for pfba and pfbs using the anionic co foaming agent and for pfba using the non ionic co foaming agent since insignificant removal was observed the cationic and zwitterionic co foaming agents which have positive charge in the surfactant headgroup had much higher k values for all pfas species ascribed to the attractive headgroup interactions and conjoining of the pfas and co surfactant which then acts like a collector that is due to mechanism 2 table 3 provides that the k values for both cationic and zwitterionic co foaming agents are quite similar although it is difficult to distinguish which is higher due to the fact that from fig 6 it can be seen that almost complete removal 75 is observed in both systems after the first data point it is also important to note that the steady state concentration of the cationic surfactant in the pool is approximately an order of magnitude less than for the zwitterionic surfactant table 2 mechanistically it seems most reasonable to assume the conjunction of the pfas and co surfactants mainly occurs in the turbulent and well mixed liquid pool and consequently the extent of pairing will be proportional to the concentration of co surfactant in the liquid pool in terms of headgroup interaction and separation effectiveness this implies that the electrostatic attraction between the pfas and the cationic surfactant is stronger than the interaction between the pfas and the zwitterionic surfactant which would be the expectation based on mechanism 2 described in the conceptual development section above to provide evidence to support this equilibrium surface tension was measured using a drop profile analysis tensiometer the data was collected by measuring the dynamic surface tension of solutions stabilised by 10 ppm of each co foaming agent and comparing the effect when 10 ppm of pfoa was added to the solution as a model species 10 ppm was chosen as the concentration since this was the lowest concentration that allowed for a measurable and discernible difference between each co foaming agent at lower concentrations the same trend appeared but the higher concentration is used for illustrative clarity surface tension of the liquid containing a fixed amount of surfactant can be used as a diagnostic tool table 4 shows the reduction in equilibrium surface tension of a milli q water solution resulting from adding 10 ppm of pfoa into solutions of different co foaming agents also at 10 ppm concentration the relative reduction in surface tension as a result of the additional surfactant in each of the different systems provides insight into the extent of interactions between the molecules the surface tension is hypothesised to decrease more in the case where the charge of the headgroup of the surfactant is opposite to that of the pfoa molecule i e cationic co surfactant it is also expected that for a co foaming agent with no electrostatic polarisation non ionic that the change in surface tension will be minimal due to the low concentrations of surfactant employed the equilibrium surface tension of a 10 ppm solution of pfoa in milli q water was measured to be 72 6 mn m from table 4 the interactions clearly follow the degree of electrostatic interactions of the co surfactant headgroup strongest attraction between the cationic co surfactant and pfoa which resulted in the highest reduction of the surface tension of the co surfactant only supporting the explanation provided above 4 4 comparison of pfas removal using opposite charged co foaming agent in low and high salinity systems to assess the performance of the co foaming agent as a collector in a remediation scenario we compare data obtained from this extremely low salinity 0 5 mm nacl study with data collected in our previously published work vo et al 2023 using saline landfill leachate conducted on the same foam fractionation apparatus operating under the same conditions the leachate used in the published study had a total dissolved solids concentration tds greater than 1934 mg l with cation concentrations of 1215 6 4 0 mg l sodium na 577 2 2 3 mg l potassium k 86 5 2 2 mg l calcium ca2 and magnesium 55 0 0 6 mg l mg2 the experiments conducted so far in this current study have all been carried out in a system with minimum background salt concentration so the ion specific effects of each class of co foaming agent on the removal of pfas by foam fractionation could be investigated in fig 7 we compare the data from both the studies and observe that cationic and zwitterionic surfactants have the capacity to act as a collector to assist with removal of short chain pfas for systems with low background salt and absence of other co contaminants from fig 1 and 7 no removal of pfas compounds with molar volume vm 150 cm3 mol was observed from the saline leachate even in the presence of cationic and zwitterionic co foaming agent which is in contrast to the findings in the test with low salt concentrations wherein both co foaming agents exhibited strong removal and high k values for both pfba and pfbs interestingly for larger pfas molecules it was observed that the separation factor was higher in the leachate as opposed to the low salinity system in which the hydrophobic effects dominate the separation factor and the contribution of electrostatic attraction for separation is minimal this increase is attributed to the complex composition of the landfill leachate that may contain other species which also influence the pfas adsorption to the interface i e high salinity dissolved organic matter hydrocarbons the anionic and non ionic co foaming agent not shown in fig 7 have no effect on collection and only influence the surface area available for pfas adsorption the reduction in collector effectiveness observed in fig 7 for a saline landfill leachate indicates that the selection of co foaming agent is impacted by the background salt concentration of the water to be treated therefore the salt concentration and type may influence the choice and selection of co foaming agent for a foam fractionation process 5 conclusion the effect of different co foaming agents on the removal of pfas by a foam fractionation process has been investigated by examining the effects of 4 different classes of surfactants anionic cationic non ionic and zwitterionic the major findings from the investigation were the long chain pfas pfoa pfos 6 2 fts were readily removed by all classes of co foaming surfactant the choice of co foaming agent with a cationic headgroup allowed for removal of short chain pfas pfba and pfbs the removal was greater for the surfactant with a cationic headgroup compared to the zwitterionic surfactant which had both cationic and anionic headgroups the removal was generally better when using the co surfactants containing an opposing charge to the pfas cationic and zwitterionic and poorest with the non ionic and anionic co surfactant pairing of pfas with the co foaming agent predominantly occurs in the well mixed liquid pool rather than at the air water interface which is relatively more stagnant the presence of co contaminants in landfill leachate can significantly impact the collection mechanism by which short chain pfas can be removed the choice of co foaming agent to utilise for the removal of pfas by foam fractionation can have a significant effect on the removal rate due to the effect on foam characteristics and subsequent effect on the surface flux it can also impact the pfas removal which may be inhibiting or synergistic with the head groups of the pfas molecules our results indicated that cationic surfactants are best suited for the removal of anionic pfas such as those of high environmental concern and should be effective even for short carbon chain length pfas species declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15142,per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas are recalcitrant synthetic chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment because of their widespread use in a variety of consumer and industrial products pfas contamination has become an increasing issue in recent years which needs to be urgently addressed foam fractionation is emerging as a potential remediation option that removes pfas by adsorption to the surface of rising air bubbles which are removed from the system as a foam pfas concentrations in the environment are often not sufficient to allow for formation of a foam by itself and often a co foaming agent is required to be added to enhance the foamability of the solution in this study the effect of different classes of co foaming agents anionic non ionic zwitterionic and cationic surfactants on the removal of pfas with varying fluorocarbon chain length from 3 to 8 in a foam fractionation process have been investigated evaluation of the air water interface partitioning coefficient k in addition with surface tension and pfas removal results support the contention that using a co foaming agent with the opposite charge to the pfas in question significantly facilitates the adsorption of pfas to the air water interface enhancing the efficiency of the process using the non ionic surfactant no headgroup electrostatic interaction with pfas as a reference it was observed in terms of pfas separation and rate of pfas removal that anionic co surfactant performed worst zwitterionic was better and cationic co surfactant performed best all of the pfas species were able to be removed below the limit of detection 0 05 µg l after 45 minutes of foaming time with the cationic surfactant keywords foam fractionation pfas water treatment emerging contaminants groundwater data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction pfas are a group of synthetic compounds resistant to thermal microbial and chemical degradation the fluorinated carbon chain imparts desirable oleophobic and hydrophobic properties resulting in the widespread use of pfas in consumer and industrial products such as paper leather lubricants cement metal cleaners and floor polishes as well as its use in foam based fire extinguishers ahrens and bundschuh 2014 prevedouros et al 2006 landfills are the final stage in the life cycle of most of these products and hence the presence of pfas is ubiquitous in landfill leachates even though pfas began to be phased out of many markets in late 2011 contaminated products with extended user lifespans continue to be discarded to landfill and there are also contaminated sites where pfas containing products were dumped before 2011 the long history of pfas use means that closed landfills also contain significant amounts of products that contain pfas and thus the leachates will remain a source of pfas release into the environment for a long time to come the continued release of pfas combined with their recalcitrant nature and large migration potential has led to public exposure through consumption of contaminated food drinking water and dust inhalation begley et al 2008 schaider et al 2017 kaboré et al 2018 björklund et al 2009 bräunig et al 2017 benskin et al 2012 sunderland et al 2019 munoz et al 2017 foam fractionation is a physiochemical process in which surface active compounds such as pfas can be separated from solution by extraction into a rising foam buckley et al 2022 the hydrophobicity imparted by the perfluoroalkyl moieties result in a strong affinity towards the air water interface consequently pfas adsorb to the surface of rising air bubbles and are carried from the liquid into the foam phase which accumulates on the surface of the liquid pool as the foam rises the liquid between adjacent bubbles drains back to the liquid pool and by harvesting the foam at a suitable height above the pool a low volume highly concentrated waste stream can be obtained the foam captures a high concentration of the surfactant pfas at the air liquid interfaces along with a small quantity of interstitial liquid which can be further processed by an energy intensive defluorination or destruction process such as thermal plasma oxidative and reduction technologies and ultrasonication nzeribe et al 2019 the effectiveness of foam fractionation in removal of pfas is related to their hydrophobicity and is subsequently a function of their fluorocarbon carbon chain length with long chain pfas compounds such as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa c 6 being more readily removed than short chain compounds c 6 although foam fractionation of anionic pfas has only been reported in the literature it is hypothesised that removal of cationic non ionic and zwitterionic pfas species by foam fractionation will also be similar for species of comparable affinity for the air water interface but not necessarily fluorocarbon chain length it has been reported by smith et al smith et al 2022 and mccleaf et al mccleaf et al 2021 that perfluorinated sulfonic acids are more readily removed by foam fractionation compared to perfluorinated carboxylic acids and sulfonamido acetic acids such as n ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid n etfosaa many countries impose regulatory limits on pfas e g in australia the drinking water standard requires less than 0 07 µg l as sum of pfos and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid pfhxs recently the united states environmental protection agency us epa released interim updated drinking water health advisories for pfos pfoa perfluorobutane sulfonic acid pfbs and ammonium 2 3 3 3 tetrafluoro 2 heptafluoropropoxy propanoate genx of 0 004 0 02 10 and 2000 ng l respectively pfas concentrations in contaminated water systems cover a wide range of concentrations generally in the order of several ng l to µg l bräunig et al 2017 sunderland et al 2019 munoz et al 2017 benskin et al 2012 kurwadkar et al 2022 thompson et al 2011 lenka et al 2021 these molar concentrations are not high enough to impact the physical and chemical properties of the solution for example the surface tension of a dilute solution of pfoa does not exhibit a discernible change until the concentration reaches above approximately 1 mg l or 1000 µg l costanza et al 2019 brusseau 2019 concentrations rarely seen in wastewater or in contaminated public environments it is therefore necessary in a foam fractionation separation process to add a co foaming agent to create a foam layer that can be harvested lowering of the surface tension by adding a co foaming agent also has the beneficial effect of reducing the size of bubbles sparged into the system by inhibiting the bubble coalescence amani et al 2021 amani and firouzi 2022 the smaller bubble size increases the amount of bubble surface area available for pfas adsorption and removal buckley et al 2022 co foaming additives are typically hydrocarbon surfactants however the specific choice of agent or even the class of co foaming agent or the best concentration for this duty is not well established another consideration is that short chain pfas i e with fluorocarbon tails less than 5 carbons long do not respond well in sorption based technologies including activated carbon park et al 2020 ross et al 2018 cantoni et al 2021 pauletto and bandosz 2022 gagliano et al 2020 ion exchange ross et al 2018 woodard et al 2017 murray et al 2021 boyer et al 2021 and foam fractionation buckley et al 2022 burns et al 2021 burns et al 2022 a co foaming agent may also offer an opportunity for use as a collector by electrostatically pairing with the pfas and removing the conjoined species in a mechanism similar to metal ion foam fractionation ghosh et al 2019 despite reports on the use of co foaming agents to facilitate pfas removal buckley et al 2022 taseidifar 2020 there is lack of information related to the phenomenological behaviour explaining the influence of co surfactants on pfas and its removal behaviour 1 1 use of co foaming agent for pfas separation from landfill leachate the applicability of foam fractionation to remediation of pfas from landfill leachate has been extensively demonstrated in the literature smith et al 2022 mccleaf et al 2021 burns et al 2022 vo et al 2023 in our earlier investigation we examined the effect of different classes of co foaming agents on the foam fractionation of pfas from landfill leachate and extracted the air water partitioning coefficient k vo et al 2023 the complexity of the leachate matrix provided a hindrance to understanding and deducing the mechanistic behaviour of the different co surfactants on the separation fig 1 shows the results from vo et al vo et al 2023 showing the air water partitioning coefficient determined for different pfas in each system with different co foaming agents the molar volume is a size descriptor for the pfas molecules similar to the molar mass where short chain pfas such as pfba and pfbs have a molar volume of 129 5 and 185 5 cm3 mol respectively whilst larger molecules such as pfos has a molar volume of 297 5 cm3 mol vo et al 2023 the data showed the decreasing trend of pfas separation as the c f chain length related to the species hydrophobicity reduced with a sharp reduction in the separation factor for small pfas species the order of separation effectiveness follows the charge of the co foaming surfactant headgroup with cationic performing the best followed by zwitterionic and then non ionic however the presence of other contaminants in the leachate such as salts and dissolved organic matter also contributed to the overall separation and the adsorption of pfas k therefore there is a need to investigate the interactions in a system free from other contaminants so the removal mechanisms for each co foaming agent can be elucidated 1 2 scope the focus of this paper is on the interaction between pfas and the co foaming agent in question therefore to isolate this effect as much as possible we performed experiments in a system of ro water with minimal background salt concentration in this work co foaming agents from different surfactant classes having anionic sodium dodecyl sulphate sds non ionic triton x 100 zwitterionic lauryl sulfobetaine sb3 12 and cationic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab headgroups are used to determine their comparative behaviour for removal of pfas by foam fractionation and to test their relative effectiveness as collectors especially for removal of short chain pfas the pfas chosen for this study were pfos pfoa pfhxs perfluorobutanoic acid pfba pfbs and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulphonate 6 2 fts 2 conceptual development for simplicity we assume i for the low concentrations in water usually applied to pfas remediation mixed surfactant entities in solution behave in accordance with ideal solution theory i e at equilibrium the surface excess of each species is proportional to the concentration in the associated bulk liquid and they act independently this applies when the surface coverage of the gas liquid interface is low e g for low surfactant concentrations and high surface availability ii the surface excess isotherm is linear brusseau and van glubt 2021 brusseau 2021 i e a langmuir isotherm applies to all species at low concentrations it is hypothesised that for foam fractionation an appropriate co surfactant may also act as a collector by interacting and binding with other surfactants here pfas present particularly if the electrostatic charge of the headgroups is opposite to that of the pfas this effectively forms a new surface active moiety in solution fig 2 shows a visual representation of the proposed mechanism for removal of pfas from each system in summary we are proposing that pfas removal takes place through two mechanisms 1 pfas adsorbs to the air water interface due to its own surface activity and does not interact significantly with the co foaming agent 2 pfas with opposing charge to the co foaming agent binds with the co foaming agent in solution or at the interface and the conjoined entity collects at the interface removal by the first mechanism can be predicted based on the surface activity or adsorption isotherm of the pfas species in question which provides the surface excess and hence increased amount of pfas removed on each bubble surface brusseau 2019 in systems where the co foaming agent has the same or opposite charge to the pfas the removal will be either decreased or increased respectively due to the electrostatic interactions between the surfactants headgroups this is especially of interest for pfas with low surface activity i e the short chain pfas which remain solvated in the liquid and are poorly removed by foam fractionation together with oppositely charged co foaming agent the relatively high concentration of co foaming agent on the interface high ratio of co foaming agent to pfas in the liquid pool of approximately 1000 1 with an attractively positively charged headgroup presenting in the liquid fig 2 bottom left and right affords additional opportunity for conjoining with the pfas which we propose provides a mechanism for enhanced separation and capture 3 materials and method 3 1 apparatus and setup six different types of pfas were procured from different sources to the best available purity pfhxs 97 purity was purchased from boc sciences 6 2 fts 98 purity was purchased from apollo scientific pfos 40 purity pfoa 95 purity pfbs 97 purity and pfba 97 purity in acid form were purchased from merck the co surfactants sds ctab triton x 100 and sb3 12 and sodium chloride nacl were procured from merck acs reagent 99 purity all solutions for foam fractionation tests were prepared using ro water with electrical conductivity of 10 1 µs cm2 nacl was also added in the foam fractionation stock solution to provide a background salt concentration of 0 5 mm all solutions for surface tension measurements were prepared using milli q water with resistivity of 18 2 mω the foam fractionation column is the same as described in an earlier report buckley et al 2022 and a schematic diagram is shown in fig 3 in brief the foam fraction column is a perspex column 60 cm tall with internal diameter of 14 cm containing 8 l of liquid and with adequate headspace for foam formation liquid is drawn from the base of the column by a pump and recirculated into the column after passing through a mazzei c venturi which draws air into the recirculating liquid and the aerated liquid is introduced back into the column the liquid recirculation flowrate was kept constant at 15 l min by throttling the flow with a gate valve the flowrate of air drawn through the venturi was also measured using an inline flowmeter in the air suction line of the venturi the injected bubbles travel upwards in the column at a rate determined by the bubble rise velocity which depends on the bubble size the bubble size is a function of recirculation liquid and induced gas flowrates venturi design and liquid properties predominantly surface tension the liquid recirculation line also includes an inline plate heat exchanger to maintain the system temperature at 23 c a solution of the co foaming agent was continuously introduced during an experiment through a peristaltic dosing pump which injected the co surfactant into the suction pipe of the liquid recirculation line at a constant flowrate of 0 5 ml min a sample port at the bottom of the column was used to extract 10 ml of solution at predetermined intervals of time a vacuum pump connected to a funnel was placed 28 cm above the liquid level of the column to extract the foam and to maintain the foam height for the duration of the experiment 3 2 semi batch foam fractionation experiments the experiments were run in semi batch mode that is the main body of liquid in the column is processed as a batch with respect to pfas and the concentration of pfas changes dynamically over the course of the experiments but the co surfactant is continuously fed into the system at a rate of 2 5 mg min and consequently attains and runs in the process at a steady concentration having a constant co surfactant concentration ensures consistent bubble formation and foam behaviour over the test duration before each experiment the column the recirculation pump and connecting pvc pipes were washed thoroughly with ro water a pfas standard solution containing a fixed amount of all 6 pfas i e pfba pfbs pfhxs pfoa 6 2 fts and pfos was used for the batch foam fractionation experiments and was added to the column prior to each experiment the average initial pfas concentration used in all experiments was standard deviation 46 5 3 5 6 7 0 8 43 4 4 6 48 0 7 0 23 4 8 1 and 58 6 1 µg l for pfba pfbs pfhxs pfoa pfos and 6 2 fts respectively the solution in the column was topped up with ro water to a desired initial level and the liquid was well mixed by running the recirculation pump for 2 minutes without sparging air through the venturi this was followed by acquiring the initial liquid sample from the sample port sample at t 0 min pfas loss due to adsorption to the perspex column and auxiliary piping is expected to be negligible due to the low surface area compared to the area of air water interfacial area in the column 2000 m2 during the experiment the foam height was monitored over time which grew at an increasing rate as co surfactant concentration in the liquid increased slowly until the foam reached the extraction height the bubbly liquid pool is observed to be well mixed since the recirculation rate 15 l min is large compared to the volume of liquid in the foam fractionation column 8 l and there is also a significant amount of turbulence as a result of jet mixing this is confirmed by the very high calculated peclet number pe the binary diffusion coefficients for pe and other important characteristics of the co foaming agents are provided in table 1 samples were taken from the liquid pool in the column after 5 10 20 30 45 and 60 minutes when the foam reached the collection height which was set at 28 cm above the liquid pool the vacuum pump was turned on and used to extract the foam from the system the experiment was stopped after 60 minutes runtime or if the vacuum pump collection vessel became full representing a total foamate volume of approximately 1400 ml 3 3 surface tension measurements solutions of different surfactant in combination with pfoa were prepared and analysed using pat 1m bubble drop profile analysis tensiometer from sinterface germany the tensiometer was calibrated using the reference liquid method with milli q water having resistivity of 18 2 mω all measurements were carried out using the buoyant bubble method at 25 c and calibration was carried out prior to each different sample with each sample being analysed 3 times to ensure repeatability and accuracy of the results 3 4 pfas sample preparation and analysis a total of six different pfas were analysed in this study using the isotope dilution method the native isotopically labelled pfas standards used included 13c4 pfba 13c3 pfbs 18o2 pfhxs 13c4 pfoa 13c4 pfos and 13c2 6 2 fts a 0 5 ml aliquot of pfas sample was added to a high density polyethylene hdpe vial and spiked with 10 µl of the mass labelled internal standard 0 2 mg l and vortexed pfas samples were analysed with a shimadzu high pressure liquid chromatography hplc system coupled with mass spectrometer qtrap ms 5500 qqq ms 6500 ab sciex operating in electronic spray ionization esi and multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode a volume of 7 µl of sample was injected into a 100 2 1 mm 3 µm column restek 19051323 c18 maintained at a constant temperature of 40 c separation of pfas was achieved by gradient elution from the column using 10 mm ammonium acetate and 0 05 acetic acid in milli q water and methanol for the aqueous and organic phases respectively a pre column cartridge is installed between the solvent mixer and the injector to trap non target compounds present in the samples the limit of quantification loq value did not exceed 0 05 µg l for all pfas samples identification and confirmation of peaks was completed using retention times and comparing ratios of mrm transition area between the samples and calibration standards in the same analytical batch calibration standards were prepared in the concentration range of 0 05 100 µg l data acquisition and processing was carried out using analyst and multiquant 3 03 sciex software a set of procedural blanks milli q water were analysed together with the batch samples to monitor contamination during sample preparation and as carry over calibration standards were run before and after pfas samples to monitor sensitivity drift the concentration of pfas in all of the carry over and blank samples were below the limit of detection the peak areas of the internal standards used in the analysis were compared to a reference sample called non extraction side spiked ness sample that was injected with each batch the ness was prepared by adding analytical grade methanol and milli q water spiked with a known concentration of pfas compounds using stock made from analytical standards and the same internal standards that were spiked to each of the samples the recoveries of each internal standard in the injected samples were calculated to be average 95 ci 83 9 2 7 for 13c4 pfba 88 3 2 4 for 13c3 pfbs 88 0 3 3 for 18o2 pfhxs 85 5 3 3 for 13c4 pfoa 81 8 4 5 for 13c2 6 2fts and 71 5 6 7 for 13c4 pfos and all samples used had internal standard recoveries within the tolerable limit of 50 150 for each sample and pfas analyte investigated in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 effectiveness of pfas removal using different surfactants the removal of different pfas into the foam phase is calculated by eq 1 where cfeed is the concentration of each pfas in the column before the recirculation pump that initiated the air drawn by the venturi was turned on and bubbles were sparged into the system ct 30 is the concentration of pfas in the liquid pool after sparging air into the system for 30 minutes 1 removal 1 c t 30 c f e e d the removal is specific to the process configuration since it is affected by process considerations e g the duration of an experiment the arrangement e g the foam collection height equipment e g bubble generation mechanism and chemistry the composition and concentration of co surfactant in the liquid pool amongst others however it provides a useful initial comparison of the effectiveness of the foam separation process and of the different co surfactants which were investigated since most of these factors affecting separation are consistent between experiments in order to assist with the comparison of the different systems the removal data after 30 minutes of operating the foam fractionation system is shown despite the total experiment runtime being 60 minutes a simple observation from fig 4 confirms that short chain pfas e g pfba are removed more poorly lower recovery than pfas with longer fluorocarbon chains e g pfos except when a cationic surfactant was used as the co foaming agent also the removal of pfas species follows the order of cationic co surfactant best followed by the zwitterionic surfactant and then the non ionic and anionic surfactants the trend is distinct in the case of shorter chain pfas such as pfba pfbs pfhxs though less discernible for pfoa pfos and 6 2fts since these are essentially completely removed in 30 minutes for all of the co surfactants in fig 4 the removal after 30 minutes is shown as a percentage however if we were to instead consider the removal after a shorter period then the removal of pfas using each species would show the removal trend follows the order of cationic zwitterionic non ionic anionic as also shown later in fig 5 similarly if we consider the removal after t infinity then the removal of each species would be 100 for each co surfactant we consider 30 mins to be indicative of a reasonable residence time for a commercial process and chose to evaluate the removal after this time we may consider first as the reference case where there is no electrostatic interaction between the co foaming agent and the pfas i e for a non ionic surfactant for pfba which is the least surface active pfas in the mixture there was effectively zero removal for the longer fluorocarbon chain pfas the relative removal of the different species follows their surface activity as reported elsewhere brusseau 2019 tamaki et al 1989 lunkenheimer et al 2015 silva et al 2021 i e removal of pfba pfbs pfhxs pfoa 6 2 fts pfos the cationic co surfactant facilitated almost complete removal of all the three shorter chain pfas viz pfba pfbs and pfhxs mainly due to the electrostatic interaction attraction between the head groups of the cationic co surfactant and anionic pfas which supports more effective capture the zwitterionic surfactant which contains both positive and negative charges also exhibited better removal of short chain pfas in comparison to the non ionic co surfactant with greater than 99 8 removal for pfbs and pfhxs the anionic co surfactant which has a repulsive interaction with the adsorbed pfas was even lower than that of non ionic thus indicating a negative effect in comparison to non ionic co foaming agent all of these observations are qualitatively consistent with the explanations above related to fig 2 in the following sections we seek to quantify the process relationships 4 2 rate of pfas removal using different surfactants the governing principles for foam fractionation are based on the mass and equilibrium balances that apply within the system at steady state the rate of pfas removal from the column can be expressed as 2 d v c b d t s b γ w f 0 c b here v is the liquid pool volume which changes as foam is extracted from the system cb is the bulk concentration of pfas in the liquid pool µg l sb is the rate at which bubble surface area is generated into the foam m2 min г is the amount of pfas adsorbed on the surface of bubbles per unit area µg m2 and wf 0 is the net flowrate of liquid being removed from the system by the foam extraction system m3 min the foam formation system is assumed to be at steady state hence to maintain continuity the liquid flowrate at the foam liquid interface wf0 is equal to that extracted by the vacuum foam collection system the pfas surface excess г is assumed to be related to the bulk concentration cb by a linear isotherm see section 2 conceptual development with k representing the partitioning coefficient eq 3 3 γ k c b the surface area flux sb m2 min is given by 4 s b 3 g r b g is the air flow rate into the system through the venturi m3 min and rb is the average bubble size in the liquid pool m in this work the balance eqs 2 4 are solved as described below the left hand term in eq 2 d v c b d t represents the rate at which pfas species are removed from the liquid pool and provides an indication as to which pfas can be successfully removed by foam fractionation with different co foaming agents this is shown in fig 5 from the data shown in fig 5 it is immediately apparent that the long chain pfas are quickly extracted with the pool concentration dropping below the detection limit within 20 minutes of operation for all types of co surfactants except anionic substitution of eq 3 into eq 2 shows that the rate of decline on pfas is 1st order with respect to pool concentration cb provided that the values of sb and wf0 are constant both of these are overwhelmingly dominated by the co surfactant which is at a much higher concentration than the pfas since the co surfactant is continuously fed into the system at a constant rate over the course of an experiment its concentration in the pool becomes steady after an initial short stabilisation period once this occurs sb and wf0 become constant and the first order removal kinetics for pfas are established a trend which is confirmed by the experimental outcomes and which is quantified later in the paper this study seeks to illuminate how the interaction between co surfactant and pfas species changes the foam fractionation effectiveness so it is necessary to remove the confounding influences the co surfactant in a particular system design causes changes to the process terms in eqs 2 4 through three main mechanisms i the average bubble size rb which determines the rate at which interfacial area is made available for separation at a particular air supply rate ii the extent of interstitial liquid drainage before the foam is harvested which affects the value of v the liquid pool volume and iii possible interactions with the pfas species changing the surface excess i e the partitioning coefficient between the liquid concentration and the air water interface in order to evaluate the third mechanism iii it is necessary to remove the confounding factors of i and ii and this may be accomplished by direct measurement the pool volume v in these experiments declines slowly as foam is harvested the quantity of which is measured the quantity of foam that is removed depends on the dryness of the foam a function of the position i e height of the foam column above the liquid foam interface and the drainage rate of the foam and thereby size of bubbles in these experiments the amount of foam harvested is small compared with the starting volume so v hardly changes but it is important from a practical perspective since it has a large effect on the enrichment a measure of the effectiveness of the process separation the balances namely eqs 2 and 4 are most conveniently made at the liquid pool foam interface at this location the bubbles are in direct contact with the well mixed liquid pool so the associated concentration is equivalent to the bulk pool concentration cb it also provides a consistent position for measuring the size distribution of bubbles that is in the first layer of foam before any coalescence or ripening occurs and then obtaining rb as the sauter mean of the distribution at this level in the column bubble size was measured using a usb digital microscope and imagej image processing software and is shown in table 2 the surface area flux was then obtained from average bubble surface area and the total airflow rate g 5 2 slpm introduced into the system which was measured on a digital flowmeter the steady state concentration of the co surfactant in the pool is estimated as follows noting that the foam was recovered at a constant rate using a vacuum extraction unit at a fixed height of 28 cm above the liquid foam interface steady state in the co surfactant mass flux through the column occurs when foam harvesting commences the time taken to reach the extraction height multiplied by the co surfactant dosing rate dr therefore provides the steady state amount of co surfactant in the column which includes the mass in the liquid pool and in the foam just below the extraction point the liquid fraction in the foam leaving the column ε is obtained by dividing the foamate collection rate wf0 by the sum of the air flowrate g and foamate collection rate at the point where the foam is first harvested and the system has reached steady state with respect to co surfactant liquid pool concentration cco the rate of removal of co surfactant in the foam is equal to the rate at which co surfactant is being added to the system using the measured liquid fraction the surface excess of co surfactant гco in the foamate can be obtained eq 5 5 d r γ co 3 g r b ε g c c o the above balance is subject to the assumption that the foam held up inside the column is taken to have composition and density comparable to the extracted foamate this is true if the foam extraction height is small subsequently from a simple mass balance co surfactant content may be calculated and hence steady state quantity and concentration of co surfactant in the liquid pool estimated table 2 the residual co foaming agent concentration in the liquid pool may contribute to an increased chemical oxygen demand cod or dissolved organic carbon doc content in the process effluent depending on the site specific requirements for the foam fractionation process and where the effluent stream is being discharged e g to groundwater aquifer sewer system or natural waterway the toxicity of the chosen hydrocarbon co foaming agent may need to be considered and further treatment steps taken to further reduce the concentration in the liquid pool this could include for example a secondary foam fractionation step with a treatment objective of reducing the concentration of the co foaming agent since the same dosing rate was maintained for all the co surfactants and the extraction height was fixed the minimum liquid pool concentration for a given co surfactant determines the period of unsteady state foam growth in the column as ctab the cationic co surfactant had the lowest liquid pool concentration the foam growth rate was fastest with larger bubble size on the contrary the anionic and zwitterionic co surfactant exhibited a slow foam growth frequent bubble collapsing during the initial phase of foam formation until the steady state foam formation and extraction commences a comparison of the chemical interaction effects of different co surfactants for various pfas species is provided by considering their removal with respect to interfacial surface area passed through the fractionator as opposed to bubbling time using eq 4 to provide the transposition the gas rate is constant in all the experiments but using cumulative surface area serves to present the results in a way that also accounts for the different bubble size associated with each of the various co surfactants we only consider the data collected after the foam harvesting has commenced and steady state has been reached and omit the initial unsteady period where the co foaming agent is still accumulating in the column the results are shown in fig 6 from fig 6 it is immediately apparent that the removal rates for all pfas species are significantly affected by the type of co surfactant with the effectiveness being cationic zwitterionic non ionic anionic for short chain pfas the same trend is observed for long chain pfas however the difference between cationic and zwitterionic co surfactant is less pronounced due to the near complete removal of these pfas species by the first data point collected after the system had reached steady state once steady state is achieved with respect to the bubbling and foaming regime i e the co foaming agent concentration in the pool has become constant the pfas removal follows a first order trend with time buckley et al 2022 we now address the evaluation of the constant k in the equilibrium eq 3 which is necessary in order to solve the process design eqs 2 4 it provides key insights into the interactions between the pfas species and the co foaming agents 4 3 estimation of pfas air water partitioning coefficient k the modelling of the removal of pfas was carried out following the same method as our previous study buckley et al 2022 eqs 2 and 4 were solved simultaneously by fitting k to the experimental data using a sum of squares regression the resultant k values from the model fitting are shown in table 3 the k values in table 3 represent the partitioning of individual pfas species by both mechanisms previously explained under the heading conceptual development we consider the non ionic surfactant as the reference case where there is no effect from the charge of the surfactant headgroup on the pfas removal and the removal of pfas only occurs as a direct result of their surface activity i e only by mechanism 1 comparatively the k values for the anionic surfactant sds were significantly lower which may be attributed to the electrostatic repulsion between surfactant headgroups adsorbed at the interface reducing the pfas removal values for k could not be calculated for pfba and pfbs using the anionic co foaming agent and for pfba using the non ionic co foaming agent since insignificant removal was observed the cationic and zwitterionic co foaming agents which have positive charge in the surfactant headgroup had much higher k values for all pfas species ascribed to the attractive headgroup interactions and conjoining of the pfas and co surfactant which then acts like a collector that is due to mechanism 2 table 3 provides that the k values for both cationic and zwitterionic co foaming agents are quite similar although it is difficult to distinguish which is higher due to the fact that from fig 6 it can be seen that almost complete removal 75 is observed in both systems after the first data point it is also important to note that the steady state concentration of the cationic surfactant in the pool is approximately an order of magnitude less than for the zwitterionic surfactant table 2 mechanistically it seems most reasonable to assume the conjunction of the pfas and co surfactants mainly occurs in the turbulent and well mixed liquid pool and consequently the extent of pairing will be proportional to the concentration of co surfactant in the liquid pool in terms of headgroup interaction and separation effectiveness this implies that the electrostatic attraction between the pfas and the cationic surfactant is stronger than the interaction between the pfas and the zwitterionic surfactant which would be the expectation based on mechanism 2 described in the conceptual development section above to provide evidence to support this equilibrium surface tension was measured using a drop profile analysis tensiometer the data was collected by measuring the dynamic surface tension of solutions stabilised by 10 ppm of each co foaming agent and comparing the effect when 10 ppm of pfoa was added to the solution as a model species 10 ppm was chosen as the concentration since this was the lowest concentration that allowed for a measurable and discernible difference between each co foaming agent at lower concentrations the same trend appeared but the higher concentration is used for illustrative clarity surface tension of the liquid containing a fixed amount of surfactant can be used as a diagnostic tool table 4 shows the reduction in equilibrium surface tension of a milli q water solution resulting from adding 10 ppm of pfoa into solutions of different co foaming agents also at 10 ppm concentration the relative reduction in surface tension as a result of the additional surfactant in each of the different systems provides insight into the extent of interactions between the molecules the surface tension is hypothesised to decrease more in the case where the charge of the headgroup of the surfactant is opposite to that of the pfoa molecule i e cationic co surfactant it is also expected that for a co foaming agent with no electrostatic polarisation non ionic that the change in surface tension will be minimal due to the low concentrations of surfactant employed the equilibrium surface tension of a 10 ppm solution of pfoa in milli q water was measured to be 72 6 mn m from table 4 the interactions clearly follow the degree of electrostatic interactions of the co surfactant headgroup strongest attraction between the cationic co surfactant and pfoa which resulted in the highest reduction of the surface tension of the co surfactant only supporting the explanation provided above 4 4 comparison of pfas removal using opposite charged co foaming agent in low and high salinity systems to assess the performance of the co foaming agent as a collector in a remediation scenario we compare data obtained from this extremely low salinity 0 5 mm nacl study with data collected in our previously published work vo et al 2023 using saline landfill leachate conducted on the same foam fractionation apparatus operating under the same conditions the leachate used in the published study had a total dissolved solids concentration tds greater than 1934 mg l with cation concentrations of 1215 6 4 0 mg l sodium na 577 2 2 3 mg l potassium k 86 5 2 2 mg l calcium ca2 and magnesium 55 0 0 6 mg l mg2 the experiments conducted so far in this current study have all been carried out in a system with minimum background salt concentration so the ion specific effects of each class of co foaming agent on the removal of pfas by foam fractionation could be investigated in fig 7 we compare the data from both the studies and observe that cationic and zwitterionic surfactants have the capacity to act as a collector to assist with removal of short chain pfas for systems with low background salt and absence of other co contaminants from fig 1 and 7 no removal of pfas compounds with molar volume vm 150 cm3 mol was observed from the saline leachate even in the presence of cationic and zwitterionic co foaming agent which is in contrast to the findings in the test with low salt concentrations wherein both co foaming agents exhibited strong removal and high k values for both pfba and pfbs interestingly for larger pfas molecules it was observed that the separation factor was higher in the leachate as opposed to the low salinity system in which the hydrophobic effects dominate the separation factor and the contribution of electrostatic attraction for separation is minimal this increase is attributed to the complex composition of the landfill leachate that may contain other species which also influence the pfas adsorption to the interface i e high salinity dissolved organic matter hydrocarbons the anionic and non ionic co foaming agent not shown in fig 7 have no effect on collection and only influence the surface area available for pfas adsorption the reduction in collector effectiveness observed in fig 7 for a saline landfill leachate indicates that the selection of co foaming agent is impacted by the background salt concentration of the water to be treated therefore the salt concentration and type may influence the choice and selection of co foaming agent for a foam fractionation process 5 conclusion the effect of different co foaming agents on the removal of pfas by a foam fractionation process has been investigated by examining the effects of 4 different classes of surfactants anionic cationic non ionic and zwitterionic the major findings from the investigation were the long chain pfas pfoa pfos 6 2 fts were readily removed by all classes of co foaming surfactant the choice of co foaming agent with a cationic headgroup allowed for removal of short chain pfas pfba and pfbs the removal was greater for the surfactant with a cationic headgroup compared to the zwitterionic surfactant which had both cationic and anionic headgroups the removal was generally better when using the co surfactants containing an opposing charge to the pfas cationic and zwitterionic and poorest with the non ionic and anionic co surfactant pairing of pfas with the co foaming agent predominantly occurs in the well mixed liquid pool rather than at the air water interface which is relatively more stagnant the presence of co contaminants in landfill leachate can significantly impact the collection mechanism by which short chain pfas can be removed the choice of co foaming agent to utilise for the removal of pfas by foam fractionation can have a significant effect on the removal rate due to the effect on foam characteristics and subsequent effect on the surface flux it can also impact the pfas removal which may be inhibiting or synergistic with the head groups of the pfas molecules our results indicated that cationic surfactants are best suited for the removal of anionic pfas such as those of high environmental concern and should be effective even for short carbon chain length pfas species declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15143,the evolution of the climate in the future will probably lead to an increase in extreme rainfall events particularly in the mediterranean regions this change in rainfall patterns will have impacts on combined sewer systems operation with a possible increase of spilled flows leading to an increase of untreated water volumes released to the receiving water due to the impact of overflows on the water cycle local authorities managing combined sewer systems are wondering about the extent of these changes and the possibility of taking it into account in stormwater management structure design to do this rainfall data with a fine time step are required to better master the shape of the hyetographs that are crucial to get a relevant rainfall runoff relationship in an urban environment however there are currently no simulations of future rainfall series available at a time step compatible with the needs in urban drainage field in this work future rainfall time series with a fine time step are elaborated with the aim to be used in urban hydrology the proposed approach is based on simulations results from five regional climate models in the framework of the euro cordex program it consists in a spatial downscaling step followed by a temporal disaggregation the rainfall time series obtained are then used as input for a calibrated and validated hydrological model to investigate the evolution of annual cso volumes and frequencies by 2100 the results show an increase of annual spilled volumes between 13 and 52 according to the considered climate model this increase will most likely be a problem regarding compliance of sewer networks in line with the water framework directive particularly the current french regulations no clear trends were observed on the cso frequencies if there is a consensus for all the carried out simulations to conclude that the cso volumes will increase we must remember that actual regional climate models suffer from limited spatial and temporal resolution and don t explicitly solve convection processes due to this point uncertainty concerning the evolution rate remains important particularly for intense rainfall episodes new

involve significant investments for which the lifespan is several decades the question that then arises is whether changes in future rainfall patterns should be considered in planning choices and if so how kourtis et al 2020 made a review of research carried out on the impact of climate change on urban sanitation networks the vast majority of the studies cited focus on the impact of future rainfall on urban flooding few authors have investigated the climate change impact on combined sewer overflows cso additionally most of the studied sites are in northern europe and in north america the impact of other types of climates such as the mediterranean climate on sanitation systems have not yet been studied niemczynowicz 1989 worked on the lund sanitation system in sweden he presented the flow volumes increase as a result of the rainfall intensity increase for 1 to 10 year return period design storms nie et al 2009 studied the impact of future rainfall on the city of fredrikstad in norway future rainfall resulted from the application of a change factor on current rainfall the change factor consisted in increasing the intensity of historical precipitation by 20 30 and 50 in canada fortier and mailhot 2015 studied the impact of future rainfall produced on a daily time step on overflows from 30 combined sewer overflow structures csos in canada the authors built a model which estimates the occurrence probability and cso duration according to the total rainfall depth the model was calibrated using observed data and then used with daily rainfall data from a regional climate model as input results were analysed in terms of frequency and duration and the main conclusion is related to variations in seasonal distribution with an increase of frequency and duration in spring and autumn and a decrease in summer furlow et al 2006 analysed the evolution of cso frequency under climate change in the great lakes region of the united states the elaboration of climate scenarios was based on the application of a change factor to historical precipitations for given return periods change factors were determined using results from global climate models cccm and hadcm2 in france mahaut and andrieu 2019 proposed an analysis of the evolution of cso on the city of nantes sewer system this analysis combined climate change scenarios with population growth and urbanisation one of the main results is that for the city of nantes and for certain scenarios climate change seems to have a lower impact than population growth and urban development one of the key aspects when dealing with the impact of rainfall on sewer systems under climate change is the time step used for considering future rainfall several authors worked on producing small timestep rainfall timeseries for urban hydrology but often without implementation on urban catchment models müller thomy 2020 onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 peleg et al 2017 sørup et al 2016 thorndahl and andersen 2021 some did it anyway but without providing any details neither on the model structure nor on its calibration and validation processes sørup et al 2018 or by using an artificial combined sewer system model müller and haberlandt 2018 some authors propose downscaling methods to achieve sub daily rainfall description with the objective to use in a different purpose than assessing the impact on sewer networks pons et al 2022 used a downscaling method based on multiplicative random cascade to achieve small timestep rainfall description the timeseries were used on a small spatial scale to evaluate the performance of green roofs requena et al 2021 and nguyen et al 2018 proposed a downscaling method to achieve fine time step description of future rainfall to update idf curves results are presented for 5 min to 24 h duration to produce small time step timeseries those authors used rainfall generators involving several clustering processes including neymann scott processes sørup et al 2016 bartlett lewis processes onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 and multiple cascade models müller and haberlandt 2018 those statistical methods give good results but can be difficult to implement and to calibrate onof arnbjerg nielsen 2009 proposed an eight parameters bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model to achieve satisfying results as multiple cascade models are concerned considering autocorrelation is a real challenge and only very recent development seems to address the problem müller thomy 2020 compared to statistical approaches the analogue method is more rarely used despite its good performances zorita et von storch 1999 pui et al 2012 li et al 2017 if we focus on the literature concerning this method it is usually used for disaggregation at a large scale river watershed region or country and the timestep is not smaller than an hour carreau et al 2019 verfaillie et al 2017 bárdossy and pegram 2016 caillouet et al 2016 few authors like willems vrac 2011 use analogue method to achieve very small timestep 10 min for their approach another specificity of studies using analogue methods is that they often use a weather type approach which consists in defining a limited number of climatic situations classifying all days in one of those categories and finding analogs inside each category verfaillie et al 2017 willems and vrac 2011 authors who don t develop a weather typing approach usually use other comparison criteria often based on a rainfall depth comparison lee and jeong 2014 bárdossy and pegram 2016 or date proximity pui et al 2012 li et al 2017 the weather typing approach has proven its efficiency but is sometimes difficult to implement because of the need of large scale climate analysis in order to define the climate types if literature concerning small time step timeseries production is important studies combining methods of timeseries production and sewer network impact analysis are not numerous when the impact on urban systems is the core of the study sub daily rainfall description is not so common and most of the studies are based on daily future rainfall data to determine the evolution of sewer network flooding on a monthly yearly basis if we consider studies concerning impact of future rainfall on csos most authors used change factor methods applied on a wide timestep daily most of the time mailhot 2015 mahaud and andrieu 2019 for the most recent ones this daily time step is the shortest time step largely available from the climate model outputs mikovits et al 2017 used debiased data from the adamont project available on three hour time steps durand et al 2009 but he chose to use the climate model outputs on a daily timestep the objective of this work is to go a step further in considering the variation of rainfall patterns under climate change and especially rainfall intensities which are key for designing sewer systems this implies building continuous timeseries of small time steps 5 or 6 min rainfall events this is especially relevant in mediterranean climate where extreme rainfall intensities of 50 up to 100 mm h are regularly recorded over very short periods in france meteo france 2022 the mediterranean region will probably experience very significant variations in rainfall patterns in the future tramblay and somot 2018 such an evolution has already been observed in historical time series over the 1961 2015 period ribes et al 2019 extreme daily rainfalls are expected to increase with climate change thiebault and moatti 2016 in a sewer network it is assumed that the hydrograph shape at an outfall is related to the hyetograph shape on the corresponding watershed the rainfall runoff relationship in an urban environment is based on the knowledge of these hyetograph shapes and the small time step is a requirement the objective of this work is to assess the consequences of future rainfall patterns on combined sewer overflows in terms of annual spilled volumes and frequency an original method was developed based on data that are easy to access or collect in order to be readily reproducible on other sites this paper details the methodology in stages to build future rainfall timeseries with a fine time step well adapted to urban hydrology issues the future rainfall timeseries are then used to assess impact on cso with a distributed sewer network model the method is implemented for the city of valence in the south of france under a mediterranean climate the originality of this work lies in two aspects firstly it deals with the evolution of cso under a mediterranean climate in france by proposing a method to elaborate future rainfall time series and applying it on a real site using a fully calibrated sewer network model and secondly the authors propose an original approach based on the analogue method to elaborate future small time step rainfall the method involves several correspondence criteria to find future past analogs but without involving weather typing approach one of the main advantages of this approach is that it is relatively easy to reproduce and then can be suited for an operational use 2 material and methods the method developed here to determine future rainfall time series at a fine time step requires using climate model projection data for future rain events and past rainfall data for the downscaling process flow measurements are needed for sewer system modelling the proposed approach is tested on the city of valence in southern france this section first describes the investigated site and data sources future rainfall and temperature past rainfall observed flow rates the designed methods to elaborate future rainfall time series are then detailed as well as the quantification of their effect on cso in terms of annual spilled volumes and frequency 2 1 valence case study 2 1 1 description the city of valence is located in the rhone valley in the drôme department equidistant between lyon and avignon joly et al 2010 characterized the climate of drôme as altered mediterranean with mild winters and hot summers the autumn and winter seasons are rather humid but show significant interannual variability conversely the summer is dry and stable ref normal 1971 2000 with regard to precipitation the annual total is considered average 800 to 950 mm for france with a heterogeneous distribution over the department the combined sewer system covers two municipalities valence and bourg lès valence the sewer network is a combined system of 700 km in length the system drains to a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 172 000 people equivalent the network has 11 self monitored csos that can discharge into the rhône river during intense rainfall events amongst these the gambetta cso structure is the most important since it alone discharges about 450 000 m3 per year corresponding to 45 of the total volume discharged by the combined sewer system 2 1 2 historical rainfall data the first stage consisting in the spatial downscaling process requires to handle a large amount of relevant local observations in the current situation the best available data come from the french meteorological office meteo france at the valence chabeuil rain gauge station aggregated at a daily time step from september 1 1997 to november 3 2020 even if this is the best dataset available the period of twenty three years of observations is considered slightly insufficient to achieve a good fit the world meteorological organization recommends having observations over a minimum of thirty years to calculate climate normals wmo 2017 arguez et al 2011 for the second stage consisting in temporal disaggregation it is necessary to have rainfall hyetographs i e 6 minute time step rain data over a period as long as possible the french meteorological office provides 15 years of data at the valence chabeuil station from july 1 2005 to july 1 2020 daily average and daily maximum temperature data are available for this same station over the same period 2 1 3 hydrological data the gambetta csos are monitored according to the french regulation in this context the spilled flows have been measured continuously since 2014 with a 5 minute time step the data reliability has been checked and improved in 2018 claro barreto 2020 we selected the years 2019 and 2018 respectively for calibration and validation of the hydrological model 2 2 elaboration of future rainfall time series at a fine time step results of regional climate models rcm simulations cannot be used directly to feed an urban hydrological model the challenge is to transform daily data from rcm in 6 min time step data for the use as inputs of a rainfall runoff model to do so two key steps are carried out a spatial downscaling and a temporal disaggregation fig 1 2 2 1 climate change data the euro cordex project is the european branch of the cordex project initiated by the world climate research program vautard et al 2021 it aims to make climate simulation results available for all in order to determine the impacts of climate change and help to define adaptation strategies in europe each european union country is responsible for providing local data calculated using national models on which a bias correction is applied in october 2020 the french meteorological office meteo france made new simulation results available in france under the name drias 2020 dataset meteo france 2020 this new dataset is an update of the 2014 dataset the drias 2020 dataset benefits from the most recent euro cordex simulations and corrects anomalies highlighted in the 2014 simulations to build the drias 2020 dataset meteo france selected results between all the available euro cordex simulations to perform this selection meteo france chose the more realistic gcm rcm couples and tried to ensure the maximum diversity of gcm rcm combinations the selection led to a 42 simulation set with 12 covering the historical period and 30 over the future period 12 according to rcp8 5 10 according to rcp4 5 and 8 according to rcp2 6 a bias correction was applied to all these simulation results using the cdf t cumulative distribution function transform method vrac et al 2012 and the adamont method deque 2007 verfaillie et al 2017 throughout france using safran observation data le moigne 2002 the cdf t method is a statistical method based on the quantile quantile method q q method the drias 2020 dataset has an equivalent bias correction and a homogeneous spatial rendering on a 8 8 km resolution grid for all 42 simulations it provides daily outputs for a number of parameters including daily precipitation depth daily average temperature and daily maximum temperature over two simulation periods a historical period used for bias correction and a future period from 2006 to the end of 2100 for most simulations the present work focuses on the exploitation of five gcm rcm simulations from the drias 2020 dataset these five simulations were selected to better represent the diversity of future projections as specific models have particular trends i e drier or wetter hotter or cooler conditions with seasonal variations or just ranged within the multi model median in addition the most pessimistic greenhouse gas concentration pathway was retained i e rcp 8 5 in order to describe the worst case scenario the five selected gcm rcm couples their provider institutes and their tendencies are cnrm aladin gcm and rcm both issued by the french national centre for meteorological research simulations are close to the multi model median cnrm racmo french national centre for meteorological research royal netherlands meteorological institute simulations tend to generate rather cold and wet summers ipsl wrf pierre simon laplace institute for gcm and rcm simulations tend to generate hot and humid winters and cold and humid summers hadgem cclm met office hadley centre uk climate limited area modelling community international contributions simulations tend to generate warm winters and hot and dry summers mpiesm remo2009 max planck institute for meteorology germany climate service centre germany simulations tend to generate rather cold winters 2 2 2 step 1 spatial downscaling climate models results described above are provided on an 8 km x 8 km grid regional climate models poorly represent very small spatial scale rain phenomena including convective rainfall with a general tendency to underestimate the most intense precipitation events maraun et al 2010 piani et al 2010 the main reasons for this are firstly related to the models themselves which consider the orography in an imperfect way and do not represent the convection process and secondly the bias correction leads to a smoothing of the debiased simulation results this bias correction is performed using the safran reanalysis which consists in a resampling and a projection of meteorological observed data on an 8 km regular grid covering the whole french territory vidal et al 2010 in order to face this drawback we applied a new bias correction to the drias 2020 data based on local observed data at the valence chabeuil rain gauge station over the period 2005 2020 as for the downscaling carried out for the production of drias 2020 dataset we have retained the cdf t method but unlike the standard q q method it does not rely on the assumption of bias stationarity modelled values and observations may change and be different the assumption is that the simulations and the observed distributions can be inferred by a mathematical function the transform that remains the same for past and future distributions this method was initially developed by michelangeli et al 2009 on wind speed simulations and then widely used for other climatic parameters such as temperature and precipitation vrac et al 2012 lavaysse et al 2012 vigaud et al 2013 vautard et al 2013 a complete and accessible description of the cdf t method is included in vrac et al 2016 in our case we applied a second level of downscaling on the previously downscaled data from drias 2020 this step considering local rainfall time series can be viewed as a local downscaling 2 2 3 step 2 temporal disaggregation urban watersheds usually have a short lag time ranging from a few minutes to a few hours depending on configuration the sewer network hydraulic response is very sensitive to the hyetograph shape a convective short intense thunderstorm will produce a very different response from a long low intensity stratiform rain in addition urban watersheds are sensitive to the sequence of rainfall events which may occur on back to back days the second step of the process consists in temporal disaggregation that converts daily time step data into 6 minute time step data we chose 6 min because it is the time step for which observations data are available to do this we used a climate analogue approach for each future day we look for the best analogous day in the dataset for which the data are available at a 6 minute time step this method is inspired from the adamont method initially developed to deal with data from the french alps verfaillie et al 2017 and produce precipitation data with a 3 hour time step the challenge here is to determine the criteria to find the best possible analogue between a future day with a daily rain simulation value and a past day with a rain hyetograph with a 6 minute time step many authors have studied the relationships between rainfall intensity and atmospheric conditions such as surface air temperature usually considered 2 m above the ground and have shown that these relationships have implications on rainfall intensity variations lepore et al 2016 westra et al 2013 ben daoud et al 2011 other authors herath et al 2018 gyasi agyei 2018 have linked the rain intensity to the maximum daily temperature they have shown that short duration rainfall intensities are positively correlated to the maximum daily temperature and that this relationship is stronger for intense rains these relationships have been tested on the valence rainfall and temperature data at the valence chabeuil station and 4 criteria have been selected to identify analogue couples season total daily rainfall depth average daily temperature and maximum daily temperature 2 3 sewer network modelling to assess future sewer system discharges the impact of future rainfall time series was quantified using a distributed model built under the infoworks software the model represents the entire sewer network associated with the valence wastewater treatment plant as its outlet the designed model covers an area of 1574 ha divided into 154 sub watersheds of which 33 of the surface is impervious mainly roofs and roads the modelled network has 269 computing nodes and a total pipe length of approximately 48 km the runoff model used is a linear reservoir model with a lag time depending on urban watershed characteristics and rainfall intensity for impervious surfaces with a runoff coefficient of 0 3 for roads and 0 85 for roofs runoff on pervious surfaces is described by a horton model horton 1941 with an initial infiltration capacity of 76 mm h and a limiting infiltration capacity of 12 7 mm h the propagation of the flow in the pipes is ensured by a complete resolution of the barre de st venant equations cunge and wegner 1964 long term small time step continuous simulations have been run for calibration validation and simulation of future periods 2021 2100 3 results 3 1 future rainfall time series 3 1 1 spatial downscaling the spatial downscaling step enabled us to generate daily rainfall depths data according to local historical data fig 2 shows downscaled daily data for each season differences between gcm rcm original values and corrected values are more important for high daily rain depths for these higher daily rain depths 50 mm the downscaled values are higher than the original gcm rcm outputs in summer and winter for all the models the results for spring and autumn depend on the model considered spring data are the least affected by the downscaling process adjustment is particularly low for the ipsl wrf simulation in autumn downscaled rainfall depths are higher than original outputs for values over 50 mm for cnrm racmo and mpiesm remo2009 simulations and lower for the three other simulations 3 1 2 rain intensity vs temperature as it has been shown on other locations lepore et al 2016 bürger et al 2019 figs 3 a and 3b show that maximum rain intensities in valence are directly related to average daily temperatures but only up to a certain value in this case 18 to 24 c for the highest temperature class 24 to 30 c the percentile values tend to drop this trend is particularly marked for the 0 9 and 0 99 percentiles maximum daily temperatures with no limitation on this temperature scale 3 1 3 past future climate analogs the determination of the best past analogue day for each future day is done by minimizing the euclidean distance on all the past future parameters considered total daily rainfall depth average daily temperature and maximum daily temperature the search is performed for each season independently once analogs are identified we consider that the future 6 minute hyetographs have the same shape as the one in the past future 6 minute values of rainfall intensity are corrected to fit the total daily rainfall depth simulated by the climate models corrected with the cdf t method examples of analogue matches are shown in fig 4 characteristics of past future analogue days are specified on the top of each graph showing that rainfall depth and temperature conditions are quite similar for the future day and its best analogue in the past considering the median and first quartile figs 4a 4b 4d and 4e figs 4c and 4f show the correspondence for the highest euclidian distance it corresponds to the future day with the highest daily rainfall considering that such an event has not been observed in the past the correspondence is consequently weaker however the correspondence remains the best one available 3 1 4 sewer network modelling calibration and validation model calibration and validation have been performed for dry and wet weather results presented focus on the spilled volumes at the gambetta csos calibration was performed on 2019 data and validation on 2018 data by processing continuous simulations over each year for calibration and validation periods data from 5 rain gauges were available over the area in order to be as precise as possible those 5 rain gauges have been considered differences between simulated and measured csos are presented in table 1 total annual discharge and table 2 significant episodes for the gambetta csos the difference between simulated and measured total annual overflow volume is low 5 for the calibration year and 2 for the validation year table 1 this reflects the good capacity of the model to reproduce the annual volumes discharged these deviations are within the range of those widely accepted in hydrological modelling bertrand krajewski et al 2000 aguilar et al 2016 in this study results are considered as very good if the difference between simulation and measurement is less than 15 for volume less than 30 for peak flow and over 0 75 for nse nash sutcliffe error as recommended by moriasi et al 2015 in addition to the cso annual volume we present the results for the most significant cso events over the two years table 2 these correspond to 76 of the annual discharged volume for 2019 and 72 for 2018 these results show that with regard to the volumes spilled per episode in the calibration phase the difference between simulation and measurement is less than 15 for 10 out of 14 episodes concerning the peak flow value the difference is less than 30 for 11 out of 14 episodes the nse is always higher than 0 2 for all events meaning that the model is more accurate than the mean value of the observations median value of nse is 0 82 indicating a very accurate model these results allow us to conclude that the calibration is acceptable based on the data recorded during the year 2019 and according to the precision that can be expected from a model calibrated on the basis of flow measurements in a sewer system the results for 2018 are of comparable quality over this validation period the difference between simulation and measurement is less than 15 for 13 episodes out of 17 with regard to peak flows the difference is less than 30 for 16 episodes out of 17 the median nse is 0 77 we therefore conclude that the model reproduces cso in a satisfying way and that it can be used to predict the impact of future precipitation on the cso volume and frequency over the 2021 2100 period without any structural modification in this study all the factors including population urbanisation and land use are considered stable until 2100 it is clearly a non realistic hypothesis but to characterise the impact of climate change on csos all other factors must stay unchanged 3 2 future cso volumes and frequency future rainfall time series produced from the five selected climate models are used as input to the sewer network model to produce cso flow rates at the gambetta csos at 5 minute timestep between 2021 and 2100 discharged volumes are aggregated on an annual basis two types of data analysis are proposed continuous 30 year moving average plots and four 20 year boxplots one of the major causes of interannual variation in climate models is internal climate variability which consists of a set of natural internal processes leading to an alternance of dry and wet years as well as hot and cold years deser et al 2012 ribes et al 2020 this internal variability yields highly unsteady annual discharged volumes that hide possible long term trends to overcome this a smoothing is applied to the cso volumes it consists in calculating a moving average centred on 30 years as climate normals are traditionally defined over 30 year periods https www ncdc noaa gov news defining climate normals new ways fig 5 presents results on future overflow volumes and frequencies it highlights a trend towards an increase of the cso volumes for all the climate models selected left column on the other hand there is no consensus regarding the evolution of the annual number of cso events per year since 3 models show a downward trend and the other two an upward trend right column annual spilled volumes increase over the 2021 2100 period between 13 and 52 with significant p value tests table 3 regarding the number of annual cso the p value is only significant for three climate models with an increasing trend for ipsl wrf and cnrm racmo and a decreasing trend for hadgem cclm those results are well represented by the multi model average which highlights an increase of the annual volume and no clear tendency for the annual cso frequency number of overflow events another way to analyse the results is to plot the distributions of volume discharges over four 20 year periods from 2021 to 2100 figs 6 and 7 show boxplots for annual discharges and number of events historical 2006 2021 observations are also represented red in order to confront simulation results to observations fig 6 shows the annual overflow volumes over the historical period pink according to each climate model these results were obtained by applying the downscaling and temporal disaggregation steps to simulation results for each climate model over the 2006 2021 period direct comparisons between simulations and measurements should be done with caution because observations are the results of real rainfall fields on the catchment with all the heterogeneity related to real events whereas simulation results are computed with the assumption of a homogenous rainfall field over the entire catchment another important aspect is the duration of the historical period sixteen years is presumably too short to manage climate internal variability and its impact on simulation results over relatively short periods considering this it appears that median simulation values over the historical period are quite similar to the observed median value except for the ipslwrf model which shows a higher median value distribution between first and third quartile is spread out for all models to a small extent for cnrmaladin mpiesmremo and ipslwrf and more broadly for the two other models if we consider the 5th quartile values obtained with all models are consistent with the observations the 95th quartile is higher for all simulations but the difference remains low if the outliers are considered especially for the measurements the differences in distributions according to the models reflect the uncertainty associated with climate modelling and lead us to consider the results of the multi model aggregation green boxplots the distribution is wider than the observations but we nethertheless consider it to be representative of real rainfall fields as the strong hypothesis on simulated rainfall homogeneity leads to overestimate discharged volumes comparison between models results and measurement according to the annual number of cso is shown on fig 7 red and pink boxplots we observe an offset of the annual number of cso for all models according to the measurements if we compare models between themselves we highlight a certain homogeneity with median values between 55 and 58 cso events per year and comparable extents of distributions for all models here again the assumption that the rainfall field is homogenous lead to this overestimation of the annual cso number considering the future period the different climate models present strong disparities between annual discharges basically median annual volumes tend to increase except for the mpiesm remo and cnrm racmo simulations over the 2081 2100 period for some models the distribution tends to spread out and shift towards larger values over time cnrm aladin and ipsl wrf while for others the distribution tends to flatten hadgem cclm and cnrm racmo with time the multi model distribution green shows an increasing trend 12 of the median between 2021 2040 and 2081 2100 from 440 689 m3 to 493 755 m3 27 of the 0 25 percentile from 327 246 m3 to 415 929 m3 and 30 of the 0 75 percentile from 520 287 m3 to 676 560 m3 this confirms the previous analysis shown in fig 5 of the upward trend in cso volumes the evolution of cso number distribution per 20 year period fig 7 does not reveal any pattern the ipsl wrf model shows an increasing trend for both the median and the quartiles while the hadgem cclm model shows a decreasing trend and the other three models no particular trend considering an increase of the total annual cso volumes and no clear evolution of the cso frequencies it suggests that the volume per cso will probably tend to increase in the future 4 discussion 4 1 impact of future rainfall on csos this new approach to determine future rainfall time series and the performance of long term simulations show an increase in cso volumes for all five climate models used between 13 and 52 from now until the end of the century in valence on the other hand there is no clear trend with regard to the variation of the annual cso number these results are consistent with the scientific literature as most authors conclude that there will be an increase in csos with climate change based on a change factor approach niemczynowicz 1989 concluded that in lund sweden the volumes discharged will increase between 11 and 78 depending on the hypothesis on the rainfall intensity increase nie et al 2009 showed that in fredrikstad norway the total volume spilled will increase by a factor of 1 5 to 3 times greater than the factor of increase of the rainfall volume mainly due to the runoff response of the urban watershed tavakol davani et al 2016 presented results where cso volumes increased up to 12 18 in the near future in the city of toledo usa gooré bi et al 2015 highlighted similar results with an increase of predicted cso volumes between 13 and 148 until 2050 based on eight rainfall events in longueuil canada roseboro et al 2021 showed that cso volumes could increase by 11 73 in 2070 2099 compared to 1970 1999 in buffalo usa considering only the impact of climate change mahaut and andrieu 2019 concluded that in nantes the total cso volume will be reduced by a factor of 3 until 2100 in the most optimistic scenario due to lower rainfall intensities however these results are presented for different regions and the impact of climate change is not uniform on the planet 4 2 relevance and limitations of the approach 4 2 1 practical methodology for use in urban hydrology the method developed here is based on easily accessible climatic projections and is therefore reproducible on any site with historical timeseries of rainfall in fine time steps the possibility of considering several climatic models is an option to manage uncertainty our choice to perform long term hydrological simulations i e continuous modelling over 80 years enables to assess not only the potential impact of all types of rain events on csos but also the impact of rain event sequences which would be impossible with a return period based approach 4 2 2 cascade of uncertainties in climate modelling uncertainties linked to the method developed here are numerous and exist at each stage of this work clark et al 2016 with regard to future rainfall time series production we will first mention the uncertainty linked to the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions in our case we assumed the most pessimistic available scenario i e the rcp 8 5 scenario then come the uncertainties related to the climate models used which produce different results from an identical starting situation this uncertainty comes from the construction and formulation specific to each model internal climate variability is also a source of uncertainty it corresponds to the butterfly effect finally regarding the production of future rainfall the last source of uncertainty concerns the bias correction and downscaling methods as for the hydrological and hydraulic modelling stage it includes uncertainties related to the conceptual nature of the physical phenomena description and the choice of hydrological parameters made during the calibration stage considering the uncertainty related to future climate many authors recommend to carry out simulations from several climate models maraun et al 2010 semenov et al 2010 fowler et al 2007 the eurocordex project brings together more than a hundred projections available in france the drias 2020 dataset is a selection of 12 gcm rcm pairs over historical and future periods amongst these available simulations we selected five for this study and we do not pretend to fully cover the range of uncertainties the results of this work can be considered as possible futures with an upward trend in the annual cso volumes which can be considered by the local authority in the implementation of its adaptation strategies 4 2 3 distribution of future rainfall an important approximation in the method used consists in the assumption of homogeneous future rain distribution on the whole urban area indeed the calibration and validation of the sewer network model were performed considering the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall events by using data acquired on five rain gauges covering the studied area simulations for future periods were performed on the grid point corresponding to the studied site considering the spatio temporal variability of rainfall at city scale in future climate is a major challenge for which we do not have identified a scientifically and technically acceptable solution while rainfall is a crucial parameter in hydrological modelling ballinas gonzález et al 2020 and failure to consider its heterogeneity in space and time is a very significant factor of uncertainty fraga et al 2019 4 2 4 advances in climate modelling new generations of regional climate models are emerging with a space grid of 3 km against 12 km currently for eurocordex simulations they will make it possible to consider orography in a finer way and to explicitly solve convection processes these models will also allow access to rainfall simulation results at intraday timesteps first results obtained in the south of france with this type of approach suggest that extreme events increase even more significantly luu 2020 pichelli et al 2021 it is therefore possible that the results in terms of csos presented in this work are underestimated however those new models are not widely and easily available yet 4 3 operational reach beyond the annual volume discharged the aspect of particular interest for local authorities is the percentage of the total volume spilled in relation to the total annual volume produced by the combined sewer system french regulations impose an annual overflow volume ratio of less than 5 in the case of the valence combined sewer system the distribution of annual percentages of cso volumes are compared to the total volume produced by the combined sewer system over 20 year periods on fig 8 the change in the percentage of cso volumes is quite similar to the evolution of the annual volumes discharged at gambetta csos the first box shows the observed cso distribution and indicates an often non compliant system with an annual median volume ratio around 7 result distributions by 20 year periods produced with all the models indicate an increasing trend in the median first quartile and third quartile values if the evolution of cso events cannot be highlighted the cso volumes at gambetta as well as the evolution of the total overflow volume percentage show an increasing trend this reflects an increase of the discharged volume per cso event related to the rainfall event intensification the valence combined sewer system does not fulfil the current french regulation and it will probably tend to be more problematic under a future climate leading to the receiving water quality degradation engagements have to be made on the adaptation strategies by local authorities such as clear water infiltration reduction pervious surface disconnection or green infrastructure deployment considering an evolution of the regulation that would not be based on volumes but on quality of cso discharges could be another perspective it is a possibility that could be offered under certain conditions in france to consider the compliance regarding the annual cod load released in the receiving water instead of the annual volume this approach has the advantage to be based on the pollution discharged and it is easier to quantify the impact on the environment 5 conclusions to predict future rainfall timeseries with a fine time step is a challenging task and uncertain exercise we have proposed an original approach that is feasible and reproducible on other sites to elaborate rainfall timeseries at a time step for the use in urban hydrology this approach is based on climate model outputs from the euro cordex project and on rainfall data recorded locally future rainfalls generated with a fine time step were used as input of a sewer network model enables to highlight a probable increase in cso volumes through the valence sewer system over the 2021 2100 period this increase will not meet current local compliance requirements all other things being equal population infrastructure land use urbanisation regulations the proposed approach quantifies the impact of future rainfall timeseries on csos and therefore can be used by local authorities to develop adaptation strategies in order to mitigate future rainfall effects on the sewer network operation this approach is a real source of insights for decision makers however it is necessary to deal with sources of uncertainty related to the method and the data used for practitioners such a methodology is a tangible outcome which can be replicable on other sites to determine in which proportion cso quantity and frequency may vary in the future future investigations will be based on the use of hourly outputs of the most recent climate models that are not yet accessible to all these outputs will be compared to the rainfall timeseries elaborated as part of this work which will be aggregated on an

15143,the evolution of the climate in the future will probably lead to an increase in extreme rainfall events particularly in the mediterranean regions this change in rainfall patterns will have impacts on combined sewer systems operation with a possible increase of spilled flows leading to an increase of untreated water volumes released to the receiving water due to the impact of overflows on the water cycle local authorities managing combined sewer systems are wondering about the extent of these changes and the possibility of taking it into account in stormwater management structure design to do this rainfall data with a fine time step are required to better master the shape of the hyetographs that are crucial to get a relevant rainfall runoff relationship in an urban environment however there are currently no simulations of future rainfall series available at a time step compatible with the needs in urban drainage field in this work future rainfall time series with a fine time step are elaborated with the aim to be used in urban hydrology the proposed approach is based on simulations results from five regional climate models in the framework of the euro cordex program it consists in a spatial downscaling step followed by a temporal disaggregation the rainfall time series obtained are then used as input for a calibrated and validated hydrological model to investigate the evolution of annual cso volumes and frequencies by 2100 the results show an increase of annual spilled volumes between 13 and 52 according to the considered climate model this increase will most likely be a problem regarding compliance of sewer networks in line with the water framework directive particularly the current french regulations no clear trends were observed on the cso frequencies if there is a consensus for all the carried out simulations to conclude that the cso volumes will increase we must remember that actual regional climate models suffer from limited spatial and temporal resolution and don t explicitly solve convection processes due to this point uncertainty concerning the evolution rate remains important particularly for intense rainfall episodes new generations of climate models are needed to accurately predict intense episodes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords climate change future rainfall time series combined sewer overflows cso climate model sewer network model data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rainfall event management through combined sewer systems is a major challenge for water authorities this management has two main objectives to protect people and goods against urban flooding and to preserve the receiving water quality by limiting untreated wastewater overflows from the combined sewer networks overflows that impact both aquatic life hvitved jacobsen 1982 and human health passerat et al 2011 regarding these management challenges local authorities have to make decisions about the facilities and structures to be installed in their sanitation systems kourtis et al 2020 accounting for important uncertainty egger and maurer 2015 these decisions basically involve significant investments for which the lifespan is several decades the question that then arises is whether changes in future rainfall patterns should be considered in planning choices and if so how kourtis et al 2020 made a review of research carried out on the impact of climate change on urban sanitation networks the vast majority of the studies cited focus on the impact of future rainfall on urban flooding few authors have investigated the climate change impact on combined sewer overflows cso additionally most of the studied sites are in northern europe and in north america the impact of other types of climates such as the mediterranean climate on sanitation systems have not yet been studied niemczynowicz 1989 worked on the lund sanitation system in sweden he presented the flow volumes increase as a result of the rainfall intensity increase for 1 to 10 year return period design storms nie et al 2009 studied the impact of future rainfall on the city of fredrikstad in norway future rainfall resulted from the application of a change factor on current rainfall the change factor consisted in increasing the intensity of historical precipitation by 20 30 and 50 in canada fortier and mailhot 2015 studied the impact of future rainfall produced on a daily time step on overflows from 30 combined sewer overflow structures csos in canada the authors built a model which estimates the occurrence probability and cso duration according to the total rainfall depth the model was calibrated using observed data and then used with daily rainfall data from a regional climate model as input results were analysed in terms of frequency and duration and the main conclusion is related to variations in seasonal distribution with an increase of frequency and duration in spring and autumn and a decrease in summer furlow et al 2006 analysed the evolution of cso frequency under climate change in the great lakes region of the united states the elaboration of climate scenarios was based on the application of a change factor to historical precipitations for given return periods change factors were determined using results from global climate models cccm and hadcm2 in france mahaut and andrieu 2019 proposed an analysis of the evolution of cso on the city of nantes sewer system this analysis combined climate change scenarios with population growth and urbanisation one of the main results is that for the city of nantes and for certain scenarios climate change seems to have a lower impact than population growth and urban development one of the key aspects when dealing with the impact of rainfall on sewer systems under climate change is the time step used for considering future rainfall several authors worked on producing small timestep rainfall timeseries for urban hydrology but often without implementation on urban catchment models müller thomy 2020 onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 peleg et al 2017 sørup et al 2016 thorndahl and andersen 2021 some did it anyway but without providing any details neither on the model structure nor on its calibration and validation processes sørup et al 2018 or by using an artificial combined sewer system model müller and haberlandt 2018 some authors propose downscaling methods to achieve sub daily rainfall description with the objective to use in a different purpose than assessing the impact on sewer networks pons et al 2022 used a downscaling method based on multiplicative random cascade to achieve small timestep rainfall description the timeseries were used on a small spatial scale to evaluate the performance of green roofs requena et al 2021 and nguyen et al 2018 proposed a downscaling method to achieve fine time step description of future rainfall to update idf curves results are presented for 5 min to 24 h duration to produce small time step timeseries those authors used rainfall generators involving several clustering processes including neymann scott processes sørup et al 2016 bartlett lewis processes onof and arnbjerg nielsen 2009 and multiple cascade models müller and haberlandt 2018 those statistical methods give good results but can be difficult to implement and to calibrate onof arnbjerg nielsen 2009 proposed an eight parameters bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model to achieve satisfying results as multiple cascade models are concerned considering autocorrelation is a real challenge and only very recent development seems to address the problem müller thomy 2020 compared to statistical approaches the analogue method is more rarely used despite its good performances zorita et von storch 1999 pui et al 2012 li et al 2017 if we focus on the literature concerning this method it is usually used for disaggregation at a large scale river watershed region or country and the timestep is not smaller than an hour carreau et al 2019 verfaillie et al 2017 bárdossy and pegram 2016 caillouet et al 2016 few authors like willems vrac 2011 use analogue method to achieve very small timestep 10 min for their approach another specificity of studies using analogue methods is that they often use a weather type approach which consists in defining a limited number of climatic situations classifying all days in one of those categories and finding analogs inside each category verfaillie et al 2017 willems and vrac 2011 authors who don t develop a weather typing approach usually use other comparison criteria often based on a rainfall depth comparison lee and jeong 2014 bárdossy and pegram 2016 or date proximity pui et al 2012 li et al 2017 the weather typing approach has proven its efficiency but is sometimes difficult to implement because of the need of large scale climate analysis in order to define the climate types if literature concerning small time step timeseries production is important studies combining methods of timeseries production and sewer network impact analysis are not numerous when the impact on urban systems is the core of the study sub daily rainfall description is not so common and most of the studies are based on daily future rainfall data to determine the evolution of sewer network flooding on a monthly yearly basis if we consider studies concerning impact of future rainfall on csos most authors used change factor methods applied on a wide timestep daily most of the time mailhot 2015 mahaud and andrieu 2019 for the most recent ones this daily time step is the shortest time step largely available from the climate model outputs mikovits et al 2017 used debiased data from the adamont project available on three hour time steps durand et al 2009 but he chose to use the climate model outputs on a daily timestep the objective of this work is to go a step further in considering the variation of rainfall patterns under climate change and especially rainfall intensities which are key for designing sewer systems this implies building continuous timeseries of small time steps 5 or 6 min rainfall events this is especially relevant in mediterranean climate where extreme rainfall intensities of 50 up to 100 mm h are regularly recorded over very short periods in france meteo france 2022 the mediterranean region will probably experience very significant variations in rainfall patterns in the future tramblay and somot 2018 such an evolution has already been observed in historical time series over the 1961 2015 period ribes et al 2019 extreme daily rainfalls are expected to increase with climate change thiebault and moatti 2016 in a sewer network it is assumed that the hydrograph shape at an outfall is related to the hyetograph shape on the corresponding watershed the rainfall runoff relationship in an urban environment is based on the knowledge of these hyetograph shapes and the small time step is a requirement the objective of this work is to assess the consequences of future rainfall patterns on combined sewer overflows in terms of annual spilled volumes and frequency an original method was developed based on data that are easy to access or collect in order to be readily reproducible on other sites this paper details the methodology in stages to build future rainfall timeseries with a fine time step well adapted to urban hydrology issues the future rainfall timeseries are then used to assess impact on cso with a distributed sewer network model the method is implemented for the city of valence in the south of france under a mediterranean climate the originality of this work lies in two aspects firstly it deals with the evolution of cso under a mediterranean climate in france by proposing a method to elaborate future rainfall time series and applying it on a real site using a fully calibrated sewer network model and secondly the authors propose an original approach based on the analogue method to elaborate future small time step rainfall the method involves several correspondence criteria to find future past analogs but without involving weather typing approach one of the main advantages of this approach is that it is relatively easy to reproduce and then can be suited for an operational use 2 material and methods the method developed here to determine future rainfall time series at a fine time step requires using climate model projection data for future rain events and past rainfall data for the downscaling process flow measurements are needed for sewer system modelling the proposed approach is tested on the city of valence in southern france this section first describes the investigated site and data sources future rainfall and temperature past rainfall observed flow rates the designed methods to elaborate future rainfall time series are then detailed as well as the quantification of their effect on cso in terms of annual spilled volumes and frequency 2 1 valence case study 2 1 1 description the city of valence is located in the rhone valley in the drôme department equidistant between lyon and avignon joly et al 2010 characterized the climate of drôme as altered mediterranean with mild winters and hot summers the autumn and winter seasons are rather humid but show significant interannual variability conversely the summer is dry and stable ref normal 1971 2000 with regard to precipitation the annual total is considered average 800 to 950 mm for france with a heterogeneous distribution over the department the combined sewer system covers two municipalities valence and bourg lès valence the sewer network is a combined system of 700 km in length the system drains to a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 172 000 people equivalent the network has 11 self monitored csos that can discharge into the rhône river during intense rainfall events amongst these the gambetta cso structure is the most important since it alone discharges about 450 000 m3 per year corresponding to 45 of the total volume discharged by the combined sewer system 2 1 2 historical rainfall data the first stage consisting in the spatial downscaling process requires to handle a large amount of relevant local observations in the current situation the best available data come from the french meteorological office meteo france at the valence chabeuil rain gauge station aggregated at a daily time step from september 1 1997 to november 3 2020 even if this is the best dataset available the period of twenty three years of observations is considered slightly insufficient to achieve a good fit the world meteorological organization recommends having observations over a minimum of thirty years to calculate climate normals wmo 2017 arguez et al 2011 for the second stage consisting in temporal disaggregation it is necessary to have rainfall hyetographs i e 6 minute time step rain data over a period as long as possible the french meteorological office provides 15 years of data at the valence chabeuil station from july 1 2005 to july 1 2020 daily average and daily maximum temperature data are available for this same station over the same period 2 1 3 hydrological data the gambetta csos are monitored according to the french regulation in this context the spilled flows have been measured continuously since 2014 with a 5 minute time step the data reliability has been checked and improved in 2018 claro barreto 2020 we selected the years 2019 and 2018 respectively for calibration and validation of the hydrological model 2 2 elaboration of future rainfall time series at a fine time step results of regional climate models rcm simulations cannot be used directly to feed an urban hydrological model the challenge is to transform daily data from rcm in 6 min time step data for the use as inputs of a rainfall runoff model to do so two key steps are carried out a spatial downscaling and a temporal disaggregation fig 1 2 2 1 climate change data the euro cordex project is the european branch of the cordex project initiated by the world climate research program vautard et al 2021 it aims to make climate simulation results available for all in order to determine the impacts of climate change and help to define adaptation strategies in europe each european union country is responsible for providing local data calculated using national models on which a bias correction is applied in october 2020 the french meteorological office meteo france made new simulation results available in france under the name drias 2020 dataset meteo france 2020 this new dataset is an update of the 2014 dataset the drias 2020 dataset benefits from the most recent euro cordex simulations and corrects anomalies highlighted in the 2014 simulations to build the drias 2020 dataset meteo france selected results between all the available euro cordex simulations to perform this selection meteo france chose the more realistic gcm rcm couples and tried to ensure the maximum diversity of gcm rcm combinations the selection led to a 42 simulation set with 12 covering the historical period and 30 over the future period 12 according to rcp8 5 10 according to rcp4 5 and 8 according to rcp2 6 a bias correction was applied to all these simulation results using the cdf t cumulative distribution function transform method vrac et al 2012 and the adamont method deque 2007 verfaillie et al 2017 throughout france using safran observation data le moigne 2002 the cdf t method is a statistical method based on the quantile quantile method q q method the drias 2020 dataset has an equivalent bias correction and a homogeneous spatial rendering on a 8 8 km resolution grid for all 42 simulations it provides daily outputs for a number of parameters including daily precipitation depth daily average temperature and daily maximum temperature over two simulation periods a historical period used for bias correction and a future period from 2006 to the end of 2100 for most simulations the present work focuses on the exploitation of five gcm rcm simulations from the drias 2020 dataset these five simulations were selected to better represent the diversity of future projections as specific models have particular trends i e drier or wetter hotter or cooler conditions with seasonal variations or just ranged within the multi model median in addition the most pessimistic greenhouse gas concentration pathway was retained i e rcp 8 5 in order to describe the worst case scenario the five selected gcm rcm couples their provider institutes and their tendencies are cnrm aladin gcm and rcm both issued by the french national centre for meteorological research simulations are close to the multi model median cnrm racmo french national centre for meteorological research royal netherlands meteorological institute simulations tend to generate rather cold and wet summers ipsl wrf pierre simon laplace institute for gcm and rcm simulations tend to generate hot and humid winters and cold and humid summers hadgem cclm met office hadley centre uk climate limited area modelling community international contributions simulations tend to generate warm winters and hot and dry summers mpiesm remo2009 max planck institute for meteorology germany climate service centre germany simulations tend to generate rather cold winters 2 2 2 step 1 spatial downscaling climate models results described above are provided on an 8 km x 8 km grid regional climate models poorly represent very small spatial scale rain phenomena including convective rainfall with a general tendency to underestimate the most intense precipitation events maraun et al 2010 piani et al 2010 the main reasons for this are firstly related to the models themselves which consider the orography in an imperfect way and do not represent the convection process and secondly the bias correction leads to a smoothing of the debiased simulation results this bias correction is performed using the safran reanalysis which consists in a resampling and a projection of meteorological observed data on an 8 km regular grid covering the whole french territory vidal et al 2010 in order to face this drawback we applied a new bias correction to the drias 2020 data based on local observed data at the valence chabeuil rain gauge station over the period 2005 2020 as for the downscaling carried out for the production of drias 2020 dataset we have retained the cdf t method but unlike the standard q q method it does not rely on the assumption of bias stationarity modelled values and observations may change and be different the assumption is that the simulations and the observed distributions can be inferred by a mathematical function the transform that remains the same for past and future distributions this method was initially developed by michelangeli et al 2009 on wind speed simulations and then widely used for other climatic parameters such as temperature and precipitation vrac et al 2012 lavaysse et al 2012 vigaud et al 2013 vautard et al 2013 a complete and accessible description of the cdf t method is included in vrac et al 2016 in our case we applied a second level of downscaling on the previously downscaled data from drias 2020 this step considering local rainfall time series can be viewed as a local downscaling 2 2 3 step 2 temporal disaggregation urban watersheds usually have a short lag time ranging from a few minutes to a few hours depending on configuration the sewer network hydraulic response is very sensitive to the hyetograph shape a convective short intense thunderstorm will produce a very different response from a long low intensity stratiform rain in addition urban watersheds are sensitive to the sequence of rainfall events which may occur on back to back days the second step of the process consists in temporal disaggregation that converts daily time step data into 6 minute time step data we chose 6 min because it is the time step for which observations data are available to do this we used a climate analogue approach for each future day we look for the best analogous day in the dataset for which the data are available at a 6 minute time step this method is inspired from the adamont method initially developed to deal with data from the french alps verfaillie et al 2017 and produce precipitation data with a 3 hour time step the challenge here is to determine the criteria to find the best possible analogue between a future day with a daily rain simulation value and a past day with a rain hyetograph with a 6 minute time step many authors have studied the relationships between rainfall intensity and atmospheric conditions such as surface air temperature usually considered 2 m above the ground and have shown that these relationships have implications on rainfall intensity variations lepore et al 2016 westra et al 2013 ben daoud et al 2011 other authors herath et al 2018 gyasi agyei 2018 have linked the rain intensity to the maximum daily temperature they have shown that short duration rainfall intensities are positively correlated to the maximum daily temperature and that this relationship is stronger for intense rains these relationships have been tested on the valence rainfall and temperature data at the valence chabeuil station and 4 criteria have been selected to identify analogue couples season total daily rainfall depth average daily temperature and maximum daily temperature 2 3 sewer network modelling to assess future sewer system discharges the impact of future rainfall time series was quantified using a distributed model built under the infoworks software the model represents the entire sewer network associated with the valence wastewater treatment plant as its outlet the designed model covers an area of 1574 ha divided into 154 sub watersheds of which 33 of the surface is impervious mainly roofs and roads the modelled network has 269 computing nodes and a total pipe length of approximately 48 km the runoff model used is a linear reservoir model with a lag time depending on urban watershed characteristics and rainfall intensity for impervious surfaces with a runoff coefficient of 0 3 for roads and 0 85 for roofs runoff on pervious surfaces is described by a horton model horton 1941 with an initial infiltration capacity of 76 mm h and a limiting infiltration capacity of 12 7 mm h the propagation of the flow in the pipes is ensured by a complete resolution of the barre de st venant equations cunge and wegner 1964 long term small time step continuous simulations have been run for calibration validation and simulation of future periods 2021 2100 3 results 3 1 future rainfall time series 3 1 1 spatial downscaling the spatial downscaling step enabled us to generate daily rainfall depths data according to local historical data fig 2 shows downscaled daily data for each season differences between gcm rcm original values and corrected values are more important for high daily rain depths for these higher daily rain depths 50 mm the downscaled values are higher than the original gcm rcm outputs in summer and winter for all the models the results for spring and autumn depend on the model considered spring data are the least affected by the downscaling process adjustment is particularly low for the ipsl wrf simulation in autumn downscaled rainfall depths are higher than original outputs for values over 50 mm for cnrm racmo and mpiesm remo2009 simulations and lower for the three other simulations 3 1 2 rain intensity vs temperature as it has been shown on other locations lepore et al 2016 bürger et al 2019 figs 3 a and 3b show that maximum rain intensities in valence are directly related to average daily temperatures but only up to a certain value in this case 18 to 24 c for the highest temperature class 24 to 30 c the percentile values tend to drop this trend is particularly marked for the 0 9 and 0 99 percentiles maximum daily temperatures with no limitation on this temperature scale 3 1 3 past future climate analogs the determination of the best past analogue day for each future day is done by minimizing the euclidean distance on all the past future parameters considered total daily rainfall depth average daily temperature and maximum daily temperature the search is performed for each season independently once analogs are identified we consider that the future 6 minute hyetographs have the same shape as the one in the past future 6 minute values of rainfall intensity are corrected to fit the total daily rainfall depth simulated by the climate models corrected with the cdf t method examples of analogue matches are shown in fig 4 characteristics of past future analogue days are specified on the top of each graph showing that rainfall depth and temperature conditions are quite similar for the future day and its best analogue in the past considering the median and first quartile figs 4a 4b 4d and 4e figs 4c and 4f show the correspondence for the highest euclidian distance it corresponds to the future day with the highest daily rainfall considering that such an event has not been observed in the past the correspondence is consequently weaker however the correspondence remains the best one available 3 1 4 sewer network modelling calibration and validation model calibration and validation have been performed for dry and wet weather results presented focus on the spilled volumes at the gambetta csos calibration was performed on 2019 data and validation on 2018 data by processing continuous simulations over each year for calibration and validation periods data from 5 rain gauges were available over the area in order to be as precise as possible those 5 rain gauges have been considered differences between simulated and measured csos are presented in table 1 total annual discharge and table 2 significant episodes for the gambetta csos the difference between simulated and measured total annual overflow volume is low 5 for the calibration year and 2 for the validation year table 1 this reflects the good capacity of the model to reproduce the annual volumes discharged these deviations are within the range of those widely accepted in hydrological modelling bertrand krajewski et al 2000 aguilar et al 2016 in this study results are considered as very good if the difference between simulation and measurement is less than 15 for volume less than 30 for peak flow and over 0 75 for nse nash sutcliffe error as recommended by moriasi et al 2015 in addition to the cso annual volume we present the results for the most significant cso events over the two years table 2 these correspond to 76 of the annual discharged volume for 2019 and 72 for 2018 these results show that with regard to the volumes spilled per episode in the calibration phase the difference between simulation and measurement is less than 15 for 10 out of 14 episodes concerning the peak flow value the difference is less than 30 for 11 out of 14 episodes the nse is always higher than 0 2 for all events meaning that the model is more accurate than the mean value of the observations median value of nse is 0 82 indicating a very accurate model these results allow us to conclude that the calibration is acceptable based on the data recorded during the year 2019 and according to the precision that can be expected from a model calibrated on the basis of flow measurements in a sewer system the results for 2018 are of comparable quality over this validation period the difference between simulation and measurement is less than 15 for 13 episodes out of 17 with regard to peak flows the difference is less than 30 for 16 episodes out of 17 the median nse is 0 77 we therefore conclude that the model reproduces cso in a satisfying way and that it can be used to predict the impact of future precipitation on the cso volume and frequency over the 2021 2100 period without any structural modification in this study all the factors including population urbanisation and land use are considered stable until 2100 it is clearly a non realistic hypothesis but to characterise the impact of climate change on csos all other factors must stay unchanged 3 2 future cso volumes and frequency future rainfall time series produced from the five selected climate models are used as input to the sewer network model to produce cso flow rates at the gambetta csos at 5 minute timestep between 2021 and 2100 discharged volumes are aggregated on an annual basis two types of data analysis are proposed continuous 30 year moving average plots and four 20 year boxplots one of the major causes of interannual variation in climate models is internal climate variability which consists of a set of natural internal processes leading to an alternance of dry and wet years as well as hot and cold years deser et al 2012 ribes et al 2020 this internal variability yields highly unsteady annual discharged volumes that hide possible long term trends to overcome this a smoothing is applied to the cso volumes it consists in calculating a moving average centred on 30 years as climate normals are traditionally defined over 30 year periods https www ncdc noaa gov news defining climate normals new ways fig 5 presents results on future overflow volumes and frequencies it highlights a trend towards an increase of the cso volumes for all the climate models selected left column on the other hand there is no consensus regarding the evolution of the annual number of cso events per year since 3 models show a downward trend and the other two an upward trend right column annual spilled volumes increase over the 2021 2100 period between 13 and 52 with significant p value tests table 3 regarding the number of annual cso the p value is only significant for three climate models with an increasing trend for ipsl wrf and cnrm racmo and a decreasing trend for hadgem cclm those results are well represented by the multi model average which highlights an increase of the annual volume and no clear tendency for the annual cso frequency number of overflow events another way to analyse the results is to plot the distributions of volume discharges over four 20 year periods from 2021 to 2100 figs 6 and 7 show boxplots for annual discharges and number of events historical 2006 2021 observations are also represented red in order to confront simulation results to observations fig 6 shows the annual overflow volumes over the historical period pink according to each climate model these results were obtained by applying the downscaling and temporal disaggregation steps to simulation results for each climate model over the 2006 2021 period direct comparisons between simulations and measurements should be done with caution because observations are the results of real rainfall fields on the catchment with all the heterogeneity related to real events whereas simulation results are computed with the assumption of a homogenous rainfall field over the entire catchment another important aspect is the duration of the historical period sixteen years is presumably too short to manage climate internal variability and its impact on simulation results over relatively short periods considering this it appears that median simulation values over the historical period are quite similar to the observed median value except for the ipslwrf model which shows a higher median value distribution between first and third quartile is spread out for all models to a small extent for cnrmaladin mpiesmremo and ipslwrf and more broadly for the two other models if we consider the 5th quartile values obtained with all models are consistent with the observations the 95th quartile is higher for all simulations but the difference remains low if the outliers are considered especially for the measurements the differences in distributions according to the models reflect the uncertainty associated with climate modelling and lead us to consider the results of the multi model aggregation green boxplots the distribution is wider than the observations but we nethertheless consider it to be representative of real rainfall fields as the strong hypothesis on simulated rainfall homogeneity leads to overestimate discharged volumes comparison between models results and measurement according to the annual number of cso is shown on fig 7 red and pink boxplots we observe an offset of the annual number of cso for all models according to the measurements if we compare models between themselves we highlight a certain homogeneity with median values between 55 and 58 cso events per year and comparable extents of distributions for all models here again the assumption that the rainfall field is homogenous lead to this overestimation of the annual cso number considering the future period the different climate models present strong disparities between annual discharges basically median annual volumes tend to increase except for the mpiesm remo and cnrm racmo simulations over the 2081 2100 period for some models the distribution tends to spread out and shift towards larger values over time cnrm aladin and ipsl wrf while for others the distribution tends to flatten hadgem cclm and cnrm racmo with time the multi model distribution green shows an increasing trend 12 of the median between 2021 2040 and 2081 2100 from 440 689 m3 to 493 755 m3 27 of the 0 25 percentile from 327 246 m3 to 415 929 m3 and 30 of the 0 75 percentile from 520 287 m3 to 676 560 m3 this confirms the previous analysis shown in fig 5 of the upward trend in cso volumes the evolution of cso number distribution per 20 year period fig 7 does not reveal any pattern the ipsl wrf model shows an increasing trend for both the median and the quartiles while the hadgem cclm model shows a decreasing trend and the other three models no particular trend considering an increase of the total annual cso volumes and no clear evolution of the cso frequencies it suggests that the volume per cso will probably tend to increase in the future 4 discussion 4 1 impact of future rainfall on csos this new approach to determine future rainfall time series and the performance of long term simulations show an increase in cso volumes for all five climate models used between 13 and 52 from now until the end of the century in valence on the other hand there is no clear trend with regard to the variation of the annual cso number these results are consistent with the scientific literature as most authors conclude that there will be an increase in csos with climate change based on a change factor approach niemczynowicz 1989 concluded that in lund sweden the volumes discharged will increase between 11 and 78 depending on the hypothesis on the rainfall intensity increase nie et al 2009 showed that in fredrikstad norway the total volume spilled will increase by a factor of 1 5 to 3 times greater than the factor of increase of the rainfall volume mainly due to the runoff response of the urban watershed tavakol davani et al 2016 presented results where cso volumes increased up to 12 18 in the near future in the city of toledo usa gooré bi et al 2015 highlighted similar results with an increase of predicted cso volumes between 13 and 148 until 2050 based on eight rainfall events in longueuil canada roseboro et al 2021 showed that cso volumes could increase by 11 73 in 2070 2099 compared to 1970 1999 in buffalo usa considering only the impact of climate change mahaut and andrieu 2019 concluded that in nantes the total cso volume will be reduced by a factor of 3 until 2100 in the most optimistic scenario due to lower rainfall intensities however these results are presented for different regions and the impact of climate change is not uniform on the planet 4 2 relevance and limitations of the approach 4 2 1 practical methodology for use in urban hydrology the method developed here is based on easily accessible climatic projections and is therefore reproducible on any site with historical timeseries of rainfall in fine time steps the possibility of considering several climatic models is an option to manage uncertainty our choice to perform long term hydrological simulations i e continuous modelling over 80 years enables to assess not only the potential impact of all types of rain events on csos but also the impact of rain event sequences which would be impossible with a return period based approach 4 2 2 cascade of uncertainties in climate modelling uncertainties linked to the method developed here are numerous and exist at each stage of this work clark et al 2016 with regard to future rainfall time series production we will first mention the uncertainty linked to the evolution of greenhouse gas emissions in our case we assumed the most pessimistic available scenario i e the rcp 8 5 scenario then come the uncertainties related to the climate models used which produce different results from an identical starting situation this uncertainty comes from the construction and formulation specific to each model internal climate variability is also a source of uncertainty it corresponds to the butterfly effect finally regarding the production of future rainfall the last source of uncertainty concerns the bias correction and downscaling methods as for the hydrological and hydraulic modelling stage it includes uncertainties related to the conceptual nature of the physical phenomena description and the choice of hydrological parameters made during the calibration stage considering the uncertainty related to future climate many authors recommend to carry out simulations from several climate models maraun et al 2010 semenov et al 2010 fowler et al 2007 the eurocordex project brings together more than a hundred projections available in france the drias 2020 dataset is a selection of 12 gcm rcm pairs over historical and future periods amongst these available simulations we selected five for this study and we do not pretend to fully cover the range of uncertainties the results of this work can be considered as possible futures with an upward trend in the annual cso volumes which can be considered by the local authority in the implementation of its adaptation strategies 4 2 3 distribution of future rainfall an important approximation in the method used consists in the assumption of homogeneous future rain distribution on the whole urban area indeed the calibration and validation of the sewer network model were performed considering the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall events by using data acquired on five rain gauges covering the studied area simulations for future periods were performed on the grid point corresponding to the studied site considering the spatio temporal variability of rainfall at city scale in future climate is a major challenge for which we do not have identified a scientifically and technically acceptable solution while rainfall is a crucial parameter in hydrological modelling ballinas gonzález et al 2020 and failure to consider its heterogeneity in space and time is a very significant factor of uncertainty fraga et al 2019 4 2 4 advances in climate modelling new generations of regional climate models are emerging with a space grid of 3 km against 12 km currently for eurocordex simulations they will make it possible to consider orography in a finer way and to explicitly solve convection processes these models will also allow access to rainfall simulation results at intraday timesteps first results obtained in the south of france with this type of approach suggest that extreme events increase even more significantly luu 2020 pichelli et al 2021 it is therefore possible that the results in terms of csos presented in this work are underestimated however those new models are not widely and easily available yet 4 3 operational reach beyond the annual volume discharged the aspect of particular interest for local authorities is the percentage of the total volume spilled in relation to the total annual volume produced by the combined sewer system french regulations impose an annual overflow volume ratio of less than 5 in the case of the valence combined sewer system the distribution of annual percentages of cso volumes are compared to the total volume produced by the combined sewer system over 20 year periods on fig 8 the change in the percentage of cso volumes is quite similar to the evolution of the annual volumes discharged at gambetta csos the first box shows the observed cso distribution and indicates an often non compliant system with an annual median volume ratio around 7 result distributions by 20 year periods produced with all the models indicate an increasing trend in the median first quartile and third quartile values if the evolution of cso events cannot be highlighted the cso volumes at gambetta as well as the evolution of the total overflow volume percentage show an increasing trend this reflects an increase of the discharged volume per cso event related to the rainfall event intensification the valence combined sewer system does not fulfil the current french regulation and it will probably tend to be more problematic under a future climate leading to the receiving water quality degradation engagements have to be made on the adaptation strategies by local authorities such as clear water infiltration reduction pervious surface disconnection or green infrastructure deployment considering an evolution of the regulation that would not be based on volumes but on quality of cso discharges could be another perspective it is a possibility that could be offered under certain conditions in france to consider the compliance regarding the annual cod load released in the receiving water instead of the annual volume this approach has the advantage to be based on the pollution discharged and it is easier to quantify the impact on the environment 5 conclusions to predict future rainfall timeseries with a fine time step is a challenging task and uncertain exercise we have proposed an original approach that is feasible and reproducible on other sites to elaborate rainfall timeseries at a time step for the use in urban hydrology this approach is based on climate model outputs from the euro cordex project and on rainfall data recorded locally future rainfalls generated with a fine time step were used as input of a sewer network model enables to highlight a probable increase in cso volumes through the valence sewer system over the 2021 2100 period this increase will not meet current local compliance requirements all other things being equal population infrastructure land use urbanisation regulations the proposed approach quantifies the impact of future rainfall timeseries on csos and therefore can be used by local authorities to develop adaptation strategies in order to mitigate future rainfall effects on the sewer network operation this approach is a real source of insights for decision makers however it is necessary to deal with sources of uncertainty related to the method and the data used for practitioners such a methodology is a tangible outcome which can be replicable on other sites to determine in which proportion cso quantity and frequency may vary in the future future investigations will be based on the use of hourly outputs of the most recent climate models that are not yet accessible to all these outputs will be compared to the rainfall timeseries elaborated as part of this work which will be aggregated on an

15144,coliphage have been suggested as an alternative to fecal indicator bacteria for assessing recreational beach water quality but it is unclear how frequently and at what types of beaches coliphage produces a different management outcome here we conducted side by side sampling of male specific and somatic coliphage by the new epa dead end hollow fiber ultrafiltration d hfuf sal method and enterococcus at southern california beaches over two years when samples were combined for all beach sites somatic and male specific coliphage both correlated with enterococcus when examined categorically enterococcus would have resulted in approximately two times the number of health advisories as somatic coliphage and four times that of male specific coliphage using recently proposed thresholds of 60 pfu 100 ml for somatic and 30 pfu 100 ml for male specific coliphage overall only 12 of total exceedances would have been for coliphage alone somatic coliphage exceedances that occurred in the absence of an enterococcus exceedance were limited to a single site during south swell events when this beach is known to be affected by nearby minimally treated sewage thus somatic coliphage provided additional valuable health protection information but may be more appropriate as a supplement to fib measurements rather than as replacement because a epa approved pcr methods for enterococcus allow a more rapid response b coliphage is more challenging owing to its greater sampling volume and laboratory time requirements and c enterococcus long data history has yielded predictive management models that would need to be recreated for coliphage keywords coliphage fecal indicators beach water quality data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the current epa approved approach for monitoring beach water quality involves measuring fecal indicator bacteria fib such as enterococcus or escherichia coli fib are abundant in the human intestinal tract inexpensive to measure and serve as an effective predictor for the presence of fecal waste they are measured in preference to pathogens because of cost and challenges of detecting pathogens which occur at low concentration however several concerns have been raised with the use of fib fib have different fate and transport characteristics boehm et al 2019 worley morse et al 2019 than the viral pathogens that are causative agents for many recreational waterborne illnesses soller et al 2010 they also differ in their survival through the wastewater treatment train with fib more susceptible to disinfection than viruses korajkic et al 2022 mcminn et al 2017 sobsey 1989 which leads to under protection if fib are inactivated and viruses survive another concern is that fib can persist and regrow in the ambient environment imamura et al 2011 wanjugi and harwood 2013 which would lead to overestimating water quality concerns if the source of fib is independent of fecal inputs coliphage a type of bacteriophage that infects e coli has been proposed as an alternative indicator nappier et al 2019 coliphage has a morphology analogous to human enteric viruses leading to similarity in their fate and transport characteristics including through the wastewater treatment train bae and schwab 2008 korajkic et al 2018 coliphages occur at high densities in wastewater and the cost of measurement is similar to that of fib with method validation studies indicating that coliphage enumeration methods are robust griffith et al 2009 and can be readily employed by health department laboratories zimmer faust et al 2022 previous epidemiologic studies have found the relationship between coliphage density and human health risk is similar to that for fib benjamin chung et al 2017 griffith et al 2016 further supporting the application of coliphage as a proxy for pathogenic viruses in recreational water settings widespread utilization of coliphage for recreational water assessment has been challenging historically due to the fact that environmental concentrations may be too low for routine monitoring enumeration boehm et al 2009 however the epa recently promulgated a new draft method epa methods 1642 that couples hollowfiber ultrafiltration with a single agar layer assay for enumeration d hfuf sal of male specific and somatic coliphages from two liter water samples mcminn et al 2017 usepa 2018 leading to an approximate ten fold increase in the volume assayed despite the potential utility of coliphages as an additional indicator there is little information about coliphage prevalence in recreational water environments relative to other indicators and how often management decisions would change if coliphage were used in place of or in addition to fib in addition there are two types of coliphages male specific and somatic and it is unclear how their prevalence differs in ambient water in this study fib and male specific and somatic coliphage were measured side by side utilizing the new d hfuf sal epa method at 12 california beaches over a two year period during wet and dry weather conditions 2 material and methods twelve southern california beach sites were sampled by six laboratories that had demonstrated acceptable performance using epa method 1642 zimmer faust et al 2022 table 1 two liter grab water samples were collected in parallel to water collected for fib analysis as part of routine monitoring efforts dry weather samples were collected in the morning to mirror routine monitoring procedures and limit degradation of the microbial signal due to sunlight exposure wet weather storm samples were collected as soon as possible following a qualified storm event defined as at least 0 10 inch of rainfall following an antecedent dry period of three or more days and within 72 h of cessation of precipitation samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and processed for cultivable enterococcus within six hours of sample collection male specific and somatic coliphage were processed within 48 h of sample collection 2 1 coliphage and enterococci analyses epa method 1642 was used for enumeration of male

least four consecutive weeks of acceptable performance were included monthly a method blank sterile pbs used in place of the sample and media sterility blanks were run alongside water samples each day samples were collected enterococcus was enumerated alongside coliphage in all samples tested enterococcus was enumerated according to epa method 1600 usepa 2009 at all sites with the exception of surfer s knoll and surfer s point at those two locations enterococcus was enumerated by enterolert with the quanti tray 2000 system as per the manufacturer s instructions idexx westbrook me united states 2 2 data analysis relationships among fecal indicators enterococcus and male specific and somatic coliphage were assessed using regression analyses with analysis of variance anova used to compare differences between sites when a significant difference was found the multcomp package was used to run a post hoc tukey comparison test for individual pairwise site comparisons data were also examined categorically to determine the percentage of beaches that were not meeting health advisory water quality thresholds epa has not yet established a health threshold for somatic or male specific coliphage so thresholds of 60 pfu 100 ml and 30 pfu 100 ml were utilized respectively based on boehm et al 2019 health risk model according to epa method 1642 all coliphage concentrations are reported per l concentrations in this study were converted to per 100 ml for comparison to the proposed thresholds and to the enterococcus concentrations measured all statistical analyses were done using r

at least 10 paired samples for both wet and dry weather conditions combined were collected n 11 sites for somatic and n 10 sites for male specific coliphage male specific coliphage levels were correlated with enterococcus at all sites apart from santa monica pier malibu surfrider and surfer s point fig 1 somatic coliphage levels were correlated with enterococcus at all sites apart from

number of health advisories as somatic coliphage and four times that of male specific coliphage there were 59 exceedances 18 of all samples of the enterococcus single sample health advisory water quality threshold across all sites the proposed coliphage thresholds were exceeded in a total of 32 samples for somatic 9 of all samples and 14 samples for male specific 4 of all samples coliphage for both wet and dry weather the highest exceedance frequency for all three indicators enterococcus male specific and somatic coliphage occurred at imperial beach table 2 imperial beach was also the only site that exceeded the male specific threshold of 30 pfu 100 ml for the duration of the study for somatic coliphage exceedances of the 60 pfu 100 ml threshold occurred at imperial beach dog beach cabrillo surfer s point and san clemente pier table 2 when examined categorically both male specific and somatic coliphage levels were significantly higher when enterococcus was above versus below the enterococcus single sample public health water quality threshold p 0 05 fig 4 however thresholds for all three indicators were exceeded in the same sample only 15 of the time with those samples limited exclusively to imperial beach fig 5 forty six percent of total exceedances were detected by enterococcus alone while only 12 were detected by somatic coliphage without enterococcus for the few samples n 8 where somatic coliphage would have produced a health warning in the absence of an enterococcus health warning all but one were associated with samples collected from imperial beach during dry weather south swell conditions fig 5a only 28 of the exceedances detected by coliphage were detected by both types of coliphage concurrently there were no instances for either dry or wet weather samples where male specific coliphage would have produced a health warning in the absence of an enterococcus health warning at the current proposed risk thresholds 4 discussion coliphage has been suggested as an additional indicator for assessing surface water quality however it is unclear how coliphage concentrations compare to indicator bacteria and at what types of beaches coliphage will produce a different result or management outcome the level of correlation observed for enterococcus and coliphage in this study was higher than that found in the previous side by side study with fib and the new d hfuf sal epa method for coliphage wanjugi et al 2018 some of that difference might be attributable to habitat as the previous studies were conducted on freshwater great lakes beaches and the comparisons were to fecal coliforms rather than enterococcus our data suggests that the relationships observed are site dependent with four of the 11 beach sites evaluated lacking a significant relationship between enterococcus and coliphage two malibu creek surfrider and santa monica pier were locations where environmental re growth of fib has been suggested as a potential fib source mika et al 2014 which would lead to a decoupling of these indicators the other two sites surfer s point and surfer s knoll are located in proximity to a wastewater treatment facility and previous studies have detected the hf183 human genetic marker in the adjacent ventura harbor mika et al 2017 both coliphage and enterococcus concentrations depend on a variety of factors including distance from pollution source transport jofre et al 2021 and environmental conditions that may impact persistence wanjugi et al 2018 these factors likely contributed to the site specificity in this study as well as the differences reported in the relationships between bacterial indicators and coliphage in previous efforts jiang and chu 2004 collected samples from different southern california fresh and brackish water creek sites finding male specific coliphage to covary with fecal coliform but not enterococcus and somatic coliphage to not covary with either bacterial indicator wanjugi et al 2018 found that fib and male specific and somatic coliphage concentrations were weakly correlated at most 75 but not all of great lakes sites sampled with weaker correlations observed at beach versus river sites in contrast other efforts have reported significant relationships between enterococcus e coli and coliphage in surface waters contreras coll et al 2002 ibarluzea et al 2007 as well as similar seasonal patterns of the indicators jiang et al 2007 during this study fewer public health warnings would have been issued using coliphage compared to enterococcus enterococcus would have resulted in approximately two times the number of health advisories as somatic coliphage and four times that of male specific coliphage there were eight samples total that were flagged by the proposed coliphage thresholds without enterococcus also being in exceedance all but one of these samples occurred at imperial beach the samples that were flagged by coliphage and not enterococcus at imperial beach occurred during dry weather in the late summer early fall during south swell conditions average wave direction in the 48 h preceding sampling was between 118 and 225 deg these same south swell conditions have previously been linked to the transport of minimally treated sewage emanating from a wastewater treatment plant in tijuana mexico feddersen et al 2021 zimmer faust et al 2021 the decoupling observed between coliphage and enterococcus measurements at this site may be a result of differences in persistence patterns and illustrate the potential for the proposed somatic coliphage threshold to capture water quality impacts that are not always detectable by culturable enterococcus the proposed threshold for male specific coliphage was less sensitive as there were no additional health warnings triggered which is consistent with the findings of li et al 2021 however the coliphage thresholds used both in this study and that of li et al 2021 were based on boehm et al 2019 human health modeling as an epa threshold has yet to be established depending on how thresholds are generated and if differences in the environmental persistence and relative aging of coliphage relative to other pathogens are considered thresholds may be lowered boehm et al 2019 the lack of threshold exceedances and the high rate of non detects for male specific coliphage might suggest that somatic is the more useful of the two phage indicators these findings regarding sensitivity are consistent with other studies that have evaluated somatic and male specific coliphage levels in europe contreras coli et al 2002 spain ibarluzea et al 2007 the great lakes mi usa wanjugi et al 2018 and southern california usa jiang and chu 2004 love et al 2014 mcminn et al 2017b aggregated fib and coliphage levels across different marine beaches finding average enterococcus levels to be roughly twice that of somatic coliphage and 10 times that of male specific coliphage there are however other considerations beyond sensitivity when weighing the relative efficacy of the two coliphage indicators one of which is ease of implementation male specific coliphage may require more experienced laboratory staff for plaque identification due to their smaller plaque size usepa 2016 another consideration is relationship to pathogen levels and health risk previous studies have found a slightly better link between male specific coliphage presence and waterborne illness rates however additional studies comparing somatic versus male specific coliphage to viral pathogen presence and associated health risk are needed griffith et al 2016 and benjamin chung et al 2017 both found slightly better relationships to multiple health outcomes for male specific coliphage in southern california korajkic et al 2018 found that male specific coliphage out performed somatic coliphage in its ability to predict pathogen presence although a significant relationship was not observed however neither somatic nor male specific coliphage have been found to consistently covary with presence of human enteric pathogens when samples were collected at different locations within a single southern california bay human enteric viruses had a different seasonal pattern than both fib and male specific coliphage jiang et al 2007 love et al 2014 found conflicting trends for two southern california beach sites sampled the presence of adenovirus correlated with the presence of male specific coliphage and fib at a site in avalon ca usa likely impacted by leaky sewage infrastructure but did not at doheny beach ca usa there are several possible ways to incorporate coliphage into routine beach monitoring a as a fib replacement b as an additional threshold in which health warnings could be issued if either indicator exceed a threshold or c as a modifier to the existing fib based thresholds we suggest that there are several advantages to continuing fib as part of routine beach water quality monitoring efforts pcr based approaches have been approved by the usepa allowing for same day results for both enterococci and e coli usepa 2012 in addition the higher volumes 2l required for the new d hfuf sal epa coliphage method may be challenging at some locations and the number of laboratory staff and time needed for this method can be an obstacle for smaller or short staffed monitoring agencies the thresholds developed for fib are also based on epidemiological studies that have been conducted under varying conditions and at multiple geographies wade et al 2022 providing confidence in these thresholds for public health protection lastly fib have been used historically thus long term data sets exist that allow for the evaluation of specific management actions on water quality as well as predictive model development and water quality forecasting gonzalez et al 2012 stidson et al 2012 thoe et al 2015 2014 the few additional samples identified as of health concern by coliphage alone suggests that coliphage should be used to help interpret fib response rather than as an independent indicator with the large number of beaches experiencing high fib counts potentially due to environmental and non human sources managers are increasingly looking for ways to prioritize beaches with the greatest health risk one approach gaining favor is use of the hf183 human associated genetic marker to prioritize beaches that most likely have a human fecal contamination signature cao et al 2018 coliphage presents another alternative to implement such a strategy as we observed more than half of the of the enterococcus threshold exceedances occurred without a corresponding exceedance of either male specific or somatic coliphage in contrast almost 20 of the enterococcus exceedances occurred simultaneously with exceedances of both coliphage measures which suggests that these may be beaches which managers should put the most effort into mitigating 5 conclusions the relationships observed between indicators were site dependent with four of the 11 beach sites lacking a significant relationship between enterococcus and coliphage likely a result of differences in source and environmental transport and persistence when coliphage concentrations were compared to newly proposed thresholds beach water quality monitoring with either somatic or male specific coliphage led to fewer public health warnings compared to enterococcus coliphage exceedances in the absence of an enterococcus exceedance were limited a single site during conditions when this beach is suspected to be affected by nearby minimally treated sewage coliphage may provide additional valuable health protection information at certain sites declaration of competing interest the authors

department laboratories zimmer faust et al 2022 previous epidemiologic studies have found the relationship between coliphage density and human health risk is similar to that for fib benjamin chung et al 2017 griffith et al 2016 further supporting the application of coliphage as a proxy for pathogenic viruses in recreational water settings widespread utilization of coliphage for recreational water assessment has been challenging historically due to the fact that environmental concentrations may be too low for routine monitoring enumeration boehm et al 2009 however the epa recently promulgated a new draft method epa methods 1642 that couples hollowfiber ultrafiltration with a single agar layer assay for enumeration d hfuf sal of male specific and somatic coliphages from two liter water samples mcminn et al 2017 usepa 2018 leading to an approximate ten fold increase in the volume assayed despite the potential utility of coliphages as an additional indicator there is little information about coliphage prevalence in recreational water environments relative to other indicators and how often management decisions would change if coliphage were used in place of or in addition to fib in addition there are two types of coliphages male specific and somatic and it is unclear how their prevalence differs in ambient water in this study fib and male specific and somatic coliphage were measured side by side utilizing the new d hfuf sal epa method at 12 california beaches over a two year period during wet and dry weather conditions 2 material and methods twelve southern california beach sites were sampled by six laboratories that had demonstrated acceptable performance using epa method 1642 zimmer faust et al 2022 table 1 two liter grab water samples were collected in parallel to water collected for fib analysis as part of routine monitoring efforts dry weather samples were collected in the morning to mirror routine monitoring procedures and limit degradation of the microbial signal due to sunlight exposure wet weather storm samples were collected as soon as possible following a qualified storm event defined as at least 0 10 inch of rainfall following an antecedent dry period of three or more days and within 72 h of cessation of precipitation samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and processed for cultivable enterococcus within six hours of sample collection male specific and somatic coliphage were processed within 48 h of sample collection 2 1 coliphage and enterococci analyses epa method 1642 was used for enumeration of male specific and somatic coliphage from surface waters briefly 2 l of sample water was concentrated using a hollow fiber ultrafilter asahi kasei rexeed 15s single use high flux dialyzer dial medical

concentrated sample volume was evenly divided into two 100 ml aliquots and assayed for both male specific and somatic coliphage by single agar layer with the eluent equivalent to one liter

least four consecutive weeks of acceptable performance were included monthly a method blank sterile pbs used in place of the sample and media sterility blanks were run alongside water samples each day samples were collected enterococcus was enumerated alongside coliphage in all samples tested enterococcus was enumerated according to epa method 1600 usepa 2009 at all sites with the exception of surfer s knoll and surfer s point at those two locations enterococcus was enumerated by enterolert with the quanti tray 2000 system as per the manufacturer s instructions idexx westbrook me united states 2 2 data analysis relationships among fecal indicators enterococcus and male specific and somatic coliphage were assessed using regression analyses with analysis of variance anova used to compare differences between sites when a significant difference was found the multcomp package was used to run a post hoc tukey comparison test for individual pairwise site comparisons data were also examined categorically to determine the percentage of beaches that were not meeting health advisory water quality thresholds epa has not yet established a health threshold for somatic or male specific coliphage so thresholds of 60 pfu 100 ml and 30 pfu 100 ml were utilized respectively based on boehm et al 2019 health risk model according to epa method 1642 all coliphage concentrations are reported per l concentrations in this study were converted to per 100 ml for comparison to the proposed thresholds and to the enterococcus concentrations measured all statistical analyses were done using r

number of health advisories as somatic coliphage and four times that of male specific coliphage there were 59 exceedances 18 of all samples of the enterococcus single sample health advisory water quality threshold across all sites the proposed coliphage thresholds were exceeded in a total of 32 samples for somatic 9 of all samples and 14 samples for male specific 4 of all samples coliphage for both wet and dry weather the highest exceedance frequency for all three indicators enterococcus male specific and somatic coliphage occurred at imperial beach table 2 imperial beach was also the only site that exceeded the male specific threshold of 30 pfu 100 ml for the duration of the study for somatic coliphage exceedances of the 60 pfu 100 ml threshold occurred at imperial beach dog beach cabrillo surfer s point and san clemente pier table 2 when examined categorically both male specific and somatic coliphage levels were significantly higher when enterococcus was above versus below the enterococcus single sample public health water quality threshold p 0 05 fig 4 however thresholds for all three indicators were exceeded in the same sample only 15 of the time with those samples limited exclusively to imperial beach fig 5 forty six percent of total exceedances were detected by enterococcus alone while only 12 were detected by somatic coliphage without enterococcus for the few samples n 8 where somatic coliphage would have produced a health warning in the absence of an enterococcus health warning all but one were associated with samples collected from imperial beach during dry weather south swell conditions fig 5a only 28 of the exceedances detected by coliphage were detected by both types of coliphage concurrently there were no instances for either dry or wet weather samples where male specific coliphage would have produced a health warning in the absence of an enterococcus health warning at the current proposed risk thresholds 4 discussion coliphage has been suggested as an additional indicator for assessing surface water quality however it is unclear how coliphage concentrations compare to indicator bacteria and at what types of beaches coliphage will produce a different result or management outcome the level of correlation observed for enterococcus and coliphage in this study was higher than that found in the previous side by side study with fib and the new d hfuf sal epa method for coliphage wanjugi et al 2018 some of that difference might be attributable to habitat as the previous studies were conducted on freshwater great lakes beaches and the comparisons were to fecal coliforms rather than enterococcus our data suggests that the relationships observed are site dependent with four of the 11 beach sites evaluated lacking a significant relationship between enterococcus and coliphage two malibu creek surfrider and santa monica pier were locations where environmental re growth of fib has been suggested as a potential fib source mika et al 2014 which would lead to a decoupling of these indicators the other two sites surfer s point and surfer s knoll are located in proximity to a wastewater treatment facility and previous studies have detected the hf183 human genetic marker in the adjacent ventura harbor mika et al 2017 both coliphage and enterococcus concentrations depend on a variety of factors including distance from pollution source transport jofre et al 2021 and environmental conditions that may impact persistence wanjugi et al 2018 these factors likely contributed to the site specificity in this study as well as the differences reported in the relationships between bacterial indicators and coliphage in previous efforts jiang and chu 2004 collected samples from different southern california fresh and brackish water creek sites finding male specific coliphage to covary with fecal coliform but not enterococcus and somatic coliphage to not covary with either bacterial indicator wanjugi et al 2018 found that fib and male specific and somatic coliphage concentrations were weakly correlated at most 75 but not all of great lakes sites sampled with weaker correlations observed at beach versus river sites in contrast other efforts have reported significant relationships between enterococcus e coli and coliphage in surface waters contreras coll et al 2002 ibarluzea et al 2007 as well as similar seasonal patterns of the indicators jiang et al 2007 during this study fewer public health warnings would have been issued using coliphage compared to enterococcus enterococcus would have resulted in approximately two times the number of health advisories as somatic coliphage and four times that of male specific coliphage there were eight samples total that were flagged by the proposed coliphage thresholds without enterococcus also being in exceedance all but one of these samples occurred at imperial beach the samples that were flagged by coliphage and not enterococcus at imperial beach occurred during dry weather in the late summer early fall during south swell conditions average wave direction in the 48 h preceding sampling was between 118 and 225 deg these same south swell conditions have previously been linked to the transport of minimally treated sewage emanating from a wastewater treatment plant in tijuana mexico feddersen et al 2021 zimmer faust et al 2021 the decoupling observed between coliphage and enterococcus measurements at this site may be a result of differences in persistence patterns and illustrate the potential for the proposed somatic coliphage threshold to capture water quality impacts that are not always detectable by culturable enterococcus the proposed threshold for male specific coliphage was less sensitive as there were no additional health warnings triggered which is consistent with the findings of li et al 2021 however the coliphage thresholds used both in this study and that of li et al 2021 were based on boehm et al 2019 human health modeling as an epa threshold has yet to be established depending on how thresholds are generated and if differences in the environmental persistence and relative aging of coliphage relative to other pathogens are considered thresholds may be lowered boehm et al 2019 the lack of threshold exceedances and the high rate of non detects for male specific coliphage might suggest that somatic is the more useful of the two phage indicators these findings regarding sensitivity are consistent with other studies that have evaluated somatic and male specific coliphage levels in europe contreras coli et al 2002 spain ibarluzea et al 2007 the great lakes mi usa wanjugi et al 2018 and southern california usa jiang and chu 2004 love et al 2014 mcminn et al 2017b aggregated fib and coliphage levels across different marine beaches finding average enterococcus levels to be roughly twice that of somatic coliphage and 10 times that of male specific coliphage there are however other considerations beyond sensitivity when weighing the relative efficacy of the two coliphage indicators one of which is ease of implementation male specific coliphage may require more experienced laboratory staff for plaque identification due to their smaller plaque size usepa 2016 another consideration is relationship to pathogen levels and health risk previous studies have found a slightly better link between male specific coliphage presence and waterborne illness rates however additional studies comparing somatic versus male specific coliphage to viral pathogen presence and associated health risk are needed griffith et al 2016 and benjamin chung et al 2017 both found slightly better relationships to multiple health outcomes for male specific coliphage in southern california korajkic et al 2018 found that male specific coliphage out performed somatic coliphage in its ability to predict pathogen presence although a significant relationship was not observed however neither somatic nor male specific coliphage have been found to consistently covary with presence of human enteric pathogens when samples were collected at different locations within a single southern california bay human enteric viruses had a different seasonal pattern than both fib and male specific coliphage jiang et al 2007 love et al 2014 found conflicting trends for two southern california beach sites sampled the presence of adenovirus correlated with the presence of male specific coliphage and fib at a site in avalon ca usa likely impacted by leaky sewage infrastructure but did not at doheny beach ca usa there are several possible ways to incorporate coliphage into routine beach monitoring a as a fib replacement b as an additional threshold in which health warnings could be issued if either indicator exceed a threshold or c as a modifier to the existing fib based thresholds we suggest that there are several advantages to continuing fib as part of routine beach water quality monitoring efforts pcr based approaches have been approved by the usepa allowing for same day results for both enterococci and e coli usepa 2012 in addition the higher volumes 2l required for the new d hfuf sal epa coliphage method may be challenging at some locations and the number of laboratory staff and time needed for this method can be an obstacle for smaller or short staffed monitoring agencies the thresholds developed for fib are also based on epidemiological studies that have been conducted under varying conditions and at multiple geographies wade et al 2022 providing confidence in these thresholds for public health protection lastly fib have been used historically thus long term data sets exist that allow for the evaluation of specific management actions on water quality as well as predictive model development and water quality forecasting gonzalez et al 2012 stidson et al 2012 thoe et al 2015 2014 the few additional samples identified as of health concern by coliphage alone suggests that coliphage should be used to help interpret fib response rather than as an independent indicator with the large number of beaches experiencing high fib counts potentially due to environmental and non human sources managers are increasingly looking for ways to prioritize beaches with the greatest health risk one approach gaining favor is use of the hf183 human associated genetic marker to prioritize beaches that most likely have a human fecal contamination signature cao et al 2018 coliphage presents another alternative to implement such a strategy as we observed more than half of the of the enterococcus threshold exceedances occurred without a corresponding exceedance of either male specific or somatic coliphage in contrast almost 20 of the enterococcus exceedances occurred simultaneously with exceedances of both coliphage measures which suggests that these may be beaches which managers should put the most effort into mitigating 5 conclusions the relationships observed between indicators were site dependent with four of the 11 beach sites lacking a significant relationship between enterococcus and coliphage likely a result of differences in source and environmental transport and persistence when coliphage concentrations were compared to newly proposed thresholds beach water quality monitoring with either somatic or male specific coliphage led to fewer public health warnings compared to enterococcus coliphage exceedances in the absence of an enterococcus exceedance were limited a single site during conditions when this beach is suspected to be affected by nearby minimally treated sewage coliphage may provide additional valuable health protection information at certain sites declaration of competing interest the authors
