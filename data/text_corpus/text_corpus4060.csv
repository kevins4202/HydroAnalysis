rahman 2017 erikstad et al 2020 due to continued research notable enhancement in operating efficiency has been reached which makes it economically competitive compared to other renewable energy sources zhong et al 2020 tamm and tamm 2020 hydrokinetic rotors are broadly classified based on the rotation axis into two major categories horizontal axis hydrokinetic rotors hahrs and vertical axis hydrokinetic rotors vahrs mosbahi et al 2020a vahrs are more preferred in small scale hydropower generations due to their ability to respond to water flow from any direction and low costs of maintenance baratchi et al 2020 conventional savonius hydrokinetic rotor cshr which is characterized by straight blades is the most widely used vahr the cshr was invented in 1922 by the engineer sigurd johannes savonius mosbahi et al 2020b the basic version of the cshr has s shaped cross section formed by two semi circular vanes with a small overlap between them cshr has several advantages i e simple structure ability to accept fluid from any direction and high starting torque at low water velocity lajnef et al 2020 however cshr faces low efficiency and operates at low tip speed ratio tsr which causes a difficult integration with generator kumar et al 2020 using twisted blades can be a viable technique to better the efficiency of the savonius turbine in terms of achieving a higher static torque and power coefficient compared to the cshr in recent years various experimental and numerical investigations were carried out to enhance the efficiency of the twisted savonius rotor the main geometrical parameters that affect the performance of the twisted savonius rotor are the blade twist angle the overlap ratio and the blade profile kumar and saini 2017 analyzed the effect of the blade twist angle on the performance of a savonius hydrokinetic turbine having two blades and an overlap ratio of 0 different values of twist angle ranging from 0 to 25 were tested at different values of water velocity ranging from 0 5 m s 1 to 2 m s 1 their results showed that the blade twist angle and the reynolds number have a direct effect on the efficiency of the twisted savonius turbine in fact they noted that the optimum value of the blade twist angle was 12 5 which gives a maximum value of power coefficient of 0 39 at a tip speed ratio value of 0 78 and for a water velocity of 2 m s 1 el askary et al 2018 carried out an experimental and a numerical study of a helical modified savonius the considered turbine was characterized by an overlap ratio of 0 15 the authors tested different values of blade twist angle ranging from 0 to 180 they noted that the highest power coefficient increased with twist angle rise up to an optimum twist angle of 45 and then declined except for 135 twist angle the maximum power and torque coefficients recorded 45 twist angle were 0 22 and 0 41 respectively lee et al 2016 investigated experimentally the effect of the blade twist angle on the performance of a two bladed savonius turbine the studied savonius turbine was characterized by an overlap ratio of 0 167 in their work they tested different values of blade twist angle of 0 45 95 and 135 they concluded that the twist angle has an influence on the savonius turbine efficiency the highest power coefficient value was recorded with 45 twist angle however for 95 and 135 twist angles the maximum power coefficient decreased by 25 5 saad et al 2020 conducted numerical study of a twisted savonius turbine with two blades different values of overlap ratio equal to 0 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 3 were tested in addition they investigated different circular end plate size ratios ranging from 0 to 1 2 as a result they confirmed that the overlap and the circular end plate size ratios affected the turbine efficiency indeed they noted that the peak value of the power coefficient was reached with an overlap and circular end plate size ratios equal to 0 and 1 1 respectively kamoji et al 2009 presented an experimental study of a helical savonius turbine with a twist angle of 90 in their work they tested different overlap ratio of 0 0 1 and 0 16 from the obtained results the authors noted that the maximum value of the power coefficient was recorded with an overlap ratio of 0 in addition they confirmed that the twisted savonius turbine presented positive values of static torque coefficient at all the rotor angles damak et al 2013 conducted an experimental study of a twisted savonius turbine with a twist angle of 180 they tested different reynolds numbers and overlap ratios ranging from 79 794 to 147 059 and from 0 to 0 242 respectively as a result they noted that the reynolds number and the overlap ratio have an effect on the twisted savonius turbine efficiency they found that the optimal overlap ratio was 0 242 kumar et al 2017 presented a numerical study of a single stage modified savonius water turbine having helical blades using cfd they analyzed the effect of the blade arc angle on the turbine efficiency the studied blade arc angles were equal to 110 124 135 and 150 in addition they investigated different values of blade shape factor the ratio between the straight edge of the blade and the radius of the circular arc of the blade of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 as a result the authors noted that the maximum value of the power coefficient was obtained for blade arc angle of 150 and blade shape factor of 0 6 at tip speed ratio of 0 9 in another work damak et al 2018 carried out an experimental study of a helical savonius turbine to analyze the influence of the blade profile on the savonius turbine performance they investigated a helical rotor with semi circular blade profile and a helical bach rotor with specific blade profile which was like a sickle the authors noted that the helical bach rotor had the highest power coefficient and static torque coefficient compared to the helical rotor the power coefficient of the helical bach rotor reached a peak value of 0 2 however the maximum power coefficient value of the helical rotor was equal to 0 18 from the above mentioned literature most studies focuses on the improvement of the efficiency of the twisted savonius turbine by varying the blade twist angle the overlap ratio and the blade profile however the performance improvement technique based on the blade shape modification was not considered for the twisted savonius turbine this technique was adopted for the conventional savonius turbine in fact various blade shape designs were suggested i e the modified savonius turbine consisting of a large number of semicircles with different diameters payambarpour et al 2020 the modified savonius rotor with different convex and concave sides tian et al 2018 and the savonius turbine with multiple quarter blades sharma and sharma 2016 all these proposed designs had shown a significant enhancement on the efficiency of the savonius turbine compared to the conventional rotor accordingly in response to the growing demand for the performance improvement of the twisted savonius turbine the blade shape modification is a topic that could be explored the main objective of this paper is to carry out an experimental study on a twisted savonius turbine in an irrigation channel the second goal is to improve the performance of the considered turbine by suggesting different blade shapes namely u shaped blade v shaped blade and w shaped blade in fact the suggested designs are numerically investigated and the optimal configuration has been chosen numerical simulations have been carried out using ansys fluent 17 0 software 2 experimental set up 2 1 twisted savonius hydrokinetic turbine due to the complex design of the twisted savonius turbine the 3d printing technology is considered for the manufacturing process the rotor was modeled in solidworks fig 1 a then the 3d model file was converted to stl format for the 3d printer after completing the printing process the twisted savonius turbine has been taken out of the 3d printer tray for required tests fig 1b the geometric parameters of the twisted savonius turbine are presented in table 1 to enhance the efficiency of the twisted savonius turbine different blade shapes have been suggested u shaped blade v shaped blade and w shaped blade the suggested designs are shown in fig 2 a these blades have the same portion of blade which is noted p the blade portion p is characterized by a height of hp 0 25 h as shown in fig 2b 2c and 2 d all suggested blade shapes are based on the twisted blade in fact for the u shaped blade design after considering the quarter of the twisted blade an extrusion up to the plane p1 has been done in the z direction up to this stage half of the blade is obtained the whole of the blade is obtained by applying a symmetry with respect to the plane p1 fig 2b for the w shaped blade design after considering also the quarter of the twisted blade a symmetry with respect to the plane p2 has been done up to this stage half of the blade is obtained the whole of the blade is obtained by applying another symmetry with respect to the plane p1 fig 2c however for v shaped blade design after considering the twisted blade half the v shaped blade whole is obtained by applying a symmetry with respect to the plane p1 fig 2d the geometrical parameters of the different configurations of the twisted savonius turbine are presented in table 2 2 2 experimental measurements the mechanical power of the twisted savonius hydrokinetic rotor is calculated by measuring the rotational speed of the rotor and the mechanical torque on the rotor shaft the experimental set up used to do that is presented in fig 3 it contains pulleys weighing pan spring balance nylon string and structure the spring balance pulleys and weighing pan are connected by the nylon string which used to brake the turbine shaft two ball bearings are mounted at top and bottom of the turbine shaft to ensure the rotation of the twisted savonius turbine the mechanical torque is calculated using the following equation 1 t r f r r p r n where f r is expressed as follows 2 f r 9 81 m m where f r the force applied on the turbine shaft r p the radius of the pulley r n the radius of the nylon string m the mass loaded on the weighing pan m the spring balance load reading the power dynamic torque and static torque coefficients could be determined from equations 3 5 respectively 3 c p t r ω 1 2 ρ a v 3 4 c t t r 1 2 ρ a v 2 r 5 c t s t s 1 2 ρ a v 2 r where ω the rotational speed of the twisted

digital tq 8800 model torque meter has been used to evaluate static torque fig 4 in all angular positions from 0 to 360 in step of 10 static torque is measured in fact the turbine is blocked and the static torque is measured in each angular position determined using a gradual disc the experimental studies are conducted in an irrigation canal with 0 6 m width and 0 5 m water height which is situated in the governorate of gabes tunisia the water current of the considered canal is characterized by a constant velocity of v 0 86 m s 1 table 3 shows the uncertainty values for the different performance parameters in fact the various uncertainty values are determined based on earlier studies kline and mcclintock 1953 young 1962 3 numerical model 3 1 mathematical formulation numerical

14 δ t δ θ π 180 ω where δ θ is the angular step the selected time step size is employed with 50 iterations time step 3 2 computation domain and boundary conditions fig 5 depicts the computation domain which is designed in ansys design modeler and the boundary conditions considered in this work two subzones stationary and rotational subzones separated by a sliding interface are created the stationary subzone which represents the irrigation canal is characterized by 3 m length 0 6 m width and 0 5 m height the rotational subzone contains the twisted savonius turbine which rotates around z axis the water current is parallel to the positive x axis and the center of rotation of the turbine coincides with the origin of the coordinate system to put the same circumstances as the experimental test rig the inlet boundary condition is allotted as a uniform velocity of 0 86 m s 1 the outlet is assigned to be atmospheric pressure on the side and bottom walls of the stationary subzone a slip boundary condition is applied however a symmetry boundary condition is applied to its top to the blades of the twisted savonius turbine a no slip moving wall condition is imposed turbulence intensity and viscosity are respectively considered equal to 5 and 10 for both inlet and outlet 3 3 meshing in this work the sliding mesh method is considered to allow the rotation of the twisted savonius turbine indeed an unstructured mesh with tetrahedral elements is selected to generate mesh for the overall computational domain as depicted in fig 6 a fine mesh is generated in the rotating region as compared to the stationary subzone in order to capture the boundary layer gradient a prismatic mesh layer was applied for the blades of the twisted savonius turbine the dimensionless distance of the first layer from the wall y is chosen less than 1 a high value of y reduces the accuracy of the numerical simulation as the boundary layer flow will not be resolved by ansys prescribed wall functions a grid independency examination is performed in this work to ensure that numerical findings are independent of further gird refinement 4 experimental results and validation the twisted savonius rotor is tested in dynamic and static conditions at water velocity of v 0 86 m s 1 from the experimental studies the curves of c t c p and c ts are determined according to data described in section 2 2 fig 7 a illustrates the variation of the c t with respect to λ in a range varying from 0 4 to 1 1 the results show that the c t rises with the decrease of λ at first the twisted turbine rotates freely without the application of a load on its shaft at this condition the maximum rotational speed of the twisted turbine which corresponds to the maximum tsr and a dynamic torque equal to zero can be determined the twisted rotor reaches a maximum rotational speed of 95 93 rpm the application of gradual loads on the turbine shaft decreases the rotational speed of the turbine on the one hand and increases the value of the dynamic torque on the other hand the highest value of c t which is equal to 0 265 is obtained at tsr of 0 475 from fig 7 b it is observed that c p increments with the increase of λ until attaining its maximum value beyond which it diminishes with the increment of λ in fact the twisted rotor is described as a solid body in the irrigation canal without the application of a load therefore no power could be extracted by the twisted rotor however after the application of gradual loads on the turbine shaft the twisted savonius turbine could extract a partial power and λ starts to diminish until reaching the maximum power output the peak value of c p is equal to 0 166 at λ 0 78 fig 8 presents the variation of the c ts versus azimuthal angle as it is clear the variation of c ts is periodic having a 180 cycle the c ts increments gradually until reaching its peak the highest c ts takes the value of 0 42 for an azimuthal angle of 50 for the rest of the cycle the c ts decreases to attain its minimum at an azimuthal angle of 120 regarding these observations the maximum value of c ts is derived from a maximum quantity of water that attacks the concave side of the blade at the corresponding angular position however its minimum value is inferred from the force of the water which did not properly move to the concave side of the blade at the corresponding azimuthal angle moreover it has been observed that the c ts values are positive at all azimuthal angles therefore it could be confirmed that the twisted rotor has a self starting ability for the considered water velocity to analyze the blade shape effect on the performance of a twisted savonius rotor and the flow characteristics around the rotor a 3d transient analysis has been carried out using ansys fluent a grid sensitivity study is performed in fact the grid independency examination is an important step to minimize computational cost and time by averting the use of the finest mesh under the present study four girds namely coarse medium fine and extra fine are considered table 4 presents the characteristics of the different refinement levels the dynamic torque coefficient of the twisted savonius turbine parameter is chosen to be observed for the grid independency test fig 9 shows the effect of the grid size on the dynamic torque coefficient from this figure it has been confirmed that the fine and extra fine grids which give a dynamic torque coefficient values equal to 0 204 and 0 208 respectively are in good accordance with the experimental value 0 212 however the coarse and medium grids which give a dynamic torque coefficient values equal to 0 163 and 0 184 respectively present the maximum errors comparing with experimental torque coefficient value thus considering the time economy of the numerical investigations the fine grid is considered a comparison between numerical and experimental results is performed so that the reliability of the cfd model is verified fig 10 presents both numerical and experimental power coefficients of the twisted savonius rotor for a tip speed ratio ranging from 0 4 to 1 1 the average error is about 4 therefore the numerical findings verify successfully the experimental one as a result the cfd model is suitable to predict the effect of the proposed blade shapes on the performance of the twisted savonius rotor 5 numerical results 5 1 velocity contour the velocity contour for the different blade shapes are presented in fig 11 upstream the rotors the velocity is governed by the value v 0 86 m s 1 as set at the inlet boundary condition approaching to the rotating domain it is obvious that the velocity remains weak with a stagnation point located on the convex side of the returning blade it is observed for all configurations but it looks less intense for the v shaped savonius water turbine as the helical water turbine rotates vortices are formed on the concave side of both advancing and returning blades the vortices formation is more significant for the v shaped savonius water turbine here the flow passage is more important which reduces the negative drag and improves the rotation of the turbine anti clockwise subsequently the power coefficient a high velocity zone appears at the attack point of the advancing blade due to the lift force fig 11a the maximum value of the velocity there reaches v 1 93 m s 1 v 1 91 m s 1 v 1 85 m s 1 and v 1 9 m s 1 for the v shaped the u shaped the w shaped and the twisted savonius water turbine the lift force is enhanced with the novel blade shapes and takes the highest value with the v shaped rotor downstream the rotors a remarkable weak velocity zone is depicted across from the concave side of the returning blade fig 11a this deviation is related to the centrifugal force created with the rotation of the turbines anti clockwise and remains an index of the wake phenomenon the shape of the weak velocity zone is clearly shown otherwise in fig 11 b it has a symmetrical aspect for the novel blade shapes in fact the symmetrical design of the different rotor shapes affects the distribution of the velocity downstream and so the wake phenomenon to understand more the flow velocity around the different blade shapes fig 12 depicts the velocity profile in four directions for the same axial position z 0 m and along a y direction limited by the values y 0 26 m and y 0 26 m different point are generated in the transverse plane defined by x 0 2 m x 0 2 m x 0 4 m and x 0 8 m it is confirmed that the velocity upstream is governed by the inlet value fig 12a and while getting closer to the rotors a deceleration is observed in fig 12b c and d the velocity increases more and more while moving away from the rotor it confirms the wake phenomenon obtained downstream and mentioned above comparing the different shapes the v shaped savonius water rotor provides improved magnitude velocity distribution over the other blades and so higher predicted torque 5 2 static pressure the distribution of the static pressure for the different blade shapes is shown in fig 13 upstream the rotor the static pressure is uniform and indicates high zone however getting away from the rotor the static pressure decreases and shows low pressure zone downstream an important depression zone is mainly noted behind the advancing blade and on the concave side of the returning blade for all the studied blade shapes the distribution of the static pressure on both rotor blades is different for all configurations the static pressure on the convex side of the returning blade is much more significant than that on the concave side of the advancing blade the difference in pressure is responsible of the turbine rotation the highest value of the static pressure on the convex side of the returning blade p 710 pa is recorded with the v shaped savonius rotor subsequently a higher pressure difference is obtained thus higher predicted produced torque due to the positive drag improvement to understand more the distribution of the static pressure the instantaneous pressure coefficient cpr on the entire rotor blades is shown in fig 14 it is obvious that the pressure coefficient has two distinguished values ranges the first one which is located at the top of the figure with more important values corresponds to the upstream of the rotor the second one which is located at the bottom of the figure presents the downstream of the rotor the compression and depression zones are so confirmed it is clear also for all configurations that the pressure coefficient on the concave side of the advancing blade b1 is more important than on the convex side of the returning blade b2 which confirms the pressure difference between the two blades responsible of the turbine rotation anticlockwise following the variation of the rotor angular position the pressure coefficient increases with the increase of θ in the range of 0 60 it decreases slightly for θ 60 and from θ 90 to the rest it decreases progressively in fact the pressure repartition on the rotor blades surfaces varies from one position to another it takes the maximum values for θ 30 which correspond to a more projected area in front of the incoming water flow the comparison between these results confirms that the proposed blades shapes have a direct effect on the instantaneous pressure coefficient around the rotor the highest value of the pressure coefficient is recorded with the v shaped blade 5 3 dynamic pressure fig 15 shows the distribution of the dynamic pressure for the proposed blade shapes it is obvious that the dynamic pressure is weak upstream the rotor due to velocity decrease a depression zone is located around the rotor mainly on the concave side of both advancing and returning blades a slight increase is noted behind the advancing blade with a high pressure zone located at its attack point it is related to the lift force created there with the turbine rotation the highest value of the dynamic pressure there is obtained for the v shaped savonius water turbine p 1345 pa over all the rotor blades behind the rotor and for all configurations the dynamic pressure highlights a weak values moving away from the rotors the dynamic pressure evinces weak zone that indicates the wake phenomenon from fig 15 b one notes that the blade shape affects the aspect of the wake zone which is more important with the novel blade shapes and especially with the v shaped rotor 5 4 turbulent kinetic energy the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy for the suggested blade shapes is shown in fig 16 upstream the rotor the turbulent kinetic energy is almost negligible it increases slightly around the rotor and presents a high zone behind the attack point of the advancing blade for all the studied blade shapes fig 16a the highest value of the turbulent kinetic energy is observed with the v shaped savonius water turbine k 0 18 over the other blades downstream the rotors a remarkable increase zone is observed for all configurations which confirms the wake phenomenon mentioned previously from fig 16 b it is clear that the blade shape affects the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy behind the rotors with the novel blade shapes except the w shaped the turbulent kinetic energy downstream is improved the highest value is obtained for the v shaped rotor k 0 08 subsequently the wake phenomenon is more improved with the v shaped 5 5 turbulence eddy dissipation fig 17 evinces the distribution of the turbulent dissipation rate for the different twisted savonius rotors the turbulence dissipation rate is practically negligible in the entire computational domain but it remains slightly remarkable at the rotor surfaces a high dissipation zone is highlighted at the attack point of the advancing blade in fact the advancing blade for all configurations evinces higher turbulent kinetic energy zone subsequently a higher dissipation rate the turbulent dissipation rate increases with the novel blade shapes except the w shaped rotor which gives lower values the highest value of the turbulence dissipation rate is obtained with the v shaped twisted savonius water rotor ε 64 53 w kg 1 the comparison between the different contours confirms that the proposed blade shapes have a direct effect on the distribution of the turbulence eddy dissipation around the twisted savonius rotor 5 6 eddy viscosity fig 18 presents the distribution of the turbulent viscosity for the different twisted savonius rotors it is obvious that the turbulent viscosity is very low upstream the rotors and becomes slightly observable at the rotating domain however downstream a rise of the turbulent viscosity is noted which is responsible of the weak velocity zone this fact is defined as the wake phenomenon examining the different configurations it is obvious that the blade shape affects the turbulent viscosity of the flow around the twisted rotors the wake zone aspect shown in fig 18 b has a symmetrical shape which is clearer with the v shaped rotor than the other blade shapes the highest values of the turbulent viscosity are recorded for the v shaped twisted savonius water rotor as a result the development of vortices is enhanced with the novel blade shapes and especially with the v shaped rotor 5 7 turbulent intensity fig 19 shows the distribution of the turbulent intensity for the studied blade shapes it is remarked that the turbulent intensity is very weak at the entry of the computational domain for all configurations it increases slightly around the rotating domain mainly in front of the concave side of both advancing and returning blade those turbulent intensity zones are more widen with the v shaped rotor in fact more vortices are formed there thus the flow passage is enhanced and so the rotation anti clockwise a high turbulent intensity zone is located at the attack point of the advancing blade for all configurations it takes the value of i 0 38 i 0 39 i 0 4 and i 0 35 respectively for the twisted the u shaped the v shaped and the w shaped savonius rotors the v shaped rotor highlights the highest value there which confirms the highest value of velocity at the attack point over the other rotor blade shapes downstream the rotor the turbulent intensity is spread over a larger area deviated upwards due to the lift force created with the turbine rotation fig 19 b shows clearly the shape of this zone which takes a symmetrical aspect with the novel blade shapes due to the turbine design itself the water flow is namely turbulent due to the vortices formation which explain the deficit of velocity and so the wake phenomenon 5 8 performance characteristics fig 20 presents the variation of the cp for the tested blade shapes from this figure it is clear that the cp rises with the increase of λ until reaching its peak for the different blade shapes the tip speed ratio corresponds to the maximum cp is known as the optimal value to which the twisted rotor should operate to produce the maximum power focusing on the optimum λ for the tested twisted rotors it could be confirmed that the proposed blade shapes affect the optimum λ in fact the optimum λ is equal to 0 78 0 8 0 83 and 0 86 for the twisted blade the w shaped blade the u shaped blade and the v shaped blade respectively regarding the peak values of cp it could be noted that the suggested blade shapes have an influence on the maximum power output the peak value reaches cp 0 166 cp 0 171 cp 0 177 and cp 0 184 for the twisted blade the w shaped blade the u shaped blade and the v shaped blade respectively moreover a noticeable diminishment of the cp has been observed with the rise of λ for the different twisted rotors this fact could be expounded by larger mechanical losses owing to the elevated rotational speed according to these findings it could be confirmed that the v shaped blades configuration presents the highest power output compared to the other rotors the variation of cts with respect to the azimuthal angles for the different blade shapes is depicted in fig 21 from these findings it is clear that the proposed blade shapes affect the self starting ability of the twisted rotor the average values of cts are equal to cts 0 248 cts 0 173 cts 0 235 and cts 0 201 for the twisted blade characterized by ψ 90 the u shaped blade characterized by ψ 22 5 the v shaped blade characterized by ψ 45 and the w shaped blade characterized by ψ 22 5 respectively in addition it is confirmed that the self starting capability of the savonius rotor is improved with the rise of the twist angle indeed by increasing the twist angle some portion of the vane profile will be located at an optimal position consequently the possibility for self rotating is maximized 6 conclusion in this paper experimental studies were carried out to evaluate the efficiency of a twisted savonius rotor in an irrigation canal with a flow velocity of 0 86 m s 1 in addition different blade shapes were proposed to examine its effect on the performance of the twisted savonius rotor in fact savonius rotors with u shaped blades v shaped blades and w shaped blades were numerically tested computational investigations were conducted by means of the cfd code ansys fluent the main conclusions of this work are sum up as follows from the experimental findings it has been noted that the maximum value of the rotational speed of the twisted savonius rotor reached 95 93 rpm the cp of the twisted savonius rotor attained a peak value of 0 166 at λ 0 78 the average values of the static torque coefficient of the twisted savonius rotor reached 0 248 from the numerical results it has been noticed that the power coefficient of the twisted savonius rotor could be enhanced using v shaped blades the power coefficient of the v shaped blades rotor reached a value of 0 184 the blade shape design of the twisted savonius rotor affect the flow characteristics around the rotor as a perspective work we are going to investigate the effect of the twist angle on the performance of the savonius rotor

hydrokinetic rotors vahrs mosbahi et al 2020a vahrs are more preferred in small scale hydropower generations due to their ability to respond to water flow from any direction and low costs of maintenance baratchi et al 2020 conventional savonius hydrokinetic rotor cshr which is characterized by straight blades is the most widely used vahr the cshr was invented in 1922 by the engineer sigurd johannes savonius mosbahi et al 2020b the basic version of the cshr has s shaped cross section formed by two semi circular vanes with a small overlap between them cshr has several advantages i e simple structure ability to accept fluid from any direction and high starting torque at low water velocity lajnef et al 2020 however cshr faces low efficiency and operates at low tip speed ratio tsr which causes a difficult integration with generator kumar et al 2020 using twisted blades can be a viable technique to better the efficiency of the savonius turbine in terms of achieving a higher static torque and power coefficient compared to the cshr in recent years various experimental and numerical investigations were carried out to enhance the efficiency of the twisted savonius rotor the main geometrical parameters that affect the performance of the twisted savonius rotor are the blade twist angle the overlap ratio and the blade profile kumar and saini 2017 analyzed the effect of the blade twist angle on the performance of a savonius hydrokinetic turbine having two blades and an overlap ratio of 0 different values of twist angle ranging from 0 to 25 were tested at different values of water velocity ranging from 0 5 m s 1 to 2 m s 1 their results showed that the blade twist angle and the reynolds number have a direct effect on the efficiency of the twisted savonius turbine in fact they noted that the optimum value of the blade twist angle was 12 5 which gives a maximum value of power coefficient of 0 39 at a tip speed ratio value of 0 78 and for a water velocity of 2 m s 1 el askary et al 2018 carried out an experimental and a numerical study of a helical modified savonius the considered turbine was characterized by an overlap ratio of 0 15 the authors tested different values of blade twist angle ranging from 0 to 180 they noted that the highest power coefficient increased with twist angle rise up to an optimum twist angle of 45 and then declined except for 135 twist angle the maximum power and torque coefficients recorded 45 twist angle were 0 22 and 0 41 respectively lee et al 2016 investigated experimentally the effect of the blade twist angle on the performance of a two bladed savonius turbine the studied savonius turbine was characterized by an overlap ratio of 0 167 in their work they tested different values of blade twist angle of 0 45 95 and 135 they concluded that the twist angle has an influence on the savonius turbine efficiency the highest power coefficient value was recorded with 45 twist angle however for 95 and 135 twist angles the maximum power coefficient decreased by 25 5 saad et al 2020 conducted numerical study of a twisted savonius turbine with two blades different values of overlap ratio equal to 0 0 1 0 15 0 2 and 0 3 were tested in addition they investigated different circular end plate size ratios ranging from 0 to 1 2 as a result they confirmed that the overlap and the circular end plate size ratios affected the turbine efficiency indeed they noted that the peak value of the power coefficient was reached with an overlap and circular end plate size ratios equal to 0 and 1 1 respectively kamoji et al 2009 presented an experimental study of a helical savonius turbine with a twist angle of 90 in their work they tested different overlap ratio of 0 0 1 and 0 16 from the obtained results the authors noted that the maximum value of the power coefficient was recorded with an overlap ratio of 0 in addition they confirmed that the twisted savonius turbine presented positive values of static torque coefficient at all the rotor angles damak et al 2013 conducted an experimental study of a twisted savonius turbine with a twist angle of 180 they tested different reynolds numbers and overlap ratios ranging from 79 794 to 147 059 and from 0 to 0 242 respectively as a result they noted that the reynolds number and the overlap ratio have an effect on the twisted savonius turbine efficiency they found that the optimal overlap ratio was 0 242 kumar et al 2017 presented a numerical study of a single stage modified savonius water turbine having helical blades using cfd they analyzed the effect of the blade arc angle on the turbine efficiency the studied blade arc angles were equal to 110 124 135 and 150 in addition they investigated different values of blade shape factor the ratio between the straight edge of the blade and the radius of the circular arc of the blade of 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 as a result the authors noted that the maximum value of the power coefficient was obtained for blade arc angle of 150 and blade shape factor of 0 6 at tip speed ratio of 0 9 in another work damak et al 2018 carried out an experimental study of a helical savonius turbine to analyze the influence of the blade profile on the savonius turbine performance they investigated a helical rotor with semi circular blade profile and a helical bach rotor with specific blade profile which was like a sickle the authors noted that the helical bach rotor had the highest power coefficient and static torque coefficient compared to the helical rotor the power coefficient of the helical bach rotor reached a peak value of 0 2 however the maximum power coefficient value of the helical rotor was equal to 0 18 from the above mentioned literature most studies focuses on the improvement of the efficiency of the twisted savonius turbine by varying the blade twist angle the overlap ratio and the blade profile however the performance improvement technique based on the blade shape modification was not considered for the twisted savonius turbine this technique was adopted for the conventional savonius turbine in fact various blade shape designs were suggested i e the modified savonius turbine consisting of a large number of semicircles with different diameters payambarpour et al 2020 the modified savonius rotor with different convex and concave sides tian et al 2018 and the savonius turbine with multiple quarter blades sharma and sharma 2016 all these proposed designs had shown a significant enhancement on the efficiency of the savonius turbine compared to the conventional rotor accordingly in response to the growing demand for the performance improvement of the twisted savonius turbine the blade shape modification is a topic that could be explored the main objective of this paper is to carry out an experimental study on a twisted savonius turbine in an irrigation channel the second goal is to improve the performance of the considered turbine by suggesting different blade shapes namely u shaped blade v shaped blade and w shaped blade in fact the suggested designs are numerically investigated and the optimal configuration has been chosen numerical simulations have been carried out using ansys fluent 17 0 software 2 experimental set up 2 1 twisted savonius hydrokinetic turbine due to the complex design of the twisted savonius turbine the 3d printing technology is considered for the manufacturing process the rotor was modeled in solidworks fig 1 a then the 3d model file was converted to stl format for the 3d printer after completing the printing process the twisted savonius turbine has been taken out of the 3d printer tray for required tests fig 1b the geometric parameters of the twisted savonius turbine are presented in table 1 to enhance the efficiency of the twisted savonius turbine different blade shapes have been suggested u shaped blade v shaped blade and w shaped blade the suggested designs are shown in fig 2 a these blades have the same portion of blade which is noted p the blade portion p is characterized by a height of hp 0 25 h as shown in fig 2b 2c and 2 d all suggested blade shapes are based on the twisted blade in fact for the u shaped blade design after considering the quarter of the twisted blade an extrusion up to the plane p1 has been done in the z direction up to this stage half of the blade is obtained the whole of the blade is obtained by applying a symmetry with respect to the plane p1 fig 2b for the w shaped blade design after considering also the quarter of the twisted blade a symmetry with respect to the plane p2 has been done up to this stage half of the blade is obtained the whole of the blade is obtained by applying another symmetry with respect to the plane p1 fig 2c however for v shaped blade design after considering the twisted blade half the v shaped blade whole is obtained by applying a symmetry with respect to the plane p1 fig 2d the geometrical parameters of the different configurations of the twisted savonius turbine are presented in table 2 2 2 experimental measurements the mechanical power of the twisted savonius hydrokinetic rotor is calculated by measuring the rotational speed of the rotor and the mechanical torque on the rotor shaft the experimental set up used to do that is presented in fig 3 it contains pulleys weighing pan spring balance nylon string and structure the spring balance pulleys and weighing pan are connected by the nylon string which used to brake the turbine shaft two ball bearings are mounted at top and bottom of the turbine shaft to ensure the rotation of the twisted savonius turbine the mechanical torque is calculated using the following equation 1 t r f r r p r n where f r is expressed as follows 2 f r 9 81 m m where f r the force applied on the turbine shaft r p the radius of the pulley r n the radius of the nylon string m the mass loaded on the weighing pan m the spring balance load reading the power dynamic torque and

digital tq 8800 model torque meter has been used to evaluate static torque fig 4 in all angular positions from 0 to 360 in step of 10 static torque is measured in fact the turbine is blocked and the static torque is measured in each angular position determined using a gradual disc the experimental studies are conducted in an irrigation canal with 0 6 m width and 0 5 m water height which is situated in the governorate of gabes tunisia the water current of the considered canal is characterized by a constant velocity of v 0 86 m s 1 table 3 shows the uncertainty values for the different performance parameters in fact the various uncertainty values are determined based on earlier studies kline and mcclintock 1953 young 1962 3 numerical model 3 1 mathematical formulation numerical

14 δ t δ θ π 180 ω where δ θ is the angular step the selected time step size is employed with 50 iterations time step 3 2 computation domain and boundary conditions fig 5 depicts the computation domain which is designed in ansys design modeler and the boundary conditions considered in this work two subzones stationary and rotational subzones separated by a sliding interface are created the stationary subzone which represents the irrigation canal is characterized by 3 m length 0 6 m width and 0 5 m height the rotational subzone contains the twisted savonius turbine which rotates around z axis the water current is parallel to the positive x axis and the center of rotation of the turbine coincides with the origin of the coordinate system to put the same circumstances as the experimental test rig the inlet boundary condition is allotted as a uniform velocity of 0 86 m s 1 the outlet is assigned to be atmospheric pressure on the side and bottom walls of the stationary subzone a slip boundary condition is applied however a symmetry boundary condition is applied to its top to the blades of the twisted savonius turbine a no slip moving wall condition is imposed turbulence intensity and viscosity are respectively considered equal to 5 and 10 for both inlet and outlet 3 3 meshing in this work the sliding mesh method is considered to allow the rotation of the twisted savonius turbine indeed an unstructured mesh with tetrahedral elements is selected to generate mesh for the overall computational domain as depicted in fig 6 a fine mesh is generated in the rotating region as compared to the stationary subzone in order to capture the boundary layer gradient a prismatic mesh layer was applied for the blades of the twisted savonius turbine the dimensionless distance of the first layer from the wall y is chosen less than 1 a high value of y reduces the accuracy of the numerical simulation as the boundary layer flow will not be resolved by ansys prescribed wall functions a grid independency examination is performed in this work to ensure that numerical findings are independent of further gird refinement 4 experimental results and validation the twisted savonius rotor is tested in dynamic and static conditions at water velocity of v 0 86 m s 1 from the experimental studies the curves of c t c p and c ts are determined according to data described in section 2 2 fig 7 a illustrates the variation of the c t with respect to λ in a range varying from 0 4 to 1 1 the results show that the c t rises with the decrease of λ at first the twisted turbine rotates freely without the application of a load on its shaft at this condition the maximum rotational speed of the twisted turbine which corresponds to the maximum tsr and a dynamic torque equal to zero can be determined the twisted rotor reaches a maximum rotational speed of 95 93 rpm the application of gradual loads on the turbine shaft decreases the rotational speed of the turbine on the one hand and increases the value of the dynamic torque on the other hand the highest value of c t which is equal to 0 265 is obtained at tsr of 0 475 from fig 7 b it is observed that c p increments with the increase of λ until attaining its maximum value beyond which it diminishes with the increment of λ in fact the twisted rotor is described as a solid body in the irrigation canal without the application of a load therefore no power could be extracted by the twisted rotor however after the application of gradual loads on the turbine shaft the twisted savonius turbine could extract a partial power and λ starts to diminish until reaching the maximum power output the peak value of c p is equal to 0 166 at λ 0 78 fig 8 presents the variation of the c ts versus azimuthal angle as it is clear the variation of c ts is periodic having a 180 cycle the c ts increments gradually until reaching its peak the highest c ts takes the value of 0 42 for an azimuthal angle of 50 for the rest of the cycle the c ts decreases to attain its minimum at an azimuthal angle of 120 regarding these observations the maximum value of c ts is derived from a maximum quantity of water that attacks the concave side of the blade at the corresponding angular position however its minimum value is inferred from the force of the water which did not properly move to the concave side of the blade at the corresponding azimuthal angle moreover it has been observed that the c ts values are positive at all azimuthal angles therefore it could be confirmed that the twisted rotor has a self starting ability for the considered water velocity to analyze the blade shape effect on the performance of a twisted savonius rotor and the flow characteristics around the rotor a 3d transient analysis has been carried out using ansys fluent a grid sensitivity study is performed in fact the grid independency examination is an important step to minimize computational cost and time by averting the use of the finest mesh under the present study four girds namely coarse medium fine and extra fine are considered table 4 presents the characteristics of the different refinement levels the dynamic torque coefficient of the twisted savonius turbine parameter is chosen to be observed for the grid independency test fig 9 shows the effect of the grid size on the dynamic torque coefficient from this figure it has been confirmed that the fine and extra fine grids which give a dynamic torque coefficient values equal to 0 204 and 0 208 respectively are in good accordance with the experimental value 0 212 however the coarse and medium grids which give a dynamic torque coefficient values equal to 0 163 and 0 184 respectively present the maximum errors comparing with experimental torque coefficient value thus considering the time economy of the numerical investigations the fine grid is considered a comparison between numerical and experimental results is performed so that the reliability of the cfd model is verified fig 10 presents both numerical and experimental power coefficients of the twisted savonius rotor for a tip speed ratio ranging from 0 4 to 1 1 the average error is about 4 therefore the numerical findings verify successfully the experimental one as a result the cfd model is suitable to predict the effect of the proposed blade shapes on the performance of the twisted savonius rotor 5 numerical results 5 1 velocity contour the velocity contour for the different blade shapes are presented in fig 11 upstream the rotors the velocity is governed by the value v 0 86 m s 1 as set at the inlet boundary condition approaching to the rotating domain it is obvious that the velocity remains weak with a stagnation point located on the convex side of the returning blade it is observed for all configurations but it looks less intense for the v shaped savonius water turbine as the helical water turbine rotates vortices are formed on the concave side of both advancing and returning blades the vortices formation is more significant for the v shaped savonius water turbine here the flow passage is more important which reduces the negative drag and improves the rotation of the turbine anti clockwise subsequently the power coefficient a high velocity zone appears at the attack point of the advancing blade due to the lift force fig 11a the maximum value of the velocity there reaches v 1 93 m s 1 v 1 91 m s 1 v 1 85 m s 1 and v 1 9 m s 1 for the v shaped the u shaped the w shaped and the twisted savonius water turbine the lift force is enhanced with the novel blade shapes and takes the highest value with the v shaped rotor downstream the rotors a remarkable weak velocity zone is depicted across from the concave side of the returning blade fig 11a this deviation is related to the centrifugal force created with the rotation of the turbines anti clockwise and remains an index of the wake phenomenon the shape of the weak velocity zone is clearly shown otherwise in fig 11 b it has a symmetrical aspect for the novel blade shapes in fact the symmetrical design of the different rotor shapes affects the distribution of the velocity downstream and so the wake phenomenon to understand more the flow velocity around the different blade shapes fig 12 depicts the velocity profile in four directions for the same axial position z 0 m and along a y direction limited by the values y 0 26 m and y 0 26 m different point are generated in the transverse plane defined by x 0 2 m x 0 2 m x 0 4 m and x 0 8 m it is confirmed that the velocity upstream is governed by the inlet value fig 12a and while getting closer to the rotors a deceleration is observed in fig 12b c and d the velocity increases more and more while moving away from the rotor it confirms the wake phenomenon obtained downstream and mentioned above comparing the different shapes the v shaped savonius water rotor provides improved magnitude velocity distribution over the other blades and so higher predicted torque 5 2 static pressure the distribution of the static pressure for the different blade shapes is shown in fig 13 upstream the rotor the static pressure is uniform and indicates high zone however getting away from the rotor the static pressure decreases and shows low pressure zone downstream an important depression zone is mainly noted behind the advancing blade and on the concave side of the returning blade for all the studied blade shapes the distribution of the static pressure on both rotor blades is different for all configurations the static pressure on the convex side of the returning blade is much more significant than that on the concave side of the advancing blade the difference in pressure is responsible of the turbine rotation the highest value of the static pressure on the convex side of the returning blade p 710 pa is recorded with the v shaped savonius rotor subsequently a higher pressure difference is obtained thus higher predicted produced torque due to the positive drag improvement to understand more the distribution of the static pressure the instantaneous pressure coefficient cpr on the entire rotor blades is shown in fig 14 it is obvious that the pressure coefficient has two distinguished values ranges the first one which is located at the top of the figure with more important values corresponds to the upstream of the rotor the second one which is located at the bottom of the figure presents the downstream of the rotor the compression and depression zones are so confirmed it is clear also for all configurations that the pressure coefficient on the concave side of the advancing blade b1 is more important than on the convex side of the returning blade b2 which confirms the pressure difference between the two blades responsible of the turbine rotation anticlockwise following the variation of the rotor angular position the pressure coefficient increases with the increase of θ in the range of 0 60 it decreases slightly for θ 60 and from θ 90 to the rest it decreases progressively in fact the pressure repartition on the rotor blades surfaces varies from one position to another it takes the maximum values for θ 30 which correspond to a more projected area in front of the incoming water flow the comparison between these results confirms that the proposed blades shapes have a direct effect on the instantaneous pressure coefficient around the rotor the highest value of the pressure coefficient is recorded with the v shaped blade 5 3 dynamic pressure fig 15 shows the distribution of the dynamic pressure for the proposed blade shapes it is obvious that the dynamic pressure is weak upstream the rotor due to velocity decrease a depression zone is located around the rotor mainly on the concave side of both advancing and returning blades a slight increase is noted behind the advancing blade with a high pressure zone located at its attack point it is related to the lift force created there with the turbine rotation the highest value of the dynamic pressure there is obtained for the v shaped savonius water turbine p 1345 pa over all the rotor blades behind the rotor and for all configurations the dynamic pressure highlights a weak values moving away from the rotors the dynamic pressure evinces weak zone that indicates the wake phenomenon from fig 15 b one notes that the blade shape affects the aspect of the wake zone which is more important with the novel blade shapes and especially with the v shaped rotor 5 4 turbulent kinetic energy the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy for the suggested blade shapes is shown in fig 16 upstream the rotor the turbulent kinetic energy is almost negligible it increases slightly around the rotor and presents a high zone behind the attack point of the advancing blade for all the studied blade shapes fig 16a the highest value of the turbulent kinetic energy is observed with the v shaped savonius water turbine k 0 18 over the other blades downstream the rotors a remarkable increase zone is observed for all configurations which confirms the wake phenomenon mentioned previously from fig 16 b it is clear that the blade shape affects the distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy behind the rotors with the novel blade shapes except the w shaped the turbulent kinetic energy downstream is improved the highest value is obtained for the v shaped rotor k 0 08 subsequently the wake phenomenon is more improved with the v shaped 5 5 turbulence eddy dissipation fig 17 evinces the distribution of the turbulent dissipation rate for the different twisted savonius rotors the turbulence dissipation rate is practically negligible in the entire computational domain but it remains slightly remarkable at the rotor surfaces a high dissipation zone is highlighted at the attack point of the advancing blade in fact the advancing blade for all configurations evinces higher turbulent kinetic energy zone subsequently a higher dissipation rate the turbulent dissipation rate increases with the novel blade shapes except the w shaped rotor which gives lower values the highest value of the turbulence dissipation rate is obtained with the v shaped twisted savonius water rotor ε 64 53 w kg 1 the comparison between the different contours confirms that the proposed blade shapes have a direct effect on the distribution of the turbulence eddy dissipation around the twisted savonius rotor 5 6 eddy viscosity fig 18 presents the distribution of the turbulent viscosity for the different twisted savonius rotors it is obvious that the turbulent viscosity is very low upstream the rotors and becomes slightly observable at the rotating domain however downstream a rise of the turbulent viscosity is noted which is responsible of the weak velocity zone this fact is defined as the wake phenomenon examining the different configurations it is obvious that the blade shape affects the turbulent viscosity of the flow around the twisted rotors the wake zone aspect shown in fig 18 b has a symmetrical shape which is clearer with the v shaped rotor than the other blade shapes the highest values of the turbulent viscosity are recorded for the v shaped twisted savonius water rotor as a result the development of vortices is enhanced with the novel blade shapes and especially with the v shaped rotor 5 7 turbulent intensity fig 19 shows the distribution of the turbulent intensity for the studied blade shapes it is remarked that the turbulent intensity is very weak at the entry of the computational domain for all configurations it increases slightly around the rotating domain mainly in front of the concave side of both advancing and returning blade those turbulent intensity zones are more widen with the v shaped rotor in fact more vortices are formed there thus the flow passage is enhanced and so the rotation anti clockwise a high turbulent intensity zone is located at the attack point of the advancing blade for all configurations it takes the value of i 0 38 i 0 39 i 0 4 and i 0 35 respectively for the twisted the u shaped the v shaped and the w shaped savonius rotors the v shaped rotor highlights the highest value there which confirms the highest value of velocity at the attack point over the other rotor blade shapes downstream the rotor the turbulent intensity is spread over a larger area deviated upwards due to the lift force created with the turbine rotation fig 19 b shows clearly the shape of this zone which takes a symmetrical aspect with the novel blade shapes due to the turbine design itself the water flow is namely turbulent due to the vortices formation which explain the deficit of velocity and so the wake phenomenon 5 8 performance characteristics fig 20 presents the variation of the cp for the tested blade shapes from this figure it is clear that the cp rises with the increase of λ until reaching its peak for the different blade shapes the tip speed ratio corresponds to the maximum cp is known as the optimal value to which the twisted rotor should operate to produce the maximum power focusing on the optimum λ for the tested twisted rotors it could be confirmed that the proposed blade shapes affect the optimum λ in fact the optimum λ is equal to 0 78 0 8 0 83 and 0 86 for the twisted blade the w shaped blade the u shaped blade and the v shaped blade respectively regarding the peak values of cp it could be noted that the suggested blade shapes have an influence on the maximum power output the peak value reaches cp 0 166 cp 0 171 cp 0 177 and cp 0 184 for the twisted blade the w shaped blade the u shaped blade and the v shaped blade respectively moreover a noticeable diminishment of the cp has been observed with the rise of λ for the different twisted rotors this fact could be expounded by larger mechanical losses owing to the elevated rotational speed according to these findings it could be confirmed that the v shaped blades configuration presents the highest power output compared to the other rotors the variation of cts with respect to the azimuthal angles for the different blade shapes is depicted in fig 21 from these findings it is clear that the proposed blade shapes affect the self starting ability of the twisted rotor the average values of cts are equal to cts 0 248 cts 0 173 cts 0 235 and cts 0 201 for the twisted blade characterized by ψ 90 the u shaped blade characterized by ψ 22 5 the v shaped blade characterized by ψ 45 and the w shaped blade characterized by ψ 22 5 respectively in addition it is confirmed that the self starting capability of the savonius rotor is improved with the rise of the twist angle indeed by increasing the twist angle some portion of the vane profile will be located at an optimal position consequently the possibility for self rotating is maximized 6 conclusion in this paper experimental studies were carried out to evaluate the efficiency of a twisted savonius rotor in an irrigation canal with a flow velocity of 0 86 m s 1 in addition different blade shapes were proposed to examine its effect on the performance of the twisted savonius rotor in fact savonius rotors with u shaped blades v shaped blades and w shaped blades were numerically tested computational investigations were conducted by means of the cfd code ansys fluent the main conclusions of this work are sum up as follows from the experimental findings it has been noted that the maximum value of the rotational speed of the twisted savonius rotor reached 95 93 rpm the cp of the twisted savonius rotor attained a peak value of 0 166 at λ 0 78 the average values of the static torque coefficient of the twisted savonius rotor reached 0 248 from the numerical results it has been noticed that the power coefficient of the twisted savonius rotor could be enhanced using v shaped blades the power coefficient of the v shaped blades rotor reached a value of 0 184 the blade shape design of the twisted savonius rotor affect the flow characteristics around the rotor as a perspective work we are going to investigate the effect of the twist angle on the performance of the savonius rotor

20301,the multi ship encounter situation at sea is characterized by high complexity and uncertainty which is a big challenge for both traditional ships and the new autonomous ships in order to make reasonable navigation decisions and perform well under multi ship encounter situation it is necessary to grasp the current scenario correctly and intelligently therefore in this paper an adaptive understanding model for multi ship encounter situation is proposed the core function of this model is to infer the navigation intention of other target ships under the same situation this model is mainly composed of two sub models one is the ship encounter situation analysis model which realizes the cognition of the whole encounter scenario from the global perspective by maintaining the double matrix the second is the ship navigation intention inference model the key part of the model is a set of well designed fuzzy inference system the output of the encounter situation analysis model is the input of the intention inference model and these two models are closely linked to form a unified whole this model is verified by both simulation based and real scenario based experiments the results show that this model can perform well under the complex multi ship encounter situation moreover some necessary discussion and analysis for this inference model are also stated at the end of this paper in the future we expect that this model can be applied in real situations keywords encounter situation autonomous ship intention inference situation understanding 1 introduction 1 1 background in recent years ship intelligent navigation theory and system have become an active area of research kufoalor et al 2020 peeters et al 2020 from the real time perception of maritime navigation environment elkins et al 2010 to the anthropomorphic formulation of complex navigation decisions wu et al 2020 a variety of emerging technologies make ship navigation more intelligent and efficient wróbel et al 2017 porathe et al 2018 ramos et al 2019 antão and guedes soares 2008 pointed out that 75 96 of marine accidents and causalities are caused by some types of human errors therefore in the future the use of machines to support or partially replace ship officers will show its own value and application prospects it is worth noting that most marine accidents are caused by ship collisions huang et al 2020 ship collision will cause serious loss of life and property at sea and some may even cause severe impact on the marine ecological environment therefore collision avoidance is one of the primary tasks of ship intelligent navigation according to the 108 maritime investigation reports on ship collisions publicly released by the china maritime safety administration msa in recent years the statistical divisions of collision situation are shown in fig 1 the data source is from china p i club 2020 from this figure we can find although a considerable part of collision accidents occurring due to poor geographical or meteorological conditions such as narrow waters poor visibility the top proportion of ship collision accidents is the crossing encounter situation in fact the multi ship encounter situation especially under complex scenario is one of the main factors causing ship collision accidents correct and adequate understanding of the complex multi ship encounter situations is an important means and prerequisite for preventing ship collisions and ensuring ship navigation safety however the understanding for complex multi ship encounter situation faces big challenges in real situation there are still quite a few oows officers on watch who do not pay enough attention to the use of good seamanship when they encounter and maneuver their own ships therefore there are often cases of violation of colregs such as give way vessel keeping course and speed stand on vessel change her course alone as mentioned in statheros et al 2008 rothblum et al 2002 about 56 of marine collision accidents are related to uncoordinated collision avoidance caused by non compliance with colregs it is worth noting that the colregs only divides single to single encounter situation but does not provide additional explanations for the multi ship encounter situation these conditions increase the complexity and diversity of the multi ship encounter situation in recent years autonomous shipping has become a hot topic around world because of its capability to reduce maritime accidents due to human errors perera et al 2015 wróbel et al 2017 ship intelligent collision avoidance system which can control autonomous ship to avoid collisions by generating a series of collision avoidance decisions and has become an active research field in recent years huang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 a complete collision avoidance decision making system should include environmental information perception and processing module collision risk calculation module encounter situation identification and understanding module decision making module decision execution and supervision module the system outputs the latest decision in real time through rolling updates shaobo et al 2020 the logical relationship between these modules is shown in fig 2 encounter situation recognition and understanding is an intermediate module of the system which directly determines the pros and cons of the current scene expression and the output of the final collision avoidance decision according to the level of ship autonomy it can be divided into 5 different categories zhou et al 2020 pedersen et al 2020 which is shown in fig 3 in the future various types of ships will appear at the same time and ship encounter situation will become mixed and complex where different types of ships such as manned unmanned and remotely controlled ships coexist perera and murray 2019 for the same multi ship encounter situation oows on traditional ships experts in remote control center and ship intelligent navigation system on fully autonomous ships will have different judgments and understandings although we assume that all decision makers are rational there will still be unconventional collision avoidance actions of course these decision makers will always find suitable reasons for their actions therefore the complicated maritime encounter situation in the future will bring many challenges to the module encounter situation recognition and understanding in ship intelligent collision avoidance system how to correctly and appropriately identify the current encounter situation and how to understand the navigation intentions of other ships are both key issues that need to be resolved imminently 1 2 literature review at present there are some literatures focusing on the ship encounter situation analysis however there are few literatures that simply discuss the situation itself and most of them integrate the ship encounter situation with the collision risk model hilgert and baldauf 1997 believe that there is a lack of objective criteria in the assessment of ship encounter situations for this reason they design a general ship encounter risk model with 4 risk levels based on colregs liu et al 2020 use the spatial analysis technology by gis geographic information system to propose a topological analysis model for multi ship encounter situation and this model is used to analyze ship collision risk in response to the problem that there is no unified model for the angle division of ship encounter situation gao et al 2020 excavate and collect several typical encounter scenarios specified by colregs from the historical ais automatic identification system data of zhoushan port in china zhang et al 2019 use prolog language to establish a segmentation model for ship encounter situation and divide these situations into 6 types based on ontology he et al 2017 propose a quantitative analysis system combining colregs and seamanship this system includes the encounter situation discrimination model based on the relative course angles of own ship and target ships and divide the whole process of ship collision avoidance into four stages in addition in order to evaluate the performance of the autonomous collision avoidance system in recent years researchers analyze the characteristics of various encounter scenarios in detail based on colregs and design evaluation criteria for collision avoidance actions in various scenarios based on the real ship encounter situations at sea woerner et al 2019 pedersen et al 2020 analysis and understanding of the multi ship encounter situation are an indispensable part of various collision avoidance algorithms and systems especially in recent years it is almost inevitable to integrate colregs into the collision avoidance algorithm liu et al 2016 tu et al 2018 huang et al 2020 in this paper some typical collision avoidance algorithms systems are sorted out and the part of encounter situation analysis contained in them is summarized as shown in table 1 almost all the literatures have considered the two ships encounter situations defined in colregs and according to the rules 13 17 the responsibilities of stand on vessel and give way vessel under the current encounter situation are divided however the method of dividing encounter situations is relatively simple basically dividing 360 into 4 parts namely head on overtaking crossing give way crossing stand on perera et al 2011 further subdivide the crossing encounter situation and expand the number of ship encounter situation into 11 types based on the division of encounter situations some literatures have conducted a more in depth analysis in the field of ship encounter situation understanding so as to further improve the safety of ship navigation at sea these models and theories can be summarized into two categories including ship trajectory prediction and ship intention inference if own ship can predict the trajectory and get the navigation intention of target ships in advance under the current encounter situation this can help own ship to take more reasonable and effective actions ship trajectory prediction plays an important role in ship collision detection and avoidance huang et al 2020 some methods are basic and simple such as predicting the trajectories of other ships are straight lines johansen et al 2016 kufoalor et al 2018 the method of trajectory forecasting based on historical ship position data from ais tu et al 2018 receives attention in recent years a few models and methods including extended kalman filter fossen 2018 hidden markov model peel and good 2011 are used in this area moreover some researchers assume that ships can broadcast and share their navigation intentions kim et al 2017 and planned route huang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 du et al 2020 with each other through communication devices so as to realize the trajectory prediction of target ships although ship trajectory prediction can help decision makers make ship navigation decisions the trajectory prediction is highly uncertain due to the special maritime environment the accuracy of trajectory prediction will decrease with the duration of prediction time in contrast ship navigation intention inference at a certain moment is more direct and effective and it can more intuitively express the understanding for multi ship encounter situation therefore it has become popular in recent years the collision avoidance logic of other target ships can be inferred by a well designed scheme named observation inference prediction decision oipd which is proposed in wang et al 2020 however in this study a large value of the evidence discrepancy threshold parameter may result in unresponsiveness to the collision avoidance logic changes of other ships which will make the intention inference less meaningful cho et al 2021 use the dynamic bayesian network to represent the hidden maneuver intention of other target ships so as to comply with the colregs the restriction of this study is that the number of inference target is limited to only one ship namely two ships encounter situation which is not in compliance with maritime general conditions du et al 2020 try to improve stand on ship s situational awareness by estimating the intention of the give way ship however the intent estimation target is also limited only the give way ship and the intention of give way ship is simply divided into two types including evasive action and normal navigation the intention estimation process is more focus on the navigation conflict detection rather than ship intention inference wu et al 2020 propose a fuzzy logic based intelligent decision making approach for navigation strategy selection in the inland traffic separation scheme there is a sub model named intention inference of own ship in the decision making process however this well designed model is only used for ships in the inland traffic separation scheme in addition to that there are a few methods used to infer the intentions of land traffic participants such as dynamic bayesian network gindele et al 2010 knowledge reasoning armand et al 2014 fuzzy logic perera et al 2012 etc it is worth noting that the description of the real ship encounter situation usually has the characteristics of strong ambiguity and high uncertainty many quantitative evaluation indicators are mostly derived from navigational experience values while fuzzy logic can handle fuzzy and uncertain information well and have been widely used in navigation risk assessment mentes et al 2015 wu et al 2018 2019 and intelligent navigation decision making perera et al 2014 wu et al 2020 1 3 motivation from the above analysis there are some research gaps in the existing studies firstly the analysis of ship encounter situation is an essential part of the ship autonomous collision avoidance system it has been discussed in many previous literatures but most of these literatures are based on colregs to simply classify the encounter situation into four categories head on overtaking crossing give way crossing stand on however ship encounter situation needs to be divided more accurately for example is it a small angle crossing or a large angle crossing and is it overtaking from the left or from the right they are not discussed in some of the literatures in addition most of the previous literatures ignore the highly dynamic characteristics of the multi ship encounter situation during the ship encounter process the distance bearing and other parameters between two ships will continue to change and other ships or own ships may take actions which will change the current situation secondly under the same multi ship encounter situation there may be many two ship encounter situations between different participants at present most literatures still analyze the encounter situation centered on own ship it will lead to the short sightedness consequence during ship collision avoidance decision process for example when own ship is a give way vessel and other ship is a stand on vessel the other ship may be in another more urgent encounter situation that she believes and acts as a give way vessel so the other ship will take collision avoidance actions and own ship will think that there is an uncoordinated collision avoidance situation which will seriously affect own ship making collision avoidance decisions thirdly in terms of ship navigation intention inference many current literatures have proposed various valuable methods to predict the trajectories and intentions of other ships in advance however most of them are based on historical ais ship position data or based on some strong assumptions such as exchanging navigation intention or planned route only very little work focuses on the navigation intention inference under multi ship encounter situation in fact compared with land and air traffic the ship navigation intention inference in open water has its own advantages if we assume that all decision makers are rational the colregs can regulate part of the ship actions besides good seamanship can also restrict the behavior of other ships which are in a common encounter situation these conditions make ship navigation intention inference become more realistic and reachable therefore the motivation of this paper is tried to adaptively understand the multi ship encounter situation first of all in view of the shortsighted and simplistic problems in the current ship encounter situation judgment process this paper constructs a novel encounter situation analysis model from a global perspective and dynamic updating characteristics of the situation is also be considered after that based on the result from the encounter situation analysis model this paper attempts to infer the navigation intention of those target ships that have not taken actions yet but are more likely to take actions next we expect the research work in this paper can help machines improve the capabilities of situational awareness and encounter situation understanding so as to better serve the future high level autonomous ships and enhance the safety of ship navigation 1 4 contributions given the above the main contributions of this paper are as follows firstly a novel encounter situation analysis model is proposed the core component of this model is based on a double matrix which get calculation and dynamic maintenance in real time secondly the adaptive construction rules of the multi ship encounter situation topology network are established and the fuzzy logic method is used to realize the navigation intention inference of other ships under current encounter situation the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 gives some preliminaries and the overview of this paper section 3 and section 4 propose the ship encounter situation analysis model and ship navigation intention inference model respectively section 5 gives case study for the application of proposed models both simulation and real scenario based experiments are conducted discussion is carried out in section 6 and conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 preliminaries and overview this part introduces some commonly used variables and their meanings in this paper all of the abbreviations and notations are listed in appendix a moreover some necessary theoretical points are explained in addition the overall structure of this paper is also introduced 2 1 variable declaration some commonly used symbols and variables in this paper are shown in fig 4 there are two ships in the world coordinate x o y os means own ship and ts means target ship they can be used as subscripts to distinguish variables with the same symbol 2 2 parameter calculation in order to facilitate the discussion below we are here to introduce the calculation methods of dcpa and tcpa between os and ts this paper uses a general parameter calculation method as shown in formula 1 and 2 1 d c p a d sin σ t b o s t s π 2 t c p a d cos σ t b o s t s π r v it should be noted that the value ranges of dcpa and tcpa obtained by this calculation method are both the corresponding signs have different meanings for tcpa if tcpa 0 it means that ts has passed the closest point of approach cpa if tcpa 0 it means that ts has not passed cpa for dcpa the meanings of its sign as shown in fig 5 if ts is on the left side of os when ts passes the bow of os dcpa 0 when passing the stern of os dcpa 0 if ts is on the right side of os when ts passes the bow of os dcpa 0 when passing the stern of os dcpa 0 according to the positive and negative results of dcpa and tcpa the encounter situation between two ships can be divided in more detail 2 3 rule selection in this paper we assume that all traffic participants under current encounter situation are rational in other words their judgments refer to colregs certainly we do not exclude that different traffic participants have different understandings of the same situation and they may take actions that they think effective to avoid collisions therefore seven key rules are considered and selected in this paper and appendix b is a detailed explanation of the parts involved in these seven rules rule 7 risk of collision and rule 8 action to avoid collision mean that all other ships under the same situation will first assess collision risk and then take collision avoidance actions as early as possible and obvious besides rule 13 overtaking rule 14 head on situation and rule 15 crossing situation are used to divide different encounter situations define the stand on vessel and give way vessel and restrict the movement of give way vessel at the same time rule 16 action by give way vessel and rule 17 action by stand on vessel are also selected 2 4 overview the overall architecture of the model proposed in this paper is shown in fig 6 as mentioned in section 1 4 this model mainly include two sub models one is the ship encounter situation analysis model the other is the ship intention inference model for the encounter situation analysis model its core part is composed of two dynamic matrices namely the collision risk matrix and the encounter situation matrix according to the basic information of os and ts these two matrices can be calculated in real time and updated following the corresponding criteria for the ship intention inference model first the topological network model of the current multi ship encounter situation can be constructed according to the information provided by the ship encounter situation analysis model and the traffic participants associated with each ship in the scene can be clarified then the fuzzy reasoning method is adopted 1 fuzzify the crisps through the fuzzy membership function 2 construct a series of fuzzy rules if then and infer the navigation intention of target ship 3 de fuzzify the inference results into crisp and finally get the output of this model the architecture of the entire model is progressive and the internal sub modules are highly correlated 3 ship encounter situation analysis model 3 1 collision risk matrix collision risk cr directly determines the members who make up the current ship encounter situation researchers have proposed many valuable theories and methods to calculate cr chen et al 2018 ozturk and cicek 2019 at present arpa automatic radar plotting aid are essentially utilized to improve the standard of collision avoidance at sea the core parameters tcpa and dcpa in arpa are still important indicators to judge collision risk in view of this a basic cr calculation method is adopted in this paper which is to construct risk membership functions of dcpa and tcpa zheng and wu 2001 the risk membership function of dcpa is shown in formula 3 3 s d c p a 1 d c p a d 1 1 2 1 2 sin π d 2 d 1 d c p a d 2 d 1 2 d 1 d c p a d 2 0 d 2 d c p a among them d 1 is the ship safety domain which is amended by the observation results of goodwin 1975 as defined in formula 4 d 2 is the non risk boundary according to the survey and observation results from zheng and wu 2001 for ships coming to the port side when the initial dcpa is 1 5n miles 98 of the ships do not take evasive action for ships coming to the starboard side or the bow when the initial dcpa is 1 5n miles 94 3 of ships do not take evasive action for stern coming ships when the initial dcpa is 0 9n miles 100 of ships do not take evasive action considering the observation and the safety we defined d 2 2 d 1 4 d 1 1 1 0 2 t b o s t s π 0 t b o s t s 5 π 8 1 0 0 4 t b o s t s π 5 π 8 t b o s t s π 1 0 0 4 2 π t b o s t s π π t b o s t s 11 π 8 1 1 0 4 2 π t b o s t s π 11 π 8 t b o s t s 2 π the risk membership function of tcpa is shown in formula 5 5 s t c p a 1 0 t c p a t 1 t 2 t c p a t 2 t 1 2 t 1 t c p a t 2 0 t 2 t c p a among them 6 t 1 d 1 2 d c p a 2 r v d c p a d 1 d 1 d c p a r v d c p a d 1 t 2 12 2 d c p a 2 r v taking into account the arpa long distance scanning frequently used on ships this paper only collects ship information within 12 nautical miles from os that is when the relative distance of ts is more than 12 nautical miles the danger of tcpa is 0 according to the statistical results we set the weights of the risk of dcpa and tcpa to be 0 6 and 0 4 respectively and the collision risk between os and ts is 7 c r o s t s 0 6 s d c p a 0 4 s t c p a c r o s t s 0 1 the collision risk between os and ts is expanded to the collision risk of any two ships globally we define the current multi ship encounter situation as ξ then the constituent elements of ξ are as follows 8 ξ os k 1 n ts k n is the number of ts within 12 nautical miles then the global collision risk matrix m c r ξ of the current multi ship encounter situation ξ is defined as follows 9 m c r ξ 0 c r o s t s 1 c r o s t s k c r t s 1 o s 0 c r t s 1 t s k c r t s k o s c r t s k t s 1 0 m c r ξ is a symmetric matrix of n 1 n 1 and the main diagonal elements are all equal to zero the collision risk between any two ships under current multi ship encounter situation can be obtained from m c r ξ 3 2 encounter situation matrix the division result of ship encounter situation affects the accuracy of the ship intention inference however as described in section 1 2 most of the existing schemes for dividing ship encounter situations are relatively simple and cannot meet the needs of navigation intention inference therefore ship encounter situations need to be divided more precisely it should be noted here that there are two preconditions for the division of the ship encounter situation 1 normal power driven vessels while underway 2 vessels in sight of each other based on these two above prerequisites this paper enriches ship encounter situations to 16 types according to four basic scenarios specified by colregs the schematic diagrams of each encounter situation are shown in fig 7 the codes and definitions are shown in table 2 it should be noted that the colregs only defines the relative bearing angle of overtaking situation namely 112 5 in this paper the division angles for other encounter situations based on amendment to some results of literatures listed in section 1 2 for the head on situation some of literatures limit the angle to less than 10 zhao et al 2016 lyu and yin 2018 zhang et al 2019 at the same time a few works define the angle as 22 5 johansen et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 in order to balance these angles we define the angle for head on as 15 moreover the angle 22 5 is used to mark the crossing situation with small angle in addition to that considering the angle for overtaking is 22 5 larger than the beam of ship according to the principle of symmetry we set the angle for crossing situation with large angle as 67 5 drawing on the construction idea of m c r ξ the global ship encounter situation matrix m e s ξ of current multi ship encounter situation ξ is defined as follows 10 m e s ξ 0 e s o s t s 1 e s o s t s k e s t s 1 o s 0 e s t s 1 t s k e s t s k o s e s t s k t s 1 0 m e s ξ is also a symmetric matrix of n 1 n 1 and the main diagonal elements are all equal to zero the value range of the element in m e s ξ is 0 h 1 h 2 c 1 o 8 take e s o s t s 1 as an example it represents the encounter situation of ts1 with respect to os m e s ξ will be affected by m c r ξ 3 3 double matrix updating and maintenance considering the real multi ship encounter situations at sea since the navigation parameters of each ship are constantly changing m c r ξ and m e s ξ need to be dynamically updated and maintained to ensure the real time and effectiveness analysis of the current encounter situation the pseudo code of double matrix updating and maintenance as shown in table 3 two points need to be explained in the algorithm 1 m c r ξ is calculated in real time its updates without any impact when c r p q threshold in this paper the threshold is 0 5 if ship encounter situation at the corresponding position in m e s ξ o l d is crossing or head on situation the element in m e s ξ n e w needs to be updated to 0 if it is overtaking situation it will not be affected by cr between two ships this is because according to rule 14 and 15 in the colregs the prerequisite for crossing and head on situation is that there is a collision risk between two power driven vessel but rule 13 overtaking does not clearly stipulate at the same time rule 13 d stipulates that once the overtaking situation is formed the responsibilities of overtaking and being overtaken will not be relieved even if the navigation status of two ships changes afterwards 2 when the element e s p q in m e s ξ o l d belongs to overtaking situations if two ships past and clear or the relative course is greater than the critical angle of overtaking then update the element at the corresponding position in m e s ξ n e w to 0 there are two conditions for judging past and clear under overtaking situation one is t c p a 0 the other is the overtaking vessel past the beam of overtaken vessel now define the critical angle of overtaking ω is considered to be the maximum overtaking angle when the speed of the two ships no longer changes in other words if the relative course r c between two ships is greater than ω then it is considered that the overtaking vessel can never catch up with the overtaken vessel suppose the speed of overtaking vessel is v a f t and the speed of overtaken vessel is v f o r e then 11 ω arccos v f o r e v a f t the standardized dynamic update of a and b is realized and it can be ensured that the judgment result of encounter situation between two ships at each current moment is the latest and effective 4 ship intention inference model 4 1 the topology construction of multi ship encounter situation the calculation results of the multi ship encounter situation analysis model make it possible to directly or indirectly establish a connection between ships under the current encounter situation this connection makes it possible to infer the navigation intention of any other ship under the same scenario before inferring we regard each ship as a node the set of inference elements that may affect ship s navigation status need to be collected and sorted out topological network is very suitable for the efficient expression of complex multi ship encounter situation topology is to abstract entities as points that have nothing to do with their size and shape and abstract the connections between entities as lines such a graph that represents a point line relationship is called a topology graph the topology graph of multi ship encounter situation is constructed according to following rules 1 each ship as a node in the topology 2 when there is an effective encounter situation between two ships nodes connect these two nodes with a line 3 the connection edge is directional and can store the associated information between two nodes fig 8 a shows an example of a complex multi ship encounter situation in which there are 5 ships at the same time fig 8 b is the corresponding topology expression of this scene the determination of the connecting edge and the associated information are calculated by the ship encounter analysis model double matrix we can find from the topological structure that for any node the set of related inference elements δ can be quickly obtained the element set generally contains the ts directly associated with this node and encounter situation of the ts corresponding to this node these two parts often appear in pairs so the element set δ n for any node n is defined as 12 δ n t s 1 e s 1 t s 2 e s 2 t s k e s k where k represents the number of ships associated with node n in the current scene the constituent elements of δ n are highly related to the navigation intent of ship t s n corresponding to node n first of all due to the constraints of colregs the navigation intentions of t s n will be affected by current encounter situation between two ships at the same time the actions taken by another associated ship will also affect the future navigation intention of t s n such as under encounter situation h2 if another ship turns to left side then there is a high probability that t s n will turn left at the next moment rather than turning right which stipulated in the colregs rule 14 4 2 the fundamental inference based on fuzzy logic as mentioned in section 1 2 fuzzy logic can be used to deal with imprecise inference problems with fuzzy characteristics due to the high degree of uncertainty during ship navigation process the fuzzy logic method has been widely used in navigation risk analysis wu et al 2019 2020 and ship intelligent navigation decision making perera et al 2012 perera et al 2014 a complete fuzzy inference system mainly consists of the following three parts 1 fuzzification unit it is used to convert the input crisp value into a fuzzy set on a given domain the fuzzy set is usually represented by linguistic variables 2 fuzzy inference engine it mainly includes a fuzzy rule library composed of a series of fuzzy if then rules and the inference method as one of the most commonly used fuzzy inference methods mamdani uses the classic max min operator as the synthetic algorithm of fuzzy relations and fuzzy sets 3 defuzzification unit its task is to determine an accurate value that best represents the fuzzy set commonly used methods include the maximum membership method the center of gravity method and the center average method in this section according to the three parts of fuzzy inference system introduced above we mainly discuss the basic intention inference method single to single in the next section we will extend it to more general scenarios 4 2 1 fuzzification unit the number of input variables of a fuzzy inference system directly determines the complexity of the system for a typical multi input single output fuzzy inference system if there are too many input variables the scale of the fuzzy rule library will be too large which will make the construction of the fuzzy inference system quite complicated considering the needs of ship navigation intention inference two input variables are considered in this paper the urgency level of current situation ul and the action taken by other ship ac are selected these two elements can be used to infer the navigation intention int of the selected target ship in this paper we use collision risk cr which is calculated in the encounter situation analysis model to approximately represent ul that is the higher cr between two ships the more urgent the current encounter situation ac means that the exact course change angle of other ships which is related to the inference target ship considering that this paper only discusses the ship navigation intention inference in open waters and most ships do not change their speed when taking evasive actions he et al 2017 shaobo et al 2020 so int represents the navigation intention of other ships to change their courses in addition we use a simple case so as to explain the logic from ul ac to int which is shown in fig 9 in this case the inference target ship ts and os are both included and these two ships are in encounter situation h1 at the initial moment which is shown in scenario a it means that ts may turn right according to the colregs the difference between scenario b and scenario c lies in their respective ul taking into account the real sea situation we assume that ul is positively correlated with the magnitude and possibility of the int apart from the inference element ul we set that the actions namely change of course taken by other ships will also influence the int of inference target ship considering the restrictions of the colregs the action taken by the other ship under the same encounter situation can be roughly divided into two categories compliance and non compliance in scenario d and f os alters her course to starboard side which can be regarded as complying with colregs so ts may turn right in response to os s action at the same time the intention of ts is still related to ul which has been discussed before in scenario d considering two ships under higher ul so ts will have a greater probability of turning right to cooperate with os in scenario f there is a lower ul between os and ts so the magnitude and probability of ts turning right is less than scenario d in scenario e and g os turns left which violating colregs so ts may also turn left so as to cooperate with os the magnitude and probability of ts turning left under scenario e is greater than scenario g for ul we set three linguistic variables low s1 medium s2 high s3 this paper uses triangular fuzzy membership functions so the definitions of these three variables are as follows s 1 0 50 0 50 0 70 s 2 0 55 0 70 0 90 s 3 0 75 1 00 1 00 the fuzzy membership function is shown in fig 10 the type of action taken by another ship under the same situation is judged by the ship navigation behavior record unit nbru the recording period of nbru starts from the moment when two ships encounter situation is first determined and ends when the encounter situation disappears five linguistic variables determined by ac are small angle left l1 large angle left l2 maintain course and speed m small angle right r1 large angle right r2 this paper uses the trapezoidal membership function to describe it so these five variables are defined as follows r 1 3 8 15 20 r 2 15 20 30 30 m 7 3 3 7 l 1 20 15 8 3 l 2 30 30 20 15 the fuzzy membership function is shown in fig 11 besides we set the linguistic variables of int are consistent with ac namely l1 l2 m r1 r2 4 2 2 fuzzy inference engine after determining the input variables a mamdani type if antecedent then consequent rule based system is developed which inference via min max norm fuzzy rule library is the core part of the fuzzy inference engine for any input fuzzy set a complete fuzzy inference system can find the corresponding fuzzy rules for inference which requires the fuzzy rule library to be complete at the same time whether the fuzzy rules are reasonable will directly affect the accuracy of the inference results therefore the establishment of the fuzzy rule library in this paper goes through the following three steps to ensure the accuracy of ship intention inference step 1 in section 3 this paper divides ship encounter situation into 16 types we consider that the colregs is one of the main foundations for the establishment of fuzzy rule library we assume that for any ship under current encounter situation before the evasive action is taken the oows on the bridge are rational that is their decision making is bound by colregs the rules considered in this paper have been described in section 2 3 what needs to be explained here is that according to the requirements of rule 16 and rule 17 the roles of stand on vessel and give way vessel are not always fixed under appropriate conditions such as inconsistent collision avoidance actions or deviation from the rules stand on vessel and give way vessel can be interchanged step 2 in addition to fully considering the colregs these fuzzy rules also incorporate expert navigation knowledge when the other ship under the same encounter situation takes an evasive action the colregs does not explain the actions own ship should take so it is particularly important to integrate expert navigation knowledge at this time for example when two ships are in the h2 situation if the other ship turns to the left side although this type of action violates the requirements of rule 14 in the colregs as a sensible ship officer own ship should also turn to the left side so as to coordinate with the other ship step 3 after the initial establishment of fuzzy rules library we feed it back to the captain and relevant experts in this field and make appropriate amendments based on their suggestions to ensure that the rules can be recognized by experts the dimension of fuzzy rule library is determined by es ul ac so the number of rules is 16 3 5 240 table 4 shows some of the rules all fuzzy rules are defined in appendix c each rule belongs to a single rule with multiple antecedents and the consequents is the navigation intentions of selected ship after building fuzzy rules library ship navigation inference is carried out according to the mamdani min max operator specifically suppose the current two ships encounter situation is e s let u l ˆ u l a c ˆ a c i n t ˆ i n t be fuzzy sets which based on domain x 0 1 y 90 90 z 90 90 the fuzzy logic among u l ˆ a c ˆ and i n t ˆ can be defined as e s r m x y z let μ denote the membership function then the fuzzy logic can be defined as 13 μ r m x y z μ u l ˆ x λ μ a c ˆ y λ μ i n t ˆ z then we can get inference consequents i n t 14 μ i n t z v μ u l x λ μ a c y λ μ u l ˆ x λ μ a c ˆ y λ μ i n t ˆ z after sorting as shown in the formula this formula expresses the whole inference logic based on mamdani 15 μ i n t z v μ u l x λ μ u l ˆ x λ v μ a c y λ μ a c ˆ y λ μ i n t ˆ z 4 2 3 defuzzification unit because the fuzzy membership functions of different linguistic variables will overlap the fuzzy inference system usually calls multiple fuzzy rules when inferring therefore it is very important to clarify the merged fuzzy set this paper uses the center of gravity method to achieve defuzzification this method can make full use of all the fuzzy information in the inference result the task of defuzzification is to determine an accurate value that best represents the fuzzy set however it is worth noting that although the defuzzification result is a certain angle it does not completely represent that the inferred ship will adopt the same maneuvering angle in the future this certain angle just describes the most possible actions that the inferred ship will take in the future 4 3 the general inference methodologys in section 4 1 the topology network of the current multi ship encounter situation is constructed and the inference element set δ n of any other ship under the scenario is defined for each pair of elements in δ n the inference result can be obtained according to the fundamental ship intention inference model illustrated in section 4 2 in this section we extend the inference between two ships to multi ship encounter situation the multi ship encounter situation has complex and changeable characteristics for any ship under current situation the composition and scale of the inference element set are often unlimited with randomness and uncertainty therefore if we continue to use fuzzy logic to infer ship navigation intention under the multi ship encounter situation it will make the construction of the fuzzy rule library very difficult in other words it is difficult for us to analyze all the multi ship encounter situations to exhaustively besides if the inference results of each element pair in the element set are simply superimposed this will make the inference results of opposite intentions cancel each other out and directly lead to the wrong inference results in fact the above problems are often encountered when fuzzy logic applies to multi ship encounter situation perera et al 2014 design the saf sequential action formulation module the principle is to convert the inference on a time slice into a continuous time slice that is to adjust the order of different inference results in terms of time however for the ship navigation intention inference people pay more attention to the ship navigation intention at the current moment so the saf based method is not suitable here now we define the question of ship navigation intention inference under multi ship encounter situation for any target ship t s m under the current multi ship encounter situation ξ 0 its inference element set is δ t s m let the fuzzy inference result be i n t t s k which corresponding to each inference element pair t s k e s k then we can get the inference result set φ t s m of t s m under current encounter situation 16 φ t s m i n t t s 1 i n t t s 2 i n t t s n therefore the final navigation intention result i n t t s m of t s m can be calculated from inference result set φ t s m it is generally believed that the actions of rational agents often follow the principle of maximum return that is priority is given to the individuals in φ t s m with great utility therefore the final output of the inference result in φ t s m under the multi ship scenario should be the reasonable decision element with the greatest return and the least cost that is take each inference result element i n t t s k as the main body to calculate the total cost τ of the remaining inference element set ω i n t o t h however using the method of traversing the calculation cost element by element will cause calculation redundancy and generate some unnecessary calculation processes therefore the general inference methodology is often divided into two steps step 1 merge the inference result set φ t s m to find the inference contradictory pair in this step according to the fuzzy membership of ac to perform re fuzzy operation on φ t s m and then construct five different action category sets according to the fuzzification results the general formula of the set is as follows 17 a c t s k μ k a c r 1 r 2 m l 1 l 2 in the above set t s k μ k indicates that the degree of t s k belonging to the set a c is μ k when there is no corresponding element in a c the set is now we can merge the action category set a c and the merge operation follows these two rules rule 1 set m is merged into other action category sets the corresponding interpretation of this rule is when the inferred target ship is both a stand on vessel and a give way vessel it should generally take avoidance actions in accordance with the obligation of give way vessel rule 2 for the action category sets with same direct r 1 merges in r 2 l 1 merges in l 2 the corresponding interpretation of this rule is for steering intentions of different amplitudes in the same direction a small angle steering is subject to a large steering according to the above two rules we can get the results of merging φ t s m there are two results after merging one is that only one action category set is retained and the other is that two action category sets are retained for the first type it can be directly used as the output of the system for each set its output follows the principle of maximization that is selecting navigation intention inference result i n t t s x max from φ t s m corresponding to the target ship t s x max with the greatest degree of membership among the retained elements of the set for the second type two remaining action category sets are contradictory pairs that is the corresponding intention inference results include the left and right directions respectively and the second step is required step 2 calculate the total cost caused by each party in the contradictory pair and select the optimal inference result in this paper we define that the total cost of each party in a contradictory pair is generated by the superposition of action categories in the opposite direction specifically for the inference result i n t t s p l which belongs to l 2 or l 1 the cost is generated by the elements in r 2 and r 1 on the contrary for the inference result i n t t s q r the cost is generated by the elements in l 2 and l 1 the cost value in this paper is determined by the loss function we consider that the loss function should be related to the following four factors 1 angle difference of fuzzy inference results 2 the collision risk between two ships according to m c r ξ 3 the responsibility division according to m e s ξ whether the inference target is a give way vessel or a stand on vessel 4 the degree of membership in the corresponding set the specific construction process of the loss function is given below angle difference is the main component which generates cost in the contradictory pair taking into account the actual navigation process at sea we set the maximum loss when the angle is completely opposite let i n t α be one of the inference results in the contradictory pair the inference result of t s λ which is located in the opposite direction action category set is i n t t s λ choosing i n t α as the final intention inference output will bring the loss to t s λ that can be approximated by a gaussian function the angle difference d i f f a n g l e is 18 d i f f a n g l e i n t α i n t t s λ d i f f a n g l e 30 30 the cost function is shown in formula 19 considering the maximum angle difference is 30 in order to enable the cost function to cover the data domain of the angle difference as much as possible we use the rules of three times standard deviation that is the ratio of 3 ε 3 ε containing 30 30 is 99 74 so we set ε 10 in this paper the figure function is shown in fig 12 a 19 f d i f f a n g l e e d i f f a n g l e 2 2 ε 2 in addition to the angle difference the collision risk between inference target and the other ships in the action category set and the result of the responsibility division will also affect the loss function namely factors 2 and 3 in fact if we do not consider the responsibility division of the inference target under current ship encounter situation then the loss of t s λ caused by the inference result i n t α is positively correlated with the collision risk between two ships however due to the different roles played by the inference target under ship encounter situation the rate of change of the relationship curve is also different we convert the influence of factors 2 and 3 on the loss function into the scale factor s f when the inference target is stand on vessel as the collision risk between two ships increases the growth rate of s f is also faster this is because when two ships are in the early stage of collision risk the stand on vessel should wait for the give way vessel to make evasive actions however as the collision risk grows stand on vessel is more likely to take evasive action which will influence s f when the inference target is a give way vessel the s f should be much higher than a stand on vessel at the initial moment c r 0 5 as the collision risk between two ships increases the growth rate of s f is slower this is because as the collision risk increases the probability of stand on vessel taking action gradually increases but no matter how the value of collision risk changes the s f when inference target is a give way vessel will always be higher than the s f when inference target is stand on vessel let the calculation function be g c r when inference target is a stand on vessel the inverse function h c r of g c r is the calculation function when inference target is a give way vessel as shown in formula 20 the function g c r and h c r are shown as the red and blue lines in fig 12 b respectively θ 2 20 g c r c r θ h c r c r θ 1 for factor 4 the degree of membership also reflects the degree of influence on the loss function we set the membership of t s λ in a action category a c being μ λ a c then for t s λ in this set the cost on t s λ generated by the contradictory intention inference result i n t α is 21 i n t α l o s s t s λ a c μ λ a c s f f d i f f a n g l e it can be seen that the total cost generated by i n t α is the superposition of the cost generated by each element t s k μ k which is in the set of action categories on the opposite side the total loss can be expressed as formula 22 22 g l o s s i n t α a c m k 1 n l o s s t s k a c among them m represents the number of non empty action category sets on the opposite side n represents the number of other ships existing in the current action category set therefore by comparing the total loss of these two contradictory intention inference results and choosing the result with the least cost as the final output in summary after step 1 and step 2 the general inference model is established the model proposed in this paper is expanded from two ships to a more common multi ship encounter situation 5 application of the proposed model case study in this section in order to further discuss and verify the correctness of the proposed model a simulation based experiment and a real scenario based experiment are conducted respectively both of these two cases are based on the electronic chart system ecs some necessary quantitative analysis is also included 5 1 the simulation based experiment in this part a four ship encounter situation is designed and we define it as ξ f two intention inference processes are carried out during this special multi ship encounter situation at the beginning the information of these four ships os ts 1 ts 2 ts 3 is listed in table 5 and the relative position of these ships are shown in fig 14 a 5 1 1 the first inference process we define the scenario at the initial moment as ξ f 1 and it consists of 4 1 4 ships the collision risk matrix m c r ξ f 1 and the updated global encounter situation matrix m e s ξ f 1 n e w are all symmetric matrices of 4 4 and the main diagonal elements are equal to 0 the calculation results of these two matrices are shown in formula 23 23 m c r ξ f 1 0 0 53 0 52 0 54 0 53 0 0 55 0 52 0 52 0 55 0 0 45 0 54 0 52 0 45 0 m e s ξ f 1 n e w 0 h 1 c 5 c 2 h 1 0 c 2 c 5 c 2 c 5 0 0 c 5 c 2 0 0 according to m c r ξ f 1 and m e s ξ f 1 n e w os is in danger of collision with other ships ts1 ts2 and ts3 and there is an encounter situation corresponding to each target ship therefore it is necessary to infer the navigation intentions of all three target ships at the initial moment based on the proposed ship intention inference model in section 4 the fuzzy sets of the input variables for each target ship under scenario ξ f 1 are shown in table 6 it can be found that there are three types of related es h1 c2 c5 in this scenario and the corresponding fuzzy logic rules which have been established are shown in fig 13 the rules activated in this scenario are shown in table 7 according to the information in tables 6 and 7 the fundamental navigation intention inference result for each inference target can be gained and shown in table 8 for all of these inference targets the individual inference results are all in the same direction so according to step 1 which is defined in section 4 3 the final navigation intention inference results for ts 1 ts 2 and ts 3 are all 11 5 we invite captains in our research group who have extensive navigation experience to conduct a plausibility assessment for the final inference results and the comments are summarized as follows for ts 1 it has head on and crossing encounter situation relative to os ts 2 and ts 3 respectively according to the colregs although ts 1 should keep course and speed relative to ts 3 as a stand on vessel it is necessary to alter her course to starboard so as to fulfill its obligations corresponding to os and ts 2 otherwise the amount of course changing should not be too large at the initial moment because os ts 2 and ts 3 also have their own responsibility for collision avoidance so the course changing of ts 1 also depends on the actions taken by other ships for ts 2 it has crossing encounter situation with os and ts 1 according to the model proposed in this paper although it is relatively far from ts 3 it has great potential to form a head on situation with ts 3 in the future therefore alter her course to starboard side is right and the amount of course changing should also be tentative the reason is the same as ts 1 for ts 3 considering the symmetry with ts 2 the plausibility assessment for ts 3 is almost the same as ts 2 the first inference process is simple and direct this is due to the fact that all ships related to the inference are keeping course and speed in addition at the beginning of the scenario the collision risk between ships just exceeded the set threshold 0 5 these two main reasons make the fuzzy sets have less overlap in order to further analysis and discuss these inference results we assume that all inference targets have taken actions corresponding to their inference results namely turning right 11 5 it is shown in fig 14 b this scenario is defined as ξ f 1 considering the main purpose for these target ships taking actions is collision avoidance the distance of other ships relative to the inferred ship is recorded and analyzed respectively we set the recording time step to 10 s comparison results between these two scenarios ξ f 1 and ξ f 1 are shown in fig 15 for ts 1 the distance relative to other ships before intention inference is shown in fig 15 a it can be seen that the distance between os and ts 1 will equal to zero at about the 53rd time step the relative distance after inference is shown in fig 15 b the distance relative to os has been significantly improved to 0 6 nm for ts 2 the distance relative to other ships before intention inference is shown in fig 15 c it can be seen that the distance relative to ts 3 will equal to almost zero at about the 81st time step the relative distance after inference is shown in fig 15 d the distance relative to ts 3 has been significantly improved to 1 4 nm for ts 3 the distance relative to other ships before intention inference is shown in fig 15 e the relative distance after inference is shown in fig 15 f however the distance relative to other ships after inference may become closer like ts 2 relative to ts 1 ts 2 and ts 3 relative to each other one of the reasons for explanation is because the first ship navigation intention inference process happened at the initial moment there are longer distance and lower collision risk between ships so the inference results are slight although the distance is reduced this is a transition from passing the bow to passing the stern which is more reasonable under current encounter situation 5 1 2 the second inference process the second inference process is the continuation of the first inference process we assume that ships under scenario ξ f do not take actions exactly as the first intention inference result in fact it is impossible for other ships to match the inference results generated by our model completely after several minutes we set the course of ts 2 changed from 090 to 063 and the course of ts 3 changed from 270 to 275 therefore considering that the other two target ships have already taken collision avoidance actions that they think are reasonable and effective it is necessary to infer the navigation intention of ts 1 according to the updated information we define this scenario at current moment as ξ f 2 and it consists these four same ships as shown in fig 16 a the collision risk matrix m c r ξ f 2 and the updated global encounter situation matrix m e s ξ f 2 n e w are shown in formula 24 24 m c r ξ f 2 0 0 68 0 61 0 65 0 68 0 0 53 0 61 0 61 0 53 0 0 46 0 65 0 61 0 46 0 m e s ξ f 2 n e w 0 h 1 c 5 c 2 h 1 0 c 2 c 5 c 2 c 5 0 0 c 5 c 2 0 0 according to m c r ξ f 2 and m e s ξ f 2 n e w ts 1 is in danger of collision with os ts 2 and ts 3 in order to infer the navigation intention of ts 1 the information included in double matrix needs to be transformed into fuzzy sets as shown in table 9 according to table 9 the activated rules are shown in table 10 and the surface figures of corresponding es are the same as fig 13 based on the above calculation process the fundamental inference results under scenario ξ f 2 can be found in table 11 the fundamental inference result set of ts 1 can be defined as the symbol φ ts 1 25 φ ts 1 22 3 os 7 4 ts 2 6 1 ts 3 there are contradictory pairs in φ ts 1 according to the general fuzzy inference method proposed in section 4 3 after step 1 we can get the merged contradictory pair shown as follows 26 i n t t s q r 22 3 os i n t t s p l 7 4 ts 2 then according to step 2 the cost generated by this contradictory should be calculated and the results are as follows 27 g l o s s 22 3 os 0 125 g l o s s 7 4 ts 2 0 462 the inference result 7 4 can cause more loss than the result 22 3 therefore the final navigation intention inference results for ts 1is 22 3 a plausibility assessment has also conducted by captains and the comments are summarized as follows for ts 1 it should be noticed that ts 2 and ts 3 have taken evasive actions based on their knowledge at current moment ts 1 and os are in head on situation so ts 1 should alter her course to starboard ts 1 and ts 3 are in crossing left encounter situation relative to ts 1 according to rule 17 c in the colregs and considering ts 3 have taken collision avoidance action ts 1 should not alter her course to port for ts 3 which is on her own port side ts 1 and ts 2 are in crossing right encounter situation relative to ts 1 so ts 1 should alter course to starboard unexpectedly ts 2 have altered her course to port it is not in line with good seamanship relative to all other ships if ts 1 turns to starboard side it will definitely reduce the passing distance with ts 2 however if ts 1 turns to port side it will against rules relative to all three other ships compared with turning right this will have worse consequences under actual circumstance ts 1 prefers to turn right and coordinate with ts 1 increasing the left turning angle and passing stern of ts 1 at the same time therefore the inference result 22 3 is reasonable in order to further analyze the inference result under scenario ξ f 2 we assume ts 1 have turned right 22 3 and define this scenario is ξ f 2 as shown in fig 16 b the distance of other ships relative to ts 1 is recorded and analyzed respectively fig 17 a shows the relative distance before taking inference result the relative distance after taking inference result is shown in fig 17 b according to the result if ts 1 still keeps course it will collide with os after ts 1 turned right 22 3 the passing distance relative to os and ts 3 have improved obviously although the passing distance with ts 2 has decreased namely 0 5 nm at the 40th timestep it can still ensure that ts 2 passes the stern of ts 1 in order to further guarantee safety the coordination by communication between ts 1 and ts 2 is necessary which is also stated in the plausibility assessment above 5 2 the real scenario based experiment 5 2 1 scenario description of the selected case in this part a real complex multi ship encounter situation which is on a typical route along the coast of china is selected to verity the model proposed in this paper the bohai sea is the northernmost inland sea in china and the most important outlet to the sea in northeast and north china there are two busy waterways from east to west and north to south among them the north south waterway connects dalian and shandong peninsula and the east west waterway is mainly for ships from the south to the beijing tianjin hebei region therefore the crossing area of the two waterways often creates more complicated ship encounter situations the multi ship encounter situation selected in this paper is in the intersection area and the entire environment background is shown in fig 18 the green dots represent all ais equipped ships in the sea at a certain moment the bottom left corner is the annual average heat map of the large bulk carrier trajectory in the bohai sea the author of this paper took the ro ro passenger ship shengsheng2 dalian to weihai on the evening of december 18th 2020 for sea experiments we recorded and collected typical multi ship encounter situations on the ship bridge a typical encounter scenario tes was recorded at around 0100 in the morning and the model proposed in this paper was used to conduct a detailed and in depth analysis we play back the tes on the electronic chart platform and the initial moment of tes is shown in fig 19 the tes contains a total of 7 ships the information of all ships at the initial moment is shown in table 12 shengsheng2 sails from dalian to weihai along the red route in fig 19 at the same time 3 and 4 are also ro ro passenger ships operating on the dalian weihai route 5 and 6 are oil tankers heading to tianjin xingang part of the ais information of 2 and 7 is missing and they are more likely to be fishing vessels for shengsheng2 in the tes since the ship is at the intersection of the north south and east west channels the current situation for shengsheng2 is more complicated intuitively shengsheng2 is not only in the process of ship encountering but there are also multiple ships ahead at the same time some of these ships may take actions in the future which will bring a high degree of uncertainty to this multi ship encounter situation in addition after the initial moment of tes in fig 19 5 adjusts its course from 267 to 252 due to its navigation plans in order to encounter 4 more safely 7 turns to the right side from course 080 to 097 it can be seen that the encounter situation ahead is more complicated and some ships have already taken actions therefore it is urgent to understand the current encounter situation and infer the navigation intention of the key ship 5 2 2 model calculation and inference process in section 5 2 1 we introduce the scenario information of the case to be analyzed in detail and expound the complexity of the environmental background in this section we will calculate the model according to the process shown in fig 6 in section 2 4 and make a detailed statement of the inference process first of all according to the ship encounter situation analysis model introduced in section 3 this current multi ship encounter situation is defined as ξ t e s this situation is centered on shengsheng2 own ship considering ships within a radius of 12 nautical miles so ξ t e s consists of 7 1 7 ships the collision risk matrix m c r ξ t e s the initial global encounter situation matrix m e s ξ t e s o l d and the updated global encounter situation matrix m e s ξ t e s n e w are all symmetric matrices of 7 7 and the main diagonal elements are all equal to 0 the calculation results of the above matrices are shown in formula 28 30 28 m c r ξ t e s 0 0 72 0 89 0 0 11 0 46 0 37 0 72 0 0 32 0 0 42 0 08 0 26 0 89 0 32 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 87 0 76 0 72 0 11 0 42 0 0 87 0 0 57 0 91 0 46 0 08 0

e w the non zero values in the updated global encounter situation matrix are concentrated in the upper left corner and the lower right corner respectively that is for the multi ship situation ξ t e s it can be divided into sub situation ξ t e s a composed of 1 2 3 and sub situation ξ t e s b composed of 4 5 6 7 os is currently in ξ t e s a the oow believes that os can pass 2 and 3 at a safe distance so os maintains her original course and speed according to m c r ξ t e s at this moment in addition to 2 and 3 os also has collision risk with 5 6 7 and the collision risk with 6 7 is greater it is worth noting that 7 has changed her course and the collision risk of 6 is close to the set threshold 0 5 therefore if we can infer the navigation intention of 6 in advance it will help os to safely pass the current complex multi ship encounter situation in order to infer the navigation intention of 6 first input the calculation result m c r ξ t e s and m e s ξ t e s n e w into the fuzzification unit and the results are shown in table 13 there are three types of related es c2 o7 h1 in this scenario and the corresponding fuzzy logic rules which have been established are shown in fig 20 the association rules to be used for inference are shown in table 14 according to the fuzzy inference system constructed in section 4 2 for the multi ship encounter situation ξ t e s b the inference input values and results of 6 relative to 4 5 and 7 are shown in table 15 so far we can get the navigation intention inference result set of 6 as φ 6 31 φ 6 23 5 4 7 5 10 1 7 according to the general fuzzy inference method proposed in section 4 3 in order to get the final navigation intention inference result i n t 6 of 6 under scenario ξ t e s b it needs to execute step 1 and step 2 for φ 6 first of all the two action category sets contradictory pairs that can be retained by grouping φ 6 are as follows 32 i n t t s q r 23 5 4 i n t t s p l 7 5 according to rule 2 the step 2should be continued when there is a contradiction during the inference process that is to calculate the sum of the cost caused by the contradiction to each party the calculation results are as follows 33 g l o s s 23 5 4 0 096 g l o s s 7 5 0 225 we select the inference result with minimum cost so the final navigation intention inference result i n t 6 of 6 under situation ξ t e s b is to turn right 23 5 we assume that the inference target takes action according to the inference result and this scenario is defined as ξ t e s the distance of ship 6 relative to other ships is also recorded as shown in fig 21 fig 21 a shows the relative distance before taking inference result the relative distance after taking inference result is shown in fig 21 b it can be found that if 6 takes action the distance relative to 5 will continue to increase although the passing distance relative to 4 has not increased significantly 6 will pass the stern of 4 instead of the bow which is generally considered to be in line with good seamanship the distance relative to 1 os will decrease a lot but 1 and 6 are far apart at the moment of intention inference it means that there is still enough room for both ships taking the next collision avoidance actions in fact after a period of time 6 dose turn to the right side and its course changed from 265 to 320 as shown in fig 22 a this proves the correctness of the model designed in this paper what needs to be explained here is the dcpa value between os and 6 is closed to 0 the second officer on duty noticed this situation in advance he believed that 6 took the action to turn right to avoid 4 and after passing the stern of 4 6 will return to the original route therefore the second officer did not take any related evasive actions after a while as the second officer said the course of 6 changed from 320 to 270 as shown in fig 22 b it also shows that model in this paper can adaptively understand complex multi ship encounter situation this model can not only infer the navigation intention of the selected target ship such as inferring 6 turning the rudder to the right but also clarify the specific reasons for the future navigation intention of the selected target ship for example the reason why 6 turns to the right is that she is in a sub situation ξ t e s b composed of 4 5 and 7 6 discussions 6 1 discussion on the performance and limitations of the proposed model maritime transportation safety is one of the primary factors considered by the researchers in the maritime filed reasonable and effective ship navigation intention inference is an important prerequisite to ensure the safety of ship navigation especially considering that autonomous ships and other marine intelligent transportation system have become an active research area in recent years so we hope the model proposed in this paper can be further used in these intelligent systems in the future as stated in section 5 two experiments including both simulation and real scenario have been conducted both the quantitative and theoretical analysis have been carried out so as to prove the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model for the simulation based experiment a four ship encounter situation was designed and it contains two intention inference processes the main difference between these two inferences is that two of other target ships have already taken different actions in the second scenario certainly it will increase the difficulty of inference for the real scenario based experiment which is more vivid and realistic the inference result and real actions are compared with each other although both results are large and starboard side angle the amplitude of the angle generated by the inference model is smaller than the real action this points further shows that the navigation intentions of other ships are actually difficult to grasp closely because of its ambiguity and uncertainty therefore the exact angles generated by our model can be regarded as a reference value or an approximate expression to describe navigation intention based on this consideration the linguistic variables of int which are introduced in section 4 2 1 can be used to qualitative represent ship navigation intention in addition we assume that the loss value of each element in the contradictory pairs can be used to reflect the degree of distrust of the corresponding inference result distrust means the degree to which this inference result is disturbed we define that it is equal to the ratio of single loss and the total loss of the contradictory pair based on the above discussion these exact angles obtained by our model in section 5 can be transformed into semantic description which are shown in table 16 precise navigation intention inference for other ships under the common scenario is a difficult research topic and it needs to be solved gradually nevertheless compared with other research work which is related with ship intention inference in recent years the model proposed in this paper has its own advantages firstly some intention inference model cho et al 2021 only can cope with simple ship encounter situation including two ships our model can deal with multi ship encounter situation namely the complex situation it is benefit from the double matrix and its automatic update logic which can observe and understand other ships from the overall perspective secondly compared with du et al 2020 which roughly divide the intention of give way ships into two categories evasive action and normal navigation the inference results generated by our model are exact angles although these angles do not completely match the real actions we expect them can better express the navigation intention of other ships thirdly compared to these prediction and inference processes which are entirely based on mathematical models wang et al 2020 cho et al 2021 our inference model which based on fuzzy logic can incorporate expert knowledge and navigation experience it makes the model more flexible and human like although the analysis in previous section and the above discussions show active aspect of our model it still has some limitations and defects firstly the intention inference results generated by the model is only for the current moment as time passing by the inference result at different moments may change which will have a potential impact secondly the intention inference result is an exact angle which will almost always deviate from the real actions it may interfere with the oow s judgement thirdly the model in this paper is designed with more consideration of the complex multi ship encounter situation at open water the antecedent of the 240 fuzzy inference rules designed is only related to the collision risk the encounter situation and the actions of other ships for other marine environments such as narrow waters fishing areas anchoring areas port entry and traffic separation zones etc have their own characteristics target ship s navigation intentions will also be affected by many other factors such as shallow waters traffic control etc 6 2 future work and prospect considering these limitations listed in section 6 1 the future work contains some targeted improvements for the first limitation we plan to transform the inference at current moment into a certain period of time which will extend the effective time of intention inference for the second limitation we plan to change the form of inference results from accurate angle to intention probability distribution for the third limitation we plan to add more sub inference models into our current model like the work in wu et al 2020 we expect that the above discussion can further improve our model so as to apply under real conditions the object of the ship navigation intention inference model is to find and calculate other ships intention under the same multi ship encounter situation so as to assist oow or some intelligent machines to make navigation decisions which will further improve the safety of ship navigation however it should be noted that ship intention inference is just one method which is used to get other ships intention in fact under traditional circumstances in order to get other ships intention the oows usually rely on the communication through mutual coordination by vhf very high frequency to clarify each other s navigation intention and plan their next action and this type of method is simple effective and reliable for unmanned ships there is a lack of human participation in the bridge which makes the communication between ships becomes more difficult considering the long term coexistence of unmanned ships and manned ships at sea how to realize the communication between humans and intelligent agents will be a novel research field drawing on the precedents of reliable human computer interaction in other fields speech recognition and natural language processing are one of the potential solutions however due to the disadvantages of voice interaction of international navigating ships such as different languages different accents and excessive noise of maritime communication the feasibility of such a scheme remains to be discussed therefore for the new format of human computer interaction between unmanned and manned ships in the future it is particularly important to find a novel information interaction mechanism in addition whether it is to infer navigation intention of the target ship or to establish a reliable information interaction mechanism between autonomous ship and typical ship the future navigation dynamics of the target ship at sea still have a high degree of uncertainty unexpected uncoordinated actions can cause serious consequences in addition to realizing cognition and understanding of most normal situations it is also necessary to consider the extreme uncoordinated situations that may occur this will also be the next interesting research topic 7 conclusions in this paper in order to further improve the safety of ship navigation and support the intelligent navigation decision making for autonomous ship a novel ship navigation intention inference model is introduced which includes two parts the ship encounter situation analysis model and the ship intention inference model the input of the intention inference model is exactly the output of the encounter situation analysis model a simulation based experiment and a real scenario based experiment are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of this model the capability of multi ship encounter situation understanding is one of the essential elements for the next generation of intelligent autonomous ships besides if the decision making center can infer and grasp other ship s intention in advance it will help a lot for own ship to make more quality navigation decisions like collision avoidance actions or course keeping maneuvering however there are still some issues need to be solved in the future especially the uncertainty in simply predicting and inferring other ship s intention in the next research step the autonomous interaction between ships is a new topic which is waiting to be researched and well solved credit authorship contribution statement shaobo wang conceptualization methodology software

20301,the multi ship encounter situation at sea is characterized by high complexity and uncertainty which is a big challenge for both traditional ships and the new autonomous ships in order to make reasonable navigation decisions and perform well under multi ship encounter situation it is necessary to grasp the current scenario correctly and intelligently therefore in this paper an adaptive understanding model for multi ship encounter situation is proposed the core function of this model is to infer the navigation intention of other target ships under the same situation this model is mainly composed of two sub models one is the ship encounter situation analysis model which realizes the cognition of the whole encounter scenario from the global perspective by maintaining the double matrix the second is the ship navigation intention inference model the key part of the model is a set of well designed fuzzy inference system the output of the encounter situation analysis model is the input of the intention inference model and these two models are closely linked to form a unified whole this model is verified by both simulation based and real scenario based experiments the results show that this model can perform well under the complex multi ship encounter situation moreover some necessary discussion and analysis for this inference model are also stated at the end of this paper in the future we expect that this model can be applied in real situations keywords encounter situation autonomous ship intention inference situation understanding 1 introduction 1 1 background in recent years ship intelligent navigation theory and system have become an active area of research kufoalor et al 2020 peeters et al 2020 from the real time perception of maritime navigation environment elkins et al 2010 to the anthropomorphic formulation of complex navigation decisions wu et al 2020 a variety of emerging technologies make ship navigation more intelligent and efficient wróbel et al 2017 porathe et al 2018 ramos et al 2019 antão and guedes soares 2008 pointed out that 75 96 of marine accidents and causalities are caused by some types of human errors therefore in the future the use of machines to support or partially replace ship officers will show its own value and application prospects it is worth noting that most marine accidents are caused by ship collisions huang et al 2020 ship collision will cause serious loss of life and property at sea and some may even cause severe impact on the marine ecological environment therefore collision avoidance is one of the primary tasks of ship intelligent navigation according to the 108 maritime investigation reports on ship collisions publicly released by the china maritime safety administration msa in recent years the statistical divisions of collision situation are shown in fig 1 the data source is from china p i club 2020 from this figure we can find although a considerable part of collision accidents occurring due to poor geographical or meteorological conditions such as narrow waters poor visibility the top proportion of ship collision accidents is the crossing encounter situation in fact the multi ship encounter situation especially under complex scenario is one of the main factors causing ship collision accidents correct and adequate understanding of the complex multi ship encounter situations is an important means and prerequisite for preventing ship collisions and ensuring ship navigation safety however the understanding for complex multi ship encounter situation faces big challenges in real situation there are still quite a few oows officers on watch who do not pay enough attention to the use of good seamanship when they encounter and maneuver their own ships therefore there are often cases of violation of colregs such as give way vessel keeping course and speed stand on vessel change her course alone as mentioned in statheros et al 2008 rothblum et al 2002 about 56 of marine collision accidents are related to uncoordinated collision avoidance caused by non compliance with colregs it is worth noting that the colregs only divides single to single encounter situation but does not provide additional explanations for the multi ship encounter situation these conditions increase the complexity and diversity of the multi ship encounter situation in recent years autonomous shipping has become a hot topic around world because of its capability to reduce maritime accidents due to human errors perera et al 2015 wróbel et al 2017 ship intelligent collision avoidance system which can control autonomous ship to avoid collisions by generating a series of collision avoidance decisions and has become an active research field in recent years huang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 a complete collision avoidance decision making system should include environmental information perception and processing module collision risk calculation module encounter situation identification and understanding module decision making module decision execution and supervision module the system outputs the latest decision in real time through rolling updates shaobo et al 2020 the logical relationship between these modules is shown in fig 2 encounter situation recognition and understanding is an intermediate module of the system which directly determines the pros and cons of the current scene expression and the output of the final collision avoidance decision according to the level of ship autonomy it can be divided into 5 different categories zhou et al 2020 pedersen et al 2020 which is shown in fig 3 in the future various types of ships will appear at the same time and ship encounter situation will become mixed and complex where different types of ships such as manned unmanned and remotely controlled ships coexist perera and murray 2019 for the same multi ship encounter situation oows on traditional ships experts in remote control center and ship intelligent navigation system on fully autonomous ships will have different judgments and understandings although we assume that all decision makers are rational there will still be unconventional collision avoidance actions of course these decision makers will always find suitable reasons for their actions therefore the complicated maritime encounter situation in the future will bring many challenges to the module encounter situation recognition and understanding in ship intelligent collision avoidance system how to correctly and appropriately identify the current encounter situation and how to understand the navigation intentions of other ships are both key issues that need to be resolved imminently 1 2 literature review at present there are some literatures focusing on the ship encounter situation analysis however there are few literatures that simply discuss the situation itself and most of them integrate the ship encounter situation with the collision risk model hilgert and baldauf 1997 believe that there is a lack of objective criteria in the assessment of ship encounter situations for this reason they design a general ship encounter risk model with 4 risk levels based on colregs liu et al 2020 use the spatial analysis technology by gis geographic information system to propose a topological analysis model for multi ship encounter situation and this model is used to analyze ship collision risk in response to the problem that there is no unified model for the angle division of ship encounter situation gao et al 2020 excavate and collect several typical encounter scenarios specified by colregs from the historical ais automatic identification system data of zhoushan port in china zhang et al 2019 use prolog language to establish a segmentation model for ship encounter situation and divide these situations into 6 types based on ontology he et al 2017 propose a quantitative analysis system combining colregs and seamanship this system includes the encounter situation discrimination model based on the relative course angles of own ship and target ships and divide the whole process of ship collision avoidance into four stages in addition in order to evaluate the performance of the autonomous collision avoidance system in recent years researchers analyze the characteristics of various encounter scenarios in detail based on colregs and design evaluation criteria for collision avoidance actions in various scenarios based on the real ship encounter situations at sea woerner et al 2019 pedersen et al 2020 analysis and understanding of the multi ship encounter situation are an indispensable part of various collision avoidance algorithms and systems especially in recent years it is almost inevitable to integrate colregs into the collision avoidance algorithm liu et al 2016 tu et al 2018 huang et al 2020 in this paper some typical collision avoidance algorithms systems are sorted out and the part of encounter situation analysis contained in them is summarized as shown in table 1 almost all the literatures have considered the two ships encounter situations defined in colregs and according to the rules 13 17 the responsibilities of stand on vessel and give way vessel under the current encounter situation are divided however the method of dividing encounter situations is relatively simple basically dividing 360 into 4 parts namely head on overtaking crossing give way crossing stand on perera et al 2011 further subdivide the crossing encounter situation and expand the number of ship encounter situation into 11 types based on the division of encounter situations some literatures have conducted a more in depth analysis in the field of ship encounter situation understanding so as to further improve the safety of ship navigation at sea these models and theories can be summarized into two categories including ship trajectory prediction and ship intention inference if own ship can predict the trajectory and get the navigation intention of target ships in advance under the current encounter situation this can help own ship to take more reasonable and effective actions ship trajectory prediction plays an important role in ship collision detection and avoidance huang et al 2020 some methods are basic and simple such as predicting the trajectories of other ships are straight lines johansen et al 2016 kufoalor et al 2018 the method of trajectory forecasting based on historical ship position data from ais tu et al 2018 receives attention in recent years a few models and methods including extended kalman filter fossen 2018 hidden markov model peel and good 2011 are used in this area moreover some researchers assume that ships can broadcast and share their navigation intentions kim et al 2017 and planned route huang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 du et al 2020 with each other through communication devices so as to realize the trajectory prediction of target ships although ship trajectory prediction can help decision makers make ship navigation decisions the trajectory prediction is highly uncertain due to the special maritime environment the accuracy of trajectory prediction will decrease with the duration of prediction time in contrast ship navigation intention inference at a certain moment is more direct and effective and it can more intuitively express the understanding for multi ship encounter situation therefore it has become popular in recent years the collision avoidance logic of other target ships can be inferred by a well designed scheme named observation inference prediction decision oipd which is proposed in wang et al 2020 however in this study a large value of the evidence discrepancy threshold parameter may result in unresponsiveness to the collision avoidance logic changes of other ships which will make the intention inference less meaningful cho et al 2021 use the dynamic bayesian network to represent the hidden maneuver intention of other target ships so as to comply with the colregs the restriction of this study is that the number of inference target is limited to only one ship namely two ships encounter situation which is not in compliance with maritime general conditions du et al 2020 try to improve stand on ship s situational awareness by estimating the intention of the give way ship however the intent estimation target is also limited only the give way ship and the intention of give way ship is simply divided into two types including evasive action and normal navigation the intention estimation process is more focus on the navigation conflict detection rather than ship intention inference wu et al 2020 propose a fuzzy logic based intelligent decision making approach for navigation strategy selection in the inland traffic separation scheme there is a sub model named intention inference of own ship in the decision making process however this well designed model is only used for ships in the inland traffic separation scheme in addition to that there are a few methods used to infer the intentions of land traffic participants such as dynamic bayesian network gindele et al 2010 knowledge reasoning armand et al 2014 fuzzy logic perera et al 2012 etc it is worth noting that the description of the real ship encounter situation usually has the characteristics of strong ambiguity and high uncertainty many quantitative evaluation indicators are mostly derived from navigational experience values while fuzzy logic can handle fuzzy and uncertain information well and have been widely used in navigation risk assessment mentes et al 2015 wu et al 2018 2019 and intelligent navigation decision making perera et al 2014 wu et al 2020 1 3 motivation from the above analysis there are some research gaps in the existing studies firstly the analysis of ship encounter situation is an essential part of the ship autonomous collision avoidance system it has been discussed in many previous literatures but most of these literatures are based on colregs to simply classify the encounter situation into four categories head on overtaking crossing give way crossing stand on however ship encounter situation needs to be divided more accurately for example is it a small angle crossing or a large angle crossing and is it overtaking from the left or from the right they are not discussed in some of the literatures in addition most of the previous literatures ignore the highly dynamic characteristics of the multi ship encounter situation during the ship encounter process the distance bearing and other parameters between two ships will continue to change and other ships or own ships may take actions which will change the current situation secondly under the same multi ship encounter situation there may be many two ship encounter situations between different participants at present most literatures still analyze the encounter situation centered on own ship it will lead to the short sightedness consequence during ship collision avoidance decision process for example when own ship is a give way vessel and other ship is a stand on vessel the other ship may be in another more urgent encounter situation that she believes and acts as a give way vessel so the other ship will take collision avoidance actions and own ship will think that there is an uncoordinated collision avoidance situation which will seriously affect own ship making collision avoidance decisions thirdly in terms of ship navigation intention inference many current literatures have proposed various valuable methods to predict the trajectories and intentions of other ships in advance however most of them are based on historical ais ship position data or based on some strong assumptions such as exchanging navigation intention or planned route only very little work focuses on the navigation intention inference under multi ship encounter situation in fact compared with land and air traffic the ship navigation intention inference in open water has its own advantages if we assume that all decision makers are rational the colregs can regulate part of the ship actions besides good seamanship can also restrict the behavior of other ships which are in a common encounter situation these conditions make ship navigation intention inference become more realistic and reachable therefore the motivation of this paper is tried to adaptively understand the multi ship encounter situation first of all in view of the shortsighted and simplistic problems in the current ship encounter situation judgment process this paper constructs a novel encounter situation analysis model from a global perspective and dynamic updating characteristics of the situation is also be considered after that based on the result from the encounter situation analysis model this paper attempts to infer the navigation intention of those target ships that have not taken actions yet but are more likely to take actions next we expect the research work in this paper can help machines improve the capabilities of situational awareness and encounter situation understanding so as to better serve the future high level autonomous ships and enhance the safety of ship navigation 1 4 contributions given the above the main contributions of this paper are as follows firstly a novel encounter situation analysis model is proposed the core component of this model is based on a double matrix which get calculation and dynamic maintenance in real time secondly the adaptive construction rules of the multi ship encounter situation topology network are established and the fuzzy logic method is used to realize the navigation intention inference of other ships under current encounter situation the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 gives some preliminaries and the overview of this paper section 3 and section 4 propose the ship encounter situation analysis model and ship navigation intention inference model respectively section 5 gives case study for the application of proposed models both simulation and real scenario based experiments are conducted discussion is carried out in section 6 and conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 preliminaries and overview this part introduces some commonly used variables and their meanings in this paper all of the abbreviations and notations are listed in appendix a moreover some necessary theoretical points are explained in addition the overall structure of this paper is also introduced 2 1 variable declaration some commonly used symbols and variables in this paper are shown in fig 4 there are two ships in the world coordinate x o y os means own ship and ts means target ship they can be used as subscripts to distinguish variables with the same symbol 2 2 parameter calculation in order to facilitate the discussion below we are here to introduce the calculation methods of dcpa and tcpa between os and ts this paper uses a general parameter calculation method as shown in formula 1 and 2 1 d c p a d sin σ t b o s t s π 2 t c p a d cos σ t b o s t s π r v it should be noted that the value ranges of dcpa and tcpa obtained by this calculation method are both the corresponding signs have different meanings for tcpa if tcpa 0 it means that ts has passed the closest point of approach cpa if tcpa 0 it means that ts has not passed cpa for dcpa the meanings of its sign as shown in fig 5 if ts is on the left side of os when ts passes the bow of os dcpa 0 when passing the stern of os dcpa 0 if ts is on the right side of os when ts passes the bow of os dcpa 0 when passing the stern of os dcpa 0 according to the positive and negative results of dcpa and tcpa the encounter situation between two ships can be divided in more detail 2 3 rule selection in this paper we assume that all traffic participants under current encounter situation are rational in other words their judgments refer to colregs certainly we do not exclude that different traffic participants have different understandings of the same situation and they may take actions that they think effective to avoid collisions therefore seven key rules are considered and selected in this paper and appendix b is a detailed explanation of the parts involved in these seven rules rule 7 risk of collision and rule 8 action to avoid collision mean that all other ships under the same situation will first assess collision risk and then take collision avoidance actions as early as possible and obvious besides rule 13 overtaking rule 14 head on situation and rule 15 crossing situation are used to divide different encounter situations define the stand on vessel and give way vessel and restrict the movement of give way vessel at the same time rule 16 action by give way vessel and rule 17 action by stand on vessel are also selected 2 4 overview the overall architecture of the model proposed in this paper is shown in fig 6 as mentioned in section 1 4 this model mainly include two sub models one is the ship encounter situation analysis model the other is the ship intention inference model for the encounter situation analysis model its core part is composed of two dynamic matrices namely the collision risk matrix and the encounter situation matrix according to the basic information of os and ts these two matrices can be calculated in real time and updated following the corresponding criteria for the ship intention inference model first the topological network model of the current multi ship encounter situation can be constructed according to the information provided by the ship encounter situation analysis model and the traffic participants associated with each ship in the scene can be clarified then the fuzzy reasoning method is adopted 1 fuzzify the crisps through the fuzzy membership function 2 construct a series of fuzzy rules if then and infer the navigation intention of target ship 3 de fuzzify the inference results into crisp and finally get the output of this model the architecture of the entire model is progressive and the internal sub modules are highly correlated 3 ship encounter situation analysis model 3 1 collision risk matrix collision risk cr directly determines the members who make up the current ship encounter situation researchers have proposed many valuable theories and methods to calculate cr chen et al 2018 ozturk and cicek 2019 at present arpa automatic radar plotting aid are essentially utilized to improve the standard of collision avoidance at sea the core parameters tcpa and dcpa in arpa are still important indicators to judge collision risk in view of this a basic cr calculation method is adopted in this paper which is to construct risk membership functions of dcpa and tcpa zheng and wu 2001 the risk membership function of dcpa is shown in formula 3 3 s d c p a 1 d c p a d 1 1 2 1 2 sin π d 2 d 1 d c p a d 2 d 1 2 d 1 d c p a d 2 0 d 2 d c p a among them d 1 is the ship safety domain which is amended by the observation results of goodwin 1975 as defined in formula 4 d 2 is the non risk boundary according to the survey and observation results from zheng and wu 2001 for ships coming to the port side when the initial dcpa is 1 5n miles 98 of the ships do not take evasive action for ships coming to the starboard side or the bow when the initial dcpa is 1 5n miles 94 3 of ships do not take evasive action for stern coming ships when the initial dcpa is 0 9n miles 100 of ships do not take evasive action considering the observation and the safety we defined d 2 2 d 1 4 d 1 1 1 0 2 t b o s t s π 0 t b o s t s 5 π 8 1 0 0 4 t b o s t s π 5 π 8 t b o s t s π 1 0 0 4 2 π t b o s t s π π t b o s t s 11 π 8 1 1 0 4 2 π t b o s t s π 11 π 8 t b o s t s 2 π the risk membership function of tcpa is shown in formula 5 5 s t c p a 1 0 t c p a t 1 t 2 t c p a t 2 t 1 2 t 1 t c p a t 2 0 t 2 t c p a among them 6 t 1 d 1 2 d c p a 2 r v d c p a d 1 d 1 d c p a r v d c p a d 1 t 2 12 2 d c p a 2 r v taking into account the arpa long distance scanning frequently used on ships this paper only collects ship information within 12 nautical miles from os that is when the relative distance of ts is more than 12 nautical miles the danger of tcpa is 0 according to the statistical results we set the weights of the risk of dcpa and tcpa to be 0 6 and 0 4 respectively and the collision risk between os and ts is 7 c r o s t s 0 6 s d c p a 0 4 s t c p a c r o s t s 0 1 the collision risk between os and ts is expanded to the collision risk of any two ships globally we define the current multi ship encounter situation as ξ then the constituent elements of ξ are as follows 8 ξ os k 1 n ts k n is the number of ts within 12 nautical miles then the global collision risk matrix m c r ξ of the current multi ship encounter situation ξ is defined as follows 9 m c r ξ 0 c r o s t s 1 c r o s t s k c r t s 1 o s 0 c r t s 1 t s k c r t s k o s c r t s k t s 1 0 m c r ξ is a symmetric matrix of n 1 n 1 and the main diagonal elements are all equal to zero the collision risk between any two ships under current multi ship encounter situation can be obtained from m c r ξ 3 2 encounter situation matrix the division result of ship encounter situation affects the accuracy of the ship intention inference however as described in section 1 2 most of the existing schemes for dividing ship encounter situations are relatively simple and cannot meet the needs of navigation intention inference therefore ship encounter situations need to be divided more precisely it should be noted here that there are two preconditions for the division of the ship encounter situation 1 normal power driven vessels while underway 2 vessels in sight of each other based on these two above prerequisites this paper enriches ship encounter situations to 16 types according to four basic scenarios specified by colregs the schematic diagrams of each encounter situation are shown in fig 7 the codes and definitions are shown in table 2 it should be noted that the colregs only defines the relative bearing angle of overtaking situation namely 112 5 in this paper the division angles for other encounter situations based on amendment to some results of literatures listed in section 1 2 for the head on situation some of literatures limit the angle to less than 10 zhao et al 2016 lyu and yin 2018 zhang et al 2019 at the same time a few works define the angle as 22 5 johansen et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 in order to balance these angles we define the angle for head on as 15 moreover the angle 22 5 is used to mark the crossing situation with small angle in addition to that considering the angle for overtaking is 22 5 larger than the beam of ship according to the principle of symmetry we set the angle for crossing situation with large angle as 67 5 drawing on the construction idea of m c r ξ the global ship encounter situation matrix m e s ξ of current multi ship encounter situation ξ is defined as follows 10 m e s ξ 0 e s o s t s 1 e s o s t s k e s t s 1 o s 0 e s t s 1 t s k e s t s k o s e s t s k t s 1 0 m e s ξ is also a symmetric matrix of n 1 n 1 and the main diagonal elements are all equal to zero the value range of the element in m e s ξ is 0 h 1 h 2 c 1 o 8 take e s o s t s 1 as an example it represents the encounter situation of ts1 with respect to os m e s ξ will be affected by m c r ξ 3 3 double matrix updating and maintenance considering the real multi ship encounter situations at sea since the navigation parameters of each ship are constantly changing m c r ξ and m e s ξ need to be dynamically updated and maintained to ensure the real time and effectiveness analysis of the current encounter situation the pseudo code of double matrix updating and maintenance as shown in table 3 two points need to be explained in the algorithm 1 m c r ξ is calculated in real time its updates without any impact when c r p q threshold in this paper the threshold is 0 5 if ship encounter situation at the corresponding position in m e s ξ o l d is crossing or head on situation the element in m e s ξ n e w needs to be updated to 0 if it is overtaking situation it will not be affected by cr between two ships this is because according to rule 14 and 15 in the colregs the prerequisite for crossing and head on situation is that there is a collision risk between two power driven vessel but rule 13 overtaking does not clearly stipulate at the same time rule 13 d stipulates that once the overtaking situation is formed the responsibilities of overtaking and being overtaken will not be relieved even if the navigation status of two ships changes afterwards 2 when the element e s p q in m e s ξ o l d belongs to overtaking situations if two ships past and clear or the relative course is greater than the critical angle of overtaking then update the element at the corresponding position in m e s ξ n e w to 0 there are two conditions for judging past and clear under overtaking situation one is t c p a 0 the other is the overtaking vessel past the beam of overtaken vessel now define the critical angle of overtaking ω is considered to be the maximum overtaking angle when the speed of the two ships no longer changes in other words if the relative course r c between two ships is greater than ω then it is considered that the overtaking vessel can never catch up with the overtaken vessel suppose the speed of overtaking vessel is v a f t and the speed of overtaken vessel is v f o r e then 11 ω arccos v f o r e v a f t the standardized dynamic update of a and b is realized and it can be ensured that the judgment result of encounter situation between two ships at each current moment is the latest and effective 4 ship intention inference model 4 1 the topology construction of multi ship encounter situation the calculation results of the multi ship encounter situation analysis model make it possible to directly or indirectly establish a connection between ships under the current encounter situation this connection makes it possible to infer the navigation intention of any other ship under the same scenario before inferring we regard each ship as a node the set of inference elements that may affect ship s navigation status need to be collected and sorted out topological network is very suitable for the efficient expression of complex multi ship encounter situation topology is to abstract entities as points that have nothing to do with their size and shape and abstract the connections between entities as lines such a graph that represents a point line relationship is called a topology graph the topology graph of multi ship encounter situation is constructed according to following rules 1 each ship as a node in the topology 2 when there is an effective encounter situation between two ships nodes connect these two nodes with a line 3 the connection edge is directional and can store the associated information between two nodes fig 8 a shows an example of a complex multi ship encounter situation in which there are 5 ships at the same time fig 8 b is the corresponding topology expression of this scene the determination of the connecting edge and the associated information are calculated by the ship encounter analysis model double matrix we can find from the topological structure that for any node the set of related inference elements δ can be quickly obtained the element set generally contains the ts directly associated with this node and encounter situation of the ts corresponding to this node these two parts often appear in pairs so the element set δ n for any node n is defined as 12 δ n t s 1 e s 1 t s 2 e s 2 t s k e s k where k represents the number of ships associated with node n in the current scene the constituent elements of δ n are highly related to the navigation intent of ship t s n corresponding to node n first of all due to the constraints of colregs the navigation intentions of t s n will be affected by current encounter situation between two ships at the same time the actions taken by another associated ship will also affect the future navigation intention of t s n such as under encounter situation h2 if another ship turns to left side then there is a high probability that t s n will turn left at the next moment rather than turning right which stipulated in the colregs rule 14 4 2 the fundamental inference based on fuzzy logic as mentioned in section 1 2 fuzzy logic can be used to deal with imprecise inference problems with fuzzy characteristics due to the high degree of uncertainty during ship navigation process the fuzzy logic method has been widely used in navigation risk analysis wu et al 2019 2020 and ship intelligent navigation decision making perera et al 2012 perera et al 2014 a complete fuzzy inference system mainly consists of the following three parts 1 fuzzification unit it is used to convert the input crisp value into a fuzzy set on a given domain the fuzzy set is usually represented by linguistic variables 2 fuzzy inference engine it mainly includes a fuzzy rule library composed of a series of fuzzy if then rules and the inference method as one of the most commonly used fuzzy inference methods mamdani uses the classic max min operator as the synthetic algorithm of fuzzy relations and fuzzy sets 3 defuzzification unit its task is to determine an accurate value that best represents the fuzzy set commonly used methods include the maximum membership method the center of gravity method and the center average method in this section according to the three parts of fuzzy inference system introduced above we mainly discuss the basic intention inference method single to single in the next section we will extend it to more general scenarios 4 2 1 fuzzification unit the number of input variables of a fuzzy inference system directly determines the complexity of the system for a typical multi input single output fuzzy inference system if there are too many input variables the scale of the fuzzy rule library will be too large which will make the construction of the fuzzy inference system quite complicated considering the needs of ship navigation intention inference two input variables are considered in this paper the urgency level of current situation ul and the action taken by other ship ac are selected these two elements can be used to infer the navigation intention int of the selected target ship in this paper we use collision risk cr which is calculated in the encounter situation analysis model to approximately represent ul that is the higher cr between two ships the more urgent the current encounter situation ac means that the exact course change angle of other ships which is related to the inference target ship considering that this paper only discusses the ship navigation intention inference in open waters and most ships do not change their speed when taking evasive actions he et al 2017 shaobo et al 2020 so int represents the navigation intention of other ships to change their courses in addition we use a simple case so as to explain the logic from ul ac to int which is shown in fig 9 in this case the inference target ship ts and os are both included and these two ships are in encounter situation h1 at the initial moment which is shown in scenario a it means that ts may turn right according to the colregs the difference between scenario b and scenario c lies in their respective ul taking into account the real sea situation we assume that ul is positively correlated with the magnitude and possibility of the int apart from the inference element ul we set that the actions namely change of course taken by other ships will also influence the int of inference target ship considering the restrictions of the colregs the action taken by the other ship under the same encounter situation can be roughly divided into two categories compliance and non compliance in scenario d and f os alters her course to starboard side which can be regarded as complying with colregs so ts may turn right in response to os s action at the same time the intention of ts is still related to ul which has been discussed before in scenario d considering two ships under higher ul so ts will have a greater probability of turning right to cooperate with os in scenario f there is a lower ul between os and ts so the magnitude and probability of ts turning right is less than scenario d in scenario e and g os turns left which violating colregs so ts may also turn left so as to cooperate with os the magnitude and probability of ts turning left under scenario e is greater than scenario g for ul we set three linguistic variables low s1 medium s2 high s3 this paper uses triangular fuzzy membership functions so the definitions of these three variables are as follows s 1 0 50 0 50 0 70 s 2 0 55 0 70 0 90 s 3 0 75 1 00 1 00 the fuzzy membership function is shown in fig 10 the type of action taken by another ship under the same situation is judged by the ship navigation behavior record unit nbru the recording period of nbru starts from the moment when two ships encounter situation is first determined and ends when the encounter situation disappears five linguistic variables determined by ac are small angle left l1 large angle left l2 maintain course and speed m small angle right r1 large angle right r2 this paper uses the trapezoidal membership function to describe it so these five variables are defined as follows r 1 3 8 15 20 r 2 15 20 30 30 m 7 3 3 7 l 1 20 15 8 3 l 2 30 30 20 15 the fuzzy membership function is shown in fig 11 besides we set the linguistic variables of int are consistent with ac namely l1 l2 m r1 r2 4 2 2 fuzzy inference engine after determining the input variables a mamdani type if antecedent then consequent rule based system is developed which inference via min max norm fuzzy rule library is the core part of the fuzzy inference engine for any input fuzzy set a complete fuzzy inference system can find the corresponding fuzzy rules for inference which requires the fuzzy rule library to be complete at the same time whether the fuzzy rules are reasonable will directly affect the accuracy of the inference results therefore the establishment of the fuzzy rule library in this paper goes through the following three steps to ensure the accuracy of ship intention inference step 1 in section 3 this paper divides ship encounter situation into 16 types we consider that the colregs is one of the main foundations for the establishment of fuzzy rule library we assume that for any ship under current encounter situation before the evasive action is taken the oows on the bridge are rational that is their decision making is bound by colregs the rules considered in this paper have been described in section 2 3 what needs to be explained here is that according to the requirements of rule 16 and rule 17 the roles of stand on vessel and give way vessel are not always fixed under appropriate conditions such as inconsistent collision avoidance actions or deviation from the rules stand on vessel and give way vessel can be interchanged step 2 in addition to fully considering the colregs these fuzzy rules also incorporate expert navigation knowledge when the other ship under the same encounter situation takes an evasive action the colregs does not explain the actions own ship should take so it is particularly important to integrate expert navigation knowledge at this time for example when two ships are in the h2 situation if the other ship turns to the left side although this type of action violates the requirements of rule 14 in the colregs as a sensible ship officer own ship should also turn to the left side so as to coordinate with the other ship step 3 after the initial establishment of fuzzy rules library we feed it back to the captain and relevant experts in this field and make appropriate amendments based on their suggestions to ensure that the rules can be recognized by experts the dimension of fuzzy rule library is determined by es ul ac so the number of rules is 16 3 5 240 table 4 shows some of the rules all fuzzy rules are defined in appendix c each rule belongs to a single rule with multiple antecedents and the consequents is the navigation intentions of selected ship after building fuzzy rules library ship navigation inference is carried out according to the mamdani min max operator specifically suppose the current two ships encounter situation is e s let u l ˆ u l a c ˆ a c i n t ˆ i n t be fuzzy sets which based on domain x 0 1 y 90 90 z 90 90 the fuzzy logic among u l ˆ a c ˆ and i n t ˆ can be defined as e s r m x y z let μ denote the membership function then the fuzzy logic can be defined as 13 μ r m x y z μ u l ˆ x λ μ a c ˆ y λ μ i n t ˆ z then we can get inference consequents i n t 14 μ i n t z v μ u l x λ μ a c y λ μ u l ˆ x λ μ a c ˆ y λ μ i n t ˆ z after sorting as shown in the formula this formula expresses the whole inference logic based on mamdani 15 μ i n t z v μ u l x λ μ u l ˆ x λ v μ a c y λ μ a c ˆ y λ μ i n t ˆ z 4 2 3 defuzzification unit because the fuzzy membership functions of different linguistic variables will overlap the fuzzy inference system usually calls multiple fuzzy rules when inferring therefore it is very important to clarify the merged fuzzy set this paper uses the center of gravity method to achieve defuzzification this method can make full use of all the fuzzy information in the inference result the task of defuzzification is to determine an accurate value that best represents the fuzzy set however it is worth noting that although the defuzzification result is a certain angle it does not completely represent that the inferred ship will adopt the same maneuvering angle in the future this certain angle just describes the most possible actions that the inferred ship will take in the future 4 3 the general inference methodologys in section 4 1 the topology network of the current multi ship encounter situation is constructed and the inference element set δ n of any other ship under the scenario is defined for each pair of elements in δ n the inference result can be obtained according to the fundamental ship intention inference model illustrated in section 4 2 in this section we extend the inference between two ships to multi ship encounter situation the multi ship encounter situation has complex and changeable characteristics for any ship under current situation the composition and scale of the inference element set are often unlimited with randomness and uncertainty therefore if we continue to use fuzzy logic to infer ship navigation intention under the multi ship encounter situation it will make the construction of the fuzzy rule library very difficult in other words it is difficult for us to analyze all the multi ship encounter situations to exhaustively besides if the inference results of each element pair in the element set are simply superimposed this will make the inference results of opposite intentions cancel each other out and directly lead to the wrong inference results in fact the above problems are often encountered when fuzzy logic applies to multi ship encounter situation perera et al 2014 design the saf sequential action formulation module the principle is to convert the inference on a time slice into a continuous time slice that is to adjust the order of different inference results in terms of time however for the ship navigation intention inference people pay more attention to the ship navigation intention at the current moment so the saf based method is not suitable here now we define the question of ship navigation intention inference under multi ship encounter situation for any target ship t s m under the current multi ship encounter situation ξ 0 its inference element set is δ t s m let the fuzzy inference result be i n t t s k which corresponding to each inference element pair t s k e s k then we can get the inference result set φ t s m of t s m under current encounter situation 16 φ t s m i n t t s 1 i n t t s 2 i n t t s n therefore the final navigation intention result i n t t s m of t s m can be calculated from inference result set φ t s m it is generally believed that the actions of rational agents often follow the principle of maximum return that is priority is given to the individuals in φ t s m with great utility therefore the final output of the inference result in φ t s m under the multi ship scenario should be the reasonable decision element with the greatest return and the least cost that is take each inference result element i n t t s k as the main body to calculate the total cost τ of the remaining inference element set ω i n t o t h however using the method of traversing the calculation cost element by element will cause calculation redundancy and generate some unnecessary calculation processes therefore the general inference methodology is often divided into two steps step 1 merge the inference result set φ t s m to find the inference contradictory pair in this step according to the fuzzy membership of ac to perform re fuzzy operation on φ t s m and then construct five different action category sets according to the fuzzification results the general formula of the set is as follows 17 a c t s k μ k a c r 1 r 2 m l 1 l 2 in the above set t s k μ k indicates that the degree of t s k belonging to the set a c is μ k when there is no corresponding element in a c the set is now we can merge the action category set a c and the merge operation follows these two rules rule 1 set m is merged into other action category sets the corresponding interpretation of this rule is when the inferred target ship is both a stand on vessel and a give way vessel it should generally take avoidance actions in accordance with the obligation of give way vessel rule 2 for the action category sets with same direct r 1 merges in r 2 l 1 merges in l 2 the corresponding interpretation of this rule is for steering intentions of different amplitudes in the same direction a small angle steering is subject to a large steering according to the above two rules we can get the results of merging φ t s m there are two results after merging one is that only one action category set is retained and the other is that two action category sets are retained for the first type it can be directly used as the output of the system for each set its output follows the principle of maximization that is selecting navigation intention inference result i n t t s x max from φ t s m corresponding to the target ship t s x max with the greatest degree of membership among the retained elements of the set for the second type two remaining action category sets are contradictory pairs that is the corresponding intention inference results include the left and right directions respectively and the second step is required step 2 calculate the total cost caused by each party in the contradictory pair and select the optimal inference result in this paper we define that the total cost of each party in a contradictory pair is generated by the superposition of action categories in the opposite direction specifically for the inference result i n t t s p l which belongs to l 2 or l 1 the cost is generated by the elements in r 2 and r 1 on the contrary for the inference result i n t t s q r the cost is generated by the elements in l 2 and l 1 the cost value in this paper is determined by the loss function we consider that the loss function should be related to the following four factors 1 angle difference of fuzzy inference results 2 the collision risk between two ships according to m c r ξ 3 the responsibility division according to m e s ξ whether the inference target is a give way vessel or a stand on vessel 4 the degree of membership in the corresponding set the specific construction process of the loss function is given below angle difference is the main component which generates cost in the contradictory pair taking into account the actual navigation process at sea we set the maximum loss when the angle is completely opposite let i n t α be one of the inference results in the contradictory pair the inference result of t s λ which is located in the opposite direction action category set is i n t t s λ choosing i n t α as the final intention inference output will bring the loss to t s λ that can be approximated by a gaussian function the angle difference d i f f a n g l e is 18 d i f f a n g l e i n t α i n t t s λ d i f f a n g l e 30 30 the cost function is shown in formula 19 considering the maximum angle difference is 30 in order to enable the cost function to cover the data domain of the angle difference as much as possible we use the rules of three times standard deviation that is the ratio of 3 ε 3 ε containing 30 30 is 99 74 so we set ε 10 in this paper the figure function is shown in fig 12 a 19 f d i f f a n g l e e d i f f a n g l e 2 2 ε 2 in addition to the angle difference the collision risk between inference target and the other ships in the action category set and the result of the responsibility division will also affect the loss function namely factors 2 and 3 in fact if we do not consider the responsibility division of the inference target under current ship encounter situation then the loss of t s λ caused by the inference result i n t α is positively correlated with the collision risk between two ships however due to the different roles played by the inference target under ship encounter situation the rate of change of the relationship curve is also different we convert the influence of factors 2 and 3 on the loss function into the scale factor s f when the inference target is stand on vessel as the collision risk between two ships increases the growth rate of s f is also faster this is because when two ships are in the early stage of collision risk the stand on vessel should wait for the give way vessel to make evasive actions however as the collision risk grows stand on vessel is more likely to take evasive action which will influence s f when the inference target is a give way vessel the s f should be much higher than a stand on vessel at the initial moment c r 0 5 as the collision risk between two ships increases the growth rate of s f is slower this is because as the collision risk increases the probability of stand on vessel taking action gradually increases but no matter how the value of collision risk changes the s f when inference target is a give way vessel will always be higher than the s f when inference target is stand on vessel let the calculation function be g c r when inference target is a stand on vessel the inverse function h c r of g c r is the calculation function when inference target is a give way vessel as shown in formula 20 the function g c r and h c r are shown as the red and blue lines in fig 12 b respectively θ 2 20 g c r c r θ h c r c r θ 1 for factor 4 the degree of membership also reflects the degree of influence on the loss function we set the membership of t s λ in a action category a c being μ λ a c then for t s λ in this set the cost on t s λ generated by the contradictory intention inference result i n t α is 21 i n t α l o s s t s λ a c μ λ a c s f f d i f f a n g l e it can be seen that the total cost generated by i n t α is the superposition of the cost generated by each element t s k μ k which is in the set of action categories on the opposite side the total loss can be expressed as formula 22 22 g l o s s i n t α a c m k 1 n l o s s t s k a c among them m represents the number of non empty action category sets on the opposite side n represents the number of other ships existing in the current action category set therefore by comparing the total loss of these two contradictory intention inference results and choosing the result with the least cost as the final output in summary after step 1 and step 2 the general inference model is established the model proposed in this paper is expanded from two ships to a more common multi ship encounter situation 5 application of the proposed model case study in this section in order to further discuss and verify the correctness of the proposed model a simulation based experiment and a real scenario based experiment are conducted respectively both of these two cases are based on the electronic chart system ecs some necessary quantitative analysis is also included 5 1 the simulation based experiment in this part a four ship encounter situation is designed and we define it as ξ f two intention inference processes are carried out during this special multi ship encounter situation at the beginning the information of these four ships os ts 1 ts 2 ts 3 is listed in table 5 and the relative position of these ships are shown in fig 14 a 5 1 1 the first inference process we define the scenario at the initial moment as ξ f 1 and it consists of 4 1 4 ships the collision risk matrix m c r ξ f 1 and the updated global encounter situation matrix m e s ξ f 1 n e w are all symmetric matrices of 4 4 and the main diagonal elements are equal to 0 the calculation results of these two matrices are shown in formula 23 23 m c r ξ f 1 0 0 53 0 52 0 54 0 53 0 0 55 0 52 0 52 0 55 0 0 45 0 54 0 52 0 45 0 m e s ξ f 1 n e w 0 h 1 c 5 c 2 h 1 0 c 2 c 5 c 2 c 5 0 0 c 5 c 2 0 0 according to m c r ξ f 1 and m e s ξ f 1 n e w os is in danger of collision with other ships ts1 ts2 and ts3 and there is an encounter situation corresponding to each target ship therefore it is necessary to infer the navigation intentions of all three target ships at the initial moment based on the proposed ship intention inference model in section 4 the fuzzy sets of the input variables for each target ship under scenario ξ f 1 are shown in table 6 it can be found that there are three types of related es h1 c2 c5 in this scenario and the corresponding fuzzy logic rules which have been established are shown in fig 13 the rules activated in this scenario are shown in table 7 according to the information in tables 6 and 7 the fundamental navigation intention inference result for each inference target can be gained and shown in table 8 for all of these inference targets the individual inference results are all in the same direction so according to step 1 which is defined in section 4 3 the final navigation intention inference results for ts 1 ts 2 and ts 3 are all 11 5 we invite captains in our research group who have extensive navigation experience to conduct a plausibility assessment for the final inference results and the comments are summarized as follows for ts 1 it has head on and crossing encounter situation relative to os ts 2 and ts 3 respectively according to the colregs although ts 1 should keep course and speed relative to ts 3 as a stand on vessel it is necessary to alter her course to starboard so as to fulfill its obligations corresponding to os and ts 2 otherwise the amount of course changing should not be too large at the initial moment because os ts 2 and ts 3 also have their own responsibility for collision avoidance so the course changing of ts 1 also depends on the actions taken by other ships for ts 2 it has crossing encounter situation with os and ts 1 according to the model proposed in this paper although it is relatively far from ts 3 it has great potential to form a head on situation with ts 3 in the future therefore alter her course to starboard side is right and the amount of course changing should also be tentative the reason is the same as ts 1 for ts 3 considering the symmetry with ts 2 the plausibility assessment for ts 3 is almost the same as ts 2 the first inference process is simple and direct this is due to the fact that all ships related to the inference are keeping course and speed in addition at the beginning of the scenario the collision risk between ships just exceeded the set threshold 0 5 these two main reasons make the fuzzy sets have less overlap in order to further analysis and discuss these inference results we assume that all inference targets have taken actions corresponding to their inference results namely turning right 11 5 it is shown in fig 14 b this scenario is defined as ξ f 1 considering the main purpose for these target ships taking actions is collision avoidance the distance of other ships relative to the inferred ship is recorded and analyzed respectively we set the recording time step to 10 s comparison results between these two scenarios ξ f 1 and ξ f 1 are shown in fig 15 for ts 1 the distance relative to other ships before intention inference is shown in fig 15 a it can be seen that the distance between os and ts 1 will equal to zero at about the 53rd time step the relative distance after inference is shown in fig 15 b the distance relative to os has been significantly improved to 0 6 nm for ts 2 the distance relative to other ships before intention inference is shown in fig 15 c it can be seen that the distance relative to ts 3 will equal to almost zero at about the 81st time step the relative distance after inference is shown in fig 15 d the distance relative to ts 3 has been significantly improved to 1 4 nm for ts 3 the distance relative to other ships before intention inference is shown in fig 15 e the relative distance after inference is shown in fig 15 f however the distance relative to other ships after inference may become closer like ts 2 relative to ts 1 ts 2 and ts 3 relative to each other one of the reasons for explanation is because the first ship navigation intention inference process happened at the initial moment there are longer distance and lower collision risk between ships so the inference results are slight although the distance is reduced this is a transition from passing the bow to passing the stern which is more reasonable under current encounter situation 5 1 2 the second inference process the second inference process is the continuation of the first inference process we assume that ships under scenario ξ f do not take actions exactly as the first intention inference result in fact it is impossible for other ships to match the inference results generated by our model completely after several minutes we set the course of ts 2 changed from 090 to 063 and the course of ts 3 changed from 270 to 275 therefore considering that the other two target ships have already taken collision avoidance actions that they think are reasonable and effective it is necessary to infer the navigation intention of ts 1 according to the updated information we define this scenario at current moment as ξ f 2 and it consists these four same ships as shown in fig 16 a the collision risk matrix m c r ξ f 2 and the updated global encounter situation matrix m e s ξ f 2 n e w are shown in formula 24 24 m c r ξ f 2 0 0 68 0 61 0 65 0 68 0 0 53 0 61 0 61 0 53 0 0 46 0 65 0 61 0 46 0 m e s ξ f 2 n e w 0 h 1 c 5 c 2 h 1 0 c 2 c 5 c 2 c 5 0 0 c 5 c 2 0 0 according to m c r ξ f 2 and m e s ξ f 2 n e w ts 1 is in danger of collision with os ts 2 and ts 3 in order to infer the navigation intention of ts 1 the information included in double matrix needs to be transformed into fuzzy sets as shown in table 9 according to table 9 the activated rules are shown in table 10 and the surface figures of corresponding es are the same as fig 13 based on the above calculation process the fundamental inference results under scenario ξ f 2 can be found in table 11 the fundamental inference result set of ts 1 can be defined as the symbol φ ts 1 25 φ ts 1 22 3 os 7 4 ts 2 6 1 ts 3 there are contradictory pairs in φ ts 1 according to the general fuzzy inference method proposed in section 4 3 after step 1 we can get the merged contradictory pair shown as follows 26 i n t t s q r 22 3 os i n t t s p l 7 4 ts 2 then according to step 2 the cost generated by this contradictory should be calculated and the results are as follows 27 g l o s s 22 3 os 0 125 g l o s s 7 4 ts 2 0 462 the inference result 7 4 can cause more loss than the result 22 3 therefore the final navigation intention inference results for ts 1is 22 3 a plausibility assessment has also conducted by captains and the comments are summarized as follows for ts 1 it should be noticed that ts 2 and ts 3 have taken evasive actions based on their knowledge at current moment ts 1 and os are in head on situation so ts 1 should alter her course to starboard ts 1 and ts 3 are in crossing left encounter situation relative to ts 1 according to rule 17 c in the colregs and considering ts 3 have taken collision avoidance action ts 1 should not alter her course to port for ts 3 which is on her own port side ts 1 and ts 2 are in crossing right encounter situation relative to ts 1 so ts 1 should alter course to starboard unexpectedly ts 2 have altered her course to port it is not in line with good seamanship relative to all other ships if ts 1 turns to starboard side it will definitely reduce the passing distance with ts 2 however if ts 1 turns to port side it will against rules relative to all three other ships compared with turning right this will have worse consequences under actual circumstance ts 1 prefers to turn right and coordinate with ts 1 increasing the left turning angle and passing stern of ts 1 at the same time therefore the inference result 22 3 is reasonable in order to further analyze the inference result under scenario ξ f 2 we assume ts 1 have turned right 22 3 and define this scenario is ξ f 2 as shown in fig 16 b the distance of other ships relative to ts 1 is recorded and analyzed respectively fig 17 a shows the relative distance before taking inference result the relative distance after taking inference result is shown in fig 17 b according to the result if ts 1 still keeps course it will collide with os after ts 1 turned right 22 3 the passing distance relative to os and ts 3 have improved obviously although the passing distance with ts 2 has decreased namely 0 5 nm at the 40th timestep it can still ensure that ts 2 passes the stern of ts 1 in order to further guarantee safety the coordination by communication between ts 1 and ts 2 is necessary which is also stated in the plausibility assessment above 5 2 the real scenario based experiment 5 2 1 scenario description of the selected case in this part a real complex multi ship encounter situation which is on a typical route along the coast of china is selected to verity the model proposed in this paper the bohai sea is the northernmost inland sea in china and the most important outlet to the sea in northeast and north china there are two busy waterways from east to west and north to south among them the north south waterway connects dalian and shandong peninsula and the east west waterway is mainly for ships from the south to the beijing tianjin hebei region therefore the crossing area of the two waterways often creates more complicated ship encounter situations the multi ship encounter situation selected in this paper is in the intersection area and the entire environment background is shown in fig 18 the green dots represent all ais equipped ships in the sea at a certain moment the bottom left corner is the annual average heat map of the large bulk carrier trajectory in the bohai sea the author of this paper took the ro ro passenger ship shengsheng2 dalian to weihai on the evening of december 18th 2020 for sea experiments we recorded and collected typical multi ship encounter situations on the ship bridge a typical encounter scenario tes was recorded at around 0100 in the morning and the model proposed in this paper was used to conduct a detailed and in depth analysis we play back the tes on the electronic chart platform and the initial moment of tes is shown in fig 19 the tes contains a total of 7 ships the information of all ships at the initial moment is shown in table 12 shengsheng2 sails from dalian to weihai along the red route in fig 19 at the same time 3 and 4 are also ro ro passenger ships operating on the dalian weihai route 5 and 6 are oil tankers heading to tianjin xingang part of the ais information of 2 and 7 is missing and they are more likely to be fishing vessels for shengsheng2 in the tes since the ship is at the intersection of the north south and east west channels the current situation for shengsheng2 is more complicated intuitively shengsheng2 is not only in the process of ship encountering but there are also multiple ships ahead at the same time some of these ships may take actions in the future which will bring a high degree of uncertainty to this multi ship encounter situation in addition after the initial moment of tes in fig 19 5 adjusts its course from 267 to 252 due to its navigation plans in order to encounter 4 more safely 7 turns to the right side from course 080 to 097 it can be seen that the encounter situation ahead is more complicated and some ships have already taken actions therefore it is urgent to understand the current encounter situation and infer the navigation intention of the key ship 5 2 2 model calculation and inference process in section 5 2 1 we introduce the scenario information of the case to be analyzed in detail and expound the complexity of the environmental background in this section we will calculate the model according to the process shown in fig 6 in section 2 4 and make a detailed statement of the inference process first of all according to the ship encounter situation analysis model introduced in section 3 this current multi ship encounter situation is defined as ξ t e s this situation is centered on shengsheng2 own ship considering ships within a radius of 12 nautical miles so ξ t e s consists of 7 1 7 ships the collision risk matrix m c r ξ t e s the initial global encounter situation matrix m e s ξ t e s o l d and the updated global encounter situation matrix m e s ξ t e s n e w are all symmetric matrices of 7 7 and the main diagonal elements are all equal to 0 the calculation results of the above matrices are shown in formula 28 30 28 m c r ξ t e s 0 0 72 0 89 0 0 11 0 46 0 37 0 72 0 0 32 0 0 42 0 08 0 26 0 89 0 32 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 87 0 76 0 72 0 11 0 42 0 0 87 0 0 57 0 91 0 46 0 08 0

e w the non zero values in the updated global encounter situation matrix are concentrated in the upper left corner and the lower right corner respectively that is for the multi ship situation ξ t e s it can be divided into sub situation ξ t e s a composed of 1 2 3 and sub situation ξ t e s b composed of 4 5 6 7 os is currently in ξ t e s a the oow believes that os can pass 2 and 3 at a safe distance so os maintains her original course and speed according to m c r ξ t e s at this moment in addition to 2 and 3 os also has collision risk with 5 6 7 and the collision risk with 6 7 is greater it is worth noting that 7 has changed her course and the collision risk of 6 is close to the set threshold 0 5 therefore if we can infer the navigation intention of 6 in advance it will help os to safely pass the current complex multi ship encounter situation in order to infer the navigation intention of 6 first input the calculation result m c r ξ t e s and m e s ξ t e s n e w into the fuzzification unit and the results are shown in table 13 there are three types of related es c2 o7 h1 in this scenario and the corresponding fuzzy logic rules which have been established are shown in fig 20 the association rules to be used for inference are shown in table 14 according to the fuzzy inference system constructed in section 4 2 for the multi ship encounter situation ξ t e s b the inference input values and results of 6 relative to 4 5 and 7 are shown in table 15 so far we can get the navigation intention inference result set of 6 as φ 6 31 φ 6 23 5 4 7 5 10 1 7 according to the general fuzzy inference method proposed in section 4 3 in order to get the final navigation intention inference result i n t 6 of 6 under scenario ξ t e s b it needs to execute step 1 and step 2 for φ 6 first of all the two action category sets contradictory pairs that can be retained by grouping φ 6 are as follows 32 i n t t s q r 23 5 4 i n t t s p l 7 5 according to rule 2 the step 2should be continued when there is a contradiction during the inference process that is to calculate the sum of the cost caused by the contradiction to each party the calculation results are as follows 33 g l o s s 23 5 4 0 096 g l o s s 7 5 0 225 we select the inference result with minimum cost so the final navigation intention inference result i n t 6 of 6 under situation ξ t e s b is to turn right 23 5 we assume that the inference target takes action according to the inference result and this scenario is defined as ξ t e s the distance of ship 6 relative to other ships is also recorded as shown in fig 21 fig 21 a shows the relative distance before taking inference result the relative distance after taking inference result is shown in fig 21 b it can be found that if 6 takes action the distance relative to 5 will continue to increase although the passing distance relative to 4 has not increased significantly 6 will pass the stern of 4 instead of the bow which is generally considered to be in line with good seamanship the distance relative to 1 os will decrease a lot but 1 and 6 are far apart at the moment of intention inference it means that there is still enough room for both ships taking the next collision avoidance actions in fact after a period of time 6 dose turn to the right side and its course changed from 265 to 320 as shown in fig 22 a this proves the correctness of the model designed in this paper what needs to be explained here is the dcpa value between os and 6 is closed to 0 the second officer on duty noticed this situation in advance he believed that 6 took the action to turn right to avoid 4 and after passing the stern of 4 6 will return to the original route therefore the second officer did not take any related evasive actions after a while as the second officer said the course of 6 changed from 320 to 270 as shown in fig 22 b it also shows that model in this paper can adaptively understand complex multi ship encounter situation this model can not only infer the navigation intention of the selected target ship such as inferring 6 turning the rudder to the right but also clarify the specific reasons for the future navigation intention of the selected target ship for example the reason why 6 turns to the right is that she is in a sub situation ξ t e s b composed of 4 5 and 7 6 discussions 6 1 discussion on the performance and limitations of the proposed model maritime transportation safety is one of the primary factors considered by the researchers in the maritime filed reasonable and effective ship navigation intention inference is an important prerequisite to ensure the safety of ship navigation especially considering that autonomous ships and other marine intelligent transportation system have become an active research area in recent years so we hope the model proposed in this paper can be further used in these intelligent systems in the future as stated in section 5 two experiments including both simulation and real scenario have been conducted both the quantitative and theoretical analysis have been carried out so as to prove the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model for the simulation based experiment a four ship encounter situation was designed and it contains two intention inference processes the main difference between these two inferences is that two of other target ships have already taken different actions in the second scenario certainly it will increase the difficulty of inference for the real scenario based experiment which is more vivid and realistic the inference result and real actions are compared with each other although both results are large and starboard side angle the amplitude of the angle generated by the inference model is smaller than the real action this points further shows that the navigation intentions of other ships are actually difficult to grasp closely because of its ambiguity and uncertainty therefore the exact angles generated by our model can be regarded as a reference value or an approximate expression to describe navigation intention based on this consideration the linguistic variables of int which are introduced in section 4 2 1 can be used to qualitative represent ship navigation intention in addition we assume that the loss value of each element in the contradictory pairs can be used to reflect the degree of distrust of the corresponding inference result distrust means the degree to which this inference result is disturbed we define that it is equal to the ratio of single loss and the total loss of the contradictory pair based on the above discussion these exact angles obtained by our model in section 5 can be transformed into semantic description which are shown in table 16 precise navigation intention inference for other ships under the common scenario is a difficult research topic and it needs to be solved gradually nevertheless compared with other research work which is related with ship intention inference in recent years the model proposed in this paper has its own advantages firstly some intention inference model cho et al 2021 only can cope with simple ship encounter situation including two ships our model can deal with multi ship encounter situation namely the complex situation it is benefit from the double matrix and its automatic update logic which can observe and understand other ships from the overall perspective secondly compared with du et al 2020 which roughly divide the intention of give way ships into two categories evasive action and normal navigation the inference results generated by our model are exact angles although these angles do not completely match the real actions we expect them can better express the navigation intention of other ships thirdly compared to these prediction and inference processes which are entirely based on mathematical models wang et al 2020 cho et al 2021 our inference model which based on fuzzy logic can incorporate expert knowledge and navigation experience it makes the model more flexible and human like although the analysis in previous section and the above discussions show active aspect of our model it still has some limitations and defects firstly the intention inference results generated by the model is only for the current moment as time passing by the inference result at different moments may change which will have a potential impact secondly the intention inference result is an exact angle which will almost always deviate from the real actions it may interfere with the oow s judgement thirdly the model in this paper is designed with more consideration of the complex multi ship encounter situation at open water the antecedent of the 240 fuzzy inference rules designed is only related to the collision risk the encounter situation and the actions of other ships for other marine environments such as narrow waters fishing areas anchoring areas port entry and traffic separation zones etc have their own characteristics target ship s navigation intentions will also be affected by many other factors such as shallow waters traffic control etc 6 2 future work and prospect considering these limitations listed in section 6 1 the future work contains some targeted improvements for the first limitation we plan to transform the inference at current moment into a certain period of time which will extend the effective time of intention inference for the second limitation we plan to change the form of inference results from accurate angle to intention probability distribution for the third limitation we plan to add more sub inference models into our current model like the work in wu et al 2020 we expect that the above discussion can further improve our model so as to apply under real conditions the object of the ship navigation intention inference model is to find and calculate other ships intention under the same multi ship encounter situation so as to assist oow or some intelligent machines to make navigation decisions which will further improve the safety of ship navigation however it should be noted that ship intention inference is just one method which is used to get other ships intention in fact under traditional circumstances in order to get other ships intention the oows usually rely on the communication through mutual coordination by vhf very high frequency to clarify each other s navigation intention and plan their next action and this type of method is simple effective and reliable for unmanned ships there is a lack of human participation in the bridge which makes the communication between ships becomes more difficult considering the long term coexistence of unmanned ships and manned ships at sea how to realize the communication between humans and intelligent agents will be a novel research field drawing on the precedents of reliable human computer interaction in other fields speech recognition and natural language processing are one of the potential solutions however due to the disadvantages of voice interaction of international navigating ships such as different languages different accents and excessive noise of maritime communication the feasibility of such a scheme remains to be discussed therefore for the new format of human computer interaction between unmanned and manned ships in the future it is particularly important to find a novel information interaction mechanism in addition whether it is to infer navigation intention of the target ship or to establish a reliable information interaction mechanism between autonomous ship and typical ship the future navigation dynamics of the target ship at sea still have a high degree of uncertainty unexpected uncoordinated actions can cause serious consequences in addition to realizing cognition and understanding of most normal situations it is also necessary to consider the extreme uncoordinated situations that may occur this will also be the next interesting research topic 7 conclusions in this paper in order to further improve the safety of ship navigation and support the intelligent navigation decision making for autonomous ship a novel ship navigation intention inference model is introduced which includes two parts the ship encounter situation analysis model and the ship intention inference model the input of the intention inference model is exactly the output of the encounter situation analysis model a simulation based experiment and a real scenario based experiment are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of this model the capability of multi ship encounter situation understanding is one of the essential elements for the next generation of intelligent autonomous ships besides if the decision making center can infer and grasp other ship s intention in advance it will help a lot for own ship to make more quality navigation decisions like collision avoidance actions or course keeping maneuvering however there are still some issues need to be solved in the future especially the uncertainty in simply predicting and inferring other ship s intention in the next research step the autonomous interaction between ships is a new topic which is waiting to be researched and well solved credit authorship contribution statement shaobo wang conceptualization methodology software

20302,the primary barrier of a liquefied natural gas lng carrier generally has a corrugated shape so as to withstand thermal shrinkage at cryogenic temperatures over the years studies have been actively performed to improve the performance of the primary barrier through structural analysis however when analyzing the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation previous studies have not considered the residual stress generated during the forming process of the corrugation this can lead to an overestimation of the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation in this work the pressure resisting capabilities of the corrugation were evaluated by considering the residual stress generated during the deep drawing process of the corrugation the initial buckling mode was also considered through a linear buckle analysis based on a finite element analysis universal hydraulic test equipment was developed for measuring the pressure resisting capabilities of corrugations of various sizes by comparing the analytical results from the experiments it was confirmed that the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation decreased by 16 when the residual stress and initial buckling mode were considered simultaneously we believe that this study can be used as a reference to present guidelines when setting design parameters to improve the pressure resisting capability of a primary barrier keywords corrugation forming process buckling mode residual stress pressure resisting capability 1 introduction with the exhaustion of fossil fuels such as petroleum and coal and growing interest in eco friendly energy sources the use of natural gas with its low co2 emissions and high efficiency is increasing when natural gas is liquefied the costs for the transport and storage of the natural gas can be reduced as the volume of liquefied natural gas lng is reduced by 600 times relative to the gaseous state however because natural gas has a boiling temperature of 162 c under atmospheric pressure a cryogenic containment system ccs is required to maintain an environment below the boiling temperature to transport the lng cryogenic membrane tank systems have been widely used for lng ccss owing to their high capacity reliability and efficiency ishimaru et al 2004 as shown in fig 1 the structure of a membrane type ccs consists of two barriers primary and secondary barriers for preventing lng leakage and maintaining a cryogenic temperature of 163 c the primary barrier generally made of 1 2 mm stainless steel sus 304 l has a corrugated shape for reducing the thermal shrinkage at cryogenic temperatures as it is in direct contact with the lng choe et al 2014 choi and yu 2013 chun et al 2009 lee et al 2014 when pitching or yawing of an lng ship occurs the corrugation can buckle and collapse from the sloshing and cavitation ultimately making it impossible to maintain the cryogenic conditions owing to the leakage of the lng kim and yoon 2012 recently studies have been conducted on the buckling and collapse of corrugation by simulating sloshing impacts and hydraulic pressures lee et al analyzed the vibration and impact characteristics of a corrugation membrane by simulating sloshing and cavitation impacts using a drop weight impact test method lee et al 2014 kim et al developed impact test equipment for analyzing the impact behaviors of corrugation and the relationship between the reaction force displacement and reaction energy according to the impact kim et al 2019a in addition the failure mode was analyzed numerically and experimentally according to the size of the corrugation and the failure phenomenon of the corrugation was predicted kim et al 2019b however there is a limit to the analytical implementation of the complex physical phenomena of various variables such as vessel size speed and wave frequency and it is difficult to verify these phenomena experimentally malenica et al 2017 paik et al 2011 therefore most studies on the performance of corrugation have mainly focused on evaluating the pressure resisting capability of corrugation based on a static hydraulic pressure instead of an impact load lee et al developed an experimental device that used a rubber bag to simulate hydraulic pressures in lng ccss and evaluated the pressure resisting capability of a corrugation kim and yoon 2011 however the experimental device had difficulty transferring the uniform hydraulic pressure to the corrugation owing to the non uniform contact between the rubber bag and corrugation part in addition separate rubber bags and experimental devices would be required whenever the size of the corrugation changes as a corrugation has a complex shape residual stress is generated during the forming process which deteriorates the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation james 2011 totten 2002 however to the best of our knowledge this residual stress has not been considered when analyzing the pressure resisting capabilities of corrugation in addition as the large deformation of the corrugation caused by buckling is affected by the buckling mode according to the shape of the corrugation an analysis of the buckling mode is essential for evaluating the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation bathe 2006 bushnell 1985 degenhardt et al 2001 ravn jensen and tvergaard 1990 teng and rotter 2006 xue and fatt 2002 ziemian 2010 in this study the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation was evaluated using a finite element analysis a pre process for estimating the residual stress was performed before measuring the pressure resisting capability and the buckling mode was analyzed to consider the large deformation of the corrugation a novel experimental device for applying uniform pressure to the corrugation and measuring the pressure resisting capabilities of various types of the corrugation without modification with additional parts was developed to verify the finite element analysis results subsequently the influence of the corrugation shape and residual stress on the cryogenic temperature was analyzed 2 finite element analysis model for pressure resisting capability of corrugation in this study the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation of a primary barrier was analyzed using finite element analysis abaqus v14 3 dassault france a metal sheet with a thickness of 1 2 mm sus 304 l was modeled with a four node element cpe4r and the mechanical properties obtained from a previous study were used as shown in table 1 paik et al 2011 veritas 2006 in addition the structural non linearity was considered to analyze the buckling of the corrugation the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation was analyzed based on five steps from the forming process to the hydraulic pressure test to consider the effect of the residual stress generated in the forming process and initial buckling mode and the modeling and boundary conditions bcs for each step is shown in fig 2 step 1 comprised describing the deep drawing process used to fabricate the corrugation two holders a die and a punch for fabricating the corrugation were modeled as rigid bodies a metal sheet was placed between the holder and die to fix it and the punch was translated in the positive y direction to implement a deep drawing process in step 2 the springback of the deep drawn sheet after a part removing process was analyzed the displacements of two holders and a punch were constrained and the die was translated in the positive y direction to implement part removing process in step 3 the stress change from fixing the elastically restored metal sheet to the universal hydraulic test equipment was analyzed a substrate and two upper molds were modeled as rigid bodies the displacement of the substrate was constrained and the upper mold was applied to the negative y direction to fix the metal sheet in step 4 the initial buckling mode of the corrugation was analyzed through a linear buckling analysis the displacement of the both ends of the metal sheet was fixed and a 1 mpa of unit pressure was applied to the upper surface of metal sheet in step 5 the pressure resisting capability was analyzed by applying the residual stress obtained from step 3 and a scale factor 0 2 representing the geometric imperfection from step 4 to the corrugation degenhardt et al 2001 teng and rotter 2006 the same contact conditions and the displacement bcs as in step 4 were applied between the parts the friction coefficients between the parts are summarized in table 2 kim and yoon 2011 zein et al 2014 after verifying the finite element analysis model by comparing the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation at room temperature with the experimental results the pressure resisting capability at cryogenic temperature was predicted using the same analysis technique to analyze the thermal shrinkage at cryogenic temperature according to the type of corrugation the displacement of the flat part of the metal sheet was fixed in the y direction and a symmetric bc condition was applied to both ends of the metal sheet based on these conditions the initial buckling mode and residual stress were analyzed at the cryogenic temperature subsequently the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation was determined before the analyses the mesh sensitivity of the metal sheet was checked in step 1 the finite element models with varying number of elements were analyzed to find out proper mesh size in terms of mesh convergence and calculating efficiency regarding computation time cpu as shown in fig 3 a the mesh of the corrugated part was modeled more densely compared to that of the flat part in consideration of the calculation efficiency as most of the large deformation occurs in the corrugated part the numerical analysis results of step 1 with respect to the number of elements were shown in fig 3 b and c and summarized in table 3 based on the results case 5 and case 5 5 were selected for the mesh models of the corrugation part and the flat part respectively 3 experiments 3 1 preparation of the universal hydraulic test equipment a universal hydraulic test equipment was designed to overcome the limitations of the previous hydrostatic test equipment kim and yoon 2011 such as formation of non uniform pressurization and compatibility issue with corrugation geometries as shown in fig 4 applying hydraulic pressure to the space between the aluminum housing and specimen without using the conventional rubber bag not only solved the problem of the uneven pressure transfer occurring in the rubber bag but also allowed for measuring the pressure resisting capability regardless of the corrugation size bottom and side gaskets made of nitrile butadiene rubber with oil resistance and high compression force were placed at the locations where oil leakage could occur shen et al 2016 the length of the specimen was 2 mm longer than that of the aluminum housing to prevent oil leakage i e by pressing the side gasket at both ends of the specimen when fastened to the universal hydraulic test equipment because this assembly method suppressed the deformation of both ends of the specimen it could have an effect similar to the actual behavior of the corrugation part adjacent to the knot area of the primary barrier with high structural rigidity 3 2 experimental procedure two types of stainless steel membrane specimens sus304l with the dimensions shown in fig 5 were prepared from the two types of primary barriers with different dimensions of the corrugation area used in the actual lng ccs aiming to evaluate the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation using the universal hydraulic test equipment as the deformation of the specimen owing to hydraulic pressure mainly occurs in the corrugation part rather than in the flat part 12 holes were made in the flat part and bolted to fix it to the universal hydraulic test equipment before measuring the pressure resistance of the specimen the residual stress at the top of the corrugation generated in the forming step was measured using a residual stress analyzer μ x360s pulstec japan a specimen was placed on a flat plat without fixation to minimize the effect of external forces on the specimen the positioning of the x ray diffraction was performed precisely by the automated multi axis positioning platform for repeatability this setup allows for fast measurement of surface residual stress through the cosα method fig 6 shows the procedure for measuring the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation first the specimen was fixed to the aluminum housing with the bottom gasket and then the one sided mold was fastened to the housing with the side gasket the other side of the mold was fastened to the housing with the side gasket after filling the space between the specimen and aluminum housing with oil the hydraulic pressure was applied to the specimen by supplying additional oil through the oil inlet using a hydraulic pump and the pressure was indicated on a pressure gauge attached to the hydraulic pump after confirming that the pressure applied to the specimen reached a specific value and was maintained for 10 s the specimen was removed from the test equipment subsequently the deformed shape of the corrugation was measured using a 3d coordinate scanning measuring machine lmi r3x lmi tech canada 4 results and discussion 4 1 pressure resisting capability calculated by finite element analyses fig 7 shows the residual stress generated in the metal sheet from steps 1 to 3 of the finite element analysis it can be confirmed that the residual stress occurs in the corrugation rather than in the flat part and that the overall residual stress in step 2 decreases when compared to that in step 1 owing to the elastic recovery the average residual stress in the hoop direction 46 mpa at the top of the corrugation in step 2 is close to the measured residual stress in the hoop direction 34 mpa in the actual corrugation in the process of assembling the corrugated specimen to the universal hydraulic test equipment in step 3 the residual stress increases at the lower curvature of the corrugation part fig 8 shows the linear buckling mode of the specimens in step 4 and the deformed shape of the specimens according to the hydraulic pressure in step 5 as shown in fig 8 a and b specimens a and b show different buckling modes namely asymmetric and symmetric modes respectively resulting from the differences in the geometric shapes and curvatures of the corrugation specimen a is permanently deformed at a hydraulic pressure of 23 bar and excessive asymmetric deformation owing to buckling occurs at 27 bar as shown in fig 8 c in the case of specimen b plastic deformation occurs at 11 bar and excessive symmetric deformation occurs at 13 bar by buckling as shown in fig 8 d in both specimens excessive deformation owing to buckling occurs when the curvature of the sidewall of the corrugation part becomes zero therefore this pressure is defined as the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation lee et al 2013 it can be determined that the pressure resisting capability is 25 27 bar for specimen a and 11 13 bar for specimen b to analyze the effect of initial analysis conditions such as the residual stress and buckling mode on the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation the deformed shapes of the specimens with respect to the initial conditions are compared when the pressure corresponding to the pressure resisting capability of each specimen is applied excessive deformation does not occur in any specimen when one or both conditions are not considered as shown in fig 9 a and b table 4 summarizes the deformation ratios obtained by dividing the maximum deformation occurring near the inflection point of the corrugation when one or both conditions are not considered by the maximum deformation occurring at the same point when all initial conditions are considered it can be seen that both specimens a and b show small deformation ratios when neither condition is considered or when only one is considered this means that when both conditions are considered the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation is drastically reduced to check the pressure resisting capability for the non condition the deformations of the specimens under varying pressure are obtained as shown in fig 9 c and d in the case of specimen a plastic deformation occurs at 27 bar and excessive symmetric deformation owing to buckling occurs at 31 bar specimen b shows plastic deformation at 13 bar and reaches an excessive symmetric deformation by buckling at 15 bar accordingly the pressure resisting capabilities of specimens a and b without condition are estimated to be 29 31 bar and 13 15 bar respectively i e higher than those of the specimen under both conditions based on these results it is found that the deformed shape of the corrugation depends on whether the buckling mode is considered and that the onset of excessive deformation is influenced by the residual stress 4 2 hydraulic test of corrugation fig 10 shows that the deformed shape of corrugation with respect to applying pressure by using the universal hydraulic test equipment as shown in fig 10 specimen a is permanently deformed at 23 bar and excessive asymmetric deformation occurs at 27 bar owing to buckling of one side wall specimen b shows plastic deformation at 11 bar and reaches excessive symmetric deformation owing to the buckling of both side walls over 13 bar therefore it is confirmed that the pressure resisting capabilities of specimens a and b are 25 27 bar and 11 13 bar respectively i e the same as the results from the finite element analysis another noteworthy experimental result in terms of deformed shape is that the asymmetric deformation of specimen a and symmetric deformation of specimen b are consistent with the finite element analysis result of the linear buckling mode in step 4 from these results it is confirmed that the universal hydraulic test equipment developed in this study was appropriate for measuring the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation and buckling mode and that the residual stress generated during the metal forming process should be considered simultaneously to accurately analyze the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation 4 3 finite element analysis according to steps in cryogenic environment fig 11 shows the thermal shrinkage and resulting residual stresses of the corrugation specimens at cryogenic temperatures 163 c as shown in fig 11 a the height of specimen a decreases by 2 7 and the width at the inflection point of curvature increases by 2 4 relative to those at room temperature specimen b which has a higher aspect ratio than specimen a has a 1 1 decrease in height and 0 9 increase in width relative to the dimensions at room temperature as shown in fig 11 b the difference in the magnitude of thermal shrinkage is considered to be owing to the differences in the aspect ratio and curvature between the specimens with respect to the residual stress of the specimens at cryogenic temperatures sharp increases in the vicinity of the inflection point of curvature are noticeable in both specimens as shown in fig 11 c and d in addition substantial thermal stress occurs in the flat parts of the specimens and can affect the reliability of the welded joints of the primary barrier at cryogenic temperatures however the stress level at the end of the specimens with corrugation 200 mpa decreases by 20 relative to that of the specimen without corrugation 240 mpa indicating that the thermal stress shrinkage of the metal sheet induced on the flat part is effectively released by the corrugation fig 12 shows the buckling modes and deformation of the specimens under varying pressures at cryogenic temperatures as shown in fig 12 a and b the buckling modes of the specimens are the same as those at room temperature under the pressure in which excessive permanent deformation occurs at room temperature small deformations occur in both specimens at cryogenic temperatures although the residual stress increases further as shown in fig 12 c and d consequently the pressure resisting capabilities of both specimens at cryogenic temperatures are increased by approximately 15 relative to those at room temperature this is associated with the increase in yield strength at cryogenic temperatures as shown in table 1 5 conclusion in this study the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation of a primary barrier was analyzed by considering the forming process and operating conditions at cryogenic temperatures through finite element analysis and then was verified by performing experiments using universal hydraulic test equipment the results obtained from the proposed model and the universal hydraulic test equipment are as follows 1 the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation decreased significantly in both specimens when the residual stress and buckling mode were considered simultaneously 2 from the comparison between the analytical results and experimental results regarding the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation the reliability of the proposed analytical model and universal hydraulic test equipment were verified 3 the pressure resisting capabilities of both specimens at cryogenic temperatures increased by approximately 15 relative to those at room temperature this was associated with the increase in yield strength at cryogenic temperatures we believe that the proposed analytical model considering the residual stress and buckling mode can present a guideline for assisting in the setting of design parameters to improve the pressure resisting capabilities of the corrugation parts in primary barriers credit authorship

analysis results subsequently the influence of the corrugation shape and residual stress on the cryogenic temperature was analyzed 2 finite element analysis model for pressure resisting capability of corrugation in this study the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation of a primary barrier was analyzed using finite element analysis abaqus v14 3 dassault france a metal sheet with a thickness of 1 2 mm sus 304 l was modeled with a four node element cpe4r and the mechanical properties obtained from a previous study were used as shown in table 1 paik et al 2011 veritas 2006 in addition the structural non linearity was considered to analyze the buckling of the corrugation the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation was analyzed based on five steps from the forming process to the hydraulic pressure test to consider the effect of the residual stress generated in the forming process and initial buckling mode and the modeling and boundary conditions bcs for each step is shown in fig 2 step 1 comprised describing the deep drawing process used to fabricate the corrugation two holders a die and a punch for fabricating the corrugation were modeled as rigid bodies a metal sheet was placed between the holder and die to fix it and the punch was translated in the positive y direction to implement a deep drawing process in step 2 the springback of the deep drawn sheet after a part removing process was analyzed the displacements of two holders and a punch were constrained and the die was translated in the positive y direction to implement part removing process in step 3 the stress change from fixing the elastically restored metal sheet to the universal hydraulic test equipment was analyzed a substrate and two upper molds were modeled as rigid bodies the displacement of the substrate was constrained and the upper mold was applied to the negative y direction to fix the metal sheet in step 4 the initial buckling mode of the corrugation was analyzed through a linear buckling analysis the displacement of the both ends of the metal sheet was fixed and a 1 mpa of unit pressure was applied to the upper surface of metal sheet in step 5 the pressure resisting capability was analyzed by applying the residual stress obtained from step 3 and a scale factor 0 2 representing the geometric imperfection from step 4 to the corrugation degenhardt et al 2001 teng and rotter 2006 the same contact conditions and the displacement bcs as in step 4 were applied between the parts the friction coefficients between the parts are summarized in table 2 kim and yoon 2011 zein et al 2014 after verifying the finite element analysis model by comparing the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation at room temperature with the experimental results the pressure resisting capability at cryogenic temperature was predicted using the same analysis technique to analyze the thermal shrinkage at cryogenic temperature according to the type of corrugation the displacement of the flat part of the metal sheet was fixed in the y direction and a symmetric bc condition was applied to both ends of the metal sheet based on these conditions the initial buckling mode and residual stress were analyzed at the cryogenic temperature subsequently the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation was determined before the analyses the mesh sensitivity of the metal sheet was checked in step 1 the finite element models with varying number of elements were analyzed to find out proper mesh size in terms of mesh convergence and calculating efficiency regarding computation time cpu as shown in fig 3 a the mesh of the corrugated part was modeled more densely compared to that of the flat part in consideration of the calculation efficiency as most of the large deformation occurs in the corrugated part the numerical analysis results of step 1 with respect to the number of elements were shown in fig 3 b and c and summarized in table 3 based on the results case 5 and case 5 5 were selected for the mesh models of the corrugation part and the flat part respectively 3 experiments 3 1 preparation of the universal hydraulic test equipment a universal hydraulic test equipment was designed to overcome the limitations of the previous hydrostatic test equipment kim and yoon 2011 such as formation of non uniform pressurization and compatibility issue with corrugation geometries as shown in fig 4 applying hydraulic pressure to the space between the aluminum housing and specimen without using the conventional rubber bag not only solved the problem of the uneven pressure transfer occurring in the rubber bag but also allowed for measuring the pressure resisting capability regardless of the corrugation size bottom and side gaskets made of nitrile butadiene rubber with oil resistance and high compression force were placed at the locations where oil leakage could occur shen et al 2016 the length of the specimen was 2 mm longer than that of the aluminum housing to prevent oil leakage i e by pressing the side gasket at both ends of the specimen when fastened to the universal hydraulic test equipment because this assembly method suppressed the deformation of both ends of the specimen it could have an effect similar to the actual behavior of the corrugation part adjacent to the knot area of the primary barrier with high structural rigidity 3 2 experimental procedure two types of stainless steel membrane specimens sus304l with the dimensions shown in fig 5 were prepared from the two types of primary barriers with different dimensions of the corrugation area used in the actual lng ccs aiming to evaluate the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation using the universal hydraulic test equipment as the deformation of the specimen owing to hydraulic pressure mainly occurs in the corrugation part rather than in the flat part 12 holes were made in the flat part and bolted to fix it to the universal hydraulic test equipment before measuring the pressure resistance of the specimen the residual stress at the top of the corrugation generated in the forming step was measured using a residual stress analyzer μ x360s pulstec japan a specimen was placed on a flat plat without fixation to minimize the effect of external forces on the specimen the positioning of the x ray diffraction was performed precisely by the automated multi axis positioning platform for repeatability this setup allows for fast measurement of surface residual stress through the cosα method fig 6 shows the procedure for measuring the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation first the specimen was fixed to the aluminum housing with the bottom gasket and then the one sided mold was fastened to the housing with the side gasket the other side of the mold was fastened to the housing with the side gasket after filling the space between the specimen and aluminum housing with oil the hydraulic pressure was applied to the specimen by supplying additional oil through the oil inlet using a hydraulic pump and the pressure was indicated on a pressure gauge attached to the hydraulic pump after confirming that the pressure applied to the specimen reached a specific value and was maintained for 10 s the specimen was removed from the test equipment subsequently the deformed shape of the corrugation was measured using a 3d coordinate scanning measuring machine lmi r3x lmi tech canada 4 results and discussion 4 1 pressure resisting capability calculated by finite element analyses fig 7 shows the residual stress generated in the metal sheet from steps 1 to 3 of the finite element analysis it can be confirmed that the residual stress occurs in the corrugation rather than in the flat part and that the overall residual stress in step 2 decreases when compared to that in step 1 owing to the elastic recovery the average residual stress in the hoop direction 46 mpa at the top of the corrugation in step 2 is close to the measured residual stress in the hoop direction 34 mpa in the actual corrugation in the process of assembling the corrugated specimen to the universal hydraulic test equipment in step 3 the residual stress increases at the lower curvature of the corrugation part fig 8 shows the linear buckling mode of the specimens in step 4 and the deformed shape of the specimens according to the hydraulic pressure in step 5 as shown in fig 8 a and b specimens a and b show different buckling modes namely asymmetric and symmetric modes respectively resulting from the differences in the geometric shapes and curvatures of the corrugation specimen a is permanently deformed at a hydraulic pressure of 23 bar and excessive asymmetric deformation owing to buckling occurs at 27 bar as shown in fig 8 c in the case of specimen b plastic deformation occurs at 11 bar and excessive symmetric deformation occurs at 13 bar by buckling as shown in fig 8 d in both specimens excessive deformation owing to buckling occurs when the curvature of the sidewall of the corrugation part becomes zero therefore this pressure is defined as the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation lee et al 2013 it can be determined that the pressure resisting capability is 25 27 bar for specimen a and 11 13 bar for specimen b to analyze the effect of initial analysis conditions such as the residual stress and buckling mode on the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation the deformed shapes of the specimens with respect to the initial conditions are compared when the pressure corresponding to the pressure resisting capability of each specimen is applied excessive deformation does not occur in any specimen when one or both conditions are not considered as shown in fig 9 a and b table 4 summarizes the deformation ratios obtained by dividing the maximum deformation occurring near the inflection point of the corrugation when one or both conditions are not considered by the maximum deformation occurring at the same point when all initial conditions are considered it can be seen that both specimens a and b show small deformation ratios when neither condition is considered or when only one is considered this means that when both conditions are considered the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation is drastically reduced to check the pressure resisting capability for the non condition the deformations of the specimens under varying pressure are obtained as shown in fig 9 c and d in the case of specimen a plastic deformation occurs at 27 bar and excessive symmetric deformation owing to buckling occurs at 31 bar specimen b shows plastic deformation at 13 bar and reaches an excessive symmetric deformation by buckling at 15 bar accordingly the pressure resisting capabilities of specimens a and b without condition are estimated to be 29 31 bar and 13 15 bar respectively i e higher than those of the specimen under both conditions based on these results it is found that the deformed shape of the corrugation depends on whether the buckling mode is considered and that the onset of excessive deformation is influenced by the residual stress 4 2 hydraulic test of corrugation fig 10 shows that the deformed shape of corrugation with respect to applying pressure by using the universal hydraulic test equipment as shown in fig 10 specimen a is permanently deformed at 23 bar and excessive asymmetric deformation occurs at 27 bar owing to buckling of one side wall specimen b shows plastic deformation at 11 bar and reaches excessive symmetric deformation owing to the buckling of both side walls over 13 bar therefore it is confirmed that the pressure resisting capabilities of specimens a and b are 25 27 bar and 11 13 bar respectively i e the same as the results from the finite element analysis another noteworthy experimental result in terms of deformed shape is that the asymmetric deformation of specimen a and symmetric deformation of specimen b are consistent with the finite element analysis result of the linear buckling mode in step 4 from these results it is confirmed that the universal hydraulic test equipment developed in this study was appropriate for measuring the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation and buckling mode and that the residual stress generated during the metal forming process should be considered simultaneously to accurately analyze the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation 4 3 finite element analysis according to steps in cryogenic environment fig 11 shows the thermal shrinkage and resulting residual stresses of the corrugation specimens at cryogenic temperatures 163 c as shown in fig 11 a the height of specimen a decreases by 2 7 and the width at the inflection point of curvature increases by 2 4 relative to those at room temperature specimen b which has a higher aspect ratio than specimen a has a 1 1 decrease in height and 0 9 increase in width relative to the dimensions at room temperature as shown in fig 11 b the difference in the magnitude of thermal shrinkage is considered to be owing to the differences in the aspect ratio and curvature between the specimens with respect to the residual stress of the specimens at cryogenic temperatures sharp increases in the vicinity of the inflection point of curvature are noticeable in both specimens as shown in fig 11 c and d in addition substantial thermal stress occurs in the flat parts of the specimens and can affect the reliability of the welded joints of the primary barrier at cryogenic temperatures however the stress level at the end of the specimens with corrugation 200 mpa decreases by 20 relative to that of the specimen without corrugation 240 mpa indicating that the thermal stress shrinkage of the metal sheet induced on the flat part is effectively released by the corrugation fig 12 shows the buckling modes and deformation of the specimens under varying pressures at cryogenic temperatures as shown in fig 12 a and b the buckling modes of the specimens are the same as those at room temperature under the pressure in which excessive permanent deformation occurs at room temperature small deformations occur in both specimens at cryogenic temperatures although the residual stress increases further as shown in fig 12 c and d consequently the pressure resisting capabilities of both specimens at cryogenic temperatures are increased by approximately 15 relative to those at room temperature this is associated with the increase in yield strength at cryogenic temperatures as shown in table 1 5 conclusion in this study the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation of a primary barrier was analyzed by considering the forming process and operating conditions at cryogenic temperatures through finite element analysis and then was verified by performing experiments using universal hydraulic test equipment the results obtained from the proposed model and the universal hydraulic test equipment are as follows 1 the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation decreased significantly in both specimens when the residual stress and buckling mode were considered simultaneously 2 from the comparison between the analytical results and experimental results regarding the pressure resisting capability of the corrugation the reliability of the proposed analytical model and universal hydraulic test equipment were verified 3 the pressure resisting capabilities of both specimens at cryogenic temperatures increased by approximately 15 relative to those at room temperature this was associated with the increase in yield strength at cryogenic temperatures we believe that the proposed analytical model considering the residual stress and buckling mode can present a guideline for assisting in the setting of design parameters to improve the pressure resisting capabilities of the corrugation parts in primary barriers credit authorship

20303,nowadays extensive research has been conducted to generate electricity from ocean waves but there are not too many studies on the capture of wave energy in a specific ocean area as the largest sea area in china s offshore waters the south china sea contains a large amount of wave energy and is regarded as a natural wave energy power plant a comparative study was conducted to investigate the effects of wave energy converter wec parameters on the long term power capture performance of a bistable point absorber wec installed in the south china sea in this paper combined with the joint probability distribution of significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p in south china sea a mathematical model was developed for the evaluation of long term power performance of wecs the governing equations of the point absorber wec were established using the hybrid frequency time domain method the dynamic response and captured power can be obtained after numerically solving the equations of motion with the 4th order runge kutta method the results show that the bistable mechanism has great advantages in the long term captured power of wec in general a circular truncated cone shaped buoy wec with a larger buoy size and smaller nonlinear parameter tend to result in better long term power capture performance the insights given in this study provide a motivation and foundation for developing a complete set of performance optimization methods of point absorber wecs installed in south china sea keywords point absorber wec bistable mechanism long term performance south china sea 1 introduction with the rapid development of the social economy human demand for resource is increasing the energy crisis has brought severe challenges to global scale and it has caused deterioration of human ecological environment in order to alleviate the shortage of resources finding clean new type resources and developing green energy industry has been a hot topic in the world as a renewable resource ocean wave energy has greater power density than solar and wind energy in the past few decades various wave energy converters wecs have been proposed the wecs were divided into different categories according to different classification criteria including point absorbers cruz 2008 fernandes and fonseca 2013 oscillating water columns owcs doyle and aggidis 2019 iino et al 2016 and overtopping devices terminators he et al 2013 vicinanza et al 2014 etc the point absorber wec has a simpler structure lower construction cost and can effectively capture wave energy in offshore regions generally more 40m depth lópez et al 2013 besides wave energy can be obtained by point absorber wecs in almost any directions due to their horizontal dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength therefore the point absorbers have attracted more and more attention according to the number of oscillating body point absorber wecs were divided into two types one was a single body buoy reacting against a fixed frame of reference the sea bed or a bottom fixed structure which captures energy from the motion of floating buoy lejerskog et al 2015 and the other was two body systems where the wave energy is converted from the relative motion between two oscillating bodies by the power take off pto system which are often conceptually simplified as a linear spring and damper liang and zuo 2017 based on the simplification and linear system assumption frequency domain models were widely used due to its simplicity and low computer requirements gomes et al 2012 in recent years numerous researches on the linear point absorber wecs have been conducted falnes 2002 studied a heaving buoy with linear pto system by building the frequency model and pointed out that resonance occurs when the natural frequency of the wec is close to the excitation frequency leading to an approximately maximum captured power eriksson et al 2005 presented numerical studies of a cylindrical point absorber with linear generator they concluded that wec has a highest conversion efficiency with the resonance condition but the energy captured power of wec was unsatisfactory in real ocean waves because the wave frequency was usually much lower than the resonance frequency as a result it prompted researchers to come up with possible solutions to improve the power capture performance of the point absorber wecs the nonlinear bistable mechanism which was first studied in vibration energy harvesting may perform well the bistable mechanism of a buckled beam was first discovered numerally and experimentally by tseng and dugundji 1971 following that a nonlinear mechanism consisting of a nonlinear hardening spring was proposed by burrow and clare 2007 and they described the benefits of using a hardening spring instead of a linear spring according to the simulation and experimental results theoretical and numerical studies on the nonlinear oscillators involving a linear impulsively loaded structure were presented by ma 2011 he concluded that a device designed with proper non linearity may harvest more energy than its linear counterpart when there is significant frequency mismatch a nonlinear bistable pto system consisting of two sym metrically oblique springs and a linear damper was proposed by zhang and yang 2015 their results showed that compared with linear pto system the nonlinear bistable pto system can increase the power captured by the oscillating body wec in irregular waves besides buoy shape and size were considered as influential factors of the power capture efficiency to a point absorber wec meanwhile as an incentive condition for wecs sea characteristics directly determined the efficiency of pto system for the purpose of designing efficient wecs several researches on the dynamic performances of various buoy with different shapes have been done in the last years beirão and malça 2014 investigated the hydrodynamics of several buoy geometries applied to a point absorber wec their analysis revealed that the spherical buoy geometry leads to best structural behavior but it is worth noting radius and mass of three buoys conical spherical and horizontal cylindrical were not the same after that the dynamics of two buoys conical and hemispherical with identical wave conditions were analyzed by pastor and liu 2014 they found that the conical buoy is slightly better than hemispherical buoy in power captured these two buoys had the same radius but different mass accordingly amiri et al 2016 compared the efficiency of four buoy shapes with the same mass and different radius in wave energy absorption goggins and finnegan 2014 explored a methodology which aims to optimise the structural geometric configuration for different radius devices at the atlantic marine energy test site vantorre et al 2004 examined the performance of heaving point absorbers with different geometry shapes in considered area which are located at the belgian coastal area of the north sea their results showed that power absorption performance appears to be wave height dependent the main purposes of the present study are to demonstrate the advantages of bistable power capture mechanism in long term energy absorption and to investigate the effect of wec parameters on the long term power capture performance laying the foundation for developing a performance optimization method in the future in addition this study will also provide a theoretical reference for the future study on the capture of wave energy in other sea areas of the world to achieve this a large number of numerical calculations were conducted to provide reliable datum in this paper the nonlinear bistable power capture mechanism proposed by zhang and yang 2015 is applied to a point absorber wec the long term power capture performance of the bistable point absorber wec installed at the south china sea is evaluated combined with the joint probability distribution of significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p in south china sea wen et al 2018 a mathematical model is developed for the evaluation of long term power performance of wecs hybrid time frequency domain method based on the cummins 1962 equation is utilized to establish the governing equations of the point absorber wec with both linear and nonlinear bistable pto systems subsequently the dynamic response and captured power for each sea state can be calculated numerically using 4th order runge kutta approach furthermore the effects of key wec parameters on the long term power capture performance of a bistable point absorber wec are studied in detail 2 model of the wec the schematic program of a point absorber wec with linear and non linear bistable pto system is shown in fig 1 a hemisphere buoy with the radius r is adopted as the geometry of the converter the hemisphere is rigidly connected to the pto system and it is assumed to only heave motion the mass of the hemisphere buoy is m 2 ρ π r 3 3 ρ is the density of seawater 1025 k g m 3 fig 1 a is the point absorber converter with a linear pto system which is composed of a linear spring and a linear damper fig 1 b is the point absorber converter with a non linear bistable mechanism proposed by zhang and yang 2015 unlike a linear converter it consists of a damper and two symmetrically oblique springs only heave motion of the hemisphere buoy is considered for simplified cases due to the axisymmetric characteristics of the hemisphere geometry one directional incident waves are considered besides the draught of the hemisphere floater in equilibrium condition equals to its radius and waves of the south china sea are chosen as calculated waves it can be seen from fig 1 z is the direction of heave motion and is positive upward l is half of the horizontal distance between the two oblique spring feet l 0 is the original length of both springs θ is the inclination of the two springs corresponding to the initial length and k 0 is the stiffness of the two springs and the stiffness of spring in the linear pto system is chosen as k 2 k 0 for both linear and non linear pto system the equivalent damping coefficient is marked as c the damping coefficient c shown in the figure is only the equivalent damping defined in the physical sense which can be physically achieved with linear damping mechanical damping or hydraulic damping in practical applications as a preliminary study this paper focuses on solving the capturing force of wec by establishing a simplified mathematical model however as for how to physically realize the damping of pto system in practical application it will be discussed in detail in the following research more importantly a bistable parameter γ is defined as ratio of horizontal distance l to original length of oblique springs i e 1 γ l l 0 based on the researches of zhang et al 2014 the static characteristics of snap trough mechanism are briefly summarized a the snap through mechanism with two oblique springs leads to negative stiffness and the strength of the negative stiffness depends on the value of γ and its strength gets larger as γ 0 γ 1 becomes smaller the negative stiffness disappears when γ 1 b the snap through pto system is characteristic of double well potential as the γ decreases the potential barrier between the two wells increases when γ 1 the potential barrier of non linear pto system disappears like the linear system in addition there are three equilibrium positions in the non linear pto system corresponding to two possible kinds of motion 3 dynamic response of the wec 3 1 wave spectrum as the input conditions for the wave energy capture system the analysis of the wave spectrum is particularly important in this work the northern south china sea is selected as the intended deployment site due to its abundance of wave energy resources according to the studies of wen et al 2018 the joint probability distribution of average annual significant wave height h s and wave averaged period t av in the south china sea from january 1988 to december 2011 are presented at table 1 the background color in the table reflects the probability of occurrence of each wave condition where the integer refers to the number of occurrences it is divided by the total number of wave occurrences 64210 to get the probability of occurrence expressed as a percentage as shown in table 1 most of the significant wave height are below 4 5 m and its maximum probability occur in the range of 0 5 2 5m the average wave period is mostly distributed in the 3 5 9 5s especially in the range of 3 5 6 5s according to the works of zheng et al 2012 t p 1 2t av should be taken in the calculation random waves are considered to be closest to real waves and they are extremely irregular in this calculation jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 is adopted to simulate the waves in the south china sea the wave spectral density function s f is presented as 2 s f α h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 5 4 1 t p f 4 χ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 where f is the wave frequency h s is the significant wave height t p is the peak period of jonswap spectrum χ is the peak elevation factor whose value is within the range of 1 5 6 and it taken as 3 3 in this calculation σ is the peak shape parameter its value is defined as 3 σ 0 07 if f f p 0 09 if f f p α is a parameter related to the peak elevation factor χ 4 α 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 χ 0 185 1 9 χ since circular frequency ω is commonly used in analysis the jonswap spectrum density function can also be expressed as 5 s ω 320 38 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1948 18 t p ω 4 χ exp ω ω p 1 2 2 σ 2 approximately replacing the peak period of irregular wave t p with the wave average period t a v in the table 1 the wave spectrum of the south china sea in each sea state can be obtained by eq 2 or eq 5 for the time history calculation of wave spectrum it should be formed by superposing a sufficiently large number n of regular wave components with different amplitudes circular frequency and random phases the time series of waves can be described as 6 ζ t i 1 a ω i cos ω i t ε i i 1 n a ω i cos ω i t ε i where ζ is wave elevation n is a sufficiently large positive integer a ω i is the amplitude of the ith wavelet ω i is the circular frequency of the ith wavelet ε i is the random phases of the ith wavelet its value is evenly distributed within the range of 0 2π and k i is the number of wave in a length of 2π 7 ω i ω 0 i δ ω i 0 1 2 n 1 where ω 0 is the lowest wave frequency component δ ω is a small frequency interval the amplitude of the ith wavelet can be represented by the given wave spectral density 8 a ω i 2 s ω i δ ω the wave spectrum density and wave time series of the most probable sea states h s 0 5m t av 4 5s in the south china sea are shown in the fig 2 in order to clearly observe the wave form the wave surface elevation time series of a small section of irregular wave in fig 2 b is displayed with a zoomed in version 3 2 the equation of motion due to the non linearity of the system frequency domain method is no longer applicable thus time domain method based on the cummins 1962 equation is adopted to analyze the dynamic response of a point absorber wec with nonlinear snap through pto system in south china sea in the case of considering only heave motion the equation of motion for the nonlinear wec see fig 1 b can be expressed as 9 m a z z t 0 t k z t τ z τ d τ c z t ρ g s z t k 1 l 0 z 2 l 2 z t f e i r r e g u l a r similarly the equation of heave motion for the linear wec see fig 1 a can be expressed as 10 m a z z t 0 t k z t τ z τ d τ c z t ρ g s k z t f e i r r e g u l a r where z t z t and z t represents the displacement velocity and acceleration of heave motion respectively the positive direction of heave motion is defined as shown in fig 1 a z is the added mass of the floater as the wave frequency ω approaches infinity f e irregular is the wave excitation force on the float in irregular waves s is the area of the cross section of the floater and s πr 2 for a hemispherical buoy c is the equivalent damping coefficient of both linear and nonlinear pto system k is the stiffness of spring for the linear pto system and twice the stiffness k 0 of each spring for the nonlinear snap through system ρ is the density of sea water g is the acceleration of gravity m is the mass of hemispherical floater with values of 2πρr 3 3 the convolution terms in eq 9 and eq 10 indicate the memory effect of fluid in the radiation forces the time domain retardation function k z t related to the radiation damping coefficient of heave motion can be expressed as 11 k z t 2 π 0 b z ω cos ω t d ω since the size of the float is much smaller than the sea depth at the installation location it is reasonable to assume that the water depth is infinite during the following calculations for linear and nonlinear wecs the radius of hemisphere is r 5m the density of sea water is ρ 1025 kg m3 the acceleration of gravity is g 9 81 m s2 the mass of hemispherical floater is m 2πρr 3 3 and the area of the cross section of the hemisphere is s πr 2 according to vicente et al 2013 the equivalent stiffness of the pto system is usually about 10 of the hydrostatic recovery coefficient of the floater in this calculation k 0 1ρgs the wave excitation force of the hemispherical buoy in irregular waves can be superposed by components in regular waves faltinsen 1993 for a given regular wave with circular frequency ω and amplitude a ω the moduli of wave excitation force is proportional to the amplitude of the regular wave i e f e r e g u l a r γ z ω a ω where f e r e g u l a r is the moduli of wave excitation force in regular waves and γ z ω is the wave excitation force coefficient falnes 2002 explored the relationship between the wave excitation force and the incident wave amplitude of an axisymmetric floater doing heave motion in deep water giving an analytical result of wave excitation force coefficient as 12 γ z ω 2 g 3 ρ b z ω ω 3 where b z ω is the radiation damping coefficient of floater in the heave motion this equation is also known as haskind relation the added mass and radiation damping as well as wave excitation force of the hemispherical buoy in the heave motion are calculated using sesam 2013 developed by dnv gl classification society in order to verify the accuracy of the hydrodynamic parameters the numerical solutions are compared with the research by hulme 1982 as shown in fig 3 additionally based on the research by falnes 2002 and finnegan et al 2013 the calculation accuracy of wave excitation forces that acting on bodies with different geometries are verified in fig 4 the results show good agreement which illustrates the reliability of the numerical solutions combining eq 8 the wave excitation force of a hemispherical buoy in irregular waves can be obtained by superimposing a considerably large number n of regular wave components 13 f e i r r e g u l a r i 1 n γ z ω i a ω i cos ω i t ϕ i ε i where ϕ i is the phase of the wave excitation force for the ith regular wave component and ε i is a random number uniformly distributed in 0 2π 3 3 state space model the convolution terms in the time domain motion eqs 9 and 10 result in a slower and inconvenient calculation for the analysis of dynamic response of converters therefore the state space model alves 2012 is used to replace the convolution term the general form of a state space model is 14 x t a x t b u t y t c x t where u t and y t are input and output variable of state space respectively x t is the state vector and a b c are constant coefficient matrices of the state space model for eqs 9 and 10 the input variable is heave velocity z t and the impulse response function is retardation function k z t thus the convolution term can be replaced by the state space model as 15 x t a x t b z t i z t c x t where i z t 0 t k z t τ z τ d τ is the radiation force considering the memory effects of the fluid in time domain after replacing the convolution term with a state space model the constant coefficient matrices a b and c of the model need to be solved this process is also called system identification taghipour et al 2008 in the frequency domain the kernel function is expressed as a function related to the added mass and damping coefficient by fourier transformation 16 k z j ω 0 k z τ e j ω τ d τ b z ω j ω a z ω a z where j is an imaginary unit the nonlinear least square method is adopted to find a suitable function k ˆ z that approximates k z j ω for a given series of circular frequencies following the restrictions indicated by perez and fossen 2011 the transfer function k ˆ z is defined as 17 k ˆ s θ p n 1 s n 1 p n 2 s n 2 p 1 s p 0 s n q n 1 s n 1 q 1 s q 0 where s j ω and n is called the order of the transfer function θ p n 1 p n 2 p 0 q n 1 q n 2 q 0 is a set of coefficients that can be obtained using the nonlinear least square method the coefficient matrices and vectors of state space model which approximately replace the convolution integral can be written

be numerically solved by using 4th runge kutta method the accuracy of the numerical solution with the 4th runge kutta method is validated in section 3 5 3 4 power capture performance after the discrete time results of displacement and velocity are obtained the average power captured by converters with linear pto system and nonlinear bistable mechanism in each sea state are calculated numerically using the following expression 24 p 1 t 0 t c z 2 d t where t is the time period for the average power calculation c is the equivalent damping of the pto system z indicates the heave velocity related to the time t in order to further study the effects of wec parameters on the long term power performance two physical quantities are introduced in the following one of them is the wave energy transport p w a v e which represents the wave energy passing through a section of unit width per unit time in the direction perpendicular to the incident wave faltinsen 1993 for regular waves with frequency ω the expression of wave energy transport can be written as 25 p w a v e ω 1 2 ρ g v g ω h a 2 where ρ is the sea water density g is the gravity acceleration a is the wave amplitude v g ω h is the wave group velocity which is expressed as 26 v g ω h g 2 ω tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where h is the water depth k denotes the wave number ω and k satisfy the dispersion relation considering the irregular waves in real sea states the power per meter of the wave crest length is given by younesian and alam 2017 27 p w a v e ρ g 0 v g ω h s ω d ω ρ g 2 h s 2 32 0 ω 1 s ω d ω 0 s ω d ω where h s is the significant wave height s ω is the jonswap spectrum density function it refers to eq 5 another dimensionless physical quantity is energy capture width ratio η which indicates to the ratio of the average captured power of the wec to the wave energy transport within the width of the buoy it can be obtained by the formula as 28 η p d p w a v e where p is the average power obtained by eq 24 d is the diameter of the buoy at the waterline plane and p w a v e is the power per meter of the wave crest length since η reflects the energy capture efficiency of the wec in some extent it becomes a more significant indicator for evaluating the power performance of wec compared with the average captured power therefore the long term power capture performance of the wecs is evaluated by utilizing the p l t and η l t combined with the joint probability distribution of the south china sea waves it can be written as formula 29 p l t i 1 m j 1 n p i j ξ i j m 11 n 13 30 η l t i 1 m j 1 n p i j ξ i j d i 1 m j 1 n p w a v e i j ξ i j m 11 n 13 where i j are subscripts which respectively correspond to the position coordinates of each sea state h s t p in table 1 m and n are the measured number of significant wave height and average period in the south china sea respectively p i j and p w a v e i j are the average captured power and wave energy transport separately under each sea state it can refer to eq 24 and eq 27 ξ i j is distribution probability of each significant wave height and average period see table 1 p lt and η l t indicate the long term captured power and long term energy capture width ratio of the wecs respectively for the point absorber wec with the linear pto system in regular waves the heave motion equation of the floater can be expressed as 31 m a z ω z b z ω c z ρ g s k z f e r e g u l a r where f e regular is the wave excitation force of the floater which does heave motion in regular waves by performing fourier transform on the eq 31 the frequency domain motion equation of the linear converter in regular waves can be obtained and we can get 32 z f e r e g u l a r ω 2 m a z ω j ω b z ω c ρ g s k where z and f e regular are the fourier transform results of z and f e regular respectively the time averaged power captured by the linear wec is written as 33 p 1 2 c ω 2 z 2 1 8 b z ω f e r e g u l a r 2 b z ω 2 u f e r e g u l a r 2 b z ω 2 where u j ω z is the fourier transform of the heaving velocity of the floater it can be seen from the eq 33 the average power p reaches the maximum value with u f e r e g u l a r 2 b z substituting it into the eq 32 can be acquired 34 ω r ρ g s k m a z ω r 35 c b b z ω r equation 34 indicates the conditions for the resonance event between the oscillating body and the wave ω r represents the resonant frequency at this condition the linear wec reaches the maximum power absorption and eq 35 shows that the damping coefficient of the linear pto system should be equal to the radiation damping of the floater in order to harvest the maximum power at the resonance frequency in this study the c b in eq 35 is defined as the basic damping coefficient moreover the basic damping coefficient is usually used as the initial damping to explore the influence of the damping of the pto system on the long term power performance of wecs 3 5 validation of numerical solutions the accuracy of the numerical solutions obtained in this study is tested in two steps first the accuracy of the 4th runge kutta method is verified by comparing the long term captured power of linear wecs in the frequency domain and time domain calculated with different sets of random phase ε between 0 and 2π second the non linear pto system is considered and the convergence of the numerical results is validated by comparing the long term captured power of nonlinear wecs at different time steps δt with different sets of random phase ε the time steps employed for testing the results are 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 s finally five different sets of random phase angles are generated at each time step to model the irregular waves of the real sea states considered in this study the long term captured power generated by both the linear and non linear wec of which the float is a hemisphere with the radius 5 m the draft of the buoy is 5 m and the nonlinear parameter γ is 0 01 is calculated and the numerical results are presented in table 2 the frequency domain and time domain calculation results of linear wec are in good agreement since the frequency domain results are generally considered accurate the results of the linear wec verify the validity of the 4th runge kutta method the time domain results show that the long term captured power does not differ with changing sets of random phase angles the difference between each result corresponding to each set of random phase angles and the average value of long term captured power corresponding to these random phase is less than 1 in all cases furthermore the differences of the numerical results at different time steps are insignificant and the convergence of the results is also clearly observed consequently 4th runge kutta method is chosen for evaluating the motion response of the wecs in waves with a time step of 0 1 s duo to the shorter calculation time of this time step 4 results and discussion this section demonstrates the distribution of the long term captured power of wecs in the south china sea and discusses the effect of characteristic parameters on the long term power performance of wecs based on the motion response of the buoy some reasonable explains are given for the influence of these parameters on the long term power performance while a heavy or large sized float helps to increase the energy absorbed by a wec this type of buoy geometry also causes the cost of production to increase since the hemisphere generally has better hydrodynamic performance and taking into account the economy of the wec in this study the hemisphere is considered as the basic shape of the float and its initial radius is r 5m based on the researches by vicente et al 2013 the stiffness coefficient of the pto system is chosen as k 0 1ρgs moreover according to eqs 34 and 35 wecs with buoys of different shapes have different resonance frequencies and basic damping by changing the multiple of the basic damping in the calculation the influence of the damping coefficient of the pto system on the long term power performance of wecs with different buoys is studied 4 1 long term captured power distribution according to the statistics of the south china sea state in table 1 the average captured power of the linear wec in each sea state is calculated by changing the values of h s and t p in the jonswap spectrum expression eq 5 the average capture energy of the linear wec under various happened sea state can be obtained as shown in fig 7 based on the joint probability distribution of the significant wave height and wave average period the long term captured power distribution of the linear wec can be further obtained as shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 7 that for the linear wec with a hemispherical floater radius of 5m the average captured power is greatly affected by wave parameters in general the linear wec will absorb more wave energy as the significant wave height increases this possible reason for this phenomenon is that the large wave height causes violent heave motion of the buoy however the effect of the peak frequency on the average power captured by the linear pto system is not similar for the linear wec the captured power reaches the maximum as the peak frequency is close to the natural frequency of the device due to the particularity of the sea conditions the average power distribution of the linear wec is mainly concentrated in the range of large significant wave height and low peak frequencies as shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the long term captured power distribution of the linear wec is significant different from the average power distribution in fig 7 as the joint probability distribution of significant wave height and average period is considered the long term captured power of the linear wec is mainly concentrated in the low spectral peak frequency ω p 1 5 rad s region where the significant wave height is less than 4 5m and the long term captured power reaches the maximum when the h s is equal to 2m and the peak frequency is close to 0 7 rad s it indicates that the energy absorbed of the wec in practical applications is not only related to wave parameters but more importantly it will be affected by the specific sea condition of the installation site for the nonlinear wec the nonlinear parameter γ is taken as 0 1 and the initial length l 0 of the spring is chosen as 2m it s similar to the linear wec the average power distribution of the nonlinear wec with bistable mechanism in each happened sea state can be calculated are shown in fig 9 the long term captured power distribution is further gained by combing the joint probability distribution of h s and t av table 1 as shown in fig 10 compared with the linear wec the similar average power distribution rules of the nonlinear wec are presented in fig 9 the average captured power of the nonlinear wec with a bistable parameter γ of 0 1 will absorb more energy as the h s increasing to 6 5m the maximum average power captured by the nonlinear wec is greater than that of the linear wec in each h s case the peak frequency corresponding to the maximum average power of the nonlinear wec is lower than the natural frequency of the pto system since the dual well characteristic of the bistable mechanism the larger wave energy can be captured by the nonlinear pto system at a lower peak frequency zhang et al 2014 it can be seen from fig 10 the nonlinear wec with a hemispherical floater radius of 5 m achieves the maximum long term captured power when the h s is 1 5m and the t p is close to 1 rad s and the maximum long term captured power of the nonlinear wec is almost twice that of the linear wec considering the joint probability distribution of the h s and t av in the south china sea the long term captured power distribution of the nonlinear wec is the same as the linear wec however the power capture performance of the nonlinear wec in various wave conditions is better than that of the linear wec besides the long term power capture performance of the linear and nonlinear wecs is also affected to varying degrees due to the sea conditions at the actual installation site in order to demonstrate the reliability of numerical calculations it is necessary to verify the accuracy of the results however only part of the verification results are shown in this paper due to the limitation of the length of the paper at the same it should be noted that all calculation results in section 4 have been validated for accuracy adopting the similar methods the long term captured power of wecs with a hemispherical buoy of radius 5m calculated by different time steps and different sets of random phase angles are illustrated in table 3 the calculation results show good numerical convergence 4 2 the effect of buoy shape on long term power performance based on the hemispherical buoy several common buoy geometries are designed as shown in fig 11 in order to eliminate the influence of secondary factors on the power performance these geometries are designed to have the same volume as the hemispherical buoy in addition it is ensured that these buoy geometries have the same mass and as equal water plane area as possible in the discussion about the influence of buoy geometry three groups of different calculation cases were selected for comparison the detailed design parameters of wecs are shown in table 4 it is well known that the hydrodynamic parameters of the buoy are significantly affected by its geometric shape a well designed shape will greatly improve the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy according to eq 29 30 and table 1 the long term captured power of the linear and nonlinear wecs with four different shapes of buoys in the south china sea is investigated the nonlinear parameters γ of the bistable pto in the calculation are selected as 0 01 0 1 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 respectively results of the long term prediction of the wecs with different buoy shapes are given in figs 12 and 13 where a b c represent different test cases shown in table 4 from fig 12 it is obvious that the geometric shape of the buoy has a significant effect on the long term captured power of both linear and nonlinear wec the extent of influence will vary with the size of the buoy and the nonlinear parameters γ for the linear wec see fig 12 a the difference in long term absorbed power among wecs with the different shape buoys changes is significant but this difference is less affected by the size of the buoys the maximum difference can reach about 7 kw this means that the linear wec with a circular truncated cone shaped buoy is better than the one with a combination buoy in the long term power performance for the nonlinear wec see fig 12 b f the bistable pto system using circular truncated cone buoy shows greater advantages compared with other geometrical buoy this advantage is related to the size of the buoy and nonlinear parameter γ when the nonlinear parameter γ is set to 0 01 the maximum difference of the power captured by the nonlinear wecs with various buoy shapes is about 15 kw as the γ increases the effect of buoy shape on the long term power performance of the point absorber wec with nonlinear pto system is weakened until the γ is equal to 0 9 the power performance of the nonlinear wec is similar to that of the linear wec affected by the buoy shape this may be explained as the negative stiffness of the spring in the nonlinear bistable system is disappeared under the critical state of γ 1 zhang et al 2014 at this time the potential energy curve of the nonlinear pto system no longer has the double well characteristic similar to the long term captured power the long term energy capture width ratio of the wecs is also affected by the shape of buoys as shown in fig 13 in addition the variation trends of them affected by the buoy shapes are almost the same this demonstrates that although the long term capture width ratio represents the long term energy capture efficiency of the wec it can also be used to estimate the long term power capture performance of the wec in the same sea conditions regardless of linear or nonlinear pto system wec with a circular truncated cone shaped buoy has the largest long term power capture efficiency for the linear pto system the long term power capture efficiency of the wec with a circular truncated cone shaped buoy is about twice as large as that of the wec with a combination shaped buoy see fig 13 a for the nonlinear pto system the long term energy capture efficiency of wec reaches the maximum when γ is 0 01 and the r is 6 m and the effect of the buoy shape on the long term capture efficiency of wec is attenuated with the increases of γ see fig 13 b f in general the long term power capture performance of both linear and nonlinear wec with a circular truncated cone buoy in the south china sea is better than other buoy shapes however the hemispherical buoy may also be an excellent geometry when considering multiple factors and it is worth noting the choice of buoy shape will also be affected by the sea conditions of the actual installation site the comparison diagram of the time series of the heave velocity of the truncated cone float with a waterline plane radius of 6m and that of the heave velocity of several other floats is illustrated in fig 14 the results show that the heave motion of the circular truncated cone float is more violent in the whole calculation time period with the same wave condition especially when compared with the cylindrical and combined float the effect is more obvious it can be seen from eq 24 that the power captured by wec is directly related to the damping of the pto system and the heave velocity of the float the good motion characteristics of the truncated cone float and its large basic damping make the wec with the circular truncated cone float show superior long term power performance compared with other float geometries the numerical results of the long term captured power of linear and nonlinear wecs with different shape of buoy obtained by employing different time steps are shown in table 5 in the verification of the results the radius of the float is 6m see table 4 and the nonlinear parameter is 0 01 the calculation results in the table illustrate that the numerical results of long term captured power have good convergence for both linear and nonlinear wecs 4 3 the effect of buoy size on long term power performance as written by the time domain motion equations i e eq 9 10 for linear and nonlinear wec the size of buoy further affects the power capture performance of the wec by changing the hydrodynamic quantities since the size of the designed buoy is directly related to the construction cost in practical applications it is necessary to study the influence of buoy size on the long term power performance of the pto system the size of buoy refers to the geometric parameters in table 2 and the γ of the bistable pto system are selected respectively as 0 01 0 1 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 the long term captured power and the long term energy capture width ratio of the linear and nonlinear wecs with the different sizes of buoy are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively it can be seen from fig 15 that the long term captured power of both linear and nonlinear wec in the south china sea will be affected by the size of buoy and the different results are presented for the various buoy shapes and nonlinear parameters as the size of buoy increases more wave energy can be absorbed by linear and nonlinear pto system in the long term the long term captured power of the wec with combinational buoy is almost linearly proportional to the waterline plane radius of the buoy the effect of the size or mass of the buoy on the power captured by the wec is consistent with the results researched by erselcan and kukner 2020 for the wec with the combinational buoy composed of a cylinder and a hemisphere the long term power performance is less affected by the buoy size than other geometric shapes furthermore the effect of the buoy size on the long term power performance is also related to the nonlinear parameter of the wec compared with the linear wec the long term captured power of the point absorber wec with nonlinear bistable pto is greatly affected by the buoy size this may be attributed to the higher average power can be absorbed by nonlinear wec in the same buoy size as indicated in fig 15 b f the influence of the buoy size on the long term power performance of the nonlinear pto system is weakened with the increases of γ it should be noted that a wec with the nonlinear pto system can capture the same long term power as a linear wec with a large size buoy under a smaller buoy size or even greater as illustrated in fig 15 for buoys of the same shape the long term captured power of the nonlinear wec with a buoy of waterline plane radius 4m in fig 15 b and that of the nonlinear wec with a buoy of waterline plane radius 5m in fig 15 c are greater than that of the linear wec with a buoy of waterline plane radius 6m in fig 15 a this result is particularly important for practical engineering applications it can be found from fig 16 that the effect of the buoy size on the long term energy capture width ratio of the wec with or without bistable pto system is slightly different from that on the long term captured power the reason for this phenomenon can be explained from the perspective of physical meaning of them the long term captured power of the wec reflects the amount of the wave energy captured by the pto system over a long period of time including the concept of absolute however the long term energy capture width ratio of wec is a dimensionless physical quantity it reflects the relative quality of the long term power capture performance regardless of the shape of the buoy the long term power capture efficiency of wec promotes as the buoy size increases therefore it can be fully illustrated that the wec with a larger buoy size has better long term power capture performance combining the results of figs 15 and 16 the slope of the curve in the fig 16 represents the extent of influence of buoy size on long term energy capture efficiency for the linear pto system the long term power capture efficiency of the wecs with different buoy shapes are nearly the same extent affected by the size of the buoy see fig 16 a for the nonlinear pto system the long term energy capture efficiency of the wec lifts with the buoy size increases and that of the wec with a truncated cone shaped float is always the highest see fig 16 b f it is worth mentioning that the effect of the buoy size on the long term power capture efficiency of the bistable pto system is weakened with the increases of γ but the degree of this weakening is not very significant besides the effect of the buoy size on the long term power capture efficiency of the wec is also closely to the shape of the buoy when is 0 01 the long term power capture efficiency of wec with a hemispherical shaped buoy is most affected by the size of the buoy although the long term power performance of the pto system to absorb the wave energy can be significantly improved by increasing the buoy size it should also be considered in combination with the buoy shape of wec and the nonlinear parameter γ of the pto system at the same time the construction cost of the wec and sea state of the specific installation site cannot be ignored the numerical results for the long term captured power of linear and nonlinear wecs with floats of different sizes are given in table 6 in the verification of the results a circular truncated cone buoy is selected and the nonlinear parameter is 0 01 the results in the table show that the numerical results of the long term captured power have good convergence for both linear and nonlinear wecs 4 4 the effect of the damping coefficient of the pto system on long term power performance in addition to the physical properties of the buoy shape and size the damping coefficient of the pto system has a direct influence on the long term power performance of the wec for a wec with a given buoy shape and size an optimal damping coefficient can be uniquely determined within a certain range for different nonlinear parameters since the power performance of the nonlinear wec is generally better the effect of different damping coefficients on the long term captured power of the nonlinear wec is mainly explored in this section to obtain the optimal damping of the pto system with different nonlinear parameters the radius of the buoy is selected to be 5 m and the long term captured power changes with the damping coefficient are calculated for the wec with different shapes of floats as presented in fig 17 for nonlinear wecs with different float shapes and different nonlinear parameters the long term captured power is affected by the damping coefficient of the pto system with similar trends in general as the damping of the pto system increases the long term captured power of the nonlinear wec increases firstly and then decreases in addition for buoys of a given shape and size the long term power performance of wecs with small nonlinear parameters is always better than that of wecs with large nonlinear parameters under the same damping of pto system 0 γ 1 as illustrated in fig 17 the two vertical gray dashed lines represent the optimal damping interval of the nonlinear wec which contains the optimal damping corresponding to different nonlinear parameters in the range of small damping coefficient the long term capture power of wec can be significantly increased by increasing the damping of pto system however adjusting the damping of the pto system near the optimal damping interval will not significantly improve the power performance of the wec and may even reduce the power capture of the wec it is worth noting that the width of the optimal damping interval is closely related to the shape of the buoy furthermore the variation curve of the optimal damping of the pto system with the nonlinear parameters is plotted in fig 18 as mentioned in section 3 4 different shapes of floats have different basic damping due to different hydrodynamic coefficients the c bmax of the ordinate in fig 18 is the basic damping of the circular truncated cone buoy it can be seen from the figure that the optimal damping of wec increases with the increase of nonlinear parameters especially in the range of 0 γ 0 1 the optimal damping is more observably affected by γ this may be explained by the fact that the nonlinear pto system makes the motion of the float relatively violent when γ is small the capture power of the wec is dominated by the heave velocity while the smaller damping increases the velocity of the float to obtain the maximum captured power a detailed description of the motion of the float can be referred to section 4 5 this means that the optimal damping can be decided according to the specific nonlinear parameters of wecs in engineering design and the damping of the pto system can be reduced by decreasing γ the economic benefits of wave energy utilization are maximized by absorbing more energy at lower cost 4 5 the effect of the nonlinear parameter on long term power performance as proposed by zhang et al 2014 the power capture performance of the wec with nonlinear bistable pto system is affected by the nonlinear parameter γ which determines the strength of the negative stiffness and the region with negative stiffness for the wec with a given buoy shape and size it is also a significant issue to reasonably select the non linear parameters of the pto system so that the wec has the best long term power performance in the sea conditions at the installation location in this study we choose the original length of the oblique spring l 0 equal to 2m with a set of different values of γ varying from 0 01 to 0 9 for different float shapes take their respective basic damping as the damping of the pto system in the calculation thus the long term captured power and the long term energy capture width ratio of the point absorber wec with different values of γ or without the bistable pto system can be obtained as shown in figs 19 and 20 respectively combined with the sea state of the south china sea the long term captured power of both linear and nonlinear wec in various buoy shapes is calculated respectively it can be seen from fig 19 a that for a hemispherical buoy considered in different waterline plane radius the long term power captured by the point absorber wec with nonlinear bistable pto systems is larger than that of linear wec in all of three different buoy size as the size of buoy increasing nonlinear wec has more obvious advantages in long term power capture performance the nonlinear parameter γ has an effect on the long term power performance of the nonlinear wec generally the nonlinear wec can capture a larger amount of power with a smaller value of γ over the long term and when the value of γ is close to 1 the effect on the long term power captured by nonlinear wec is weakened the influence of γ on long term captured power of the wecs will also be disturbed by other factors such as float parameters as the buoy size increases the long term captured power of the wec is more affected by nonlinear parameter γ the long term evaluation of power capture performance of a point absorber wec with cylindrical and circular truncated cone buoys are given in fig 19 b and c respectively comparing fig 19 a c it can be found that the long term captured power of a point absorber wec with these three buoy shapes has similar changes under the effect of the γ however for the results shown in fig 19 d the effect of the γ on the long term power capture performance of the wec with a combinational buoy is different from that of the wec with the other three shapes of buoy as the value of the γ is set to 0 01 the long term power capture performance of a point absorber wec with combinational buoy is significant superior to that of other value of γ at this time the long term captured power of the nonlinear wec is almost linearly proportional to the waterline plane radius of buoy for the same float shape and size the long term energy capture width ratio of wec is significantly affected by the γ as shown in fig 20 generally speaking the long term energy capture efficiency of a point absorber wec with the bistable pto system decreases with the increases of γ 0 γ 1 but it is significantly greater than that of linear wec and as the γ increases the effect of γ on the long term energy capture efficiency of the wec is weakened additionally the influence of γ on the long term energy capture efficiency of wec is also disturbed by other factors such as the shape and size of the buoy this denotes that when the shape and size of the buoy are determined the long term power capture efficiency of a bistable point absorber wec in the south china sea can be improved by appropriately increasing γ on the contrary for a given γ the point absorber wec with the highest long term power capture efficiency can also be designed by selecting the shape and size of the buoy reasonably according to the calculation results in fig 20 it can be seen that the long term energy capture efficiency of the nonlinear wec with a circular truncated cone shaped buoy in the south china sea reaches the maximum value of 0 25 when γ is 0 01 and r is 6m two high incidence sea states t av 4 5s h s 0 5m t av 5 5s h s 1 5m were selected from table 1 to calculate the float motion response and the acting force of the pto system of linear and nonlinear wec with a circular truncated cone body with a radius of 6m respectively the time domain results are presented in figs 21 and 22 it can be clearly observed from figs 21 and 22 that the motion of the buoy of the nonlinear wec under the two wave conditions is more violent than the linear wec and the corresponding pto force is also greater according to falnes 2002 research the maximum power is captured under the condition that the wave excitation force is in phase with the velocity of the float this is the basic principle for many control methods such as latching and declutching control applied to wecs to improve their power capture performance compared with fig 21 the strange behavior the floater displacement and the pto force oscillate around the extreme value for a period of time and with positive negative switching on a seemingly arbitrary timescale shown in fig 22 is actually caused by the nonlinear wec with the bistable mechanism in irregular waves the bistable mechanism makes the phase of the floater velocity close to the phase of the wave excitation force this is exactly the advantage of the bistable mechanism as a passive mechanical component in the power capture performance of the point absorber wec which is similar to the beneficial effects achieved by the application of active control methods this behavior is also consistent with the phase control feature of the adaptive bistable mechanism proposed by zhang et al 2019 the velocity of the heave motion for both linear and nonlinear wecs as well as time series of irregular wave excitation force is illustrated by fig 23 a as indicated in the rectangular box obviously the time series of velocity of the nonlinear bistable wec show a phase closer to the wave excitation force than its linear counterpart in order to give a more detailed explanation the cross correlation function ccf is adopted to obtain the time lag between the heave motion velocity of the buoy and the wave excitation force for v z t and f e t the ccf is defined as δ τ t 1 t 2 v z t τ f e t d t the time lag between v z t and f e t is denoted by the value of τ corresponding to the maximum value of the cross correlation function δ t based on the above definition for the time interval 3647 3658 marked by the rectangular in fig 23 a the time lag between the heave velocity and wave excitation force is 1 for the nonlinear bistable wec and 8 for the linear wec see fig 23 b therefore the long term power performance of the nonlinear wec is generally better than that of the linear wec furthermore it is necessary to point out that the motion and pto force limits of a real wec need to be strictly determined considering the specific implementation device to ensure the safety of the structure the numerical results for the long term captured power of linear and nonlinear wecs with different nonlinear parameters are given in table 7 in the verification of the results a circular truncated cone buoy is selected and the waterline plane radius is 5m the results in the table show that the numerical results of the long term captured power have good convergence for both linear and nonlinear wecs with various γ 5 conclusions a mathematical model for the long term power evaluation is developed to investigate the long term power capture performance of the bistable point absorber wec in south china sea combining the joint probability distribution of significant wave height h s and wave average period t p of south china sea the long term captured power of a point absorber wec can be easily and conveniently obtained to demonstrate the advantages of the bistable power capture mechanism in long term wave energy absorption a comparative study on the power performance of point absorber wecs is conducted from the control variable analysis of the calculated data the effects of key wec parameters on the long term power capture performance are discussed in detail including both the geometrical parameters of buoy and the nonlinear parameters of the pto system based on the numerical results conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the long term power capture performance of both linear and nonlinear point absorber wec is greatly affected by the sea conditions in the south china sea the joint probability distribution of h s and t p directly determines the concentrated region of the wec s long term captured power distribution in general a point absorber wec with bistable mechanism shows obvious advantages in long term power capture 2 the long term captured power and long term energy capture efficiency of a point absorber wec is significantly affected by the shape of buoy generally the linear and nonlinear wecs with hemispherical and circular truncated cone shaped buoys have better long term power capture performance in the south china sea 3 the effect of buoy size on the long term power performance of wecs varies with different float shapes and nonlinear parameters γ as the buoy size increases more wave energy is absorbed by the linear and nonlinear bistable pto systems in south china sea for the nonlinear pto system the influence of the buoy size on the long term power performance of the wec is weakened with the increase of nonlinear parameter 4 for the four different shapes of buoy in this study the long term power capture performance by the nonlinear point absorber wec is significantly better than that of linear wec in all of three buoy size and the bistable point absorber wec has better power capture performance with a smaller value of γ 0 γ 1 in the south china sea besides the influence of γ on long term captured power of the wecs is also related to the buoy shape and size it should be pointed out that only the numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the long term power capture performance of point absorber wecs with or without the bistable mechanism in south china sea and the relatively optimized parameters of the wec with better long term power performance are obtained in this study which also requires experimental verification and

20303,nowadays extensive research has been conducted to generate electricity from ocean waves but there are not too many studies on the capture of wave energy in a specific ocean area as the largest sea area in china s offshore waters the south china sea contains a large amount of wave energy and is regarded as a natural wave energy power plant a comparative study was conducted to investigate the effects of wave energy converter wec parameters on the long term power capture performance of a bistable point absorber wec installed in the south china sea in this paper combined with the joint probability distribution of significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p in south china sea a mathematical model was developed for the evaluation of long term power performance of wecs the governing equations of the point absorber wec were established using the hybrid frequency time domain method the dynamic response and captured power can be obtained after numerically solving the equations of motion with the 4th order runge kutta method the results show that the bistable mechanism has great advantages in the long term captured power of wec in general a circular truncated cone shaped buoy wec with a larger buoy size and smaller nonlinear parameter tend to result in better long term power capture performance the insights given in this study provide a motivation and foundation for developing a complete set of performance optimization methods of point absorber wecs installed in south china sea keywords point absorber wec bistable mechanism long term performance south china sea 1 introduction with the rapid development of the social economy human demand for resource is increasing the energy crisis has brought severe challenges to global scale and it has caused deterioration of human ecological environment in order to alleviate the shortage of resources finding clean new type resources and developing green energy industry has been a hot topic in the world as a renewable resource ocean wave energy has greater power density than solar and wind energy in the past few decades various wave energy converters wecs have been proposed the wecs were divided into different categories according to different classification criteria including point absorbers cruz 2008 fernandes and fonseca 2013 oscillating water columns owcs doyle and aggidis 2019 iino et al 2016 and overtopping devices terminators he et al 2013 vicinanza et al 2014 etc the point absorber wec has a simpler structure lower construction cost and can effectively capture wave energy in offshore regions generally more 40m depth lópez et al 2013 besides wave energy can be obtained by point absorber wecs in almost any directions due to their horizontal dimensions are much smaller than the wavelength therefore the point absorbers have attracted more and more attention according to the number of oscillating body point absorber wecs were divided into two types one was a single body buoy reacting against a fixed frame of reference the sea bed or a bottom fixed structure which captures energy from the motion of floating buoy lejerskog et al 2015 and the other was two body systems where the wave energy is converted from the relative motion between two oscillating bodies by the power take off pto system which are often conceptually simplified as a linear spring and damper liang and zuo 2017 based on the simplification and linear system assumption frequency domain models were widely used due to its simplicity and low computer requirements gomes et al 2012 in recent years numerous researches on the linear point absorber wecs have been conducted falnes 2002 studied a heaving buoy with linear pto system by building the frequency model and pointed out that resonance occurs when the natural frequency of the wec is close to the excitation frequency leading to an approximately maximum captured power eriksson et al 2005 presented numerical studies of a cylindrical point absorber with linear generator they concluded that wec has a highest conversion efficiency with the resonance condition but the energy captured power of wec was unsatisfactory in real ocean waves because the wave frequency was usually much lower than the resonance frequency as a result it prompted researchers to come up with possible solutions to improve the power capture performance of the point absorber wecs the nonlinear bistable mechanism which was first studied in vibration energy harvesting may perform well the bistable mechanism of a buckled beam was first discovered numerally and experimentally by tseng and dugundji 1971 following that a nonlinear mechanism consisting of a nonlinear hardening spring was proposed by burrow and clare 2007 and they described the benefits of using a hardening spring instead of a linear spring according to the simulation and experimental results theoretical and numerical studies on the nonlinear oscillators involving a linear impulsively loaded structure were presented by ma 2011 he concluded that a device designed with proper non linearity may harvest more energy than its linear counterpart when there is significant frequency mismatch a nonlinear bistable pto system consisting of two sym metrically oblique springs and a linear damper was proposed by zhang and yang 2015 their results showed that compared with linear pto system the nonlinear bistable pto system can increase the power captured by the oscillating body wec in irregular waves besides buoy shape and size were considered as influential factors of the power capture efficiency to a point absorber wec meanwhile as an incentive condition for wecs sea characteristics directly determined the efficiency of pto system for the purpose of designing efficient wecs several researches on the dynamic performances of various buoy with different shapes have been done in the last years beirão and malça 2014 investigated the hydrodynamics of several buoy geometries applied to a point absorber wec their analysis revealed that the spherical buoy geometry leads to best structural behavior but it is worth noting radius and mass of three buoys conical spherical and horizontal cylindrical were not the same after that the dynamics of two buoys conical and hemispherical with identical wave conditions were analyzed by pastor and liu 2014 they found that the conical buoy is slightly better than hemispherical buoy in power captured these two buoys had the same radius but different mass accordingly amiri et al 2016 compared the efficiency of four buoy shapes with the same mass and different radius in wave energy absorption goggins and finnegan 2014 explored a methodology which aims to optimise the structural geometric configuration for different radius devices at the atlantic marine energy test site vantorre et al 2004 examined the performance of heaving point absorbers with different geometry shapes in considered area which are located at the belgian coastal area of the north sea their results showed that power absorption performance appears to be wave height dependent the main purposes of the present study are to demonstrate the advantages of bistable power capture mechanism in long term energy absorption and to investigate the effect of wec parameters on the long term power capture performance laying the foundation for developing a performance optimization method in the future in addition this study will also provide a theoretical reference for the future study on the capture of wave energy in other sea areas of the world to achieve this a large number of numerical calculations were conducted to provide reliable datum in this paper the nonlinear bistable power capture mechanism proposed by zhang and yang 2015 is applied to a point absorber wec the long term power capture performance of the bistable point absorber wec installed at the south china sea is evaluated combined with the joint probability distribution of significant wave height h s and peak wave period t p in south china sea wen et al 2018 a mathematical model is developed for the evaluation of long term power performance of wecs hybrid time frequency domain method based on the cummins 1962 equation is utilized to establish the governing equations of the point absorber wec with both linear and nonlinear bistable pto systems subsequently the dynamic response and captured power for each sea state can be calculated numerically using 4th order runge kutta approach furthermore the effects of key wec parameters on the long term power capture performance of a bistable point absorber wec are studied in detail 2 model of the wec the schematic program of a point absorber wec with linear and non linear bistable pto system is shown in fig 1 a hemisphere buoy with the radius r is adopted as the geometry of the converter the hemisphere is rigidly connected to the pto system and it is assumed to only heave motion the mass of the hemisphere buoy is m 2 ρ π r 3 3 ρ is the density of seawater 1025 k g m 3 fig 1 a is the point absorber converter with a linear pto system which is composed of a linear spring and a linear damper fig 1 b is the point absorber converter with a non linear bistable mechanism proposed by zhang and yang 2015 unlike a linear converter it consists of a damper and two symmetrically oblique springs only heave motion of the hemisphere buoy is considered for simplified cases due to the axisymmetric characteristics of the hemisphere geometry one directional incident waves are considered besides the draught of the hemisphere floater in equilibrium condition equals to its radius and waves of the south china sea are chosen as calculated waves it can be seen from fig 1 z is the direction of heave motion and is positive upward l is half of the horizontal distance between the two oblique spring feet l 0 is the original length of both springs θ is the inclination of the two springs corresponding to the initial length and k 0 is the stiffness of the two springs and the stiffness of spring in the linear pto system is chosen as k 2 k 0 for both linear and non linear pto system the equivalent damping coefficient is marked as c the damping coefficient c shown in the figure is only the equivalent damping defined in the physical sense which can be physically achieved with linear damping mechanical damping or hydraulic damping in practical applications as a preliminary study this paper focuses on solving the capturing force of wec by establishing a simplified mathematical model however as for how to physically realize the damping of pto system in practical application it will be discussed in detail in the following research more importantly a bistable parameter γ is defined as ratio of horizontal distance l to original length of oblique springs i e 1 γ l l 0 based on the researches of zhang et al 2014 the static characteristics of snap trough mechanism are briefly summarized a the snap through mechanism with two oblique springs leads to negative stiffness and the strength of the negative stiffness depends on the value of γ and its strength gets larger as γ 0 γ 1 becomes smaller the negative stiffness disappears when γ 1 b the snap through pto system is characteristic of double well potential as the γ decreases the potential barrier between the two wells increases when γ 1 the potential barrier of non linear pto system disappears like the linear system in addition there are three equilibrium positions in the non linear pto system corresponding to two possible kinds of motion 3 dynamic response of the wec 3 1 wave spectrum as the input conditions for the wave energy capture system the analysis of the wave spectrum is particularly important in this work the northern south china sea is selected as the intended deployment site due to its abundance of wave energy resources according to the studies of wen et al 2018 the joint probability distribution of average annual significant wave height h s and wave averaged period t av in the south china sea from january 1988 to december 2011 are presented at table 1 the background color in the table reflects the probability of occurrence of each wave condition where the integer refers to the number of occurrences it is divided by the total number of wave occurrences 64210 to get the probability of occurrence expressed as a percentage as shown in table 1 most of the significant wave height are below 4 5 m and its maximum probability occur in the range of 0 5 2 5m the average wave period is mostly distributed in the 3 5 9 5s especially in the range of 3 5 6 5s according to the works of zheng et al 2012 t p 1 2t av should be taken in the calculation random waves are considered to be closest to real waves and they are extremely irregular in this calculation jonswap spectrum hasselmann et al 1973 is adopted to simulate the waves in the south china sea the wave spectral density function s f is presented as 2 s f α h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 5 4 1 t p f 4 χ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 where f is the wave frequency h s is the significant wave height t p is the peak period of jonswap spectrum χ is the peak elevation factor whose value is within the range of 1 5 6 and it taken as 3 3 in this calculation σ is the peak shape parameter its value is defined as 3 σ 0 07 if f f p 0 09 if f f p α is a parameter related to the peak elevation factor χ 4 α 0 0624 0 230 0 0336 χ 0 185 1 9 χ since circular frequency ω is commonly used in analysis the jonswap spectrum density function can also be expressed as 5 s ω 320 38 h s 2 t p 4 ω 5 exp 1948 18 t p ω 4 χ exp ω ω p 1 2 2 σ 2 approximately replacing the peak period of irregular wave t p with the wave average period t a v in the table 1 the wave spectrum of the south china sea in each sea state can be obtained by eq 2 or eq 5 for the time history calculation of wave spectrum it should be formed by superposing a sufficiently large number n of regular wave components with different amplitudes circular frequency and random phases the time series of waves can be described as 6 ζ t i 1 a ω i cos ω i t ε i i 1 n a ω i cos ω i t ε i where ζ is wave elevation n is a sufficiently large positive integer a ω i is the amplitude of the ith wavelet ω i is the circular frequency of the ith wavelet ε i is the random phases of the ith wavelet its value is evenly distributed within the range of 0 2π and k i is the number of wave in a length of 2π 7 ω i ω 0 i δ ω i 0 1 2 n 1 where ω 0 is the lowest wave frequency component δ ω is a small frequency interval the amplitude of the ith wavelet can be represented by the given wave spectral density 8 a ω i 2 s ω i δ ω the wave spectrum density and wave time series of the most probable sea states h s 0 5m t av 4 5s in the south china sea are shown in the fig 2 in order to clearly observe the wave form the wave surface elevation time series of a small section of irregular wave in fig 2 b is displayed with a zoomed in version 3 2 the equation of motion due to the non linearity of the system frequency domain method is no longer applicable thus time domain method based on the cummins 1962 equation is adopted to analyze the dynamic response of a point absorber wec with nonlinear snap through pto system in south china sea in the case of considering only heave motion the equation of motion for the nonlinear wec see fig 1 b can be expressed as 9 m a z z t 0 t k z t τ z τ d τ c z t ρ g s z t k 1 l 0 z 2 l 2 z t f e i r r e g u l a r similarly the equation of heave motion for the linear wec see fig 1 a can be expressed as 10 m a z z t 0 t k z t τ z τ d τ c z t ρ g s k z t f e i r r e g u l a r where z t z t and z t represents the displacement velocity and acceleration of heave motion respectively the positive direction of heave motion is defined as shown in fig 1 a z is the added mass of the floater as the wave frequency ω approaches infinity f e irregular is the wave excitation force on the float in irregular waves s is the area of the cross section of the floater and s πr 2 for a hemispherical buoy c is the equivalent damping coefficient of both linear and nonlinear pto system k is the stiffness of spring for the linear pto system and twice the stiffness k 0 of each spring for the nonlinear snap through system ρ is the density of sea water g is the acceleration of gravity m is the mass of hemispherical floater with values of 2πρr 3 3 the convolution terms in eq 9 and eq 10 indicate the memory effect of fluid in the radiation forces the time domain retardation function k z t related to the radiation damping coefficient of heave motion can be expressed as 11 k z t 2 π 0 b z ω cos ω t d ω since the size of the float is much smaller than the sea depth at the installation location it is reasonable to assume that the water depth is infinite during the following calculations for linear and nonlinear wecs the radius of hemisphere is r 5m the density of sea water is ρ 1025 kg m3 the acceleration of gravity is g 9 81 m s2 the mass of hemispherical floater is m 2πρr 3 3 and the area of the cross section of the hemisphere is s πr 2 according to vicente et al 2013 the equivalent stiffness of the pto system is usually about 10 of the hydrostatic recovery coefficient of the floater in this calculation k 0 1ρgs the wave excitation force of the hemispherical buoy in irregular waves can be superposed by components in regular waves faltinsen 1993 for a given regular wave with circular frequency ω and amplitude a ω the moduli of wave excitation force is proportional to the amplitude of the regular wave i e f e r e g u l a r γ z ω a ω where f e r e g u l a r is the moduli of wave excitation force in regular waves and γ z ω is the wave excitation force coefficient falnes 2002 explored the relationship between the wave excitation force and the incident wave amplitude of an axisymmetric floater doing heave motion in deep water giving an analytical result of wave excitation force coefficient as 12 γ z ω 2 g 3 ρ b z ω ω 3 where b z ω is the radiation damping coefficient of floater in the heave motion this equation is also known as haskind relation the added mass and radiation damping as well as wave excitation force of the hemispherical buoy in the heave motion are calculated using sesam 2013 developed by dnv gl classification society in order to verify the accuracy of the hydrodynamic parameters the numerical solutions are compared with the research by hulme 1982 as shown in fig 3 additionally based on the research by falnes 2002 and finnegan et al 2013 the calculation accuracy of wave excitation forces that acting on bodies with different geometries are verified in fig 4 the results show good agreement which illustrates the reliability of the numerical solutions combining eq 8 the wave excitation force of a hemispherical buoy in irregular waves can be obtained by superimposing a considerably large number n of regular wave components 13 f e i r r e g u l a r i 1 n γ z ω i a ω i cos ω i t ϕ i ε i where ϕ i is the phase of the wave excitation force for the ith regular wave component and ε i is a random number uniformly distributed in 0 2π 3 3 state space model the convolution terms in the time domain motion eqs 9 and 10 result in a slower and inconvenient calculation for the analysis of dynamic response of converters therefore the state space model alves 2012 is used to replace the convolution term the general form of a state space model is 14 x t a x t b u t y t c x t where u t and y t are input and output variable of state space respectively x t is the state vector and a b c are constant coefficient matrices of the state space model for eqs 9 and 10 the input variable is heave velocity z t and the impulse response function is retardation function k z t thus the convolution term can be replaced by the state space model as 15 x t a x t b z t i z t c x t where i z t 0 t k z t τ z τ d τ is the radiation force considering the memory effects of the fluid in time domain after replacing the convolution term with a state space model the constant coefficient matrices a b and c of the model need to be solved this process is also called system identification taghipour et al 2008 in the frequency domain the kernel function is expressed as a function related to the added mass and damping coefficient by fourier transformation 16 k z j ω 0 k z τ e j ω τ d τ b z ω j ω a z ω a z where j is an imaginary unit the nonlinear least square method is adopted to find a suitable function k ˆ z that approximates k z j ω for a given series of circular frequencies following the restrictions indicated by perez and fossen 2011 the transfer function k ˆ z is defined as 17 k ˆ s θ p n 1 s n 1 p n 2 s n 2 p 1 s p 0 s n q n 1 s n 1 q 1 s q 0 where s j ω and n is called the order of the transfer function θ p n 1 p n 2 p 0 q n 1 q n 2 q 0 is a set of coefficients that can be obtained using the nonlinear least square method the coefficient matrices and vectors of state space model which approximately replace the convolution integral can be written as 18 a q n 1 q n 2 q 1 q 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 b 1 0 0 0 0 c p n 1 p n 2 p 1 p 0 for the hemispherical wec in this study the identification results of retardation function and added mass and radiation damping are shown in the figs 5 and 6 respectively as shown in two figures when the order of the system is chosen as n 5 the identification results of the retardation function fit well with the original data in frequency domain the results of coefficient matrices and vectors for state space model in the eq 15 are 19 a 4 1277 8 7671 8 9511 4 5997 0 7243 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 b 1 0 0 0 0 c 94522 440006 397639 64449 0 based on the eq 15 the eqs 9 and 10 can again be written by using the state space model as 20 m a z z t c x t c z t ρ g s z t k 1 l 0 z 2 l 2 z t f e i r

g s k m a z λ 1 c m a z λ 2 c m a z x f e i r r e g u l a r m a z f 3 f 4 f 5 f 6 f 7 a x b λ 2 according to eqs 22 and 23 the displacement and velocity of buoy for the linear and nonlinear wecs can be numerically solved by using 4th runge kutta method the accuracy of the numerical solution with the 4th runge kutta method is validated in section 3 5 3 4 power capture performance after the discrete time results of displacement and velocity are obtained the average power captured by converters with linear pto system and nonlinear bistable mechanism in each sea state are calculated numerically using the following expression 24 p 1 t 0 t c z 2 d t where t is the time period for the average power calculation c is the equivalent damping of the pto system z indicates the heave velocity related to the time t in order to further study the effects of wec parameters on the long term power performance two physical quantities are introduced in the following one of them is the wave energy transport p w a v e which represents the wave energy passing through a section of unit width per unit time in the direction perpendicular to the incident wave faltinsen 1993 for regular waves with frequency ω the expression of wave energy transport can be written as 25 p w a v e ω 1 2 ρ g v g ω h a 2 where ρ is the sea water density g is the gravity acceleration a is the wave amplitude v g ω h is the wave group velocity which is expressed as 26 v g ω h g 2 ω tanh k h 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where h is the water depth k denotes the wave number ω and k satisfy the dispersion relation considering the irregular waves in real sea states the power per meter of the wave crest length is given by younesian and alam 2017 27 p w a v e ρ g 0 v g ω h s ω d ω ρ g 2 h s 2 32 0 ω 1 s ω d ω 0 s ω d ω where h s is the significant wave height s ω is the jonswap spectrum density function it refers to eq 5 another dimensionless physical quantity is energy capture width ratio η which indicates to the ratio of the average captured power of the wec to the wave energy transport within the width of the buoy it can be obtained by the formula as 28 η p d p w a v e where p is the average power obtained by eq 24 d is the diameter of the buoy at the waterline plane and p w a v e is the power per meter of the wave crest length since η reflects the energy capture efficiency of the wec in some extent it becomes a more significant indicator for evaluating the power performance of wec compared with the average captured power therefore the long term power capture performance of the wecs is evaluated by utilizing the p l t and η l t combined with the joint probability distribution of the south china sea waves it can be written as formula 29 p l t i 1 m j 1 n p i j ξ i j m 11 n 13 30 η l t i 1 m j 1 n p i j ξ i j d i 1 m j 1 n p w a v e i j ξ i j m 11 n 13 where i j are subscripts which respectively correspond to the position coordinates of each sea state h s t p in table 1 m and n are the measured number of significant wave height and average period in the south china sea respectively p i j and p w a v e i j are the average captured power and wave energy transport separately under each sea state it can refer to eq 24 and eq 27 ξ i j is distribution probability of each significant wave height and average period see table 1 p lt and η l t indicate the long term captured power and long term energy capture width ratio of the wecs respectively for the point absorber wec with the linear pto system in regular waves the heave motion equation of the floater can be expressed as 31 m a z ω z b z ω c z ρ g s k z f e r e g u l a r where f e regular is the wave excitation force of the floater which does heave motion in regular waves by performing fourier transform on the eq 31 the frequency domain motion equation of the linear converter in regular waves can be obtained and we can get 32 z f e r e g u l a r ω 2 m a z ω j ω b z ω c ρ g s k where z and f e regular are the fourier transform results of z and f e regular respectively the time averaged power captured by the linear wec is written as 33 p 1 2 c ω 2 z 2 1 8 b z ω f e r e g u l a r 2 b z ω 2 u f e r e g u l a r 2 b z ω 2 where u j ω z is the fourier transform of the heaving velocity of the floater it can be seen from the eq 33 the average power p reaches the maximum value with u f e r e g u l a r 2 b z substituting it into the eq 32 can be acquired 34 ω r ρ g s k m a z ω r 35 c b b z ω r equation 34 indicates the conditions for the resonance event between the oscillating body and the wave ω r represents the resonant frequency at this condition the linear wec reaches the maximum power absorption and eq 35 shows that the damping coefficient of the linear pto system should be equal to the radiation damping of the floater in order to harvest the maximum power at the resonance frequency in this study the c b in eq 35 is defined as the basic damping coefficient moreover the basic damping coefficient is usually used as the initial damping to explore the influence of the damping of the pto system on the long term power performance of wecs 3 5 validation of numerical solutions the accuracy of the numerical solutions obtained in this study is tested in two steps first the accuracy of the 4th runge kutta method is verified by comparing the long term captured power of linear wecs in the frequency domain and time domain calculated with different sets of random phase ε between 0 and 2π second the non linear pto system is considered and the convergence of the numerical results is validated by comparing the long term captured power of nonlinear wecs at different time steps δt with different sets of random phase ε the time steps employed for testing the results are 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 s finally five different sets of random phase angles are generated at each time step to model the irregular waves of the real sea states considered in this study the long term captured power generated by both the linear and non linear wec of which the float is a hemisphere with the radius 5 m the draft of the buoy is 5 m and the nonlinear parameter γ is 0 01 is calculated and the numerical results are presented in table 2 the frequency domain and time domain calculation results of linear wec are in good agreement since the frequency domain results are generally considered accurate the results of the linear wec verify the validity of the 4th runge kutta method the time domain results show that the long term captured power does not differ with changing sets of random phase angles the difference between each result corresponding to each set of random phase angles and the average value of long term captured power corresponding to these random phase is less than 1 in all cases furthermore the differences of the numerical results at different time steps are insignificant and the convergence of the results is also clearly observed consequently 4th runge kutta method is chosen for evaluating the motion response of the wecs in waves with a time step of 0 1 s duo to the shorter calculation time of this time step 4 results and discussion this section demonstrates the distribution of the long term captured power of wecs in the south china sea and discusses the effect of characteristic parameters on the long term power performance of wecs based on the motion response of the buoy some reasonable explains are given for the influence of these parameters on the long term power performance while a heavy or large sized float helps to increase the energy absorbed by a wec this type of buoy geometry also causes the cost of production to increase since the hemisphere generally has better hydrodynamic performance and taking into account the economy of the wec in this study the hemisphere is considered as the basic shape of the float and its initial radius is r 5m based on the researches by vicente et al 2013 the stiffness coefficient of the pto system is chosen as k 0 1ρgs moreover according to eqs 34 and 35 wecs with buoys of different shapes have different resonance frequencies and basic damping by changing the multiple of the basic damping in the calculation the influence of the damping coefficient of the pto system on the long term power performance of wecs with different buoys is studied 4 1 long term captured power distribution according to the statistics of the south china sea state in table 1 the average captured power of the linear wec in each sea state is calculated by changing the values of h s and t p in the jonswap spectrum expression eq 5 the average capture energy of the linear wec under various happened sea state can be obtained as shown in fig 7 based on the joint probability distribution of the significant wave height and wave average period the long term captured power distribution of the linear wec can be further obtained as shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 7 that for the linear wec with a hemispherical floater radius of 5m the average captured power is greatly affected by wave parameters in general the linear wec will absorb more wave energy as the significant wave height increases this possible reason for this phenomenon is that the large wave height causes violent heave motion of the buoy however the effect of the peak frequency on the average power captured by the linear pto system is not similar for the linear wec the captured power reaches the maximum as the peak frequency is close to the natural frequency of the device due to the particularity of the sea conditions the average power distribution of the linear wec is mainly concentrated in the range of large significant wave height and low peak frequencies as shown in fig 8 it can be observed that the long term captured power distribution of the linear wec is significant different from the average power distribution in fig 7 as the joint probability distribution of significant wave height and average period is considered the long term captured power of the linear wec is mainly concentrated in the low spectral peak frequency ω p 1 5 rad s region where the significant wave height is less than 4 5m and the long term captured power reaches the maximum when the h s is equal to 2m and the peak frequency is close to 0 7 rad s it indicates that the energy absorbed of the wec in practical applications is not only related to wave parameters but more importantly it will be affected by the specific sea condition of the installation site for the nonlinear wec the nonlinear parameter γ is taken as 0 1 and the initial length l 0 of the spring is chosen as 2m it s similar to the linear wec the average power distribution of the nonlinear wec with bistable mechanism in each happened sea state can be calculated are shown in fig 9 the long term captured power distribution is further gained by combing the joint probability distribution of h s and t av table 1 as shown in fig 10 compared with the linear wec the similar average power distribution rules of the nonlinear wec are presented in fig 9 the average captured power of the nonlinear wec with a bistable parameter γ of 0 1 will absorb more energy as the h s increasing to 6 5m the maximum average power captured by the nonlinear wec is greater than that of the linear wec in each h s case the peak frequency corresponding to the maximum average power of the nonlinear wec is lower than the natural frequency of the pto system since the dual well characteristic of the bistable mechanism the larger wave energy can be captured by the nonlinear pto system at a lower peak frequency zhang et al 2014 it can be seen from fig 10 the nonlinear wec with a hemispherical floater radius of 5 m achieves the maximum long term captured power when the h s is 1 5m and the t p is close to 1 rad s and the maximum long term captured power of the nonlinear wec is almost twice that of the linear wec considering the joint probability distribution of the h s and t av in the south china sea the long term captured power distribution of the nonlinear wec is the same as the linear wec however the power capture performance of the nonlinear wec in various wave conditions is better than that of the linear wec besides the long term power capture performance of the linear and nonlinear wecs is also affected to varying degrees due to the sea conditions at the actual installation site in order to demonstrate the reliability of numerical calculations it is necessary to verify the accuracy of the results however only part of the verification results are shown in this paper due to the limitation of the length of the paper at the same it should be noted that all calculation results in section 4 have been validated for accuracy adopting the similar methods the long term captured power of wecs with a hemispherical buoy of radius 5m calculated by different time steps and different sets of random phase angles are illustrated in table 3 the calculation results show good numerical convergence 4 2 the effect of buoy shape on long term power performance based on the hemispherical buoy several common buoy geometries are designed as shown in fig 11 in order to eliminate the influence of secondary factors on the power performance these geometries are designed to have the same volume as the hemispherical buoy in addition it is ensured that these buoy geometries have the same mass and as equal water plane area as possible in the discussion about the influence of buoy geometry three groups of different calculation cases were selected for comparison the detailed design parameters of wecs are shown in table 4 it is well known that the hydrodynamic parameters of the buoy are significantly affected by its geometric shape a well designed shape will greatly improve the hydrodynamic performance of the buoy according to eq 29 30 and table 1 the long term captured power of the linear and nonlinear wecs with four different shapes of buoys in the south china sea is investigated the nonlinear parameters γ of the bistable pto in the calculation are selected as 0 01 0 1 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 respectively results of the long term prediction of the wecs with different buoy shapes are given in figs 12 and 13 where a b c represent different test cases shown in table 4 from fig 12 it is obvious that the geometric shape of the buoy has a significant effect on the long term captured power of both linear and nonlinear wec the extent of influence will vary with the size of the buoy and the nonlinear parameters γ for the linear wec see fig 12 a the difference in long term absorbed power among wecs with the different shape buoys changes is significant but this difference is less affected by the size of the buoys the maximum difference can reach about 7 kw this means that the linear wec with a circular truncated cone shaped buoy is better than the one with a combination buoy in the long term power performance for the nonlinear wec see fig 12 b f the bistable pto system using circular truncated cone buoy shows greater advantages compared with other geometrical buoy this advantage is related to the size of the buoy and nonlinear parameter γ when the nonlinear parameter γ is set to 0 01 the maximum difference of the power captured by the nonlinear wecs with various buoy shapes is about 15 kw as the γ increases the effect of buoy shape on the long term power performance of the point absorber wec with nonlinear pto system is weakened until the γ is equal to 0 9 the power performance of the nonlinear wec is similar to that of the linear wec affected by the buoy shape this may be explained as the negative stiffness of the spring in the nonlinear bistable system is disappeared under the critical state of γ 1 zhang et al 2014 at this time the potential energy curve of the nonlinear pto system no longer has the double well characteristic similar to the long term captured power the long term energy capture width ratio of the wecs is also affected by the shape of buoys as shown in fig 13 in addition the variation trends of them affected by the buoy shapes are almost the same this demonstrates that although the long term capture width ratio represents the long term energy capture efficiency of the wec it can also be used to estimate the long term power capture performance of the wec in the same sea conditions regardless of linear or nonlinear pto system wec with a circular truncated cone shaped buoy has the largest long term power capture efficiency for the linear pto system the long term power capture efficiency of the wec with a circular truncated cone shaped buoy is about twice as large as that of the wec with a combination shaped buoy see fig 13 a for the nonlinear pto system the long term energy capture efficiency of wec reaches the maximum when γ is 0 01 and the r is 6 m and the effect of the buoy shape on the long term capture efficiency of wec is attenuated with the increases of γ see fig 13 b f in general the long term power capture performance of both linear and nonlinear wec with a circular truncated cone buoy in the south china sea is better than other buoy shapes however the hemispherical buoy may also be an excellent geometry when considering multiple factors and it is worth noting the choice of buoy shape will also be affected by the sea conditions of the actual installation site the comparison diagram of the time series of the heave velocity of the truncated cone float with a waterline plane radius of 6m and that of the heave velocity of several other floats is illustrated in fig 14 the results show that the heave motion of the circular truncated cone float is more violent in the whole calculation time period with the same wave condition especially when compared with the cylindrical and combined float the effect is more obvious it can be seen from eq 24 that the power captured by wec is directly related to the damping of the pto system and the heave velocity of the float the good motion characteristics of the truncated cone float and its large basic damping make the wec with the circular truncated cone float show superior long term power performance compared with other float geometries the numerical results of the long term captured power of linear and nonlinear wecs with different shape of buoy obtained by employing different time steps are shown in table 5 in the verification of the results the radius of the float is 6m see table 4 and the nonlinear parameter is 0 01 the calculation results in the table illustrate that the numerical results of long term captured power have good convergence for both linear and nonlinear wecs 4 3 the effect of buoy size on long term power performance as written by the time domain motion equations i e eq 9 10 for linear and nonlinear wec the size of buoy further affects the power capture performance of the wec by changing the hydrodynamic quantities since the size of the designed buoy is directly related to the construction cost in practical applications it is necessary to study the influence of buoy size on the long term power performance of the pto system the size of buoy refers to the geometric parameters in table 2 and the γ of the bistable pto system are selected respectively as 0 01 0 1 0 3 0 7 and 0 9 the long term captured power and the long term energy capture width ratio of the linear and nonlinear wecs with the different sizes of buoy are shown in figs 15 and 16 respectively it can be seen from fig 15 that the long term captured power of both linear and nonlinear wec in the south china sea will be affected by the size of buoy and the different results are presented for the various buoy shapes and nonlinear parameters as the size of buoy increases more wave energy can be absorbed by linear and nonlinear pto system in the long term the long term captured power of the wec with combinational buoy is almost linearly proportional to the waterline plane radius of the buoy the effect of the size or mass of the buoy on the power captured by the wec is consistent with the results researched by erselcan and kukner 2020 for the wec with the combinational buoy composed of a cylinder and a hemisphere the long term power performance is less affected by the buoy size than other geometric shapes furthermore the effect of the buoy size on the long term power performance is also related to the nonlinear parameter of the wec compared with the linear wec the long term captured power of the point absorber wec with nonlinear bistable pto is greatly affected by the buoy size this may be attributed to the higher average power can be absorbed by nonlinear wec in the same buoy size as indicated in fig 15 b f the influence of the buoy size on the long term power performance of the nonlinear pto system is weakened with the increases of γ it should be noted that a wec with the nonlinear pto system can capture the same long term power as a linear wec with a large size buoy under a smaller buoy size or even greater as illustrated in fig 15 for buoys of the same shape the long term captured power of the nonlinear wec with a buoy of waterline plane radius 4m in fig 15 b and that of the nonlinear wec with a buoy of waterline plane radius 5m in fig 15 c are greater than that of the linear wec with a buoy of waterline plane radius 6m in fig 15 a this result is particularly important for practical engineering applications it can be found from fig 16 that the effect of the buoy size on the long term energy capture width ratio of the wec with or without bistable pto system is slightly different from that on the long term captured power the reason for this phenomenon can be explained from the perspective of physical meaning of them the long term captured power of the wec reflects the amount of the wave energy captured by the pto system over a long period of time including the concept of absolute however the long term energy capture width ratio of wec is a dimensionless physical quantity it reflects the relative quality of the long term power capture performance regardless of the shape of the buoy the long term power capture efficiency of wec promotes as the buoy size increases therefore it can be fully illustrated that the wec with a larger buoy size has better long term power capture performance combining the results of figs 15 and 16 the slope of the curve in the fig 16 represents the extent of influence of buoy size on long term energy capture efficiency for the linear pto system the long term power capture efficiency of the wecs with different buoy shapes are nearly the same extent affected by the size of the buoy see fig 16 a for the nonlinear pto system the long term energy capture efficiency of the wec lifts with the buoy size increases and that of the wec with a truncated cone shaped float is always the highest see fig 16 b f it is worth mentioning that the effect of the buoy size on the long term power capture efficiency of the bistable pto system is weakened with the increases of γ but the degree of this weakening is not very significant besides the effect of the buoy size on the long term power capture efficiency of the wec is also closely to the shape of the buoy when is 0 01 the long term power capture efficiency of wec with a hemispherical shaped buoy is most affected by the size of the buoy although the long term power performance of the pto system to absorb the wave energy can be significantly improved by increasing the buoy size it should also be considered in combination with the buoy shape of wec and the nonlinear parameter γ of the pto system at the same time the construction cost of the wec and sea state of the specific installation site cannot be ignored the numerical results for the long term captured power of linear and nonlinear wecs with floats of different sizes are given in table 6 in the verification of the results a circular truncated cone buoy is selected and the nonlinear parameter is 0 01 the results in the table show that the numerical results of the long term captured power have good convergence for both linear and nonlinear wecs 4 4 the effect of the damping coefficient of the pto system on long term power performance in addition to the physical properties of the buoy shape and size the damping coefficient of the pto system has a direct influence on the long term power performance of the wec for a wec with a given buoy shape and size an optimal damping coefficient can be uniquely determined within a certain range for different nonlinear parameters since the power performance of the nonlinear wec is generally better the effect of different damping coefficients on the long term captured power of the nonlinear wec is mainly explored in this section to obtain the optimal damping of the pto system with different nonlinear parameters the radius of the buoy is selected to be 5 m and the long term captured power changes with the damping coefficient are calculated for the wec with different shapes of floats as presented in fig 17 for nonlinear wecs with different float shapes and different nonlinear parameters the long term captured power is affected by the damping coefficient of the pto system with similar trends in general as the damping of the pto system increases the long term captured power of the nonlinear wec increases firstly and then decreases in addition for buoys of a given shape and size the long term power performance of wecs with small nonlinear parameters is always better than that of wecs with large nonlinear parameters under the same damping of pto system 0 γ 1 as illustrated in fig 17 the two vertical gray dashed lines represent the optimal damping interval of the nonlinear wec which contains the optimal damping corresponding to different nonlinear parameters in the range of small damping coefficient the long term capture power of wec can be significantly increased by increasing the damping of pto system however adjusting the damping of the pto system near the optimal damping interval will not significantly improve the power performance of the wec and may even reduce the power capture of the wec it is worth noting that the width of the optimal damping interval is closely related to the shape of the buoy furthermore the variation curve of the optimal damping of the pto system with the nonlinear parameters is plotted in fig 18 as mentioned in section 3 4 different shapes of floats have different basic damping due to different hydrodynamic coefficients the c bmax of the ordinate in fig 18 is the basic damping of the circular truncated cone buoy it can be seen from the figure that the optimal damping of wec increases with the increase of nonlinear parameters especially in the range of 0 γ 0 1 the optimal damping is more observably affected by γ this may be explained by the fact that the nonlinear pto system makes the motion of the float relatively violent when γ is small the capture power of the wec is dominated by the heave velocity while the smaller damping increases the velocity of the float to obtain the maximum captured power a detailed description of the motion of the float can be referred to section 4 5 this means that the optimal damping can be decided according to the specific nonlinear parameters of wecs in engineering design and the damping of the pto system can be reduced by decreasing γ the economic benefits of wave energy utilization are maximized by absorbing more energy at lower cost 4 5 the effect of the nonlinear parameter on long term power performance as proposed by zhang et al 2014 the power capture performance of the wec with nonlinear bistable pto system is affected by the nonlinear parameter γ which determines the strength of the negative stiffness and the region with negative stiffness for the wec with a given buoy shape and size it is also a significant issue to reasonably select the non linear parameters of the pto system so that the wec has the best long term power performance in the sea conditions at the installation location in this study we choose the original length of the oblique spring l 0 equal to 2m with a set of different values of γ varying from 0 01 to 0 9 for different float shapes take their respective basic damping as the damping of the pto system in the calculation thus the long term captured power and the long term energy capture width ratio of the point absorber wec with different values of γ or without the bistable pto system can be obtained as shown in figs 19 and 20 respectively combined with the sea state of the south china sea the long term captured power of both linear and nonlinear wec in various buoy shapes is calculated respectively it can be seen from fig 19 a that for a hemispherical buoy considered in different waterline plane radius the long term power captured by the point absorber wec with nonlinear bistable pto systems is larger than that of linear wec in all of three different buoy size as the size of buoy increasing nonlinear wec has more obvious advantages in long term power capture performance the nonlinear parameter γ has an effect on the long term power performance of the nonlinear wec generally the nonlinear wec can capture a larger amount of power with a smaller value of γ over the long term and when the value of γ is close to 1 the effect on the long term power captured by nonlinear wec is weakened the influence of γ on long term captured power of the wecs will also be disturbed by other factors such as float parameters as the buoy size increases the long term captured power of the wec is more affected by nonlinear parameter γ the long term evaluation of power capture performance of a point absorber wec with cylindrical and circular truncated cone buoys are given in fig 19 b and c respectively comparing fig 19 a c it can be found that the long term captured power of a point absorber wec with these three buoy shapes has similar changes under the effect of the γ however for the results shown in fig 19 d the effect of the γ on the long term power capture performance of the wec with a combinational buoy is different from that of the wec with the other three shapes of buoy as the value of the γ is set to 0 01 the long term power capture performance of a point absorber wec with combinational buoy is significant superior to that of other value of γ at this time the long term captured power of the nonlinear wec is almost linearly proportional to the waterline plane radius of buoy for the same float shape and size the long term energy capture width ratio of wec is significantly affected by the γ as shown in fig 20 generally speaking the long term energy capture efficiency of a point absorber wec with the bistable pto system decreases with the increases of γ 0 γ 1 but it is significantly greater than that of linear wec and as the γ increases the effect of γ on the long term energy capture efficiency of the wec is weakened additionally the influence of γ on the long term energy capture efficiency of wec is also disturbed by other factors such as the shape and size of the buoy this denotes that when the shape and size of the buoy are determined the long term power capture efficiency of a bistable point absorber wec in the south china sea can be improved by appropriately increasing γ on the contrary for a given γ the point absorber wec with the highest long term power capture efficiency can also be designed by selecting the shape and size of the buoy reasonably according to the calculation results in fig 20 it can be seen that the long term energy capture efficiency of the nonlinear wec with a circular truncated cone shaped buoy in the south china sea reaches the maximum value of 0 25 when γ is 0 01 and r is 6m two high incidence sea states t av 4 5s h s 0 5m t av 5 5s h s 1 5m were selected from table 1 to calculate the float motion response and the acting force of the pto system of linear and nonlinear wec with a circular truncated cone body with a radius of 6m respectively the time domain results are presented in figs 21 and 22 it can be clearly observed from figs 21 and 22 that the motion of the buoy of the nonlinear wec under the two wave conditions is more violent than the linear wec and the corresponding pto force is also greater according to falnes 2002 research the maximum power is captured under the condition that the wave excitation force is in phase with the velocity of the float this is the basic principle for many control methods such as latching and declutching control applied to wecs to improve their power capture performance compared with fig 21 the strange behavior the floater displacement and the pto force oscillate around the extreme value for a period of time and with positive negative switching on a seemingly arbitrary timescale shown in fig 22 is actually caused by the nonlinear wec with the bistable mechanism in irregular waves the bistable mechanism makes the phase of the floater velocity close to the phase of the wave excitation force this is exactly the advantage of the bistable mechanism as a passive mechanical component in the power capture performance of the point absorber wec which is similar to the beneficial effects achieved by the application of active control methods this behavior is also consistent with the phase control feature of the adaptive bistable mechanism proposed by zhang et al 2019 the velocity of the heave motion for both linear and nonlinear wecs as well as time series of irregular wave excitation force is illustrated by fig 23 a as indicated in the rectangular box obviously the time series of velocity of the nonlinear bistable wec show a phase closer to the wave excitation force than its linear counterpart in order to give a more detailed explanation the cross correlation function ccf is adopted to obtain the time lag between the heave motion velocity of the buoy and the wave excitation force for v z t and f e t the ccf is defined as δ τ t 1 t 2 v z t τ f e t d t the time lag between v z t and f e t is denoted by the value of τ corresponding to the maximum value of the cross correlation function δ t based on the above definition for the time interval 3647 3658 marked by the rectangular in fig 23 a the time lag between the heave velocity and wave excitation force is 1 for the nonlinear bistable wec and 8 for the linear wec see fig 23 b therefore the long term power performance of the nonlinear wec is generally better than that of the linear wec furthermore it is necessary to point out that the motion and pto force limits of a real wec need to be strictly determined considering the specific implementation device to ensure the safety of the structure the numerical results for the long term captured power of linear and nonlinear wecs with different nonlinear parameters are given in table 7 in the verification of the results a circular truncated cone buoy is selected and the waterline plane radius is 5m the results in the table show that the numerical results of the long term captured power have good convergence for both linear and nonlinear wecs with various γ 5 conclusions a mathematical model for the long term power evaluation is developed to investigate the long term power capture performance of the bistable point absorber wec in south china sea combining the joint probability distribution of significant wave height h s and wave average period t p of south china sea the long term captured power of a point absorber wec can be easily and conveniently obtained to demonstrate the advantages of the bistable power capture mechanism in long term wave energy absorption a comparative study on the power performance of point absorber wecs is conducted from the control variable analysis of the calculated data the effects of key wec parameters on the long term power capture performance are discussed in detail including both the geometrical parameters of buoy and the nonlinear parameters of the pto system based on the numerical results conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the long term power capture performance of both linear and nonlinear point absorber wec is greatly affected by the sea conditions in the south china sea the joint probability distribution of h s and t p directly determines the concentrated region of the wec s long term captured power distribution in general a point absorber wec with bistable mechanism shows obvious advantages in long term power capture 2 the long term captured power and long term energy capture efficiency of a point absorber wec is significantly affected by the shape of buoy generally the linear and nonlinear wecs with hemispherical and circular truncated cone shaped buoys have better long term power capture performance in the south china sea 3 the effect of buoy size on the long term power performance of wecs varies with different float shapes and nonlinear parameters γ as the buoy size increases more wave energy is absorbed by the linear and nonlinear bistable pto systems in south china sea for the nonlinear pto system the influence of the buoy size on the long term power performance of the wec is weakened with the increase of nonlinear parameter 4 for the four different shapes of buoy in this study the long term power capture performance by the nonlinear point absorber wec is significantly better than that of linear wec in all of three buoy size and the bistable point absorber wec has better power capture performance with a smaller value of γ 0 γ 1 in the south china sea besides the influence of γ on long term captured power of the wecs is also related to the buoy shape and size it should be pointed out that only the numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the long term power capture performance of point absorber wecs with or without the bistable mechanism in south china sea and the relatively optimized parameters of the wec with better long term power performance are obtained in this study which also requires experimental verification and

20304,this paper proposes a modified approximation method for failure probability estimation of high dimension structural systems with numerous correlated failure modes compared with the existing approximation methods more critical factors such as component correlation reliability index reliability index ratio and the correlation between the current and weakest failure modes are considered in the proposed method which improves the accuracy and applicability of the method to different configuration systems the performance of the proposed method is verified in numerical and practical structural systems with various configurations and compared with other existing approximation methods results show that the proposed method can restrain error divergence more effectively than the existing approximation methods especially when the number of failure modes and the correlation between them increase the proposed method has also been proved to be applicable to fast reliability calculation of practical offshore engineering systems such as side by side offloading mooring system of floating production storage and offloading platform keywords correlation reliability high dimensional system conditional probability failure probability 1 introduction nowadays large scale structural systems are increasingly developed in various engineering fields miao and ghosn 2016 ni et al 2019 fast and accurate system reliability calculation methods are required for the optimal design and on line monitoring of these high dimensional structures loganathan and gandhi 2015 wang and zhang 2018 however due to the complex correlation between the failure modes it is difficult to calculate the structural reliability directly how to reasonably consider the correlation between failure modes and realize efficient and accurate failure probability calculation is still worth studying zhao et al 2018 most of the current failure probability calculation methods are based on first order reliability method form huseby et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 which requires to solve the standard multinormal integrals according to the different methods of solving integral the traditional methods based on form can be divided into 1 directional numerical integration 2 monte carlo simulation and 3 approximation method mori and kato 2003 the directional numerical integration method is only suitable for small scale system song 1992 tang and melchers 1986 when the system dimension m 5 the method is known to be impractical due to large computation cost and accumulation of errors yuan and pandey 2006 monte carlo simulation is an alternative method to solve high dimensional structural system reliability problem which can achieve high accuracy with numerous simulating samples and is applicable for different distributions li 2013 xu et al 2016 lu et al 2018 oh and nam 2021 however its computation efficiency will diminish with increased dimension of integration yuan and pandey 2006 wang and li 2018 dong et al 2019 this limits the application of monte carlo method when we need to get the system s failure probability immediately such as on line monitoring approximation method is a frequently used method to calculate system reliability which has the advantages of simplicity and efficiency and can get the results in a very short time basic approximation methods mainly include bounds method and point estimation method based upon basic principle of probability theory bounds method defines the upper and lower limits of structural system failure probability alvarez and hurtado 2014 cao et al 2018 narrow bounds method proposed by ditlevsen 1979 is demonstrated to be practical and useable for rough calculation it has been applied to evaluate the reliability of welded joints of very fast ferry bearing combined load garbatov and guedes soares 2011 and it is also used in reliability evaluation of a steel plate subjected to distributed and localized corrosion wastage silva et al 2014 however existing studies have shown that with the increase of number and correlation of failure modes the interval would become so wide that the point value cannot be located with high accuracy whereas point estimation method could transform the complex probability calculation into a simple feasible problem using general methods and make an approximation of real system failure probability therefore the failure probability calculation method based on point estimation is more suitable for complex systems among the existing point estimation methods first order multinormal fomn approach is proposed by hohenbichler and rackwitz 1982 however this method is found greatly influenced by integral dimension and correlation coefficient so fomn was improved as g fomn by tang and melchers 1986 in this method the calculation accuracy is improved but its calculation process is rather cumbersome and complex probabilistic network evaluation technique pnet is developed as a simplified method by using the failure probability of the weakest failure mode to represent a highly correlated group ang and bennett 1984 product of conditional marginal pcm method and improved pcm i pcm method pandey 1998 yuan and pandey 2006 treat the m dimensional multivariate normal integral as a product of m conditional probability terms these two methods have good performance for simple systems but are found to generate huge error for series system especially when system dimension or correlation coefficient increases greatly guo 2007 provided a method by introducing the weight coefficient based upon bounds method although it could give results comparable in accuracy to monte carlo method for small dimensional systems but the empirical formula in this method focuses only on the influence of component correlation and its application range is limited kang and song 2010 proposed an efficient sequential compounding method scm in which system reliability is derived by continuous combining two components until the system reliability is obtained however this method is tested only on systems with components of equal reliability index and equal correlation coefficient roscoe et al 2015 studied the accuracy of equivalent planes ep method by applying it into flood risk analysis and found that the calculation error will grow greatly in large systems with closely related components thus the existing point estimation methods for structural system reliability still have the problem that the calculation error increases rapidly with the increase of system dimension and component correlation in terms of this problem the purpose of this paper is to establish an improved point estimation method named high dimensional conditional probability hcp method to reduce the error divergence firstly an improved empirical formula involving more critical impacting factors is defined for failure probability calculation of every two correlated failure modes then continuously incorporate a new failure mode based on the above formula until all the failure modes are involved the performance of hcp method is verified and compared with other existing approximation methods in numerical and practical structural systems with various configurations 2 high dimensional conditional probability method 2 1 motivation and theory basis of hcp method the hcp method proposed in this paper consists of two aspects estimation method of each two component system and combination strategies for the numerous components this method conducts iterative computation to obtain final system failure probability as for a two component series system its failure probability p f s can be denoted as 1 p f s p x i x j p x i p x j p x i x j p f i p f j p f i j p f i p f j p c i j p f j where intersection probability is denoted as p f i j p c i j p f j and p c i j means conditional probability the occurrence probability of failure mode x i in case that failure mode x j occurs two failure modes can be combined as a new equivalent component to combine with a third one and so on until all failure modes are included in this way the failure probability p f s of a m dimensional series system can be deduced as 2 p f s p x 1 x 2 x m p f 12 m 1 1 p c 12 m p f m p f 1 1 p c 12 p f 2 1 p c 12 m p f m the theory basis of hcp method is narrow bounded interval ditlevsen 1979 and based on which the upper and lower bounds of p f i j can be derived as 3 max p a p b p f i j p a p b ρ i j 0 0 p f i j min p a p b ρ i j 0 where p a φ β i φ β j ρ i j β i 1 ρ i j 2 p b φ β j φ β i ρ i j β j 1 ρ i j 2 β i β j is the reliability index of ith and jth failure mode respectively and ρ i j is the correlation coefficient between them since this narrow interval shown in eq 3 is true when the set of basic variables z 1 z 2 z n of every failure mode is jointly normally distributed there must exist a factor k 0 1 making the calculated p f i j p a k p b reach its real value in this regard if we only consider the cases of ρ i j 0 an empirical formula could be proposed for estimating interaction probability p f i j of two failure mode system p f i j could be represented as 4 p f i j max p a p b k 1 min p a p b p a k 2 p b k 3 max p a p b min p a p b k 4 p a p b where k 1 k 2 k 3 or k 4 is the different definition way of factor k and k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 0 1 different empirical formulas of k k 1 k 2 k 3 or k 4 have been proposed currently but so far there is still no perfect one that performs well for systems with various configurations formulas of different forms of k are analyzed in this paper and the form of k 3 is verified to have better accuracy and applicability therefore in this paper a typical expression of k 3 as eq 5 is adopted as the basis the details of this expression can refer to guo 2007 and more critical parameters are considered and added to this formula to reduce the error divergence 5 k 3 0 5 ρ i j 2 ρ i j 1 ρ i j 2 2 2 hcp method presentation 2 2 1 factors influencing the interaction probability in this section critical factors influencing the calculation error of intersection probability p f i j are confirmed the influence of factors characterizing the feature of failure modes including the reliability indexes β i and β j of failure modes i j and the correlation coefficient ρ i j is investigated by reverse solution deduction of k based upon exact failure probabilities of systems with various configurations according to the study of this paper the exact value of k 3 are related to the correlation coefficient ρ i j failure mode reliability index β i and β j and the ratio of the two reliability index β i β j therefore the influence of these factors should also be considered in determining the expression of k 3 2 2 2 hcp method formation after further analysis we defined specific formulas to characterize the effects of these factors and the parameters in the predetermined formulas are adjusted by fitting finally the specific expression of k 3 is obtained as 6 k 3 0 85 ln β j β i c i j 0 2 ρ i j 0 1 0 85 ln β i 0 95 ρ i j where c i j 0 5 ρ i j 2 ρ i j 1 ρ i j 2 β j β i 1 0 ρ i j 1 take eq 6 into eq 4 the expression of interaction probability p f i j of x i and x j can be obtained as 7 p f i j 0 85 ln β j β i c i j 0 2 ρ i j 0 1 0 85 ln β i 0 95 ρ i j max p a p b min p a p b where β i β j are the reliability indexes of the first and second added failure mode in solving the failure probability of the two component system and in order to satisfy the positive relation of k 3 with β j β i components are required to be added in increasing order of reliability index in the iterative calculation process another important step is to compute the correlation ρ 12 m between the equivalent multi component group x 1 x 2 x m 1 and a new component x m in the existing literatures for simplicity the correlation ρ 12 m is usually defined as ρ 12 m ρ max max ρ 1 m ρ 2 m ρ m 1 m which will obviously cause great error in order to reduce the calculation error this paper also improves the definition of ρ 12 m by considering both the largest correlation ρ max max ρ 1 m ρ 2 m ρ m 1 m and the correlation ρ r i s k between the new failure mode and the weakest failure mode among the group x 1 x 2 x m 1 the specific expression is defined as 8 ρ 12 m 1 2 ρ max ρ r i s k when there are more than one component having the correlation of ρ max or ρ r i s k with the new added component x m all of the additional ρ max should also be accounted in eq 8 as for ρ r i s k when the number of ρ r i s k is no more than ten the equivalent ρ 12 m is defined by adding both the median ρ r i s k and maximum ρ r i s k in eq 8 when the number of ρ r i s k is more than ten the top five largest correlation coefficients and the median value among residual ρ r i s k are accounted 2 2 3 error source the error of hcp method mainly comes from the following two aspects a the primary error of hcp method originates in the evaluation of k 3 in eq 6 especially when the reliability indexes of the accounted two components i and j are smaller the narrow bound interval of p f i j would be wider then the calculation error may become larger however by considering the influence of more critical factors instead of ρ i j alone the calculation accuracy and applicability of the proposed hcp method for different configuration systems has been significantly improved than the existing methods b the expression of the estimated correlation coefficient ρ 12 m in eq 8 is a simplified one which would also introduce error into the obtained failure probability of the new equivalent system compared with the existing methods the proposed hcp method considers the correlation between the current failure mode and the weakest failure mode additionally which obviously reduces the calculation error 2 2 4 application conditions according to the above derivation the application of hcp method has the following preconditions 1 hcp method is proposed based on first order reliability method which requires to solve the standard multinormal integrals and the set of basic variables z 1 z 2 z n of each failure mode should be jointly normally gaussian distributed 2 the analyzed system can be regarded as or transformed into a series system with multiple failure modes 3 the failure probability reliability index of each failure mode and its correlation with the others must be obtained 3 performance evaluation of hcp method the purpose of this section is to test the performance of the hcp method in systems with various typical configurations and both of numerical and practical examples are included we defined each system with the following parameters a m system dimension number of components b ρ correlation between two components and c β component reliability index we calculate the nearly exact system failure probability using integration method for equi correlated examples and using monte carlo directional sampling for others then the results obtained by hcp method are compared with the above nearly exact values as well as the results of existing typical approximation methods 3 1 equally correlated components with equal reliability index the hcp method is firstly applied to series systems consisting of failure modes with the same reliability and correlation system dimension m varying from 3 to 250 is studied for preliminary understanding of the possible error level in hcp method we also varied equal component reliability index β 3 4 5 and 6 and correlation ρ 0 2 0 5 and 0 9 then the system failure probabilities obtained by hcp method guo s method guo 2007 and equivalent planes ep method roscoe et al 2015 are compared with exact values computed by integral method as shown in figs 1 3 the corresponding relative errors are shown in figs 4 6 as shown in the above figures in general compared with ep and guo s methods the results of hcp method are most close to the accurate values in all cases when m is within the interval of 10 110 the relative errors of hcp method are smaller than 20 in most cases while the calculation error of guo s method and ep method can reach to around 60 and 80 with the increase of m the relative error appears a general growth trending and the error accumulation is seen more severe when correlation coefficient between failure modes is larger when the correlation between components is weak ρ 0 2 the accuracy of all the three methods reaches the highest level the relative errors are smaller than 7 when the reliability index β is 4 5 and 6 however when β 3 the relative error increases to 12 78 in hcp method 19 23 in guo s method and 27 27 in ep method respectively this means that the calculation error will increase with decreasing β however when ρ 0 9 and m 250 the relative error reaches the maximum value of 144 in ep method and 88 in guo s method while the value is less than 40 in hcp method the above results show that hcp method is more accurate than both ep method and guo s method in cases of equally correlated components with equal reliability index also the performance of hcp method is better than i pcm method in the same cases see reference yuan and pandey 2006 for details this indicates that the proposed hcp method can reduce the cumulative error more effectively when compared with the existing approximation methods especially for the extremely large structural system with strong correlated failure modes in order to further study the performance of hcp method in the system with failure modes correlated in different degrees two 20 dimensional examples are considered equal correlation coefficient between failure mode components varies from 0 05 to 0 95 in steps of 0 05 and the equal reliability index of components is 3 0 and 5 0 for the two cases respectively the system failure probabilities computed by hcp method and guo s method are compared with exact solutions figs 7 and 8 and the corresponding relative errors are given in fig 9 as shown in the figure in different system configurations the results obtained by hcp method see good agreement with the exact values and the errors are all less than 9 by contrast the error in guo s method increases rapidly with the increase of ρ and reach to more than 40 for ρ 0 9 the i pcm method is also demonstrated only suitable for small correlation coefficients and the error of which reaches 26 for ρ 0 9 see reference yuan and pandey 2006 for details 3 2 equally correlated components with unequal reliability index in this section cases of 40 dimensional equi correlated systems with absolutely different β are taken as examples in which the parameter ρ varies from 0 1 to 0 9 without loss of generality the component reliability index in each case varies from 2 275 to 3 250 for group i and from 3 275 to 4 250 for group ii both in steps of 0 025 for each case the calculation process is conducted with the component β ordered from smallest to largest the system failure probabilities computed by hcp method are compared with exact integral results and guo s method see figs 10 and 11 the corresponding relative errors are shown in fig 12 as shown in the figures the relative errors of hcp method are smaller than 10 in all cases and even smaller for high reliability series system in contrast the accuracy of guo s method is heavily affected by calculation order of components and the relative error increases with growing correlation coefficient in guo s method when ρ is 0 9 the relative error reaches 36 and 23 for group i respectively in two calculation orders of components and 31 and 23 for group ii meanwhile as for i pcm method demonstrated in the literature yuan and pandey 2006 the maximum relative error could reach 30 and 50 respectively it indicates that hcp method has better performance in high dimensional systems with unequally reliable components than other approximation methods in the existing literatures 3 3 unequally correlated components with equal reliability index this section investigates the performance of hcp method for systems with equally reliable and unequally correlated components in different cases we consider systems with equal component reliability index of 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 and different component numbers of 5 10 and 50 the nearly exact results obtained by monte carlo direct sampling method is used for accuracy verification the considered maximum system dimension is selected as 50 not extensive due to the lower computation efficiency of monte carlo method for larger systems we assume that the correlation between component i and j is defined by the following formula to ensure the correlation matrix is positive definite 9 ρ i j 1 i j m 1 i j 1 m the system failure probabilities for different system configurations by monte carlo method ep method guo s method and hcp method are shown in fig 13 and the factor difference are displayed in fig 14 as shown in these figures although the errors of each method become greater with increasing component reliability index when m 10 and 50 guo s performance is particularly bad the error can reach 60 this may be due to its oversimplified definition of ρ 12 m besides guo s method only considers the maximum value when determining the relationship between the equivalent failure mode group and a new introduced component thus neglecting much of the important information in contrast the performance of hcp method is significantly improved due to the improvement in this paper and the maximum error is less than 20 in the same cases in addition in the cases of this section the performance of hcp method is close to that of ep method 3 4 accuracy assessment of hcp method for practical applications in practice complex structural systems usually have large numbers of failure modes with different reliability indexes and correlations in this section we will test the performance of hcp method for practical structures such as truss and frame systems the results are compared with nearly exact solutions computed by monte carlo direct sampling method and other methods 3 4 1 practical example i considering the two tier truss shown in fig 15 ang and bennett 1984 all the members of the truss are assumed to fail through plastic yielding in tension or compression this system could be considered as a idealized planar model of a simple jacket type offshore structure the load and strength statistics are shown in table 1 coefficient of variation c o v in table 1 means the deviation degree of results and standard deviation of a variable could be calculated by the product of mean value with c o v assume that the system will fail when the plastic mechanism is formed each plastic mechanism is considered as a failure mode of the system the limit state function g i z for failure mode i is established based on virtual work principle 10 g i z j a i j r j k b i k s k where r j is plastic strength capacity at section j s k is load applied at point k a i j is strength coefficient for the jth section in failure mode i and b i k is load coefficient for the kth load in failure mode i ang and bennett 1984 the major plastic failure modes of the truss structural system are described in table 2 listed in decreasing order of failure probabilities the system has 8 major failure modes in serial relation it can be seen that there exist correlations between different failure modes because of common parameters of load and strength variables the correlation matrix is displayed in table 3 which is calculated based upon correlation definition of variables with the information of statistics and limit state functions in tables 1 and 2 then the failure probability of the truss structure is calculated by hcp method pnet method guo s method and monte carlo method separately and the results are displayed in table 4 as shown in this table the case contains components with medium reliability β 3 8 4 5 and the system failure probability obtained by monte carlo method with 500 000 samples is 1 9000e 4 and the result calculated by hcp is 1 9090e 4 the relative error of hcp method is only 0 47 while the errors of pnet and guo s methods reach up to 2 63 31 21 which are 5 6 and 66 4 times of the former respective this example proves that guo s method performs poorly for systems with failure modes of inconsistent reliability and correlation which is consistent with the analysis above meanwhile pnet method uses some typical high failure probability failure modes to simplify the system ignoring the rest components therefore for a series system its failure probability will be underestimated by pnet method thus its reliability index will be overestimated as for this case it indicates that hcp method has better performance 3 4 2 practical example ii consider the frame structure shown in fig 16 the possible plastic hinges and the corresponding bending resistances are represented as r 1 r 19 the random variables and statistics are shown in table 5 in which the variables in different rows are completely independent and the variables in the same row are completely related the variables are then normalized and transformed into independent ones for reliability index computation of each failure mode there are 12 major failure modes identified in this frame system the corresponding limit state functions in serial relation are shown in table 6 the correlation matrix is shown in table 7 this case contains components with low reliability β 2 2 and the system failure probability results obtained by different methods are compared in table 8 the failure probability obtained by monte carlo direct sampling is 0 1151 and the result calculated by hcp method is 0 1130 the relative error of hcp method is only 1 82 which is obviously smaller than other methods 2 60 33 97 meanwhile the accuracy of guo s method is affected by the calculation order and pnet method is affected by correlation coefficient limit significantly this will lead to a large uncertainty in calculation results comparatively hcp method is both high precision and stable 3 4 3 practical example iii the side by side sbs offloading mooring system model includes five parts i e floating production storage and offloading fpso shuttle tanker yoke hawsers and fenders the schematic diagram of which is shown fig 17 where f no stands for fender and h no stands for hawser in order to evaluate the reliability of its mooring system the failure probability in two typical load cases lcs are analyzed the first one lc1 is fpso ballasted tanker fully loaded and the other one lc2 is fpso fully loaded tanker ballasted details of the principal dimensions and parameters of the fpso and shuttle tanker can refer to author s previous work zhang et al 2016 in the numerical model the fpso is provided with the mooring force by the yoke mooring system as shown in fig 18 the mooring structure is fixed on the fpso and the left and right mooring legs and yoke are modeled by tube elements respectively the two mooring legs are connected to both mooring structure and the yoke with several universal joints the details of which can also refer to author s previous work zhang et al 2016 in this paper two environmental conditions are selected for the study according to typical cases described in american petroleum institute api reference rules american petroleum institute 2001 for single point mooring system including yoke mooring which are illustrated as follows the environmental directions of wind wave and current are displayed in table 9 table 10 provides corresponding parameters of environment conditions ecs the operation conditions of fpso include four combinations of two lcs and two ecs the dynamic loads acting on the hawsers and fenders are computed considering motion responses of vessels and environmental loads and the two body motion analysis is carried out by aqwa ansys the overall numerical model of the sbs offloading mooring system of fpso is shown in fig 19 the pressure stress of fenders tension stress of hawsers and mooring legs of the yoke under the four lc and ec combinations are obtained and processed for structure reliability analysis considering the short duration of offloading process and the routine maintenance fatigue damage is not considered in this process obviously hawsers made of nylon lines can only sustain tension so only the ultimate stress is analyzed as for the yoke whose weakest elements are mooring legs the simulation results show that there is only tension during the whole process meanwhile with the utility of the universal joints for mooring legs buckling can be ignored therefore only yielding is considered for these two components for fenders the failure types are complicated and the deformation limitation is defined according to practical experience the statistical average values and standard deviations of time history stress of hawsers fenders and the yoke s mooring legs are obtained the normality test of the data is accomplished by matlab and all the data in different conditions shows consistence with normal distributions taking the case of lc1 ec1 as an example the stress and structure resistance are shown in table 11 according to the system configuration and practical experience the failure modes of sbs offloading mooring system and the corresponding limit state equations can be obtained as shown in table 12 the fewest necessary failure elements that lead to the system failure are considered as a failure mode group the ranked reliability index and correlations between these 11 failure modes are shown in tables 13 and 14 then the system reliability index is calculated by hcp method the structural system reliability index of sbs offloading mooring system in four different conditions are all obtained in the same way then the results are compared with those of pnet method in zhang et al 2016 as shown in fig 20 in this case the reliability indexes of the failure modes are relatively high which are above 4 5 as shown in fig 20 the reliability index calculated by pnet method is about 0 05 0 11 larger than that calculated by hcp method as we known in pnet method in order to simplify the calculation some failure modes with low failure probability will be ignored which will lead to the overestimation of the system reliability index in this case the results of hcp method are slightly smaller than those of pnet method proving that the proposed hcp method has higher accuracy 3 5 computational efficiency discussion for comparing the computational efficiency of different methods table 15 shows the computational time required by monte carlo directional sampling with an imposed accuracy of 0 01 on the estimate of the system reliability index and the approximation methods 2 8 ghz computer with 8 gb ram as shown in the table for the case of m 250 in section 3 1 the monte carlo directional sampling method takes 64740 s over 17 h in comparison the computation time of hcp ep and guo s methods is less than 1 s the advantage of approximation methods in calculation efficiency is obvious and the computational efficiency of the hcp method is comparable to that of other approximation methods in general the abovementioned examples verify that the hcp method has good performance in the reliability calculation of practical structural systems with unequal correlation and unequal reliability failure modes and has the potential to be applied to the reliability analysis of offshore engineering systems 4 conclusions although the existing point estimation methods for system reliability have the advantage of fast calculation speed the calculation error always increases rapidly with the increase of system dimension and component correlation which greatly limits the application of this method for high dimensional systems in practice in this paper an improved point estimation method hcp method is proposed to reduce the calculation error the improvement of this method is mainly reflected in two aspects firstly in the calculation of interaction probability more critical factors such as component correlation reliability index and their ratio are considered in the empirical formula which improves the calculation accuracy and applicability of the method to different configuration systems secondly in the calculation of correlation coefficient between the equivalent multi component system and a new component this method not only considers the maximum correlation as existing methods do but also considers the correlation between the current failure mode and the weakest failure mode compared with the existing point estimation methods the accuracy of the proposed hcp method has been significantly improved for the reliability calculation of systems with various configurations it has also been proved to be applicable to the fast reliability calculation of practical offshore engineering systems such as sbs offloading mooring system of fpso moreover the advantage of hcp method in computation efficiency is obvious for extreme large dimensional system because the whole calculation process of hcp method is essentially an iteration of algebraic computation credit authorship contribution statement wenchi ni

20304,this paper proposes a modified approximation method for failure probability estimation of high dimension structural systems with numerous correlated failure modes compared with the existing approximation methods more critical factors such as component correlation reliability index reliability index ratio and the correlation between the current and weakest failure modes are considered in the proposed method which improves the accuracy and applicability of the method to different configuration systems the performance of the proposed method is verified in numerical and practical structural systems with various configurations and compared with other existing approximation methods results show that the proposed method can restrain error divergence more effectively than the existing approximation methods especially when the number of failure modes and the correlation between them increase the proposed method has also been proved to be applicable to fast reliability calculation of practical offshore engineering systems such as side by side offloading mooring system of floating production storage and offloading platform keywords correlation reliability high dimensional system conditional probability failure probability 1 introduction nowadays large scale structural systems are increasingly developed in various engineering fields miao and ghosn 2016 ni et al 2019 fast and accurate system reliability calculation methods are required for the optimal design and on line monitoring of these high dimensional structures loganathan and gandhi 2015 wang and zhang 2018 however due to the complex correlation between the failure modes it is difficult to calculate the structural reliability directly how to reasonably consider the correlation between failure modes and realize efficient and accurate failure probability calculation is still worth studying zhao et al 2018 most of the current failure probability calculation methods are based on first order reliability method form huseby et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 which requires to solve the standard multinormal integrals according to the different methods of solving integral the traditional methods based on form can be divided into 1 directional numerical integration 2 monte carlo simulation and 3 approximation method mori and kato 2003 the directional numerical integration method is only suitable for small scale system song 1992 tang and melchers 1986 when the system dimension m 5 the method is known to be impractical due to large computation cost and accumulation of errors yuan and pandey 2006 monte carlo simulation is an alternative method to solve high dimensional structural system reliability problem which can achieve high accuracy with numerous simulating samples and is applicable for different distributions li 2013 xu et al 2016 lu et al 2018 oh and nam 2021 however its computation efficiency will diminish with increased dimension of integration yuan and pandey 2006 wang and li 2018 dong et al 2019 this limits the application of monte carlo method when we need to get the system s failure probability immediately such as on line monitoring approximation method is a frequently used method to calculate system reliability which has the advantages of simplicity and efficiency and can get the results in a very short time basic approximation methods mainly include bounds method and point estimation method based upon basic principle of probability theory bounds method defines the upper and lower limits of structural system failure probability alvarez and hurtado 2014 cao et al 2018 narrow bounds method proposed by ditlevsen 1979 is demonstrated to be practical and useable for rough calculation it has been applied to evaluate the reliability of welded joints of very fast ferry bearing combined load garbatov and guedes soares 2011 and it is also used in reliability evaluation of a steel plate subjected to distributed and localized corrosion wastage silva et al 2014 however existing studies have shown that with the increase of number and correlation of failure modes the interval would become so wide that the point value cannot be located with high accuracy whereas point estimation method could transform the complex probability calculation into a simple feasible problem using general methods and make an approximation of real system failure probability therefore the failure probability calculation method based on point estimation is more suitable for complex systems among the existing point estimation methods first order multinormal fomn approach is proposed by hohenbichler and rackwitz 1982 however this method is found greatly influenced by integral dimension and correlation coefficient so fomn was improved as g fomn by tang and melchers 1986 in this method the calculation accuracy is improved but its calculation process is rather cumbersome and complex probabilistic network evaluation technique pnet is developed as a simplified method by using the failure probability of the weakest failure mode to represent a highly correlated group ang and bennett 1984 product of conditional marginal pcm method and improved pcm i pcm method pandey 1998 yuan and pandey 2006 treat the m dimensional multivariate normal integral as a product of m conditional probability terms these two methods have good performance for simple systems but are found to generate huge error for series system especially when system dimension or correlation coefficient increases greatly guo 2007 provided a method by introducing the weight coefficient based upon bounds method although it could give results comparable in accuracy to monte carlo method for small dimensional systems but the empirical formula in this method focuses only on the influence of component correlation and its application range is limited kang and song 2010 proposed an efficient sequential compounding method scm in which system reliability is derived by continuous combining two components until the system reliability is obtained however this method is tested only on systems with components of equal reliability index and equal correlation coefficient roscoe et al 2015 studied the accuracy of equivalent planes ep method by applying it into flood risk analysis and found that the calculation error will grow greatly in large systems with closely related components thus the existing point estimation methods for structural system reliability still have the problem that the calculation error increases rapidly with the increase of system dimension and component correlation in terms of this problem the purpose of this paper is to establish an improved point estimation method named high dimensional conditional probability hcp method to reduce the error divergence firstly an improved empirical formula involving more critical impacting factors is defined for failure probability calculation of every two correlated failure modes then continuously incorporate a new failure mode based on the above formula until all the failure modes are involved the performance of hcp method is verified and compared with other existing approximation methods in numerical and practical structural systems with various configurations 2 high dimensional conditional probability method 2 1 motivation and theory basis of hcp method the hcp method proposed in this paper consists of two aspects estimation method of each two component system and combination strategies for the numerous components this method conducts iterative computation to obtain final system failure probability as for a two component series system its failure probability p f s can be denoted as 1 p f s p x i x j p x i p x j p x i x j p f i p f j p f i j p f i p f j p c i j p f j where intersection probability is denoted as p f i j p c i j p f j and p c i j means conditional probability the occurrence probability of failure mode x i in case that failure mode x j occurs two failure modes can be combined as a new equivalent component to combine with a third one and so on until all failure modes are included in this way the failure probability p f s of a m dimensional series system can be deduced as 2 p f s p x 1 x 2 x m p f 12 m 1 1 p c 12 m p f m p f 1 1 p c 12 p f 2 1 p c 12 m p f m the theory basis of hcp method is narrow bounded interval ditlevsen 1979 and based on which the upper and lower bounds of p f i j can be derived as 3 max p a p b p f i j p a p b ρ i j 0 0 p f i j min p a p b ρ i j 0 where p a φ β i φ β j ρ i j β i 1 ρ i j 2 p b φ β j φ β i ρ i j β j 1 ρ i j 2 β i β j is the reliability index of ith and jth failure mode respectively and ρ i j is the correlation coefficient between them since this narrow interval shown in eq 3 is true when the set of basic variables z 1 z 2 z n of every failure mode is jointly normally distributed there must exist a factor k 0 1 making the calculated p f i j p a k p b reach its real value in this regard if we only consider the cases of ρ i j 0 an empirical formula could be proposed for estimating interaction probability p f i j of two failure mode system p f i j could be represented as 4 p f i j max p a p b k 1 min p a p b p a k 2 p b k 3 max p a p b min p a p b k 4 p a p b where k 1 k 2 k 3 or k 4 is the different definition way of factor k and k 1 k 2 k 3 k 4 0 1 different empirical formulas of k k 1 k 2 k 3 or k 4 have been proposed currently but so far there is still no perfect one that performs well for systems with various configurations formulas of different forms of k are analyzed in this paper and the form of k 3 is verified to have better accuracy and applicability therefore in this paper a typical expression of k 3 as eq 5 is adopted as the basis the details of this expression can refer to guo 2007 and more critical parameters are considered and added to this formula to reduce the error divergence 5 k 3 0 5 ρ i j 2 ρ i j 1 ρ i j 2 2 2 hcp method presentation 2 2 1 factors influencing the interaction probability in this section critical factors influencing the calculation error of intersection probability p f i j are confirmed the influence of factors characterizing the feature of failure modes including the reliability indexes β i and β j of failure modes i j and the correlation coefficient ρ i j is investigated by reverse solution deduction of k based upon exact failure probabilities of systems with various configurations according to the study of this paper the exact value of k 3 are related to the correlation coefficient ρ i j failure mode reliability index β i and β j and the ratio of the two reliability index β i β j therefore the influence of these factors should also be considered in determining the expression of k 3 2 2 2 hcp method formation after further analysis we defined specific formulas to characterize the effects of these factors and the parameters in the predetermined formulas are adjusted by fitting finally the specific expression of k 3 is obtained as 6 k 3 0 85 ln β j β i c i j 0 2 ρ i j 0 1 0 85 ln β i 0 95 ρ i j where c i j 0 5 ρ i j 2 ρ i j 1 ρ i j 2 β j β i 1 0 ρ i j 1 take eq 6 into eq 4 the expression of interaction probability p f i j of x i and x j can be obtained as 7 p f i j 0 85 ln β j β i c i j 0 2 ρ i j 0 1 0 85 ln β i 0 95 ρ i j max p a p b min p a p b where β i β j are the reliability indexes of the first and second added failure mode in solving the failure probability of the two component system and in order to satisfy the positive relation of k 3 with β j β i components are required to be added in increasing order of reliability index in the iterative calculation process another important step is to compute the correlation ρ 12 m between the equivalent multi component group x 1 x 2 x m 1 and a new component x m in the existing literatures for simplicity the correlation ρ 12 m is usually defined as ρ 12 m ρ max max ρ 1 m ρ 2 m ρ m 1 m which will obviously cause great error in order to reduce the calculation error this paper also improves the definition of ρ 12 m by considering both the largest correlation ρ max max ρ 1 m ρ 2 m ρ m 1 m and the correlation ρ r i s k between the new failure mode and the weakest failure mode among the group x 1 x 2 x m 1 the specific expression is defined as 8 ρ 12 m 1 2 ρ max ρ r i s k when there are more than one component having the correlation of ρ max or ρ r i s k with the new added component x m all of the additional ρ max should also be accounted in eq 8 as for ρ r i s k when the number of ρ r i s k is no more than ten the equivalent ρ 12 m is defined by adding both the median ρ r i s k and maximum ρ r i s k in eq 8 when the number of ρ r i s k is more than ten the top five largest correlation coefficients and the median value among residual ρ r i s k are accounted 2 2 3 error source the error of hcp method mainly comes from the following two aspects a the primary error of hcp method originates in the evaluation of k 3 in eq 6 especially when the reliability indexes of the accounted two components i and j are smaller the narrow bound interval of p f i j would be wider then the calculation error may become larger however by considering the influence of more critical factors instead of ρ i j alone the calculation accuracy and applicability of the proposed hcp method for different configuration systems has been significantly improved than the existing methods b the expression of the estimated correlation coefficient ρ 12 m in eq 8 is a simplified one which would also introduce error into the obtained failure probability of the new equivalent system compared with the existing methods the proposed hcp method considers the correlation between the current failure mode and the weakest failure mode additionally which obviously reduces the calculation error 2 2 4 application conditions according to the above derivation the application of hcp method has the following preconditions 1 hcp method is proposed based on first order reliability method which requires to solve the standard multinormal integrals and the set of basic variables z 1 z 2 z n of each failure mode should be jointly normally gaussian distributed 2 the analyzed system can be regarded as or transformed into a series system with multiple failure modes 3 the failure probability reliability index of each failure mode and its correlation with the others must be obtained 3 performance evaluation of hcp method the purpose of this section is to test the performance of the hcp method in systems with various typical configurations and both of numerical and practical examples are included we defined each system with the following parameters a m system dimension number of components b ρ correlation between two components and c β component reliability index we calculate the nearly exact system failure probability using integration method for equi correlated examples and using monte carlo directional sampling for others then the results obtained by hcp method are compared with the above nearly exact values as well as the results of existing typical approximation methods 3 1 equally correlated components with equal reliability index the hcp method is firstly applied to series systems consisting of failure modes with the same reliability and correlation system dimension m varying from 3 to 250 is studied for preliminary understanding of the possible error level in hcp method we also varied equal component reliability index β 3 4 5 and 6 and correlation ρ 0 2 0 5 and 0 9 then the system failure probabilities obtained by hcp method guo s method guo 2007 and equivalent planes ep method roscoe et al 2015 are compared with exact values computed by integral method as shown in figs 1 3 the corresponding relative errors are shown in figs 4 6 as shown in the above figures in general compared with ep and guo s methods the results of hcp method are most close to the accurate values in all cases when m is within the interval of 10 110 the relative errors of hcp method are smaller than 20 in most cases while the calculation error of guo s method and ep method can reach to around 60 and 80 with the increase of m the relative error appears a general growth trending and the error accumulation is seen more severe when correlation coefficient between failure modes is larger when the correlation between components is weak ρ 0 2 the accuracy of all the three methods reaches the highest level the relative errors are smaller than 7 when the reliability index β is 4 5 and 6 however when β 3 the relative error increases to 12 78 in hcp method 19 23 in guo s method and 27 27 in ep method respectively this means that the calculation error will increase with decreasing β however when ρ 0 9 and m 250 the relative error reaches the maximum value of 144 in ep method and 88 in guo s method while the value is less than 40 in hcp method the above results show that hcp method is more accurate than both ep method and guo s method in cases of equally correlated components with equal reliability index also the performance of hcp method is better than i pcm method in the same cases see reference yuan and pandey 2006 for details this indicates that the proposed hcp method can reduce the cumulative error more effectively when compared with the existing approximation methods especially for the extremely large structural system with strong correlated failure modes in order to further study the performance of hcp method in the system with failure modes correlated in different degrees two 20 dimensional examples are considered equal correlation coefficient between failure mode components varies from 0 05 to 0 95 in steps of 0 05 and the equal reliability index of components is 3 0 and 5 0 for the two cases respectively the system failure probabilities computed by hcp method and guo s method are compared with exact solutions figs 7 and 8 and the corresponding relative errors are given in fig 9 as shown in the figure in different system configurations the results obtained by hcp method see good agreement with the exact values and the errors are all less than 9 by contrast the error in guo s method increases rapidly with the increase of ρ and reach to more than 40 for ρ 0 9 the i pcm method is also demonstrated only suitable for small correlation coefficients and the error of which reaches 26 for ρ 0 9 see reference yuan and pandey 2006 for details 3 2 equally correlated components with unequal reliability index in this section cases of 40 dimensional equi correlated systems with absolutely different β are taken as examples in which the parameter ρ varies from 0 1 to 0 9 without loss of generality the component reliability index in each case varies from 2 275 to 3 250 for group i and from 3 275 to 4 250 for group ii both in steps of 0 025 for each case the calculation process is conducted with the component β ordered from smallest to largest the system failure probabilities computed by hcp method are compared with exact integral results and guo s method see figs 10 and 11 the corresponding relative errors are shown in fig 12 as shown in the figures the relative errors of hcp method are smaller than 10 in all cases and even smaller for high reliability series system in contrast the accuracy of guo s method is heavily affected by calculation order of components and the relative error increases with growing correlation coefficient in guo s method when ρ is 0 9 the relative error reaches 36 and 23 for group i respectively in two calculation orders of components and 31 and 23 for group ii meanwhile as for i pcm method demonstrated in the literature yuan and pandey 2006 the maximum relative error could reach 30 and 50 respectively it indicates that hcp method has better performance in high dimensional systems with unequally reliable components than other approximation methods in the existing literatures 3 3 unequally correlated components with equal reliability index this section investigates the performance of hcp method for systems with equally reliable and unequally correlated components in different cases we consider systems with equal component reliability index of 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 and different component numbers of 5 10 and 50 the nearly exact results obtained by monte carlo direct sampling method is used for accuracy verification the considered maximum system dimension is selected as 50 not extensive due to the lower computation efficiency of monte carlo method for larger systems we assume that the correlation between component i and j is defined by the following formula to ensure the correlation matrix is positive definite 9 ρ i j 1 i j m 1 i j 1 m the system failure probabilities for different system configurations by monte carlo method ep method guo s method and hcp method are shown in fig 13 and the factor difference are displayed in fig 14 as shown in these figures although the errors of each method become greater with increasing component reliability index when m 10 and 50 guo s performance is particularly bad the error can reach 60 this may be due to its oversimplified definition of ρ 12 m besides guo s method only considers the maximum value when determining the relationship between the equivalent failure mode group and a new introduced component thus neglecting much of the important information in contrast the performance of hcp method is significantly improved due to the improvement in this paper and the maximum error is less than 20 in the same cases in addition in the cases of this section the performance of hcp method is close to that of ep method 3 4 accuracy assessment of hcp method for practical applications in practice complex structural systems usually have large numbers of failure modes with different reliability indexes and correlations in this section we will test the performance of hcp method for practical structures such as truss and frame systems the results are compared with nearly exact solutions computed by monte carlo direct sampling method and other methods 3 4 1 practical example i considering the two tier truss shown in fig 15 ang and bennett 1984 all the members of the truss are assumed to fail through plastic yielding in tension or compression this system could be considered as a idealized planar model of a simple jacket type offshore structure the load and strength statistics are shown in table 1 coefficient of variation c o v in table 1 means the deviation degree of results and standard deviation of a variable could be calculated by the product of mean value with c o v assume that the system will fail when the plastic mechanism is formed each plastic mechanism is considered as a failure mode of the system the limit state function g i z for failure mode i is established based on virtual work principle 10 g i z j a i j r j k b i k s k where r j is plastic strength capacity at section j s k is load applied at point k a i j is strength coefficient for the jth section in failure mode i and b i k is load coefficient for the kth load in failure mode i ang and bennett 1984 the major plastic failure modes of the truss structural system are described in table 2 listed in decreasing order of failure probabilities the system has 8 major failure modes in serial relation it can be seen that there exist correlations between different failure modes because of common parameters of load and strength variables the correlation matrix is displayed in table 3 which is calculated based upon correlation definition of variables with the information of statistics and limit state functions in tables 1 and 2 then the failure probability of the truss structure is calculated by hcp method pnet method guo s method and monte carlo method separately and the results are displayed in table 4 as shown in this table the case contains components with medium reliability β 3 8 4 5 and the system failure probability obtained by monte carlo method with 500 000 samples is 1 9000e 4 and the result calculated by hcp is 1 9090e 4 the relative error of hcp method is only 0 47 while the errors of pnet and guo s methods reach up to 2 63 31 21 which are 5 6 and 66 4 times of the former respective this example proves that guo s method performs poorly for systems with failure modes of inconsistent reliability and correlation which is consistent with the analysis above meanwhile pnet method uses some typical high failure probability failure modes to simplify the system ignoring the rest components therefore for a series system its failure probability will be underestimated by pnet method thus its reliability index will be overestimated as for this case it indicates that hcp method has better performance 3 4 2 practical example ii consider the frame structure shown in fig 16 the possible plastic hinges and the corresponding bending resistances are represented as r 1 r 19 the random variables and statistics are shown in table 5 in which the variables in different rows are completely independent and the variables in the same row are completely related the variables are then normalized and transformed into independent ones for reliability index computation of each failure mode there are 12 major failure modes identified in this frame system the corresponding limit state functions in serial relation are shown in table 6 the correlation matrix is shown in table 7 this case contains components with low reliability β 2 2 and the system failure probability results obtained by different methods are compared in table 8 the failure probability obtained by monte carlo direct sampling is 0 1151 and the result calculated by hcp method is 0 1130 the relative error of hcp method is only 1 82 which is obviously smaller than other methods 2 60 33 97 meanwhile the accuracy of guo s method is affected by the calculation order and pnet method is affected by correlation coefficient limit significantly this will lead to a large uncertainty in calculation results comparatively hcp method is both high precision and stable 3 4 3 practical example iii the side by side sbs offloading mooring system model includes five parts i e floating production storage and offloading fpso shuttle tanker yoke hawsers and fenders the schematic diagram of which is shown fig 17 where f no stands for fender and h no stands for hawser in order to evaluate the reliability of its mooring system the failure probability in two typical load cases lcs are analyzed the first one lc1 is fpso ballasted tanker fully loaded and the other one lc2 is fpso fully loaded tanker ballasted details of the principal dimensions and parameters of the fpso and shuttle tanker can refer to author s previous work zhang et al 2016 in the numerical model the fpso is provided with the mooring force by the yoke mooring system as shown in fig 18 the mooring structure is fixed on the fpso and the left and right mooring legs and yoke are modeled by tube elements respectively the two mooring legs are connected to both mooring structure and the yoke with several universal joints the details of which can also refer to author s previous work zhang et al 2016 in this paper two environmental conditions are selected for the study according to typical cases described in american petroleum institute api reference rules american petroleum institute 2001 for single point mooring system including yoke mooring which are illustrated as follows the environmental directions of wind wave and current are displayed in table 9 table 10 provides corresponding parameters of environment conditions ecs the operation conditions of fpso include four combinations of two lcs and two ecs the dynamic loads acting on the hawsers and fenders are computed considering motion responses of vessels and environmental loads and the two body motion analysis is carried out by aqwa ansys the overall numerical model of the sbs offloading mooring system of fpso is shown in fig 19 the pressure stress of fenders tension stress of hawsers and mooring legs of the yoke under the four lc and ec combinations are obtained and processed for structure reliability analysis considering the short duration of offloading process and the routine maintenance fatigue damage is not considered in this process obviously hawsers made of nylon lines can only sustain tension so only the ultimate stress is analyzed as for the yoke whose weakest elements are mooring legs the simulation results show that there is only tension during the whole process meanwhile with the utility of the universal joints for mooring legs buckling can be ignored therefore only yielding is considered for these two components for fenders the failure types are complicated and the deformation limitation is defined according to practical experience the statistical average values and standard deviations of time history stress of hawsers fenders and the yoke s mooring legs are obtained the normality test of the data is accomplished by matlab and all the data in different conditions shows consistence with normal distributions taking the case of lc1 ec1 as an example the stress and structure resistance are shown in table 11 according to the system configuration and practical experience the failure modes of sbs offloading mooring system and the corresponding limit state equations can be obtained as shown in table 12 the fewest necessary failure elements that lead to the system failure are considered as a failure mode group the ranked reliability index and correlations between these 11 failure modes are shown in tables 13 and 14 then the system reliability index is calculated by hcp method the structural system reliability index of sbs offloading mooring system in four different conditions are all obtained in the same way then the results are compared with those of pnet method in zhang et al 2016 as shown in fig 20 in this case the reliability indexes of the failure modes are relatively high which are above 4 5 as shown in fig 20 the reliability index calculated by pnet method is about 0 05 0 11 larger than that calculated by hcp method as we known in pnet method in order to simplify the calculation some failure modes with low failure probability will be ignored which will lead to the overestimation of the system reliability index in this case the results of hcp method are slightly smaller than those of pnet method proving that the proposed hcp method has higher accuracy 3 5 computational efficiency discussion for comparing the computational efficiency of different methods table 15 shows the computational time required by monte carlo directional sampling with an imposed accuracy of 0 01 on the estimate of the system reliability index and the approximation methods 2 8 ghz computer with 8 gb ram as shown in the table for the case of m 250 in section 3 1 the monte carlo directional sampling method takes 64740 s over 17 h in comparison the computation time of hcp ep and guo s methods is less than 1 s the advantage of approximation methods in calculation efficiency is obvious and the computational efficiency of the hcp method is comparable to that of other approximation methods in general the abovementioned examples verify that the hcp method has good performance in the reliability calculation of practical structural systems with unequal correlation and unequal reliability failure modes and has the potential to be applied to the reliability analysis of offshore engineering systems 4 conclusions although the existing point estimation methods for system reliability have the advantage of fast calculation speed the calculation error always increases rapidly with the increase of system dimension and component correlation which greatly limits the application of this method for high dimensional systems in practice in this paper an improved point estimation method hcp method is proposed to reduce the calculation error the improvement of this method is mainly reflected in two aspects firstly in the calculation of interaction probability more critical factors such as component correlation reliability index and their ratio are considered in the empirical formula which improves the calculation accuracy and applicability of the method to different configuration systems secondly in the calculation of correlation coefficient between the equivalent multi component system and a new component this method not only considers the maximum correlation as existing methods do but also considers the correlation between the current failure mode and the weakest failure mode compared with the existing point estimation methods the accuracy of the proposed hcp method has been significantly improved for the reliability calculation of systems with various configurations it has also been proved to be applicable to the fast reliability calculation of practical offshore engineering systems such as sbs offloading mooring system of fpso moreover the advantage of hcp method in computation efficiency is obvious for extreme large dimensional system because the whole calculation process of hcp method is essentially an iteration of algebraic computation credit authorship contribution statement wenchi ni
