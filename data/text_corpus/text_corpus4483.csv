three dimensional unsteady cavitating flows around the hydrofoil and propeller are simulated using detached eddy simulation des with sst menter k turbulence model two phase flow is modelled using eulerian volume of fluid vof approach with cavitation formation predicted by schnerr sauer cavitation model predicted cavity structures on the hydrofoil as well as cavitation development and performance analysis for the propeller agreed fairly well with the experimental data given in open literature erosion on the hydrofoil and propeller are predicted by intensity function method ifm gray level method glm and a new proposed approach erosive power method epm particularly the erosion predictions obtained by the epm showed remarkable correlation with the damaged area observed from paint tests on the naca0015 hydrofoil qualitative erosion predictions on the pptc propeller for zero shaft and inclined shaft conditions are presented for the first time in the literature which seems to identify regions of potential cavitation damage consequently it is believed that this study would lay an important foundation for the widespread application of the epm in the future keywords naca0015 hydrofoil pptc propeller detached eddy simulation des cavitation erosion prediction erosive power method epm 1 introduction cavitation is a widespread physical phenomenon developing in regions where the fluid s operational pressure drops below its vapour pressure causing gas pockets and bubbles to form and collapse it occurs whenever there are fluctuations in the pressure and velocity of the fluid cavitation is a complex and often inevitable fluid mechanics phenomenon for marine propellers and it causes undesired effects such as noise vibration power loss and erosion the last one the cavitation erosion is perhaps the most remarkable damaging consequences of cavitation and it can severely damage propeller by removing material from the surface li 2012 peters et al 2018 it causes enormous economic losses in practical applications marine propellers operate under the flow conditions that vary significantly from each other and without excepting special propellers of research ships or military cavitation occurs on almost every marine propeller peters et al 2018 hence propeller needs to be designed to run in cavitating flow conditions and the risk of cavitation erosion needs to be controlled rather than avoided jian et al 2015 cfd simulations of turbulent cavitating flows have been improved with the development of powerful computers and various numerical cavitation models have been introduced to cfd codes in the last decade however the cavitation modelling is still very challenging since it involves rapid temporal and spatial variations of the flow properties and interactions between the liquid and vapour furthermore the cavitating flow is turbulent highly dynamic and unstable all these features require appropriate models to predict cavitating flow accurately li 2012 usta and korkut 2018 vallier 2013 in order to numerically predict cavitation erosion it is necessary to accurately model the cavitating flow and correlate the flow features to erosion damage franc and michel 2004 due to the nonlinear nature of the cavitating flow dynamics the governing equations require extensive effort to fully understand and accurately predict the phenomenon tseng 2010 within this respect different aspects have been proposed and many models have been developed to predict cavitation erosion for practical and macroscopic hydrodynamic flow problems by numerical methods the following studies are some of the most important attempts in the literature for cavitation and cavitation erosion modelling for hydrofoils and propellers using cfd one of the cornerstones for cavitating flow simulations by cfd is the study of bensow and bark 2010 an approach to simulate the dynamic cavitation behavior based on large eddy simulation les of the cavitating flow using an implicit approach for the subgrid terms together with a wall model and a single fluid is described in that study they handled the pressure velocity coupling using a piso algorithm with a modified pressure equation for improved stability when the mass transfer terms are active ji et al 2012 analyzed unsteady cavitating turbulent flows around a conventional marine propeller in a non uniform wake to predict the excited pressure fluctuations the numerical simulations of the propeller cavitation were based on the navier stokes equations solved with a mass transfer cavitation model the k ω sst turbulence model and a sliding mesh lu et al 2013 simulated the cavitating flow around two highly skewed propellers operating in open water and mounted on an inclined shaft the investigation was based on incompressible les in combination with a volume of fluid implementation to represent the two phases of liquid and vapour and a transport equation based method for the mass transfer between the phases high speed video recordings from experiments were used for comparison ji et al 2014 simulated 3d turbulent structure around a twisted hydrofoil by using the mass transfer cavitation model and the modified rng k ε model with a local density correction for turbulent eddy viscosity they predicted three dimensional cavity structures and shedding frequency very similar that of the experimental observations ji et al 2015 simulated cavitating flow around a naca66 hydrofoil with particular emphasis on understanding the cavitation structures and shedding dynamics using les coupled with a homogeneous cavitation model long et al 2018 simulated the transient cavitating turbulent flow around a delft twisted hydrofoil using les combined with the zwart cavitation model they developed a three dimensional lagrangian technology to provide an alternative method for the analyses in cavitating flow which is based on lagrangian viewpoint asnaghi et al 2018 simulated three dimensional fully turbulent cavitating flow around the delft twist 11 hydrofoil they mainly focused on cavitation structures shedding dynamics and vorticity distribution by using implicit large eddy simulation iles they asserted the importance of capturing small scales of the flow and their impact on the cavitation shedding behavior long et al 2019 used implicitly filtered les with a homogenous cavitation model to simulate the transient turbulent cavitating flow around a clark y hydrofoil this study demonstrates the first practical application of les v v in a transient cavitating flow lloyd et al 2015 and guilmineau et al 2015 performed rans simulations around the pptc propeller in oblique flow inclined shaft cases with various mesh densities using rans they predicted propeller performance characteristics and pressure distribution as well as cavitation pattern on the blades yao 2015 also presented a numerical study to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of pptc propeller in oblique flow the study was performed by unsteady rans on an open source platform openfoam with a sliding mesh approach huuva and törnros 2016 simulated the cavitating flow around the pptc propeller in cavitating flow conditions given in heinke 2011a using an in house modified rans code based on the finite volume of open foam budich et al 2016 conducted a study for the same cases using a fully compressible numerical approach they simulated the cavitating flow by implicit les iles with a barotropic homogeneous mixture approach it was reported that even the iles correctly yields a cavitating vortex core in the wake of the propeller under the cavitating flow conditions a full resolution of the near wall region with their model was too demanding in terms of the computing resources and time fortes patella et al 2004 asserted that the collapse of cavitation in the vicinity of a surface could cause severe erosion due to the conversion of concentrated kinetic energy into among others acoustic energy in the form of high amplitude pressure waves hence they calculated the acoustic pressure to estimate the erosion potential another cavitation erosion model was porposed by bark et al 2004 which was similar to fortes patella et al 2004 in terms of its approach to energy flow the study by bark et al 2004 within the european project erocav aimed to generate a practical instrument for the calculation of the risk of erosion on ship propellers and rudders in an early design stage it highlights the whole hydrodynamic process from the early and total growth of the erosive cavity to the observed cavity collapse and potential rebound the model is based on the concept that erosion is chiefly the consequence of an accumulation of energy which transfers from large dimensional cavities to collapsing cavities that are imminent to a solid surface in this model the visual clarification of observations of cavitation process was aimed to be improved with the help of high speed video we can observe that this model can be preferably applied on large scale cavities rather than cavities that are small in size van terwisga et al 2009 developed the work by bark et al 2004 by hypothesizing that the erosive action of cavitation is mainly resulted from the acoustic shock waves released upon collapse of a focused cavity it was proposed here that the focusing of potential energy in the cavity is occurring through large scale vortices occurring in the breakup region of sheet cavitation li 2012 dular and delgosha 2009 investigated the possibility of predicting cavitation erosion on hydrofoils considering the collapse of single bubbles near a surface they proposed that depending on the jet velocity and the yield strength of the considered material a surface is supposedly eroded peters et al 2015 2018 further developed this model by considering the flow within a given distance from the surface they estimated the erosion by a numerical method based on the micro jet hypothesis they derived a coefficient to qualitatively asses the erosion potential based on the number of impacts and their intensities on the impacted areas li 2012 proposed an erosion intensity function for the assessment of the risk of cavitation erosion on the hydrofoil by post processing the results predicted by a multiphase rans model erosion is predicted in areas where these pressure derivatives exceed a certain threshold value qualitative correlation for risk of the erosion and unsteady cavitation phenomena has been succeeded by post processing the unsteady rans results of a naca0015 hydrofoil and an naca0018 45 hydrofoil a new erosion intensity function named intensity function method ifm was proposed based on derivatie of the pressure values on the surface in the study of li et al 2014 cavitation development and erosion prediction by the ifm function on naca0015 hydrofoil was investigated in that study predictions of the unsteady cavitation formation on the hydrofoil was very similar while the erosion estimations are not well consistent with the experimental results the reason was that user defined threshold value for the ifm which represents derivation of pressure was not determined accurately by the way in this paper the threshold values for the ifm is determined by a unique technique and the erosion on the naca0015 hydrofoil is predicted more consistent with the experimental results than the study of li et al 2014 nohmi et al 2008 stated a formula to derive erosion aggressiveness indices which are depend on the volume fraction the pressure and the temporal derivatives of these quantities depending on the considered index a low or a high value stands for high erosion potential hasuike et al 2009 predicted the cavitation erosion on a propeller with four differently loaded blades in a predefined wake field they tested painted surfaces in the experiments and their numerical prediction was carried out using the aggressiveness indices which were proposed by nohmi et al 2008 the indices that proposed by nohmi et al 2008 were also applied by ponkratov and caldas 2015 to predict cavitation erosion caused by a ship propeller near the leading edge of a rudder these authors used detached eddy simulations des to predict cavitation erosion on a rudder by simulating the full ship geometry full scale measurements on the rudder indicated that erosion was caused by the hub vortex of the propeller collapsing near the leading edge of the rudder the aggressiveness indices identified similar regions of erosion risk ponkratov 2015 also used the same des technique and erosion indices to estimate the erosion potential on a full scale propeller behind the full ship geometry comparing with the experimental data his erosion predictions showed a good qualitative agreement hidalgo et al 2015 predicted the erosion under unsteady cavitating flow conditions around a naca0015 hydrofoil their technique was based on bubble collapse strength on the hydrofoil usta et al 2017 simulated cavitating flow on a four bladed model propeller by des they tested three numerical methods to predict cavitation erosion with different formulas and compared erosion predictions with experiments that showed a qualitative agreement usta 2018 also used the same methods and estimated the cavitation erosion of kcd 193 propeller in different cavitating conditions the main two objectives of the current study are to demonstrate the power of the epm method for the cavitation erosion prediction which is found to be effective on both hydrofoils and marine propellers and to propose a new method to determine the user defined threshold values for the erosion intensity functions in accordance with these purposes we first numerically investigated the cavitating flow conditions around the naca0015 hydrofoil then cavitation development on the pptc propeller and the propeller performance for zero shaft and inclined shaft conditions were investigated in company with the numerical uncertainty analysis thus the used cfd models for cavitation modelling are validated and verificated after that the eroded regions on the hydrofoil and propeller blades were predicted using the three different erosion intensity models intensity function method ifm gray level method glm and erosive power method epm in this part the user defined threshold values for erosion intensity are determined by a new developed technique utilizing mean erosion intensity graphs and histogram graphs of erosion intensity within the above context this paper is structured to contain five sections following this introduction the theoretical background and details of cfd methodology is explained in section 2 section 3 presents the cavitating flow simulations around the naca0015 hydrofoil in this section unsteady cavitation development and erosion prediction on the hydrofoil are compared with the experimental results from the literature in section 4 cavitating flow simulations and erosion predictions on the pptc propeller are performed discussions about the used techniques are presented and finally section 5 draws conclusions from the study 2 theoretical background and numerical models all the simulations and post processing works were conducted using star ccm flow solver in cavitating conditions unsteady detached eddy simulation des with sst menter k detached eddy turbulence model was utilized to solve the governing equations 2 1 mathematical formulation and turbulence modelling the mass and

of the flow near of the boundary layer and les in the unsteady separated regions in the computational domain des turbulence model is set up so that boundary layers and irrotational flow regions are solved using a base rans closure model however the turbulence model is intrinsically modified so that if the grid is fine enough it will emulate a basic les subgrid scale model in detached flow regions for the shear stress transport sst menter k detached eddy turbulence model the turbulent length scales are modelled using iddes turbulent length scale approach to capture the rotation of the propeller a sliding mesh method was used two phases water and air are modelled using eulerian multiphase approach and the motion of the fluid volume throughout the computational domain is modelled with volume of fluid vof 2 2 cavitation modelling the homogeneous mixture approach was used to model the two phase cavitating flow the phases were assumed to be well mixed moving at the same velocity and to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium by sharing the same temperature and the same pressure the schnerr sauer cavitation model that is based on the rayleigh plesset equation was used to model the cavitation development sauer and schnerr 2000 schnerr sauer model implements a reduced rayleigh plesset equation which neglects the influence of bubble growth acceleration viscous effects and surface tension effects since each bubble cannot be modelled individually the cavitation is modelled using a number of bubbles in a control volume according to this approach the number of bubbles n can be calculated at any time from 5 n nb cl v where v is volume c l is volume fraction of liquid and n b is the number of bubble per unit volume of liquid 6 v n v b in addition volume of one bubble v

density α is the vapour volume fraction u v is the vapour phase velocity m e and m c are the mass transfers during the growth and collapse of the cavitation bubble respectively for cavitation

schnerr sauer model the bubbles were accepted as spherical and all seeds had the same radius at the beginning of the simulations it is used the following expression to relate the vapour volume

be determined in this model is the number of vapour bubbles per volume of liquid n b jiakai et al 2015 3 cavitating flow simulations and erosion predictions of naca0015 hydrofoil the simulated flow conditions given in table 1 can be found in li 2012 van rijsbergen et al 2012 ponkratov and caldas 2015 in the experiments naca0015 foil with a chord of c 60 mm and a width of 40 mm was placed in marin s high speed tunnel of a height of 80 mm li 2012 dimensions of the computational domain generated within this paper is to be the same with the study of li 2012 dimensions of the computational domain and the boundary conditions are presented in fig 1 and fig 2 respectively the length of the domain is generated as 9 5 chord lengths 9 5c starting 3c ahead of the leading edge and ending 5 5c behind the trailing edge the height of the domain is generated as 80 mm corresponding to the height of the test section fig 2 illustrates that the flow is given from velocity inlet and the end of the computational domain is defined as pressure outlet boundary condition the top and bottom boundaries and the hydrofoil are defined as wall in order to reduce computational complexity and solution time only half of the domain and hydrofoil is modelled this is acquired by using symmetry plane boundary condition that enables to accurately simulate the other half of the computational domain 3 1 grid generation by considering the cfl number and turbulent length scale the grid generation and mesh adaptation techniques for the naca0015 analysis are summarized as follows the numerical mesh is a structured grid however the mesh is composed of unstructured hexahedral cells on the hydrofoil prismatic cells are applied to near the surface for resolving the boundary layer and local volume mesh refinements around the hydrofoil were utilized in order to capture the cavitation development with high resolution in the regions where high pressure fluctuations and cavitation occur should have better mesh resolution usta and korkut 2018 within this approach a mesh adaptation and refinement study is applied to the naca0015 hydrofoil based on velocity pressure and volume fraction of vapour on the hydrofoil and around the hydrofoil after the mesh adaptation study the mesh generation is repeated by considering the change of the velocity and pressure gradient and the cavitation volume on and around the hydrofoil thus in the regions where high pressure fluctuations and cavitation occur had better mesh resolution final grid used in the simulations is presented in fig 3 below in the study mesh on the hydrofoil was generated on the based on the courant friedrichs levy cfl stability criterion courant number condition to provide numerical stability in the analysis the cfl is the ratio of the physical time step δ t to the mesh convection time scale which relates the mesh cell dimension δx to the mesh flow speed u as given below 18 cfl criteria u δ t δ x 1 time step is determined for the unsteady flow where the properties of the flow varies with time and it defines the time of each iterative solution usta and korkut 2018 time step is one of the most critical parameters in terms of the numerical stability of the analysis therefore accuracy of the results obtained in the analysis in the analysis the time step values are systematically lessened based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 5 and 2 considering the determined cfl numbers time step value is 2 x 10 5 in the medium mesh analysis reduced to 1 x 10 5 and increased to 5 x 10 5 in the verification studies the mesh refinement ratio r g was chosen to be 2 3 which was applied to the computational domain therefore three different types of mesh grid refinements were generated as coarse medium and fine mesh numbers for each mesh configuration are listed in table 2 in the analysis the first grid point from the wall y value was sufficiently small for the turbulence to be captured in the boundary layer if y 5 the solution is in linear sub region if 5 y 30 it is in buffer region and if 30 y 800 it is in the log law region white 2010 in this study the y values on the hydrofoil surface were kept in linear sub region y values on the hydrofoil varied between 0 0127 y 1 5 as shown in fig 4 b the courant number is typically calculated for each cell and should be less than or equal to 1 for numerical stability in this way the cfl numbers on the hydrofoil for medium mesh density and δt 2 x 10 5 varied between 0 00178 cfl 1 in the analysis as shown in fig 4 a the cfl numbers on the hydrofoil in this paper are smaller than 1 providing the cfl criteria fig 4 shows the cfl number and y values for medium mesh density and δt 2 x 10 5 reliability of the simulations in des modelling depends on the turbulent length scales in the computational region the detached eddy length scales in the whole computational domain and on the naca0015 hydrofoil for medium mesh density varied between 4 4 x 10 5 m δ d e s 5 4 x 10 3 m which is presented in fig 5 this range of calculated turbulent length scale values for the detached eddy length scale is suitable for des simulations 3 2 unsteady cavitation development predictions 3 2 1 cavitation development predictions for different mesh densities cavitation developments are predicted by using three different mesh densities such as fine medium and coarse when the physical time is 0 075 s and are presented in fig 6 vapour volume fraction value is taken as 50 isosurface is taken as 0 5 in generating the figures in the analyses predictions of cavitation development on the hydrofoil for three different mesh densities indicate similar characteristics in general however the cavitation development obtained by the use of fine mesh and medium mesh simulations are more extensive than that of the coarse mesh prediction and the medium and fine mesh simulations are more similar to those of experiment and cfd study in the literature given in fig 7 since the results obtained from the medium mesh and fine mesh simulations were very close to each other and the computational time of the fine mesh analysis takes 2 times longer than medium mesh analysis the medium size mesh is used for the cavitation predictions in the study thus validation of the unsteady cavitation development is carried out by running the simulation of medium mesh density and time step δt 2 x 10 5 boundary conditions and flow properties are established to be as identical as possible to the experimental conditions for the same physical times see figs 8 12 3 2 2 validation of the unsteady cavitation development predictions the figures below present the experimental and cfd results performed by ponkratov and caldas 2015 and the numerical predictions obtained within this study vapour volume fraction is taken as 50 generating the figures of this study when the cavitation developments by physical times are compared it is seen that the cavitation formation estimated by the ponkratov and caldas 2015 was less than the experimental results especially in the middle region of the hydrofoil however the cavitation development on the leading edge region is quite similar it can be said that the cavitation character is quite similar with the experimental results for the compared physical times for the cavitation development predicted within this study 3 3 cavitation erosion predictions on naca0015 hydrofoil by erosion functions in this sub section the physical and mathematical background of three different erosion indicators presented in the literature named intensity function method ifm gray level method glm and discrete bubble method dbm are reviewed and a new erosive indicator which is applied for the first time in this study is presented after that cavitation erosion predictions on the naca0015 hydrofoil using the intensity function method ifm the gray level method glm and the newly proposed erosive power method epm are presented and compared with the experimental and numerical results from the literature the cavitation erosion prediction simulations are performed using medium mesh density which time step value is 2 x 10 5 intensity function method ifm based on the time derivatives of the pressure on the surface that exceed a threshold to correlate the erosion intensity gray level method glm relates the standard deviation of vapour fraction to the erosive energy in order to apply the ifm and glm a user defined threshold value for erosion should be determined discrete bubble method dbm is fundamentally different from the other two cavitation erosion indicators in that the dbm is based on the development of the microscopic bubbles eskilsson and bensow 2015 in that method the erosive intensity is estimated by the computed pressure inside the advected microscopic bubbles using rayleigh plesset equation eskilsson and bensow 2015 provided more information about this method in this study the dbm method is not used due to the requirement of very high computational power the newly proposed erosive power method epm focuses on both the derivative of the vapour fraction and the derivative of pressure it is considered as the combination of ifm and glm these methods were applied to surface of the hydrofoil individually by generating field functions in the flow solver during the simulation process ifm glm and epm values were computed in each time step and the flow solver stores the data of them thus already computed values of the erosion functions are used in these methods when the simulation is converges and reaches to the planned physical time these values are ready to be used to generate the figures showing erosion prediction therefore these methods do not need an additional computational time in the post processing part of the study each of the erosion prediction method has its own user defined threshold values when generating the images that show erosion on the surface to predict the cavitation erosion formation by erosion indicators the most important parameters are these minimum and maximum threshold values used when generating the images that show where erosion occurs therefore the scalar minimum and maximum erosion values must be specified accurately the minimum threshold value represents the minimum value of the erosion on the surface it means that the erosion is supposed to be formed when the erosion value is higher than the minimum threshold value the maximum threshold value limits the maximum value of the erosion on the surface hence the user defined threshold values limits the erosion formation on the surface are very critical for generating the erosion images this paper presents a new technique to specify the user defined minimum and maximum threshold values in this technique the determination of the threshold values consists of 2 steps first cavitating flow analysis is performed during a specified physical time following this graphs are generated showing the average and maximum values of the epm glm and ifm on the hydrofoil the minimum values of the erosion intensity threshold are obtained from the average intensity physical time graphs of each erosion function therefore it is supposed that the erosion starts when the erosion value is higher than the average erosion value in addition the maximum threshold values are obtained from the histogram graphs which show the highest frequency of the erosion value on the surface details of the specifying threshold values for each erosion function ifm glm and epm are explained in the following sections in detail 3 3 1 erosion predictions for the naca0015 hydrofoil by intensity function method ifm intensity function method ifm uses the time derivative of the pressure values on the surface to predict the erosion in this technique it is supposed that if the time derivatives of the local pressure values exceeds a certain threshold erosion occurs in other words the time derivative of the pressure value equals to the erosion value at each time step application of this equation results in spatial distribution of the ifm erosion intensity function over the surface the ifm erosion function e ifm used in this study is 19 e i f m d p d t i f d p d t ε equation 19 is directly calculated and applied to our flow solver by generating a field function the minimum and maximum threshold values are specified by using average intensity physical time graphs and frequency ifm value histogram graphs as can be seen from the graph below the average erosion intensity value predicted by the ifm on the naca0015 hydrofoil is about 6 x 10 6 in the below histogram graph the frequency values of the maximum ifm function are shown the highest ifm value obtained on the naca0015 hydrofoil is around 1 x 10 8 according to the average and histogram graphs obtained using ifm functions erosion thresholds for generating image is 6 x 10 6 e i f m 1 x 10 8 therefore erosion prediction obtained with ifm given in fig 13 in the erosion prediction figures obtained by this study the red areas show high erosion intensity regions while the blue regions show lower erosion intensity regions the gray regions represent the non erosive parts of the blades 3 3 2 erosion predictions on naca0015 hydrofoil by gray level method glm gray level method glm is a direct numerical technique used to relate experimental data to erosion the basis behind the glm is that the power of the acoustic pressure wave is proportional to the pressure difference between the vapour pressure and the surrounding pressure in the liquid and the rate of change in vapour volume the idea here is to relate the standard deviation of vapour fraction to the erosive energy it is based on the work of dular et al 2006 the potential erosion power is calculated as 20 p p o t d v v d t p p v where p is reference pressure p v is saturation pressure and d v v d t is time derivative of the volume fraction of vapour on hydrofoil surface equation 20 is directly calculated and applied to our flow solver by generating a field function to estimate the erosion on the surface the glm erosion function e g l m used in this study is 21 e g l m d v v d t p p v the minimum and maximum threshold values are specified by using average intensity physical time graphs and frequency glm value histogram graphs the average erosion graph on the naca0015 using the e g l m equation is given by fig 14 according to the graph in fig 14 average erosion e g l m value is about 4 x 10 4 in the histogram graph given in fig 15 the frequency values of the maximum glm values are shown the highest glm value obtained on the naca0015 hydrofoil is around 5 x 10 5 according to the average and highest frequency values obtained from the graphs erosion prediction image was generated using the threshold 4 x 10 4 e g l m 5 x 10 5 as shown in fig 16 3 3 3 erosion predictions on naca0015 hydrofoil by erosive power method epm erosive power method epm which is a combination of glm and ifm depends on volume of cavitation and pressure changes by time eq 22 shows the erosion function of the epm used in this study 22 e e p m p p v d v v d t v v d p d t the methods glm and ifm are based on eq 22 also however they focus on the different terms the glm focus on the derivative on the vapour fraction while the ifm is based on the derivative of pressure eskilsson and bensow 2015 new proposed epm function focusses on both derivatives of pressure and vapour fraction as can be seen from the graph in fig 17 which shows the average erosion values predicted by the epm on the naca0015 hydrofoil is about 6 x 10 4 in the below histogram graph the frequency of the maximum values of the epm values are shown the highest epm value obtained on the naca0015 hydrofoil is around 15 x 10 5 according to the average and frequency the highest erosion values obtained from the graphs above erosion intensity thresholds for the epm is between 6 x 10 4 e e p m 15 x 10 5 fig 19 shows the erosion prediction of epm using these thresholds 3 4 comparisons of the cavitation erosion formation on the hydrofoil in the studies of li et al 2014 ponkratov and caldas 2015 eskilsson and bensow 2015 results of the paint test performed in 30 60 min and the erosion predictions under the same conditions using cfd were presented flow is from right to left when the paint test result given in fig 20 a is examined closely it is seen that there are eroded regions on the leading edge centre and trailing edge parts of the hydrofoil it can be deduced that glm result of eskilsson and bensow and erosion prediction by glm within this study are similar on the leading edge region and centre part of the hydrofoil the both method captures the erosion on the leading edge well however in the experimental result there is some eroded area on the trailing edge region as well glm result given in eskilsson and bensow 2015 fails to predict the erosion on the trailing edge however in the glm prediction of this study there is some erosion formation in the trailing edge region nevertheless it is not well predicted as a result the erosion on the trailing region of the hydrofoil could not be accurately obtained by glm by the way main reason of the difference between the result of eskilsson and bensow 2015 and this study is the user defined threshold values it can be supposed that the minimum and maximum erosion threshold specified by the new technique which is explained previously are more accurate than the values of eskilsson and bensow 2015 erosion prediction of ifm and epm obtained within this study and results from the literature are presented in fig 21 fig 21 a shows the 30 60 min paint test result b shows the ifm results of eskilsson and bensow 2015 and c shows the ifm result of li et al 2014 besides ifm and epm predictions of this study are presented in fig 21 d and e respectively in eskilsson and bensow 2015 it is stated that the accuracy of the result obtained with ifm is dependent on the user defined threshold value and it is emphasized that if the value is not correctly defined the result may be very erroneous in their study several threshold values were tested and the best result was obtained when the maximum threshold is 2 5 x 10 9 in the ifm result of li et al 2014 the maximum threshold is also 3 x 10 9 these studies fail to predict the erosion well especially on the trailing region in this study erosion threshold for generating image is 6 x 10 6 e i f m 1 x 10 8 when the results are compared qualitatively it can be said that the results of ifm obtained within this paper is looking more similar to the paint test result than the other cfd predictions obtained from the literature when the compared with other cfd results from the literature and the results of glm and ifm within this study the erosion result by epm is very promising glm missing the eroded part on the trailing edge where there is no cavitation formation vapour fraction ifm missing the erosion on the centre region of the hydrofoil where cavitation formation is maximum because it only includes the pressure it does not include the vapour fraction epm captures the eroded parts on the leading edge central and trailing edge regions because the epm function includes both the pressure fluctuations and cavitation development 4 cavitating flow simulations and erosion predictions on the pptc propeller the potsdam model basin sva provided comprehensive experimental data for open water and cavitation characteristics of vp1304 model propeller which were used as the test cases at the smp 11 and smp 15 workshops the experimental results can be found from https www sva potsdam de en potsdam propeller test case pptc the vp1304 model propeller named as pptc propeller in this paper is a five bladed controllable pitch propeller with a diameter of d 0 25 m the characteristics of pptc propeller is given in table 3 fig 22 a shows the pptc propeller at zero shaft conditions heinke 2011a 2011b while fig 1 b shows at the 12 inclined shaft conditions lübke 2015 these two conditions are simulated in this paper separately 4 1 operating conditions and grid resolution the first case simulated in this study is the validation of the cavitation test given in smp 11 and the second case is the validation of the cavitation test given in smp 15 which were conducted in the cavitation tunnel of the sva potsdam detailed information for the cavitating flow investigations on the pptc propeller for the other cases can be found in usta and korkut 2018 operating conditions for zero shaft inclination case 1 and 12 inclination case 2 cases are presented in table 4 below the rotational speed of the propeller and inflow speed of the tunnel were kept constant in the cfd simulations performed in this study in the cfd simulations for the pptc propeller the same numerical methods and mesh generation techniques given in section 3 1 were used the simulations were carried out for three different number of cells which are presented in table 5 mesh refinements around the propeller are for medium mesh density are shown in fig 23 courant number on the propeller for the case 1 is between 0 0012 cfl 1 whereas the y is between 0 0127 y 1 5 as shown in fig 23 for medium mesh density the detached eddy length scales for the around the propeller vary between 9 15 x 10 6 m δ d e s 1 54 x 10 2 m as shown in below length scale of the detached eddies are suitable small enough for des simulations see figs 18 and 24 4 2 validation and verification studies for the cavitating flow simulations the validation and verification v v studies were conducted using the methodology described in stern et al 2006 celik et al 2008 tezdogan et al 2015 usta 2018 and long et al 2019 4 2 1 validation of the open water propeller characteristics thrust coefficient of the cavitation tunnel experiments and cfd results are listed in table 6 the difference between the experimental results and cfd analysis are less than 2 therefore the models used in the cfd simulations can be assumed to be validated 4 2 2 verification of the thrust coefficient values of the cfd analysis des is a hybrid modelling approach that combines the rans and les in the computational domain for this reason verification of the cfd analysis for des can be conducted for rans and les regions separately various verification methods for rans simulations have been developed for engineering applications including the grid convergence index gci roache 1998 correction factor method cf stern et al 2006 factor of safety fs xing and stern 2011 and their variations eça and hoekstra 2014 however in les cavitation simulations the numerical error and the modelling error are coupled because the length scale used to filter the equations is grid dependent in other words the idea of grid independent solution does not apply to the traditional les modelling because unlike rans les is a multiscale model that resolves different time length scales on different grid resolutions long et al 2019 the uncertainty analysis method adopted in this study was based on the grid convergence index gci which is used for only rans because calculating the numerical error and model error was not possible for les in this study uncertainty assessments have been carried out via grid convergence index gci as recommended in the ittc procedure for cfd verification ittc 2011 verification analyses were performed to compute the numerical uncertainty for thrust coefficient of the vp1304 propeller in zero shaft and inclined shaft conditions given in table 4 for the grid convergence study a uniform mesh refinement ratio r g was chosen to be 2 3 which was applied to the computational domain therefore three different types of grid refinements were generated as coarse medium and fine the time step values were systematically reduced based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 and 2 5 the time step values used in this study were 5 x 10 5 2 x 10 5 and 1 x 10 5 the numerical uncertainty is predicted for the thrust coefficients with respect to mesh density and time step see table 7 considering the procedure for prediction of discretization error given above the numerical uncertainty u s n for the case 1 is calculated as u s n 3 32 while the total numerical uncertainty for case 2 is calculated as u s n 2 08 4 3 comparison of the cavitation development for the case 1 in this section cavitating flow observations around the pptc propeller for the investigated cases and cfd results for the same conditions are given the figures below are showing the cavitation development around the propeller at the case 1 conditions during the experiment tip vortex cavitation sheet cavitation and root type of cavitation on the suction side of the blades were observed as shown in fig 25 it is observed from fig 26 a that sheet cavitation on the suction side of the propeller and tip vortex cavitation developed in the radius range of r r 0 90 a root cavitation is also seen in addition a strong hub vortex cavitation structures developed heinke 2011b when figs 25 and 26 are investigated it can be deduced that the results of the cfd study fairly predict hub vortex sheet and root cavitation types on the other hand the tip vortex trail is not predicted completely due to the insufficient mesh resolution downstream of the propeller overall the predicted results show good agreement with the experiments for the case 1 4 4 comparison of the erosion predictions for the case 1 in this section cavitation erosion predictions of the pptc propeller by ifm glm and epm are given for the case 1 flow conditions the same methodology explained in section 3 for naca0015 hydrofoil is applied for the determination of the minimum and maximum threshold values and generating the figures that show the eroded regions on the propeller blades determination of the threshold values using the graphs of mean erosion intensity and histogram erosion intensity are presented in the following section 4 4 1 erosion prediction using ifm average erosion intensity values by time on the blades obtained by ifm is shown in the graph below as can be seen from the above graph the average erosion value predicted by the ifm on the propeller blades is about 2 4 x 10 6 in the below histogram graph the frequency values of the maximum ifm values are shown accordingly the ifm values are at the lowest on the blade 1 which is 2 x 10 6 and the highest on the blade 5 which is 1 8 x 10 7 time dependent cavitating flow conditions causes variation of the propeller loading distribution and therefore the erosion intensity on the propeller blades according to the graphs above erosion threshold of the ifm is 2 4 x 10 6 e i f m 1 8 x 10 7 the erosion prediction of the case 1 conditions using ifm is given in fig 29 the figure on the right hand side shows blade 5 which is on the top dead centre in the figure the red colored areas show high erosion intensity regions while the blue colored areas show lower erosion intensity regions the gray regions represents the non erosive parts of the blades see figs 27 and 28 fig 30 and fig 31 4 4 2 erosion prediction using glm average erosion values on the blades obtained by glm is shown in the graph below as can be seen from the above graph the average erosion value predicted by the glm in the blades is about between 2 5 x 10 5 and 5 5 x 10 5 according to this result it is decided that the minimum value of the erosion threshold is 2 5 x 10 5 in the below histogram graph the frequency of the maximum glm values are shown accordingly the glm values are at the lowest on the blade 1 which is 1 x 10 7 and the highest on the blade 5 which is 1 25 x 10 8 according to the surface erosion intensity estimation studies calculated erosion intensity thresholds using the glm is 2 5 x 10 5 e g l m 1 25 x 10 8 the erosion prediction of the case 1 flow conditions using glm is given in fig 32 below in the figure the red colored areas show high erosion intensity regions while the blue colored areas show lower erosion intensity regions the gray regions represents the non erosive parts of the blades the figure on the right hand side shows blade 5 which is on the top dead centre see fig 33 and fig 34 4 4 3 cavitation erosion prediction using epm average erosion values on the blades obtained by epm is shown in the graph below as can be seen from the above graph the average erosion values on the blades predicted by the epm is about between 3 x 10 5 and 5 75 x 10 5 according to this result it is decided that the minimum value of the erosion threshold for the visual is 3 x 10 5 in the below histogram graph the frequency values of the maximum epm values are shown accordingly the epm values are at the lowest on the blade 1 which is 1 x 10 7 and the highest on the blade 5 which is 1 25 x 10 8 according to the erosion prediction studies calculated erosion threshold values using the epm is 3 x 10 5 e e p m 1 25 x 10 8 the erosion prediction of the case 1 flow conditions using epm is given in fig 35 below in the figures the red areas show high erosion intensity regions while the blue regions show lower erosion intensity regions the gray regions represents the non erosive parts of the blades the figure on the right hand side shows blade 5 which position is on the top dead centre the propeller rotation and the non uniform flow characteristics around the propeller cause the blades to be exposed to different angles of attack for every position during one rotation this periodic change of flow conditions at the blades cause different cavitation structures and eroded regions on the blades the erosion indicators of ifm glm and epm agree that no erosion is predicted on the suction side of the propeller for the case 1 flow conditions however a slimline erosion is estimated on the pressure side of the blades as well as some erosion predicted to occur on the root of the pressure side of the blades estimates for the areas where erosion is expected to occur are similar for each of the three methods however it is found that epm and glm results are more similar than that of ifm in case 1 flow conditions 4 5 comparison of the cavitation development for the case 2 the figures below are showing the cavitation development around the propeller at the case 2 conditions shaft inclination causes strong spatial variation of the propeller loading distribution and therefore cavity pattern for the cases of pptc 2015 in the conditions of the case 2 cavitation developed on both sides of the propeller blades with 12 inclination angle as shown in fig 36 a on both sides of the propeller streak type sheet cavitation cloud cavitation and root cavitation were observed the results of the current cfd study predict well the cavitation pattern for the sheet cavitation however fails to predict cloud and streak characteristics of the sheet cavitation observed in the experiments given in lübke 2015 as a result the results of the current cfd study predict well the cavitation development observed in the experiments given in lübke 2015 for the case 2 conditions see figs 37 40 4 6 comparison of the erosion predictions for the case 2 cavitation erosion predictions for the 12 oblique flow for the case 2 flow conditions are presented below time dependent simulations and shaft inclination causes strong spatial variation of the propeller loading distribution and therefore cavitation erosion prediction of the each blade are different when the erosion prediction results of glm ifm and epm for case 1 and case 2 are examined it is found that the erosion estimations obtained in both flow conditions are similar to each other however it was found that epm and glm results are more similar than ifm in both case 1 and case 2 conditions because the effect of vapour fraction cavitation development on the erosion is ignored in the ifm however one of the two most important parameters in terms of erosion is the formation of cavitation in this study the erosion intensity functions used to predict the locations where erosion is supposed to occur as well as distinguishing between different erosion risks for these locations despite they do not consider the material related aspects of the erosion process they provide a qualitative estimation of the erosive potential of the cavitating flow some general resuls are obtained from the erosion predictions the glm ifm and epm functions are to be used already computed variables and can be applied without an additional computational cost thus the three methods are extremely suitable in terms of time cost the gray level method s glm main weakness is that it is unable to contain pressure fluctuations related to erosion hence it was only performing well if the flow did not have high pressure derivations the theoretical background of the intensity function method ifm is easy to understand and the indicator is very simple to implement nevertheless the method suffer from the fact that the pressure derivations are not enough to represent all the erosion formation it needs the effects of both time derivative of the pressure and volume fraction of vapour on the surface in both cases the proposed formulation of epm combines the strength of ifm and glm to enhance the erosion prediction for a wide variety of cases where erosion might occur and epm also includes both derivatives of pressure and vapour fraction values on the blade 5 conclusions a numerical study is carried out to predict cavitation development and erosion formation on a naca0015 hydrofoil and pptc propeller the cfd analysis carried out in this study by using the des sst menter k ω turbulence model including a mass transfer based on the schnerr sauer cavitation model the predicted cavitation patterns around naca0015 hydrofoil and the pptc propeller for each conditions are similar to that of the experimental results the erosion on the hydrofoil and propeller blades was predicted using erosion functions named intensity function method ifm gray level method glm and erosive power method epm the general conclusions below are drawn from the cfd analysis des is a powerful and reliable method for simulating the cavitating flows even though it is not yet possible to numerically predict all the dynamics of the cavitation completely compared results showed good agreement with the experimental observations the ifm glm and the newly proposed epm use already computed variables to define erosion indicators and so can be used without additional computational cost thus the three methods are suitable in terms of time and cost one of the most important aspects in making cavitation erosion predictions is determining the user given minimum and maximum values thresholds of the erosion indicators when generating the images that show the eroded regions to determine the minimum threshold values of the intensity functions graphs of the mean values of ifm glm and epm are used and proposed and to determine the maximum threshold values histogram graphs of the ifm glm and epm are used and proposed in this study for the naca0015 hydrofoil analysis the epm captures better the eroded parts on the leading edge central and trailing edge regions compared to those of ifm and glm therefore epm is found to be more consistent in predicting erosion for the hydrofoils for the pptc propeller analysis it is found that the erosion estimations of three methods are similar to each other however epm and glm results indicate more similar cavitation pattern compared to that of the experiments therefore in the simulated cases the proposed formulation of epm combines the strength of ifm and glm to enhance the erosion prediction for a wide variety of cases where erosion might occur finally the newly proposed epm based both on the time variation of the pressure and the cavitation volume is a powerful and reliable method for predicting the erosion for both hydrofoils and propellers 
22415,this study presents cavitation development and cavitation erosion predictions for the benchmark cases of naca0015 hydrofoil and pptc propeller vp1304 by using computational fluid dynamics cfd three dimensional unsteady cavitating flows around the hydrofoil and propeller are simulated using detached eddy simulation des with sst menter k turbulence model two phase flow is modelled using eulerian volume of fluid vof approach with cavitation formation predicted by schnerr sauer cavitation model predicted cavity structures on the hydrofoil as well as cavitation development and performance analysis for the propeller agreed fairly well with the experimental data given in open literature erosion on the hydrofoil and propeller are predicted by intensity function method ifm gray level method glm and a new proposed approach erosive power method epm particularly the erosion predictions obtained by the epm showed remarkable correlation with the damaged area observed from paint tests on the naca0015 hydrofoil qualitative erosion predictions on the pptc propeller for zero shaft and inclined shaft conditions are presented for the first time in the literature which seems to identify regions of potential cavitation damage consequently it is believed that this study would lay an important foundation for the widespread application of the epm in the future keywords naca0015 hydrofoil pptc propeller detached eddy simulation des cavitation erosion prediction erosive power method epm 1 introduction cavitation is a widespread physical phenomenon developing in regions where the fluid s operational pressure drops below its vapour pressure causing gas pockets and bubbles to form and collapse it occurs whenever there are fluctuations in the pressure and velocity of the fluid cavitation is a complex and often inevitable fluid mechanics phenomenon for marine propellers and it causes undesired effects such as noise vibration power loss and erosion the last one the cavitation erosion is perhaps the most remarkable damaging consequences of cavitation and it can severely damage propeller by removing material from the surface li 2012 peters et al 2018 it causes enormous economic losses in practical applications marine propellers operate under the flow conditions that vary significantly from each other and without excepting special propellers of research ships or military cavitation occurs on almost every marine propeller peters et al 2018 hence propeller needs to be designed to run in cavitating flow conditions and the risk of cavitation erosion needs to be controlled rather than avoided jian et al 2015 cfd simulations of turbulent cavitating flows have been improved with the development of powerful computers and various numerical cavitation models have been introduced to cfd codes in the last decade however the cavitation modelling is still very challenging since it involves rapid temporal and spatial variations of the flow properties and interactions between the liquid and vapour furthermore the cavitating flow is turbulent highly dynamic and unstable all these features require appropriate models to predict cavitating flow accurately li 2012 usta and korkut 2018 vallier 2013 in order to numerically predict cavitation erosion it is necessary to accurately model the cavitating flow and correlate the flow features to erosion damage franc and michel 2004 due to the nonlinear nature of the cavitating flow dynamics the governing equations require extensive effort to fully understand and accurately predict the phenomenon tseng 2010 within this respect different aspects have been proposed and many models have been developed to predict cavitation erosion for practical and macroscopic hydrodynamic flow problems by numerical methods the following studies are some of the most important attempts in the literature for cavitation and cavitation erosion modelling for hydrofoils and propellers using cfd one of the cornerstones for cavitating flow simulations by cfd is the study of bensow and bark 2010 an approach to simulate the dynamic cavitation behavior based on large eddy simulation les of the cavitating flow using an implicit approach for the subgrid terms together with a wall model and a single fluid is described in that study they handled the pressure velocity coupling using a piso algorithm with a modified pressure equation for improved stability when the mass transfer terms are active ji et al 2012 analyzed unsteady cavitating turbulent flows around a conventional marine propeller in a non uniform wake to predict the excited pressure fluctuations the numerical simulations of the propeller cavitation were based on the navier stokes equations solved with a mass transfer cavitation model the k ω sst turbulence model and a sliding mesh lu et al 2013 simulated the cavitating flow around two highly skewed propellers operating in open water and mounted on an inclined shaft the investigation was based on incompressible les in combination with a volume of fluid implementation to represent the two phases of liquid and vapour and a transport equation based method for the mass transfer between the phases high speed video recordings from experiments were used for comparison ji et al 2014 simulated 3d turbulent structure around a twisted hydrofoil by using the mass transfer cavitation model and the modified rng k ε model with a local density correction for turbulent eddy viscosity they predicted three dimensional cavity structures and shedding frequency very similar that of the experimental observations ji et al 2015 simulated cavitating flow around a naca66 hydrofoil with particular emphasis on understanding the cavitation structures and shedding dynamics using les coupled with a homogeneous cavitation model long et al 2018 simulated the transient cavitating turbulent flow around a delft twisted hydrofoil using les combined with the zwart cavitation model they developed a three dimensional lagrangian technology to provide an alternative method for the analyses in cavitating flow which is based on lagrangian viewpoint asnaghi et al 2018 simulated three dimensional fully turbulent cavitating flow around the delft twist 11 hydrofoil they mainly focused on cavitation structures shedding dynamics and vorticity distribution by using implicit large eddy simulation iles they asserted the importance of capturing small scales of the flow and their impact on the cavitation shedding behavior long et al 2019 used implicitly filtered les with a homogenous cavitation model to simulate the transient turbulent cavitating flow around a clark y hydrofoil this study demonstrates the first practical application of les v v in a transient cavitating flow lloyd et al 2015 and guilmineau et al 2015 performed rans simulations around the pptc propeller in oblique flow inclined shaft cases with various mesh densities using rans they predicted propeller performance characteristics and pressure distribution as well as cavitation pattern on the blades yao 2015 also presented a numerical study to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of pptc propeller in oblique flow the study was performed by unsteady rans on an open source platform openfoam with a sliding mesh approach huuva and törnros 2016 simulated the cavitating flow around the pptc propeller in cavitating flow conditions given in heinke 2011a using an in house modified rans code based on the finite volume of open foam budich et al 2016 conducted a study for the same cases using a fully compressible numerical approach they simulated the cavitating flow by implicit les iles with a barotropic homogeneous mixture approach it was reported that even the iles correctly yields a cavitating vortex core in the wake of the propeller under the cavitating flow conditions a full resolution of the near wall region with their model was too demanding in terms of the computing resources and time fortes patella et al 2004 asserted that the collapse of cavitation in the vicinity of a surface could cause severe erosion due to the conversion of concentrated kinetic energy into among others acoustic energy in the form of high amplitude pressure waves hence they calculated the acoustic pressure to estimate the erosion potential another cavitation erosion model was porposed by bark et al 2004 which was similar to fortes patella et al 2004 in terms of its approach to energy flow the study by bark et al 2004 within the european project erocav aimed to generate a practical instrument for the calculation of the risk of erosion on ship propellers and rudders in an early design stage it highlights the whole hydrodynamic process from the early and total growth of the erosive cavity to the observed cavity collapse and potential rebound the model is based on the concept that erosion is chiefly the consequence of an accumulation of energy which transfers from large dimensional cavities to collapsing cavities that are imminent to a solid surface in this model the visual clarification of observations of cavitation process was aimed to be improved with the help of high speed video we can observe that this model can be preferably applied on large scale cavities rather than cavities that are small in size van terwisga et al 2009 developed the work by bark et al 2004 by hypothesizing that the erosive action of cavitation is mainly resulted from the acoustic shock waves released upon collapse of a focused cavity it was proposed here that the focusing of potential energy in the cavity is occurring through large scale vortices occurring in the breakup region of sheet cavitation li 2012 dular and delgosha 2009 investigated the possibility of predicting cavitation erosion on hydrofoils considering the collapse of single bubbles near a surface they proposed that depending on the jet velocity and the yield strength of the considered material a surface is supposedly eroded peters et al 2015 2018 further developed this model by considering the flow within a given distance from the surface they estimated the erosion by a numerical method based on the micro jet hypothesis they derived a coefficient to qualitatively asses the erosion potential based on the number of impacts and their intensities on the impacted areas li 2012 proposed an erosion intensity function for the assessment of the risk of cavitation erosion on the hydrofoil by post processing the results predicted by a multiphase rans model erosion is predicted in areas where these pressure derivatives exceed a certain threshold value qualitative correlation for risk of the erosion and unsteady cavitation phenomena has been succeeded by post processing the unsteady rans results of a naca0015 hydrofoil and an naca0018 45 hydrofoil a new erosion intensity function named intensity function method ifm was proposed based on derivatie of the pressure values on the surface in the study of li et al 2014 cavitation development and erosion prediction by the ifm function on naca0015 hydrofoil was investigated in that study predictions of the unsteady cavitation formation on the hydrofoil was very similar while the erosion estimations are not well consistent with the experimental results the reason was that user defined threshold value for the ifm which represents derivation of pressure was not determined accurately by the way in this paper the threshold values for the ifm is determined by a unique technique and the erosion on the naca0015 hydrofoil is predicted more consistent with the experimental results than the study of li et al 2014 nohmi et al 2008 stated a formula to derive erosion aggressiveness indices which are depend on the volume fraction the pressure and the temporal derivatives of these quantities depending on the considered index a low or a high value stands for high erosion potential hasuike et al 2009 predicted the cavitation erosion on a propeller with four differently loaded blades in a predefined wake field they tested painted surfaces in the experiments and their numerical prediction was carried out using the aggressiveness indices which were proposed by nohmi et al 2008 the indices that proposed by nohmi et al 2008 were also applied by ponkratov and caldas 2015 to predict cavitation erosion caused by a ship propeller near the leading edge of a rudder these authors used detached eddy simulations des to predict cavitation erosion on a rudder by simulating the full ship geometry full scale measurements on the rudder indicated that erosion was caused by the hub vortex of the propeller collapsing near the leading edge of the rudder the aggressiveness indices identified similar regions of erosion risk ponkratov 2015 also used the same des technique and erosion indices to estimate the erosion potential on a full scale propeller behind the full ship geometry comparing with the experimental data his erosion predictions showed a good qualitative agreement hidalgo et al 2015 predicted the erosion under unsteady cavitating flow conditions around a naca0015 hydrofoil their technique was based on bubble collapse strength on the hydrofoil usta et al 2017 simulated cavitating flow on a four bladed model propeller by des they tested three numerical methods to predict cavitation erosion with different formulas and compared erosion predictions with experiments that showed a qualitative agreement usta 2018 also used the same methods and estimated the cavitation erosion of kcd 193 propeller in different cavitating conditions the main two objectives of the current study are to demonstrate the power of the epm method for the cavitation erosion prediction which is found to be effective on both hydrofoils and marine propellers and to propose a new method to determine the user defined threshold values for the erosion intensity functions in accordance with these purposes we first numerically investigated the cavitating flow conditions around the naca0015 hydrofoil then cavitation development on the pptc propeller and the propeller performance for zero shaft and inclined shaft conditions were investigated in company with the numerical uncertainty analysis thus the used cfd models for cavitation modelling are validated and verificated after that the eroded regions on the hydrofoil and propeller blades were predicted using the three different erosion intensity models intensity function method ifm gray level method glm and erosive power method epm in this part the user defined threshold values for erosion intensity are determined by a new developed technique utilizing mean erosion intensity graphs and histogram graphs of erosion intensity within the above context this paper is structured to contain five sections following this introduction the theoretical background and details of cfd methodology is explained in section 2 section 3 presents the cavitating flow simulations around the naca0015 hydrofoil in this section unsteady cavitation development and erosion prediction on the hydrofoil are compared with the experimental results from the literature in section 4 cavitating flow simulations and erosion predictions on the pptc propeller are performed discussions about the used techniques are presented and finally section 5 draws conclusions from the study 2 theoretical background and numerical models all the simulations and post processing works were conducted using star ccm flow solver in cavitating conditions unsteady detached eddy simulation des with sst menter k detached eddy turbulence model was utilized to solve the governing equations 2 1 mathematical formulation and turbulence modelling the mass and continuum conservation equations used in the cfd analyses are given below for more information the study of ferziger and peric 2012 is recommended 1 ρ t d i v ρ u 0 2 ρ t ρ u i x i 0 3 ρ u i t ρ u i u

of the flow near of the boundary layer and les in the unsteady separated regions in the computational domain des turbulence model is set up so that boundary layers and irrotational flow regions are solved using a base rans closure model however the turbulence model is intrinsically modified so that if the grid is fine enough it will emulate a basic les subgrid scale model in detached flow regions for the shear stress transport sst menter k detached eddy turbulence model the turbulent length scales are modelled using iddes turbulent length scale approach to capture the rotation of the propeller a sliding mesh method was used two phases water and air are modelled using eulerian multiphase approach and the motion of the fluid volume throughout the computational domain is modelled with volume of fluid vof 2 2 cavitation modelling the homogeneous mixture approach was used to model the two phase cavitating flow the phases were assumed to be well mixed moving at the same velocity and to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium by sharing the same temperature and the same pressure the schnerr sauer cavitation model that is based on the rayleigh plesset equation was used to model the cavitation development sauer and schnerr 2000 schnerr sauer model implements a reduced rayleigh plesset equation which neglects the influence of bubble growth acceleration viscous effects and surface tension effects since each bubble cannot be modelled individually the cavitation is modelled using a number of bubbles in a control volume according to this approach the number of bubbles n can be calculated at any time from 5 n nb cl v where v is volume c l is volume fraction of liquid and n b is the number of bubble per unit volume of liquid 6 v n v b in addition volume of one bubble v

be determined in this model is the number of vapour bubbles per volume of liquid n b jiakai et al 2015 3 cavitating flow simulations and erosion predictions of naca0015 hydrofoil the simulated flow conditions given in table 1 can be found in li 2012 van rijsbergen et al 2012 ponkratov and caldas 2015 in the experiments naca0015 foil with a chord of c 60 mm and a width of 40 mm was placed in marin s high speed tunnel of a height of 80 mm li 2012 dimensions of the computational domain generated within this paper is to be the same with the study of li 2012 dimensions of the computational domain and the boundary conditions are presented in fig 1 and fig 2 respectively the length of the domain is generated as 9 5 chord lengths 9 5c starting 3c ahead of the leading edge and ending 5 5c behind the trailing edge the height of the domain is generated as 80 mm corresponding to the height of the test section fig 2 illustrates that the flow is given from velocity inlet and the end of the computational domain is defined as pressure outlet boundary condition the top and bottom boundaries and the hydrofoil are defined as wall in order to reduce computational complexity and solution time only half of the domain and hydrofoil is modelled this is acquired by using symmetry plane boundary condition that enables to accurately simulate the other half of the computational domain 3 1 grid generation by considering the cfl number and turbulent length scale the grid generation and mesh adaptation techniques for the naca0015 analysis are summarized as follows the numerical mesh is a structured grid however the mesh is composed of unstructured hexahedral cells on the hydrofoil prismatic cells are applied to near the surface for resolving the boundary layer and local volume mesh refinements around the hydrofoil were utilized in order to capture the cavitation development with high resolution in the regions where high pressure fluctuations and cavitation occur should have better mesh resolution usta and korkut 2018 within this approach a mesh adaptation and refinement study is applied to the naca0015 hydrofoil based on velocity pressure and volume fraction of vapour on the hydrofoil and around the hydrofoil after the mesh adaptation study the mesh generation is repeated by considering the change of the velocity and pressure gradient and the cavitation volume on and around the hydrofoil thus in the regions where high pressure fluctuations and cavitation occur had better mesh resolution final grid used in the simulations is presented in fig 3 below in the study mesh on the hydrofoil was generated on the based on the courant friedrichs levy cfl stability criterion courant number condition to provide numerical stability in the analysis the cfl is the ratio of the physical time step δ t to the mesh convection time scale which relates the mesh cell dimension δx to the mesh flow speed u as given below 18 cfl criteria u δ t δ x 1 time step is determined for the unsteady flow where the properties of the flow varies with time and it defines the time of each iterative solution usta and korkut 2018 time step is one of the most critical parameters in terms of the numerical stability of the analysis therefore accuracy of the results obtained in the analysis in the analysis the time step values are systematically lessened based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 5 and 2 considering the determined cfl numbers time step value is 2 x 10 5 in the medium mesh analysis reduced to 1 x 10 5 and increased to 5 x 10 5 in the verification studies the mesh refinement ratio r g was chosen to be 2 3 which was applied to the computational domain therefore three different types of mesh grid refinements were generated as coarse medium and fine mesh numbers for each mesh configuration are listed in table 2 in the analysis the first grid point from the wall y value was sufficiently small for the turbulence to be captured in the boundary layer if y 5 the solution is in linear sub region if 5 y 30 it is in buffer region and if 30 y 800 it is in the log law region white 2010 in this study the y values on the hydrofoil surface were kept in linear sub region y values on the hydrofoil varied between 0 0127 y 1 5 as shown in fig 4 b the courant number is typically calculated for each cell and should be less than or equal to 1 for numerical stability in this way the cfl numbers on the hydrofoil for medium mesh density and δt 2 x 10 5 varied between 0 00178 cfl 1 in the analysis as shown in fig 4 a the cfl numbers on the hydrofoil in this paper are smaller than 1 providing the cfl criteria fig 4 shows the cfl number and y values for medium mesh density and δt 2 x 10 5 reliability of the simulations in des modelling depends on the turbulent length scales in the computational region the detached eddy length scales in the whole computational domain and on the naca0015 hydrofoil for medium mesh density varied between 4 4 x 10 5 m δ d e s 5 4 x 10 3 m which is presented in fig 5 this range of calculated turbulent length scale values for the detached eddy length scale is suitable for des simulations 3 2 unsteady cavitation development predictions 3 2 1 cavitation development predictions for different mesh densities cavitation developments are predicted by using three different mesh densities such as fine medium and coarse when the physical time is 0 075 s and are presented in fig 6 vapour volume fraction value is taken as 50 isosurface is taken as 0 5 in generating the figures in the analyses predictions of cavitation development on the hydrofoil for three different mesh densities indicate similar characteristics in general however the cavitation development obtained by the use of fine mesh and medium mesh simulations are more extensive than that of the coarse mesh prediction and the medium and fine mesh simulations are more similar to those of experiment and cfd study in the literature given in fig 7 since the results obtained from the medium mesh and fine mesh simulations were very close to each other and the computational time of the fine mesh analysis takes 2 times longer than medium mesh analysis the medium size mesh is used for the cavitation predictions in the study thus validation of the unsteady cavitation development is carried out by running the simulation of medium mesh density and time step δt 2 x 10 5 boundary conditions and flow properties are established to be as identical as possible to the experimental conditions for the same physical times see figs 8 12 3 2 2 validation of the unsteady cavitation development predictions the figures below present the experimental and cfd results performed by ponkratov and caldas 2015 and the numerical predictions obtained within this study vapour volume fraction is taken as 50 generating the figures of this study when the cavitation developments by physical times are compared it is seen that the cavitation formation estimated by the ponkratov and caldas 2015 was less than the experimental results especially in the middle region of the hydrofoil however the cavitation development on the leading edge region is quite similar it can be said that the cavitation character is quite similar with the experimental results for the compared physical times for the cavitation development predicted within this study 3 3 cavitation erosion predictions on naca0015 hydrofoil by erosion functions in this sub section the physical and mathematical background of three different erosion indicators presented in the literature named intensity function method ifm gray level method glm and discrete bubble method dbm are reviewed and a new erosive indicator which is applied for the first time in this study is presented after that cavitation erosion predictions on the naca0015 hydrofoil using the intensity function method ifm the gray level method glm and the newly proposed erosive power method epm are presented and compared with the experimental and numerical results from the literature the cavitation erosion prediction simulations are performed using medium mesh density which time step value is 2 x 10 5 intensity function method ifm based on the time derivatives of the pressure on the surface that exceed a threshold to correlate the erosion intensity gray level method glm relates the standard deviation of vapour fraction to the erosive energy in order to apply the ifm and glm a user defined threshold value for erosion should be determined discrete bubble method dbm is fundamentally different from the other two cavitation erosion indicators in that the dbm is based on the development of the microscopic bubbles eskilsson and bensow 2015 in that method the erosive intensity is estimated by the computed pressure inside the advected microscopic bubbles using rayleigh plesset equation eskilsson and bensow 2015 provided more information about this method in this study the dbm method is not used due to the requirement of very high computational power the newly proposed erosive power method epm focuses on both the derivative of the vapour fraction and the derivative of pressure it is considered as the combination of ifm and glm these methods were applied to surface of the hydrofoil individually by generating field functions in the flow solver during the simulation process ifm glm and epm values were computed in each time step and the flow solver stores the data of them thus already computed values of the erosion functions are used in these methods when the simulation is converges and reaches to the planned physical time these values are ready to be used to generate the figures showing erosion prediction therefore these methods do not need an additional computational time in the post processing part of the study each of the erosion prediction method has its own user defined threshold values when generating the images that show erosion on the surface to predict the cavitation erosion formation by erosion indicators the most important parameters are these minimum and maximum threshold values used when generating the images that show where erosion occurs therefore the scalar minimum and maximum erosion values must be specified accurately the minimum threshold value represents the minimum value of the erosion on the surface it means that the erosion is supposed to be formed when the erosion value is higher than the minimum threshold value the maximum threshold value limits the maximum value of the erosion on the surface hence the user defined threshold values limits the erosion formation on the surface are very critical for generating the erosion images this paper presents a new technique to specify the user defined minimum and maximum threshold values in this technique the determination of the threshold values consists of 2 steps first cavitating flow analysis is performed during a specified physical time following this graphs are generated showing the average and maximum values of the epm glm and ifm on the hydrofoil the minimum values of the erosion intensity threshold are obtained from the average intensity physical time graphs of each erosion function therefore it is supposed that the erosion starts when the erosion value is higher than the average erosion value in addition the maximum threshold values are obtained from the histogram graphs which show the highest frequency of the erosion value on the surface details of the specifying threshold values for each erosion function ifm glm and epm are explained in the following sections in detail 3 3 1 erosion predictions for the naca0015 hydrofoil by intensity function method ifm intensity function method ifm uses the time derivative of the pressure values on the surface to predict the erosion in this technique it is supposed that if the time derivatives of the local pressure values exceeds a certain threshold erosion occurs in other words the time derivative of the pressure value equals to the erosion value at each time step application of this equation results in spatial distribution of the ifm erosion intensity function over the surface the ifm erosion function e ifm used in this study is 19 e i f m d p d t i f d p d t ε equation 19 is directly calculated and applied to our flow solver by generating a field function the minimum and maximum threshold values are specified by using average intensity physical time graphs and frequency ifm value histogram graphs as can be seen from the graph below the average erosion intensity value predicted by the ifm on the naca0015 hydrofoil is about 6 x 10 6 in the below histogram graph the frequency values of the maximum ifm function are shown the highest ifm value obtained on the naca0015 hydrofoil is around 1 x 10 8 according to the average and histogram graphs obtained using ifm functions erosion thresholds for generating image is 6 x 10 6 e i f m 1 x 10 8 therefore erosion prediction obtained with ifm given in fig 13 in the erosion prediction figures obtained by this study the red areas show high erosion intensity regions while the blue regions show lower erosion intensity regions the gray regions represent the non erosive parts of the blades 3 3 2 erosion predictions on naca0015 hydrofoil by gray level method glm gray level method glm is a direct numerical technique used to relate experimental data to erosion the basis behind the glm is that the power of the acoustic pressure wave is proportional to the pressure difference between the vapour pressure and the surrounding pressure in the liquid and the rate of change in vapour volume the idea here is to relate the standard deviation of vapour fraction to the erosive energy it is based on the work of dular et al 2006 the potential erosion power is calculated as 20 p p o t d v v d t p p v where p is reference pressure p v is saturation pressure and d v v d t is time derivative of the volume fraction of vapour on hydrofoil surface equation 20 is directly calculated and applied to our flow solver by generating a field function to estimate the erosion on the surface the glm erosion function e g l m used in this study is 21 e g l m d v v d t p p v the minimum and maximum threshold values are specified by using average intensity physical time graphs and frequency glm value histogram graphs the average erosion graph on the naca0015 using the e g l m equation is given by fig 14 according to the graph in fig 14 average erosion e g l m value is about 4 x 10 4 in the histogram graph given in fig 15 the frequency values of the maximum glm values are shown the highest glm value obtained on the naca0015 hydrofoil is around 5 x 10 5 according to the average and highest frequency values obtained from the graphs erosion prediction image was generated using the threshold 4 x 10 4 e g l m 5 x 10 5 as shown in fig 16 3 3 3 erosion predictions on naca0015 hydrofoil by erosive power method epm erosive power method epm which is a combination of glm and ifm depends on volume of cavitation and pressure changes by time eq 22 shows the erosion function of the epm used in this study 22 e e p m p p v d v v d t v v d p d t the methods glm and ifm are based on eq 22 also however they focus on the different terms the glm focus on the derivative on the vapour fraction while the ifm is based on the derivative of pressure eskilsson and bensow 2015 new proposed epm function focusses on both derivatives of pressure and vapour fraction as can be seen from the graph in fig 17 which shows the average erosion values predicted by the epm on the naca0015 hydrofoil is about 6 x 10 4 in the below histogram graph the frequency of the maximum values of the epm values are shown the highest epm value obtained on the naca0015 hydrofoil is around 15 x 10 5 according to the average and frequency the highest erosion values obtained from the graphs above erosion intensity thresholds for the epm is between 6 x 10 4 e e p m 15 x 10 5 fig 19 shows the erosion prediction of epm using these thresholds 3 4 comparisons of the cavitation erosion formation on the hydrofoil in the studies of li et al 2014 ponkratov and caldas 2015 eskilsson and bensow 2015 results of the paint test performed in 30 60 min and the erosion predictions under the same conditions using cfd were presented flow is from right to left when the paint test result given in fig 20 a is examined closely it is seen that there are eroded regions on the leading edge centre and trailing edge parts of the hydrofoil it can be deduced that glm result of eskilsson and bensow and erosion prediction by glm within this study are similar on the leading edge region and centre part of the hydrofoil the both method captures the erosion on the leading edge well however in the experimental result there is some eroded area on the trailing edge region as well glm result given in eskilsson and bensow 2015 fails to predict the erosion on the trailing edge however in the glm prediction of this study there is some erosion formation in the trailing edge region nevertheless it is not well predicted as a result the erosion on the trailing region of the hydrofoil could not be accurately obtained by glm by the way main reason of the difference between the result of eskilsson and bensow 2015 and this study is the user defined threshold values it can be supposed that the minimum and maximum erosion threshold specified by the new technique which is explained previously are more accurate than the values of eskilsson and bensow 2015 erosion prediction of ifm and epm obtained within this study and results from the literature are presented in fig 21 fig 21 a shows the 30 60 min paint test result b shows the ifm results of eskilsson and bensow 2015 and c shows the ifm result of li et al 2014 besides ifm and epm predictions of this study are presented in fig 21 d and e respectively in eskilsson and bensow 2015 it is stated that the accuracy of the result obtained with ifm is dependent on the user defined threshold value and it is emphasized that if the value is not correctly defined the result may be very erroneous in their study several threshold values were tested and the best result was obtained when the maximum threshold is 2 5 x 10 9 in the ifm result of li et al 2014 the maximum threshold is also 3 x 10 9 these studies fail to predict the erosion well especially on the trailing region in this study erosion threshold for generating image is 6 x 10 6 e i f m 1 x 10 8 when the results are compared qualitatively it can be said that the results of ifm obtained within this paper is looking more similar to the paint test result than the other cfd predictions obtained from the literature when the compared with other cfd results from the literature and the results of glm and ifm within this study the erosion result by epm is very promising glm missing the eroded part on the trailing edge where there is no cavitation formation vapour fraction ifm missing the erosion on the centre region of the hydrofoil where cavitation formation is maximum because it only includes the pressure it does not include the vapour fraction epm captures the eroded parts on the leading edge central and trailing edge regions because the epm function includes both the pressure fluctuations and cavitation development 4 cavitating flow simulations and erosion predictions on the pptc propeller the potsdam model basin sva provided comprehensive experimental data for open water and cavitation characteristics of vp1304 model propeller which were used as the test cases at the smp 11 and smp 15 workshops the experimental results can be found from https www sva potsdam de en potsdam propeller test case pptc the vp1304 model propeller named as pptc propeller in this paper is a five bladed controllable pitch propeller with a diameter of d 0 25 m the characteristics of pptc propeller is given in table 3 fig 22 a shows the pptc propeller at zero shaft conditions heinke 2011a 2011b while fig 1 b shows at the 12 inclined shaft conditions lübke 2015 these two conditions are simulated in this paper separately 4 1 operating conditions and grid resolution the first case simulated in this study is the validation of the cavitation test given in smp 11 and the second case is the validation of the cavitation test given in smp 15 which were conducted in the cavitation tunnel of the sva potsdam detailed information for the cavitating flow investigations on the pptc propeller for the other cases can be found in usta and korkut 2018 operating conditions for zero shaft inclination case 1 and 12 inclination case 2 cases are presented in table 4 below the rotational speed of the propeller and inflow speed of the tunnel were kept constant in the cfd simulations performed in this study in the cfd simulations for the pptc propeller the same numerical methods and mesh generation techniques given in section 3 1 were used the simulations were carried out for three different number of cells which are presented in table 5 mesh refinements around the propeller are for medium mesh density are shown in fig 23 courant number on the propeller for the case 1 is between 0 0012 cfl 1 whereas the y is between 0 0127 y 1 5 as shown in fig 23 for medium mesh density the detached eddy length scales for the around the propeller vary between 9 15 x 10 6 m δ d e s 1 54 x 10 2 m as shown in below length scale of the detached eddies are suitable small enough for des simulations see figs 18 and 24 4 2 validation and verification studies for the cavitating flow simulations the validation and verification v v studies were conducted using the methodology described in stern et al 2006 celik et al 2008 tezdogan et al 2015 usta 2018 and long et al 2019 4 2 1 validation of the open water propeller characteristics thrust coefficient of the cavitation tunnel experiments and cfd results are listed in table 6 the difference between the experimental results and cfd analysis are less than 2 therefore the models used in the cfd simulations can be assumed to be validated 4 2 2 verification of the thrust coefficient values of the cfd analysis des is a hybrid modelling approach that combines the rans and les in the computational domain for this reason verification of the cfd analysis for des can be conducted for rans and les regions separately various verification methods for rans simulations have been developed for engineering applications including the grid convergence index gci roache 1998 correction factor method cf stern et al 2006 factor of safety fs xing and stern 2011 and their variations eça and hoekstra 2014 however in les cavitation simulations the numerical error and the modelling error are coupled because the length scale used to filter the equations is grid dependent in other words the idea of grid independent solution does not apply to the traditional les modelling because unlike rans les is a multiscale model that resolves different time length scales on different grid resolutions long et al 2019 the uncertainty analysis method adopted in this study was based on the grid convergence index gci which is used for only rans because calculating the numerical error and model error was not possible for les in this study uncertainty assessments have been carried out via grid convergence index gci as recommended in the ittc procedure for cfd verification ittc 2011 verification analyses were performed to compute the numerical uncertainty for thrust coefficient of the vp1304 propeller in zero shaft and inclined shaft conditions given in table 4 for the grid convergence study a uniform mesh refinement ratio r g was chosen to be 2 3 which was applied to the computational domain therefore three different types of grid refinements were generated as coarse medium and fine the time step values were systematically reduced based on the refinement ratio r t of 2 and 2 5 the time step values used in this study were 5 x 10 5 2 x 10 5 and 1 x 10 5 the numerical uncertainty is predicted for the thrust coefficients with respect to mesh density and time step see table 7 considering the procedure for prediction of discretization error given above the numerical uncertainty u s n for the case 1 is calculated as u s n 3 32 while the total numerical uncertainty for case 2 is calculated as u s n 2 08 4 3 comparison of the cavitation development for the case 1 in this section cavitating flow observations around the pptc propeller for the investigated cases and cfd results for the same conditions are given the figures below are showing the cavitation development around the propeller at the case 1 conditions during the experiment tip vortex cavitation sheet cavitation and root type of cavitation on the suction side of the blades were observed as shown in fig 25 it is observed from fig 26 a that sheet cavitation on the suction side of the propeller and tip vortex cavitation developed in the radius range of r r 0 90 a root cavitation is also seen in addition a strong hub vortex cavitation structures developed heinke 2011b when figs 25 and 26 are investigated it can be deduced that the results of the cfd study fairly predict hub vortex sheet and root cavitation types on the other hand the tip vortex trail is not predicted completely due to the insufficient mesh resolution downstream of the propeller overall the predicted results show good agreement with the experiments for the case 1 4 4 comparison of the erosion predictions for the case 1 in this section cavitation erosion predictions of the pptc propeller by ifm glm and epm are given for the case 1 flow conditions the same methodology explained in section 3 for naca0015 hydrofoil is applied for the determination of the minimum and maximum threshold values and generating the figures that show the eroded regions on the propeller blades determination of the threshold values using the graphs of mean erosion intensity and histogram erosion intensity are presented in the following section 4 4 1 erosion prediction using ifm average erosion intensity values by time on the blades obtained by ifm is shown in the graph below as can be seen from the above graph the average erosion value predicted by the ifm on the propeller blades is about 2 4 x 10 6 in the below histogram graph the frequency values of the maximum ifm values are shown accordingly the ifm values are at the lowest on the blade 1 which is 2 x 10 6 and the highest on the blade 5 which is 1 8 x 10 7 time dependent cavitating flow conditions causes variation of the propeller loading distribution and therefore the erosion intensity on the propeller blades according to the graphs above erosion threshold of the ifm is 2 4 x 10 6 e i f m 1 8 x 10 7 the erosion prediction of the case 1 conditions using ifm is given in fig 29 the figure on the right hand side shows blade 5 which is on the top dead centre in the figure the red colored areas show high erosion intensity regions while the blue colored areas show lower erosion intensity regions the gray regions represents the non erosive parts of the blades see figs 27 and 28 fig 30 and fig 31 4 4 2 erosion prediction using glm average erosion values on the blades obtained by glm is shown in the graph below as can be seen from the above graph the average erosion value predicted by the glm in the blades is about between 2 5 x 10 5 and 5 5 x 10 5 according to this result it is decided that the minimum value of the erosion threshold is 2 5 x 10 5 in the below histogram graph the frequency of the maximum glm values are shown accordingly the glm values are at the lowest on the blade 1 which is 1 x 10 7 and the highest on the blade 5 which is 1 25 x 10 8 according to the surface erosion intensity estimation studies calculated erosion intensity thresholds using the glm is 2 5 x 10 5 e g l m 1 25 x 10 8 the erosion prediction of the case 1 flow conditions using glm is given in fig 32 below in the figure the red colored areas show high erosion intensity regions while the blue colored areas show lower erosion intensity regions the gray regions represents the non erosive parts of the blades the figure on the right hand side shows blade 5 which is on the top dead centre see fig 33 and fig 34 4 4 3 cavitation erosion prediction using epm average erosion values on the blades obtained by epm is shown in the graph below as can be seen from the above graph the average erosion values on the blades predicted by the epm is about between 3 x 10 5 and 5 75 x 10 5 according to this result it is decided that the minimum value of the erosion threshold for the visual is 3 x 10 5 in the below histogram graph the frequency values of the maximum epm values are shown accordingly the epm values are at the lowest on the blade 1 which is 1 x 10 7 and the highest on the blade 5 which is 1 25 x 10 8 according to the erosion prediction studies calculated erosion threshold values using the epm is 3 x 10 5 e e p m 1 25 x 10 8 the erosion prediction of the case 1 flow conditions using epm is given in fig 35 below in the figures the red areas show high erosion intensity regions while the blue regions show lower erosion intensity regions the gray regions represents the non erosive parts of the blades the figure on the right hand side shows blade 5 which position is on the top dead centre the propeller rotation and the non uniform flow characteristics around the propeller cause the blades to be exposed to different angles of attack for every position during one rotation this periodic change of flow conditions at the blades cause different cavitation structures and eroded regions on the blades the erosion indicators of ifm glm and epm agree that no erosion is predicted on the suction side of the propeller for the case 1 flow conditions however a slimline erosion is estimated on the pressure side of the blades as well as some erosion predicted to occur on the root of the pressure side of the blades estimates for the areas where erosion is expected to occur are similar for each of the three methods however it is found that epm and glm results are more similar than that of ifm in case 1 flow conditions 4 5 comparison of the cavitation development for the case 2 the figures below are showing the cavitation development around the propeller at the case 2 conditions shaft inclination causes strong spatial variation of the propeller loading distribution and therefore cavity pattern for the cases of pptc 2015 in the conditions of the case 2 cavitation developed on both sides of the propeller blades with 12 inclination angle as shown in fig 36 a on both sides of the propeller streak type sheet cavitation cloud cavitation and root cavitation were observed the results of the current cfd study predict well the cavitation pattern for the sheet cavitation however fails to predict cloud and streak characteristics of the sheet cavitation observed in the experiments given in lübke 2015 as a result the results of the current cfd study predict well the cavitation development observed in the experiments given in lübke 2015 for the case 2 conditions see figs 37 40 4 6 comparison of the erosion predictions for the case 2 cavitation erosion predictions for the 12 oblique flow for the case 2 flow conditions are presented below time dependent simulations and shaft inclination causes strong spatial variation of the propeller loading distribution and therefore cavitation erosion prediction of the each blade are different when the erosion prediction results of glm ifm and epm for case 1 and case 2 are examined it is found that the erosion estimations obtained in both flow conditions are similar to each other however it was found that epm and glm results are more similar than ifm in both case 1 and case 2 conditions because the effect of vapour fraction cavitation development on the erosion is ignored in the ifm however one of the two most important parameters in terms of erosion is the formation of cavitation in this study the erosion intensity functions used to predict the locations where erosion is supposed to occur as well as distinguishing between different erosion risks for these locations despite they do not consider the material related aspects of the erosion process they provide a qualitative estimation of the erosive potential of the cavitating flow some general resuls are obtained from the erosion predictions the glm ifm and epm functions are to be used already computed variables and can be applied without an additional computational cost thus the three methods are extremely suitable in terms of time cost the gray level method s glm main weakness is that it is unable to contain pressure fluctuations related to erosion hence it was only performing well if the flow did not have high pressure derivations the theoretical background of the intensity function method ifm is easy to understand and the indicator is very simple to implement nevertheless the method suffer from the fact that the pressure derivations are not enough to represent all the erosion formation it needs the effects of both time derivative of the pressure and volume fraction of vapour on the surface in both cases the proposed formulation of epm combines the strength of ifm and glm to enhance the erosion prediction for a wide variety of cases where erosion might occur and epm also includes both derivatives of pressure and vapour fraction values on the blade 5 conclusions a numerical study is carried out to predict cavitation development and erosion formation on a naca0015 hydrofoil and pptc propeller the cfd analysis carried out in this study by using the des sst menter k ω turbulence model including a mass transfer based on the schnerr sauer cavitation model the predicted cavitation patterns around naca0015 hydrofoil and the pptc propeller for each conditions are similar to that of the experimental results the erosion on the hydrofoil and propeller blades was predicted using erosion functions named intensity function method ifm gray level method glm and erosive power method epm the general conclusions below are drawn from the cfd analysis des is a powerful and reliable method for simulating the cavitating flows even though it is not yet possible to numerically predict all the dynamics of the cavitation completely compared results showed good agreement with the experimental observations the ifm glm and the newly proposed epm use already computed variables to define erosion indicators and so can be used without additional computational cost thus the three methods are suitable in terms of time and cost one of the most important aspects in making cavitation erosion predictions is determining the user given minimum and maximum values thresholds of the erosion indicators when generating the images that show the eroded regions to determine the minimum threshold values of the intensity functions graphs of the mean values of ifm glm and epm are used and proposed and to determine the maximum threshold values histogram graphs of the ifm glm and epm are used and proposed in this study for the naca0015 hydrofoil analysis the epm captures better the eroded parts on the leading edge central and trailing edge regions compared to those of ifm and glm therefore epm is found to be more consistent in predicting erosion for the hydrofoils for the pptc propeller analysis it is found that the erosion estimations of three methods are similar to each other however epm and glm results indicate more similar cavitation pattern compared to that of the experiments therefore in the simulated cases the proposed formulation of epm combines the strength of ifm and glm to enhance the erosion prediction for a wide variety of cases where erosion might occur finally the newly proposed epm based both on the time variation of the pressure and the cavitation volume is a powerful and reliable method for predicting the erosion for both hydrofoils and propellers

proposed to achieve consensus among the asvs numerical simulations of utilizing the proposed cooperative system to move a large vessel sailing inbound the port of rotterdam are carried out to show the effectiveness of our method besides transporting barges and off shore platforms the proposed cooperative object transport system could also be a solution to coordinate non autonomous vessels and asvs in future autonomous ports where both human operated and autonomous vessels exist keywords cooperative multi vessel systems cooperative floating object transport distributed model predictive control formation control asv 1 introduction the autonomous surface vessel asv is an innovation to improve the safety and efficiency of waterborne transport and has become a hot topic in recent years liu et al 2016 schiaretti et al 2017 seeing the advantages of multi agent systems especially efficiency gains and fault tolerance cooperative control of multiple asvs has gained increasing attention chen et al 2018 lu et al 2018a huang et al 2019 li et al 2019 compared to an individual asv greater efficiency and operational capability can be realized by groups of asvs operating in a coordinated fashion potential applications of cooperative multi vessel systems cmvss include transportation in urban areas large object transport navigation assistance surveillance search and rescue etc this paper focuses on cooperative floating object transport i e a group of asvs coordinate their actions to transport floating objects cooperative object transport in multi robot systems has been studied for decades many coordination strategies have been proposed a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in multi robot systems for cooperative object transport is provided in tuci et al 2018 compared with land based robots asvs have different dynamics and control constraints when controlling the motion of land based robots sideway speed and coriolis force are not considered ota 2006 while those are important factors that need to be taken into account when control vessels fossen 2011 therefore adjustments are needed when applying the methods for land based robots to control multiple asvs the number of research on cooperative object transport in the field of waterborne transport is relatively small a related topic is the manipulation of large vessels with multiple tugboats in braganza et al 2007 esposito et al 2008 bidikli et al 2016 control strategies that enable a barge to track a reference trajectory or orientation using a swarm of autonomous tugboats are discussed in those papers the tugboats are attached to the barge and apply forces at some fixed incident angles the tugboats appear in essence as independent azimuth thrusters in feemster et al 2006 the initial positions of the tugboats are arbitrary nonetheless once contact is established the location of the tugboats are time invariant moreover only rotational motion is considered the tugs are normal to the surface of the vessel to provide torque to rotate the vessel from current orientation to the desired orientation in those papers the attitude of the tugboats is not considered the heading of tugboats usually differs sharply from the path direction which is inefficient while moving the object along the path besides collision avoidance is not considered in those papers if physical connections between the object and asvs and the attitude of the asvs are considered such as connecting the object and the asvs using ropes the maintaining of the geometric configuration during movement is required i e formation tracking formation tracking aims at controlling the vessels to maintain a prescribed configuration and to follow predefined trajectories in oh et al 2015 and liu and bucknall 2018 detailed surveys on formation control of multi agent systems are presented in the field of maritime transport formation tracking has attracted increasing interests such as thorvaldsen and skjetne 2011 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2018b however collision avoidance is usually not taken into account or only considered the conflicts among the formation mates moreover conventional methods such as leader follower and virtual structure usually either consider obstacles before the formation is formed or use shape variation and regeneration for collision avoidance during trajectory tracking however when the asvs are connected to the object changing the formation shapes to avoid obstacles is impossible this paper focuses on the control problem of cooperative floating object transport i e utilizing a team of asvs to transport a larger floating object such as a large vessel barge or offshore platform the object and the asvs are connected with towlines and the asvs maintain the formation when moving the object we propose a multi layer distributed control structure for the object transport system with the designed scheme the original cooperative transport problem is considered as the combination of several sub problems trajectory tracking of the object control allocation and formation tracking of the asvs controllers are designed using model predictive control mpc to control the motion of the asvs and the object then an optimization based allocation method is designed to ensure the forces that are needed to move the object are produced jointly by the asvs a nonlinear towline model is employed for the transformation of forces between the asvs and the object considering the mass and the elasticity of the towline a negotiation framework based on the alternating direction of multipliers method admm is employed to achieve consensus among the asvs the contribution of this study is listed as follows firstly from the perspective of concept this paper proposes a formation based method for transporting floating objects the asvs do not need frequent large attitude changes which benefits smoother and faster object transport secondly from the perspective of control algorithm design the object transport problem is solved in a distributed fashion the supervisory coordinator takes the feedback of the asv controllers into account agreements are achieved through negotiations thirdly from the perspective of communication requirements the information that the controllers exchange consist of their predicted states thus the proposed framework is suitable for negotiation among heterogeneous vessels moreover in the proposed method asvs are connected to the object with towlines the dynamics of the object and the towlines are taken into consideration as well the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the cooperative object transport system being studied the dynamic model of an asv and a model of towline are introduced subsequently the control strategy for object transport is proposed in section 3 we design a multi layer cooperative control scheme and an admm based dmpc framework is proposed to reach consensus on the following actions to be taken among the controllers in section 4 the scenarios in which the proposed cooperative system move a large vessel sailing inbound the port of rotterdam are simulated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method main findings and future research directions are provided in section 5 2 system model in this section the model of a formation based cooperative object transport system is constructed the dynamic model of an asv and a model of towline are introduced 2 1 dynamic model of an asv cooperative object transport requires the coordination and synchronization of pushing pulling forces by a group of asvs in order to transport objects in this paper we use a triangular configuration as an example to illustrate the proposed framework the method can also be used for other configurations the geometric configuration of the asvs is shown in fig 1 asv 1 and 2 are located symmetrically on the starboard side and the portside of the object the line between the object and asv 3 is perpendicular to the line between asv 1 and 2 with this configuration the surge and sway forces to move the object are provided by the three asvs while the moment to change the heading of the object is provided by asv 1 and 2 thus the problem of object transport becomes the problem of coordinating the three asvs to provide forces for moving the object following a reference path while keeping formation to calculate the forces and moment that are needed to move the object the object is treated as a virtual vessel the dynamics of the asvs and the virtual vessel are described with the 3 dof model proposed in fossen 2011 1 η i t r ψ i t ν i t 2 m i ν i t c i ν i t ν i t d i ν i t τ i t where r ψ i is a rotation matrix r ψ i t cos ψ i t sin ψ i t 0 sin ψ i t cos ψ

including rigid body and added mass matrices c i is the coriolis centripetal matrix including rigid body and added mass coriolis centripetal matrices d i is the damping force in this paper we consider a linear damping force with x i t η i t t ν i t t t and τ i t the system state and input respectively the dynamic model 1 2 can be expressed as 3 x i t f i x i t τ i t 0 3 3 r i ψ i t 0 3 3 m i 1 c i

towlines and asvs are in mechanical equilibrium the forces provided by each asv are applied to the towlines and the forces are transferred along the towlines to the object in this paper we focus on the horizontal plane denote the forces along the towlines on the horizontal plane as f k f 1 fore k f 1 aft k f 2 fore k f 2 aft k f 3 stern k t the relation between the forces that are needed to move the object τ k and f is 5 τ k γ k f k where τ τ u τ v τ r t and γ k is the transformation matrix γ k cos θ 1 fore k cos θ 1 aft k cos θ 2 fore k cos θ 2 aft k 1 sin θ 1 fore k sin θ 1 aft k sin θ 2 fore k sin θ 2 aft k 0 l tie sin θ 1 fore k ω l tie sin θ 1 aft k ω l tie sin θ 2 fore k ω l tie sin θ 2 aft k ω 0 where θ i fore k and θ i aft k are the angles between the towlines and central line of the object whose subscript and superscript indicate different towlines see fig 1 ω is the angle of the segment between two ties and the center of mass of the object l tie is the distance from the center of mass of the object to the segment between the ties we assume that the towlines have a uniform density due to gravity the towline will be shaped as a curve in fig 2 we use the towline that connects the fore tie at the object and asv i as an example t 1 fore is the tension in the horizontal direction t 1 fore is the tension on the towline g r and l r are the gravity and the length of the towline d h 1 fore is the horizontal distance between the two ends of the towline different models have been proposed to calculate the tension on the towline such as in fitriadhy and yasukawa 2011 tao et al 2019 zhou in this paper a catenary model is applied considering the mass and the elasticity of the towline tao et al 2019 zhou 6 t 1 fore k d h 1 fore k 2 t 1 fore k ϖ sinh 1 ϖ l r 2 t 1 fore k e a l r where ϖ is the density of the towline e is the so called young s modulus of the towline a is the cross sectional area of the towline at the same time because asv 1 is connected to the object with two towlines the distances between the asv and its connected ties should also meet the law of cosines i e 7 cos θ 1 fore k d h 1 fore k 2 d tie 2 d h 2 aft k 2 2 d h 1 fore k d tie 3 dmpc for cooperative object transport mpc has been popular in practical applications since its early days mayne 2014 for waterborne transport mpc methods also have many advantages especially when considering the predictive property of mpc methods chen et al 2018 moreover mpc considers the latest available measurement of the system s state and up to date information regarding disturbances which provides the mpc methods the capability to a certain extent to be robust against disturbances besides dmpc distributed model predictive control has many advantages for the control of large scale networked systems negenborn and maestre 2014 therefore we consider dmpc as a suitable approach to carry out the task of object transport in this section we propose a dmpc approach for cooperative object transport we firstly introduce a multi layer control structure for the object transport system then we linearize the above mentioned dynamic model to form the prediction model of the mpc controllers for the asvs and the virtual vessel after designing the controller for the object an optimization based control allocation method is presented to determine the forces that each asv should provide in the end an iterative negotiation framework is provided for the cooperation of the controllers 3 1 control structure fig 3 illustrates the multi layer structure for the control of the object transport system a coordinator at the higher level is responsible for two tasks one is to determine the virtual forces to control the motion of the object τ the other is to compute the forces f i u and f i v that asv i should provide which ensures that the commanded virtual control τ is produced jointly by the asvs then asv controller i determines its own control τ i according to its own state x i while providing the rewired forces the actions that the asvs take decide the final state of the object i e x the function of the coordinator can be fulfilled either by one of the asv controllers or an additional controller on the object or one of the asvs or on the shore 3 2 mpc controller design 3 2 1 linear prediction model the basic concept of mpc is to use a dynamic model to forecast system behavior and then optimizing the forecast to produce the best decision rawlings and mayne 2015 therefore at each time step a prediction is needed in this paper the successively linearized model presented in zheng et al 2014 2016 is adopted as the prediction model for the following reasons the dynamics described in 3 are highly nonlinear in this paper an mpc framework is used for the control of asvs if this nonlinear model is directly used for prediction in the mpc controller the mpc online predictions and optimizations would be too time consuming in zheng et al 2014 a comparison on the trajectory tracking performance and computation time of asv controller using non linear mpc and liner mpc shows that non linear mpc has a much higher computational complexity especially under larger prediction horizons than linear mpc moreover in our method agreements among the controllers are achieved through iterative negotiations a small increase in the computation time at each iteration may make the total time too long for real world application different from conventional linearization method the successively linearized method approximate the dynamics based on the seed state calculated in each time step over the prediction horizon the actual state usually does not change much from the seed state therefore it can provide a good approximation to the nonlinear dynamics of asvs we have carried out an analysis of the linearization errors in appendix a which shows that the linearized model can provide adequate accuracy for the control of asvs in this paper we adopt a dynamic model of marine surface vehicles with three dofs surge sway and yaw proposed in fossen 2011 this model has been widely used for the motion control of asvs various models have been proposed to describe the dynamics of vessels such as holonomic models kinematic models and dynamic models huang et al 2020 van gelder however no models can predict the dynamics of the vessels operating in real life environments without any error as the dynamics are influenced by many factors such as the shape of the hull and dimensions even for a vessel its dynamics can be varying with different loads depth of the waterways and so on schlichting 1934 liu et al 2015 the aim of this research is not to construct the most accurate dynamic model but to develop a method that can work under the situation that the actual states of an asv differ from the states that a mathematical model describes in the proposed mpc framework the controller calculates at each time step a sequence of control inputs for the whole prediction horizon after which the control input for the first control sample will be implemented thus at each time step the controller will take corrective actions if the actual state differs from the predicted state at each time step as a start point the control sequence computed in last time step is shifted one sample with an additional of zeros at the end using this extended control sequence as seed input τ e k we can obtain the seed state x e k with 3 by applying taylor s theorem we can obtain the approximation state of the asv at k 1 x i k 1 k with following discrete linearized model 8 x i k 1 k x i e k 1 k a i d k k x i k k x i e k k b i d k k τ i k k τ i e k k where a i d k k f i x i x i e k k τ i e k k b i d k k f i τ i x i e k k τ i e k k are the jacobian matrices 3 2 2 reference trajectory generation to calculate the forces and moment that are needed to make the object following a predetermined path the object is regarded as a virtual vessel in the cooperative system whose dynamics can be described using 3 one of the tasks of the coordinator is to control the motion of this virtual vessel to track a predetermined path the reference path is usually generated by discretizing segments between the waypoints with the double integrator dynamics and a constant speed v ˆ i e p i k 1 p i k v ˆ p i k is the reference position at k see the orange dots in fig 4 a in the task of object transport the asvs keep formation while navigating the reference state that each asv should track includes reference trajectory and heading i e w i k p i k t ψ i k t the initial reference trajectory can be calculated according to the geometric relations shown in fig 1 and the reference heading of the asvs is equal to the required heading of the object denoted as 9 w i k g i w k however if we connect the waypoints directly there might be abrupt changes in the trajectories of the asvs see fig 4 a thus we smooth the connection between two segments with kinematic interpolation long 2016 after discretizing the segments with the double integrator dynamics a connection between a start state in the segment w p i 1 w p i and an end state in the segment w p i w p i 1 is made with a changing velocity the acceleration during this period k is formulated as a linear function of time in order to describe object acceleration as smooth motion i e a t b m t the position and velocity can be expressed as 10 p t p 0 0 t v t d t 11 v t v 0 0 t b m t d t where v t is the corresponding velocity accordingly given the start position and velocity p k v k and the end position and velocity p k k v k k we can obtain a smooth connection between two segments without any abrupt changes in speed or direction see fig 4 b the smoothed reference trajectory between origin and destination is represented by a sequence of positions the trajectory of each asv can be calculated by 9 accordingly at each time step each asv controller and coordinator finds the reference position which is closest to its current position and use the subsequent positions over the predictive horizon as the reference trajectory 3 2 3 control problem the virtual control effort that is required to control the object to track the reference trajectory are determined by solving the primal optimization problem 12 minimize j τ k l 1 h p α η k l k w k l 2 2 γ τ k l 1 k 2 2 subject to i v l h p 13 x k k x k 14 ν min ν k

and heading d i k l k is the distance between asv i and the object with the information sent by asv i d i k l k p k l k p i k l k p k l k is the prediction made at time step k about the position of the object at time step k l and p i is the position of the asv i that the object received d i safe is the safety distance of the object ξ is a set of position in navigable waters i e spaces which are collision free considering static obstacles τ k indicates control input over the prediction horizon i e τ k τ k k t τ k 1 k t τ k h p 1 k t t this problem 12 17 can be transferred into a mixed integer linear programming problem when the collision avoidance constraint 16 is rewritten with binary variables details can be found in chen et al 2018 3 3 control allocation the virtual control effort that needed to move the object τ k is provided by the 3 asvs through the towlines there is actuator redundancy when considering the whole system i e the cooperative object transport system is an over actuated system here we use an optimization based allocation method to compute a control input that ensures that the commanded virtual control τ k is produced jointly by the asvs we formulate the control allocation objective function as minimize the forces along the towlines considering the total forces that the asvs can provide while producing required forces thus solving the control allocation problem involves solving following nonlinear optimization problem 19 minimize l 1 h p f k l k f ˆ 2 2 subject to i v l h p 20 τ k l k γ k l k f k l k 21 0 f k l k f max 22 θ min θ i fore

ˆ is the forces that transferred by the towlines when τ 0 while the asvs are keeping a preferred configuration γ is the transformation matrix between τ and f f max is the maximum forces on the towline subsequently the forces each asv should provide can be decomposed into two components in surge and sway directions f i u f i v in its own body fixed frame fig 5 illustrate the decomposition using asv 1 as an example i e f i u k f i v k t i ψ i k ψ k f i fore k f i aft k where t i ψ i k ψ k is the transformation matrix 25 t i ψ i k ψ k cos θ i fore k δ ψ i k cos θ i aft k δ ψ i k sin θ i fore k δ ψ

path direction therefore the differences between the heading of the object and the asvs are small i e δ ψ i k 0 k and small angle approximation can be used to simplify 25 for each asv it should not only follow its own reference trajectory to keep the required related distance with the object but also provide required forces to move the object accordingly the control problem that the asv controller i needs to solve is 26 minimize j i τ i k l 1 h p α η i k l k w i k l 2 2 γ τ i k l 1 k 2 2 subject to i j v i j l h p 27 ν i min ν i k l k ν i max 28 τ i k l k f i tow k l k τ i min 29 τ i

of the object according to desired configuration and the towline model 6 for example for asv 1 after calculating d h 1 aft k the distance between the tie and the center of mass of the asv 1 according to the tension on the towline the position of asv 1 can be calculated as 34 p 1 k d h 1 aft k cos θ 1 fore k sin θ 1 fore k 0 l 1 asv d tie 2 0 where d tie is the length between two ties that are connected to asv 1 in constraints 30 and 31 we set a tolerance for formation keeping for the following reasons firstly the asvs and the object are connected with ropes the asvs are possible to have small fluctuations around the desired positions secondly in the optimization we use a linearized model to predict the dynamics of the asvs and the object the actual states inevitably differ from the predictions the tolerance can help to avoid the situation that the optimization problem at the first iteration is infeasible at each time step thirdly the tolerance relaxes the need for formation keep which can help to avoid frequent control changes and is beneficial for fast convergence to the agreements 3 4 cooperative framework 3 4 1 combined overall control problem the ideal situation is that the asvs follow the reference state and provide the required force that the coordinator informs them however the asvs may fail to follow the reference paths when providing the required forces due to actuator saturation or other physical limitations as we mentioned in section 2 the positions of the asvs determine the final position of the object this means that when the asvs cannot achieve the desired state the object cannot achieve its desired state either thus the forces needed to move the object also change and so are the forces each asv needs to provide therefore the asv controllers and the coordinator needs to negotiate with each other to reach an agreement the agreements among the asvs are achieved when the expected trajectory of the object calculated based on the asvs and the predicted trajectory that the coordinator calculated become consensus therefore the combined overall control problem for the object transport system can be formulated as 35 minimize i 1 3 j i τ i k j τ k subject to i v 36 η i k h i η k 37 η k h i 1 η i k where 36 indicates that the predicted trajectory of asv i equals the expected trajectory calculated according to the predicted trajectory of the object and their geometric relation and vice versa 37 indicates the predicted trajectory of the object equals the expected trajectory of the object calculated according to the predicted trajectory of asv i h i indicate the geometric relation between the object and the asvs considering the desired formation and the towline model described by 6 and 7 3 4 2 admm based multi layer negotiation framework admm has been widely used for consensus problems with separable objective functions boyd et al 2011 admm scheme takes the form of a decomposition coordination procedure in which the solution is found through iterations of solving some sub problems the agreements among the asvs and the coordinator are achieved in the a iterative way see algorithm 1 image 4 except for step 2 every step is carried out independently in parallel for each asv i the controllers use the information about the interconnecting variables from the most recent iteration 4 numerical simulations in this section numerical simulations of the scenarios in which the proposed cooperative system move a large vessel sailing inbound the port of rotterdam are carried out to show the potential of the proposed approach both static and dynamic obstacles are considered in the simulation we compare the results of two settings one is constant configuration ignoring the dynamics of towlines the other is time varying configuration considering the nonlinear towline model simulations are carried out with matlab 2016a the linear optimization problems of the controllers are solved by ilog cplex optimization studio version 12 6 3 and the nonlinear optimization problems are solved by ipopt wächter and biegler 2006 with the solution that is found in the former iteration as a starting point the simulations are run on a pc with a dual core 3 2 ghz intel r core tm i5 3470u cpu and 8 gb of ram 4 1 set up the scenario we consider involves three asvs that transport a floating object e g a non autonomous large vessel from the north sea to a terminal in the port of rotterdam as shown in fig 6 the asvs have to transport the object following the path indicated by waypoints an obstacle e g a disabled vessel at anchor is located on the reference path in the port so called waterborne agvs are employed for inter terminal transport zheng 2016 the waterborne agv automated guided vehicles is set as sailing with a constant speed 0 35 m s with higher priority than the proposed object transport system the reference path of the object to be moved has overlap with the waterborne agv path as indicated in fig 6 when encountering with the waterborne agv the proposed cooperative asvs should give way the coordinates of the waypoints obstacle and waterborne agv path are provided in table 1 two cases are considered in the simulation constant configuration in this case the towlines are regarded as straight lines ignoring the mass the related distances between asvs and the object are predetermined as 1 255 2 m for asv 1 2 and 1 255 m for asv 3 time varying configuration in this case the related distances between the asv 1 2 and the object are determined by the towline model 6 and 7 and the relative positions between the asv 3 and the object is 1 255 m for the asvs the parameters of the model are scaled up according to the froude scaling law with a scaling factor χ 1 100 according to the scaling law the multiplication factors for length force moment and time are χ χ 3 χ 4 and χ respectively for the object the scale factor is 1 200 when calculating related data related parameters in the simulation are given in table 2 the simulation results underneath are shown with χ 1 100 4 2 results and discussion in the two cases the trajectories of the asvs and the object are similar the trajectories of the asvs and the object in case 1 are shown in fig 7 the snapshots show how the asvs avoid collision with the static obstacles and the waterborne agv while maintaining the required formation safety is further confirmed by fig 8 for both the object and the asvs their distances with the static obstacle and the waterborne agv are larger than the corresponding safety distances fig 9 shows the path following performance of the proposed cooperative system in both cases mostly the asvs can move the object along the reference path deviations occur when the object and the asvs have to depart from the path to avoid obstacles fig 10 provides the distance between the asvs and the object in the two cases in the figure l i asv k is the required distance when the towline model is considered l i asv k 2 d h i fore k 2 d tie 2 2 d h i fore k d tie cos θ i fore k ω in the case that the asvs have a constant configuration fig 10 a the asvs can keep the required distances with the object when the object is following a straight path when turning actions are needed such as for collision avoidance deviations arise however the devinations are all within the predetermined tolerance on the contrary when the required configuration is changing according to the towline model the differences between the actual distances and the required distances always exit see fig 10 b the differences between the heading of the asvs and the object are shown in fig 11 mostly the headings of the three asvs stay aligned with the heading of the object with small deviations when the sharp turning is needed e g at time step k 56 s asv 3 have larger differences in heading with the object than the other two asvs this is mainly because the distance between asv 3 and the object is larger than the others the state changes of the object are enlarged when calculating the expected trajectory of asv 3 thus asv 3 needs larger changes in position and headings than asv 1 and asv 2 for configuration keeping fig 12 provides the forces along the towlines to produce the required forces the horizontal distance between the two ends of each towline ranging from 73 m to 77 m and angles between the towlines and the object ranging from 20 to 30 change accordingly see figs 13 and 14 fig 15 shows the number of iterations and computation time needed for the asvs to achieve consensus at each time step if the reference related positions between the asvs and the object are constant fig 15 a mostly agreements are achieved in two iterations within 1 s which is shorter than the sampling time 1 s in simulation and 10 s in full scale the short computation time shows the potential to apply the proposed cooperative framework in reality at time step k the first solution each asv finds is an extension of the solution at time step k 1 that is to say an asv prefers to follow the trajectories that it sends to other controllers this property can also be used to deal with the communication delays packet loss or connection failure a controller i can assume that an asv j follows the predicted trajectories it broadcast at time step k until the controller i receives an update on the state of asv j however if the nonlinear towline model is integrated into the framework the computation time increased dramatically see fig 15 b the computation time does not have the same trend with the number of iterations any more the most time consuming part is to solve the nonlinear control allocation problem some methods may help to meet the real time requirement under this circumstance such as adopting a sampling time that is larger than the computation time or using a more suitable optimization algorithm or a computer with stronger calculation capability the time step k 124 s is one of the steps in which most iterations are needed to obtain agreements when the asvs have a time varying configuration fig 16 shows how the primal and dual residuals evolve over iterations at this time step the primal residual records the differences between the expected trajectory and the predicted trajectory i e η i s z i s 2 the dual residual records the differences between the expected trajectory at iteration s and the expected trajectory at iteration s 1 i e z i s z i s 1 2 through iterative negotiations both primal and dual residuals decrease and finally meet the stopping criteria the linear and angular velocities of the object and asvs are given in fig 17 surge and sway velocities of the asvs and the object are the same when they are on the straight path however when the object takes turning actions to keep the formation the asvs at different positions have to accelerate or decelerate accordingly fig 18 and fig 19 show the forces and moment each asv provide the solid red lines are the forces and moment including the forces to move the objects and the forces and moment an asv need to keep formation the blue dot lines the limitations on maximum and minimum forces and moments are all met the results indicate that asv 3 is the main source which provides the surge force for the object while asv 1 and 2 provide the moment when turning actions are needed 5 conclusions and future research this paper focuses on cooperative floating object transport i e a group of asvs coordinate their actions to transport floating objects we propose a formation based cooperative object transport system with a multi layer control structure the cooperative transport problem is divided into three sub problems trajectory tracking of the object control allocation and formation tracking of the asvs mpc controllers with a successively linearized prediction model are designed for distributed control of asvs and the object a negotiation framework based on admm is employed to achieve consensus among the asvs the errors introduced by the successively linearized model with numerical simulations a simulation involving moving a large vessel sailing inbound the port of rotterdam is carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative framework the results show that the proposed cooperative system can transport the floating object along a predefined trajectory and avoid potential static and dynamic obstacles ultimately this leads to methods that can also become useful for moving large vessels barges and off shore platforms in future ports where both human operated and autonomous vessels exist further research will consider the following directions firstly although the predictive property of mpc benefits the control of the asvs under disturbances more efforts are needed to analyze the influences of external disturbances methods that take the influences into consideration such as robust mpc and stochastic mpc could be developed in future research secondly formal recursive feasibility and stability analysis for the proposed method can be investigated besides the numerical approach considered here thirdly in this paper as well as in much existing research for asvs the effectiveness of the methods are assessed through simulations physical simulations can be carried out to make steps towards real world application acknowledgment this research is supported by the china scholarship council under grant 201406950041 appendix a linearization errors the successively linearized model introduced in section 3 2 1 is based on taylor s theorem therefore the accuracy of the approximation is influenced by the differences between the seed state and reference state that the controllers want to follow we carry out an analysis on the errors that are brought by linearization the linearization error is defined hereby as the difference between the position p l calculated with the linearized model 8 and the position p n l calculated with the non linear model 3 in the simulations we use the cybership 2 model to represent the dynamics of the asv the motion of the asv is controlled by the proposed mpc controller related parameters are given in table 2 two scenarios are considered to analyze the accuracy of the approximation of the successively linearized model scenario 1 impacts of initial seed state the asv follows the different paths with the same successively linearized model with the same seed state at the first time step the reference paths are shown in fig a20 a the angle between the seed trajectory and the reference path increases from 0 to 180 with an interval of 10 scenario 2 impacts of turning angles the reference path that the asv needs to follow has a turning angle increasing from 0 to 180 at an interval of 10 as shown in fig a20 b fig a20 reference paths in the simulations the thick red line is the seed trajectory for linearization in the first time step fig a20 results of scenario 1 are presented in fig a21 in this case the maximum linearization error arises in the first time step the maximum linearization errors in the situation that the asv follows different reference paths are presented in fig a21 a the maximum error increases when the angle between the seed path and the reference path increases however the successive linearization method can make use of the most up to date information and adapt the linear model according to the control input determined in the first time step in this way the deviations between the seed path and reference path become smaller thus the linearization error reduces dramatically in the second time step see fig a21 b fig a21 simulation results for scenario 1 fig a21 fig a22 simulation results for scenario 2 fig a22 simulation results for scenario 2 are presented in fig a22 fig a22 a shows an increasing tendency the maximum error with the turning angle large linearization errors arise when the asv take turning actions see fig a22 b the main reason is that the differences between the seed state and reference state become larger at the moment when the controllers decide to take turning actions nevertheless the errors are small during the simulations to conclude the accuracy of the successively linearized model is influenced by two factors the differences between the seed state and the reference state and the smoothness of the reference path owing to the property of making use of the latest state of the system the successively linearized model can make adjustments quickly this property provides the linearized model the required accuracy for the motion control

22416,compared to an individual autonomous surface vessel asv greater efficiency and operational capability can be realized by a team of cooperative asvs for certain operations such as search and rescue hydrographic survey and navigation assistance this paper focuses on cooperative floating object transport i e a group of asvs coordinate their actions to transport floating objects we propose a multi layer distributed control structure for the object transport system the object transport problem is formulated as the combination of several sub problems trajectory tracking of the object

towline a controller based on model predictive control mpc is designed to control the motion of each asv a negotiation framework based on the alternating direction of multipliers method admm is then proposed to achieve consensus among the asvs numerical simulations of utilizing the proposed cooperative system to move a large vessel sailing inbound the port of rotterdam are carried out to show the effectiveness of our method besides transporting barges and off shore platforms the proposed cooperative object transport system could also be a solution to coordinate non autonomous vessels and asvs in future autonomous ports where both human operated and autonomous vessels exist keywords cooperative multi vessel systems cooperative floating object transport distributed model predictive control formation control asv 1 introduction the autonomous surface vessel asv is an innovation to improve the safety and efficiency of waterborne transport and has become a hot topic in recent years liu et al 2016 schiaretti et al 2017 seeing the advantages of multi agent systems especially efficiency gains and fault tolerance cooperative control of multiple asvs has gained increasing attention chen et al 2018 lu et al 2018a huang et al 2019 li et al 2019 compared to an individual asv greater efficiency and operational capability can be realized by groups of asvs operating in a coordinated fashion potential applications of cooperative multi vessel systems cmvss include transportation in urban areas large object transport navigation assistance surveillance search and rescue etc this paper focuses on cooperative floating object transport i e a group of asvs coordinate their actions to transport floating objects cooperative object transport in multi robot systems has been studied for decades many coordination strategies have been proposed a comprehensive summary of recent advancements in multi robot systems for cooperative object transport is provided in tuci et al 2018 compared with land based robots asvs have different dynamics and control constraints when controlling the motion of land based robots sideway speed and coriolis force are not considered ota 2006 while those are important factors that need to be taken into account when control vessels fossen 2011 therefore adjustments are needed when applying the methods for land based robots to control multiple asvs the number of research on cooperative object transport in the field of waterborne transport is relatively small a related topic is the manipulation of large vessels with multiple tugboats in braganza et al 2007 esposito et al 2008 bidikli et al 2016 control strategies that enable a barge to track a reference trajectory or orientation using a swarm of autonomous tugboats are discussed in those papers the tugboats are attached to the barge and apply forces at some fixed incident angles the tugboats appear in essence as independent azimuth thrusters in feemster et al 2006 the initial positions of the tugboats are arbitrary nonetheless once contact is established the location of the tugboats are time invariant moreover only rotational motion is considered the tugs are normal to the surface of the vessel to provide torque to rotate the vessel from current orientation to the desired orientation in those papers the attitude of the tugboats is not considered the heading of tugboats usually differs sharply from the path direction which is inefficient while moving the object along the path besides collision avoidance is not considered in those papers if physical connections between the object and asvs and the attitude of the asvs are considered such as connecting the object and the asvs using ropes the maintaining of the geometric configuration during movement is required i e formation tracking formation tracking aims at controlling the vessels to maintain a prescribed configuration and to follow predefined trajectories in oh et al 2015 and liu and bucknall 2018 detailed surveys on formation control of multi agent systems are presented in the field of maritime transport formation tracking has attracted increasing interests such as thorvaldsen and skjetne 2011 liu et al 2017 lu et al 2018b however collision avoidance is usually not taken into account or only considered the conflicts among the formation mates moreover conventional methods such as leader follower and virtual structure usually either consider obstacles before the formation is formed or use shape variation and regeneration for collision avoidance during trajectory tracking however when the asvs are connected to the object changing the formation shapes to avoid obstacles is impossible this paper focuses on the control problem of cooperative floating object transport i e utilizing a team of asvs to transport a larger floating object such as a large vessel barge or offshore platform the object and the asvs are connected with towlines and the asvs maintain the formation when moving the object we propose a multi layer distributed control structure for the object transport system with the designed scheme the original cooperative transport problem is considered as the combination of several sub problems trajectory tracking of the object control allocation and formation tracking of the asvs controllers are designed using model predictive control mpc to control the motion of the asvs and the object then an optimization based allocation method is designed to ensure the forces that are needed to move the object are produced jointly by the asvs a nonlinear towline model is employed for the transformation of forces between the asvs and the object considering the mass and the elasticity of the towline a negotiation framework based on the alternating direction of multipliers method admm is employed to achieve consensus among the asvs the contribution of this study is listed as follows firstly from the perspective of concept this paper proposes a formation based method for transporting floating objects the asvs do not need frequent large attitude changes which benefits smoother and faster object transport secondly from the perspective of control algorithm design the object transport problem is solved in a distributed fashion the supervisory coordinator takes the feedback of the asv controllers into account agreements are achieved through negotiations thirdly from the perspective of communication requirements the information that the controllers exchange consist of their predicted states thus the proposed framework is suitable for negotiation among heterogeneous vessels moreover in the proposed method asvs are connected to the object with towlines the dynamics of the object and the towlines are taken into consideration as well the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the cooperative object transport system being studied the dynamic model of an asv and a model of towline are introduced subsequently the control strategy for object transport is proposed in section 3 we design a multi layer cooperative control scheme and an admm based dmpc framework is proposed to reach consensus on the following actions to be taken among the controllers in section 4 the scenarios in which the proposed cooperative system move a large vessel sailing inbound the port of rotterdam are simulated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method main findings and future research directions are provided in section 5 2 system model in this section the model of a formation based cooperative object transport system is constructed the dynamic model of an asv and a model of towline are introduced 2 1 dynamic model of an asv cooperative object transport requires the coordination and synchronization of pushing pulling forces by a group of asvs in order to transport objects in this paper we use a triangular configuration as an example to illustrate the proposed framework the method can also be used for other configurations the geometric configuration of the asvs is shown in fig 1 asv 1 and 2 are located symmetrically on the starboard side and the portside of the object the line between the object and asv 3 is perpendicular to the line between asv 1 and 2 with this configuration the surge and sway forces to move the object are provided by the three asvs while the moment to change the heading of the object is provided by asv 1 and 2 thus the problem of object transport becomes the problem of coordinating the three asvs to provide forces for moving the object following a reference path while keeping formation to calculate the forces and moment that are needed to move the object the object is treated as a virtual vessel the dynamics of the asvs and the virtual vessel are described with the 3 dof model proposed in fossen 2011 1 η i t r ψ i t ν i t 2 m i ν i t c i ν i t ν i t d i ν i t τ i t where r ψ i is a rotation matrix r ψ i t cos ψ i t sin ψ i t 0 sin ψ i t cos ψ

including rigid body and added mass matrices c i is the coriolis centripetal matrix including rigid body and added mass coriolis centripetal matrices d i is the damping force in this paper we consider a linear damping force with x i t η i t t ν i t t t and τ i t the system state and input respectively the dynamic model 1 2 can be expressed as 3 x i t f i x i t τ i t 0 3 3 r i ψ i t 0 3 3 m i 1 c i

towlines and asvs are in mechanical equilibrium the forces provided by each asv are applied to the towlines and the forces are transferred along the towlines to the object in this paper we focus on the horizontal plane denote the forces along the towlines on the horizontal plane as f k f 1 fore k f 1 aft k f 2 fore k f 2 aft k f 3 stern k t the relation between the forces that are needed to move the object τ k and f is 5 τ k γ k f k where τ τ u τ v τ r t and γ k is the transformation matrix γ k cos θ 1 fore k cos θ 1 aft k cos θ 2 fore k cos θ 2 aft k 1 sin θ 1 fore k sin θ 1 aft k sin θ 2 fore k sin θ 2 aft k 0 l tie sin θ 1 fore k ω l tie sin θ 1 aft k ω l tie sin θ 2 fore k ω l tie sin θ 2 aft k ω 0 where θ i fore k and θ i aft k are the angles between the towlines and central line of the object whose subscript and superscript indicate different towlines see fig 1 ω is the angle of the segment between two ties and the center of mass of the object l tie is the distance from the center of mass of the object to the segment between the ties we assume that the towlines have a uniform density due to gravity the towline will be shaped as a curve in fig 2 we use the towline that connects the fore tie at the object and asv i as an example t 1 fore is the tension in the horizontal direction t 1 fore is the tension on the towline g r and l r are the gravity and the length of the towline d h 1 fore is the horizontal distance between the two ends of the towline different models have been proposed to calculate the tension on the towline such as in fitriadhy and yasukawa 2011 tao et al 2019 zhou in this paper a catenary model is applied considering the mass and the elasticity of the towline tao et al 2019 zhou 6 t 1 fore k d h 1 fore k 2 t 1 fore k ϖ sinh 1 ϖ l r 2 t 1 fore k e a l r where ϖ is the density of the towline e is the so called young s modulus of the towline a is the cross sectional area of the towline at the same time because asv 1 is connected to the object with two towlines the distances between the asv and its connected ties should also meet the law of cosines i e 7 cos θ 1 fore k d h 1 fore k 2 d tie 2 d h 2 aft k 2 2 d h 1 fore k d tie 3 dmpc for cooperative object transport mpc has been popular in practical applications since its early days mayne 2014 for waterborne transport mpc methods also have many advantages especially when considering the predictive property of mpc methods chen et al 2018 moreover mpc considers the latest available measurement of the system s state and up to date information regarding disturbances which provides the mpc methods the capability to a certain extent to be robust against disturbances besides dmpc distributed model predictive control has many advantages for the control of large scale networked systems negenborn and maestre 2014 therefore we consider dmpc as a suitable approach to carry out the task of object transport in this section we propose a dmpc approach for cooperative object transport we firstly introduce a multi layer control structure for the object transport system then we linearize the above mentioned dynamic model to form the prediction model of the mpc controllers for the asvs and the virtual vessel after designing the controller for the object an optimization based control allocation method is presented to determine the forces that each asv should provide in the end an iterative negotiation framework is provided for the cooperation of the controllers 3 1 control structure fig 3 illustrates the multi layer structure for the control of the object transport system a coordinator at the higher level is responsible for two tasks one is to determine the virtual forces to control the motion of the object τ the other is to compute the forces f i u and f i v that asv i should provide which ensures that the commanded virtual control τ is produced jointly by the asvs then asv controller i determines its own control τ i according to its own state x i while providing the rewired forces the actions that the asvs take decide the final state of the object i e x the function of the coordinator can be fulfilled either by one of the asv controllers or an additional controller on the object or one of the asvs or on the shore 3 2 mpc controller design 3 2 1 linear prediction model the basic concept of mpc is to use a dynamic model to forecast system behavior and then optimizing the forecast to produce the best decision rawlings and mayne 2015 therefore at each time step a prediction is needed in this paper the successively linearized model presented in zheng et al 2014 2016 is adopted as the prediction model for the following reasons the dynamics described in 3 are highly nonlinear in this paper an mpc framework is used for the control of asvs if this nonlinear model is directly used for prediction in the mpc controller the mpc online predictions and optimizations would be too time consuming in zheng et al 2014 a comparison on the trajectory tracking performance and computation time of asv controller using non linear mpc and liner mpc shows that non linear mpc has a much higher computational complexity especially under larger prediction horizons than linear mpc moreover in our method agreements among the controllers are achieved through iterative negotiations a small increase in the computation time at each iteration may make the total time too long for real world application different from conventional linearization method the successively linearized method approximate the dynamics based on the seed state calculated in each time step over the prediction horizon the actual state usually does not change much from the seed state therefore it can provide a good approximation to the nonlinear dynamics of asvs we have carried out an analysis of the linearization errors in appendix a which shows that the linearized model can provide adequate accuracy for the control of asvs in this paper we adopt a dynamic model of marine surface vehicles with three dofs surge sway and yaw proposed in fossen 2011 this model has been widely used for the motion control of asvs various models have been proposed to describe the dynamics of vessels such as holonomic models kinematic models and dynamic models huang et al 2020 van gelder however no models can predict the dynamics of the vessels operating in real life environments without any error as the dynamics are influenced by many factors such as the shape of the hull and dimensions even for a vessel its dynamics can be varying with different loads depth of the waterways and so on schlichting 1934 liu et al 2015 the aim of this research is not to construct the most accurate dynamic model but to develop a method that can work under the situation that the actual states of an asv differ from the states that a mathematical model describes in the proposed mpc framework the controller calculates at each time step a sequence of control inputs for the whole prediction horizon after which the control input for the first control sample will be implemented thus at each time step the controller will take corrective actions if the actual state differs from the predicted state at each time step as a start point the control sequence computed in last time step is shifted one sample with an additional of zeros at the end using this extended control sequence as seed input τ e k we can obtain the seed state x e k with 3 by applying taylor s theorem we can obtain the approximation state of the asv at k 1 x i k 1 k with following discrete linearized model 8 x i k 1 k x i e k 1 k a i d k k x i k k x i e k k b i d k k τ i k k τ i e k k where a i d k k f i x i x i e k k τ i e k k b i d k k f i τ i x i e k k τ i e k k are the jacobian matrices 3 2 2 reference trajectory generation to calculate the forces and moment that are needed to make the object following a predetermined path the object is regarded as a virtual vessel in the cooperative system whose dynamics can be described using 3 one of the tasks of the coordinator is to control the motion of this virtual vessel to track a predetermined path the reference path is usually generated by discretizing segments between the waypoints with the double integrator dynamics and a constant speed v ˆ i e p i k 1 p i k v ˆ p i k is the reference position at k see the orange dots in fig 4 a in the task of object transport the asvs keep formation while navigating the reference state that each asv should track includes reference trajectory and heading i e w i k p i k t ψ i k t the initial reference trajectory can be calculated according to the geometric relations shown in fig 1 and the reference heading of the asvs is equal to the required heading of the object denoted as 9 w i k g i w k however if we connect the waypoints directly there might be abrupt changes in the trajectories of the asvs see fig 4 a thus we smooth the connection between two segments with kinematic interpolation long 2016 after discretizing the segments with the double integrator dynamics a connection between a start state in the segment w p i 1 w p i and an end state in the segment w p i w p i 1 is made with a changing velocity the acceleration during this period k is formulated as a linear function of time in order to describe object acceleration as smooth motion i e a t b m t the position and velocity can be expressed as 10 p t p 0 0 t v t d t 11 v t v 0 0 t b m t d t where v t is the corresponding velocity accordingly given the start position and velocity p k v k and the end position and velocity p k k v k k we can obtain a smooth connection between two segments without any abrupt changes in speed or direction see fig 4 b the smoothed reference trajectory between origin and destination is represented by a sequence of positions the trajectory of each asv can be calculated by 9 accordingly at each time step each asv controller and coordinator finds the reference position which is closest to its current position and use the subsequent positions over the predictive horizon as the reference trajectory 3 2 3 control problem the virtual control effort that is required to control the object to track the reference trajectory are determined by solving the primal optimization problem 12 minimize j τ k l 1 h p α η k l k w k l 2 2 γ τ k l 1 k 2 2 subject to i v l h p 13 x k k x k 14 ν min ν k

linear programming problem when the collision avoidance constraint 16 is rewritten with binary variables details can be found in chen et al 2018 3 3 control allocation the virtual control effort that needed to move the object τ k is provided by the 3 asvs through the towlines there is actuator redundancy when considering the whole system i e the cooperative object transport system is an over actuated system here we use an optimization based allocation method to compute a control input that ensures that the commanded virtual control τ k is produced jointly by the asvs we formulate the control allocation objective function as minimize the forces along the towlines considering the total forces that the asvs can provide while producing required forces thus solving the control allocation problem involves solving following nonlinear optimization problem 19 minimize l 1 h p f k l k f ˆ 2 2 subject to i v l h p 20 τ k l k γ k l k f k l k 21 0 f k l k f max 22 θ min θ i fore

ˆ is the forces that transferred by the towlines when τ 0 while the asvs are keeping a preferred configuration γ is the transformation matrix between τ and f f max is the maximum forces on the towline subsequently the forces each asv should provide can be decomposed into two components in surge and sway directions f i u f i v in its own body fixed frame fig 5 illustrate the decomposition using asv

path direction therefore the differences between the heading of the object and the asvs are small i e δ ψ i k 0 k and small angle approximation can be used to simplify 25 for each asv it should not only follow its own reference trajectory to keep the required related distance with the object but also provide required forces to move the object accordingly the control problem that the asv controller i needs to solve is 26 minimize j i τ i k l 1 h p α η i k l k w i k l 2 2 γ τ i k l 1 k 2 2 subject to i j v i j l h p 27 ν i min ν i k l k ν i max 28 τ i k l k f i tow k l k τ i min 29 τ i

of the object according to desired configuration and the towline model 6 for example for asv 1 after calculating d h 1 aft k the distance between the tie and the center of mass of the asv 1 according to the tension on the towline the position of asv 1 can be calculated as 34 p 1 k d h 1 aft k cos θ 1 fore k sin θ 1 fore k 0 l 1 asv d tie 2 0 where d tie is the length between two ties that are connected to asv 1 in constraints 30 and 31 we set a tolerance for formation keeping for the following reasons firstly the asvs and the object are connected with ropes the asvs are possible to have small fluctuations around the desired positions secondly in the optimization we use a linearized model to predict the dynamics of the asvs and the object the actual states inevitably differ from the predictions the tolerance can help to avoid the situation that the optimization problem at the first iteration is infeasible at each time step thirdly the tolerance relaxes the need for formation keep which can help to avoid frequent control changes and is beneficial for fast convergence to the agreements 3 4 cooperative framework 3 4 1 combined overall control problem the ideal situation is that the asvs follow the reference state and provide the required force that the coordinator informs them however the asvs may fail to follow the reference paths when providing the required forces due to actuator saturation or other physical limitations as we mentioned in section 2 the positions of the asvs determine the final position of the object this means that when the asvs cannot achieve the desired state the object cannot achieve its desired state either thus the forces needed to move the object also change and so are the forces each asv needs to provide therefore the asv controllers and the coordinator needs to negotiate with each other to reach an agreement the agreements among the asvs are achieved when the expected trajectory of the object calculated based on the asvs and the predicted trajectory that the coordinator calculated become consensus therefore the combined overall control problem for the object transport system can be formulated as 35 minimize i 1 3 j i τ i k j τ k subject to i v 36 η i k h i η k 37 η k h i 1 η i k where 36 indicates that the predicted trajectory of asv i equals the expected trajectory calculated according to the predicted trajectory of the object and their geometric relation and vice versa 37 indicates the predicted trajectory of the object equals the expected trajectory of the object calculated according to the predicted trajectory of asv i h i indicate the geometric relation between the object and the asvs considering the desired formation and the towline model described by 6 and 7 3 4 2 admm based multi layer negotiation framework admm has been widely used for consensus problems with separable objective functions boyd et al 2011 admm scheme takes the form of a decomposition coordination procedure in which the solution is found through iterations of solving some sub problems the agreements among the asvs and the coordinator are achieved in the a iterative way see algorithm 1 image 4 except for step 2 every step is carried out independently in parallel for each asv i the controllers use the information about the interconnecting variables from the most recent iteration 4 numerical simulations in this section numerical simulations of the scenarios in which the proposed cooperative system move a large vessel sailing inbound the port of rotterdam are carried out to show the potential of the proposed approach both static and dynamic obstacles are considered in the simulation we compare the results of two settings one is constant configuration ignoring the dynamics of towlines the other is time varying configuration considering the nonlinear towline model simulations are carried out with matlab 2016a the linear optimization problems of the controllers are solved by ilog cplex optimization studio version 12 6 3 and the nonlinear optimization problems are solved by ipopt wächter and biegler 2006 with the solution that is found in the former iteration as a starting point the simulations are run on a pc with a dual core 3 2 ghz intel r core tm i5 3470u cpu and 8 gb of ram 4 1 set up the scenario we consider involves three asvs that transport a floating object e g a non autonomous large vessel from the north sea to a terminal in the port of rotterdam as shown in fig 6 the asvs have to transport the object following the path indicated by waypoints an obstacle e g a disabled vessel at anchor is located on the reference path in the port so called waterborne agvs are employed for inter terminal transport zheng 2016 the waterborne agv automated guided vehicles is set as sailing with a constant speed 0 35 m s with higher priority than the proposed object transport system the reference path of the object to be moved has overlap with the waterborne agv path as indicated in fig 6 when encountering with the waterborne agv the proposed cooperative asvs should give way the coordinates of the waypoints obstacle and waterborne agv path are provided in table 1 two cases are considered in the simulation constant configuration in this case the towlines are regarded as straight lines ignoring the mass the related distances between asvs and the object are predetermined as 1 255 2 m for asv 1 2 and 1 255 m for asv 3 time varying configuration in this case the related distances between the asv 1 2 and the object are determined by the towline model 6 and 7 and the relative positions between the asv 3 and the object is 1 255 m for the asvs the parameters of the model are scaled up according to the froude scaling law with a scaling factor χ 1 100 according to the scaling law the multiplication factors for length force moment and time are χ χ 3 χ 4 and χ respectively for the object the scale factor is 1 200 when calculating related data related parameters in the simulation are given in table 2 the simulation results underneath are shown with χ 1 100 4 2 results and discussion in the two cases the trajectories of the asvs and the object are similar the trajectories of the asvs and the object in case 1 are shown in fig 7 the snapshots show how the asvs avoid collision with the static obstacles and the waterborne agv while maintaining the required formation safety is further confirmed by fig 8 for both the object and the asvs their distances with the static obstacle and the waterborne agv are larger than the corresponding safety distances fig 9 shows the path following performance of the proposed cooperative system in both cases mostly the asvs can move the object along the reference path deviations occur when the object and the asvs have to depart from the path to avoid obstacles fig 10 provides the distance between the asvs and the object in the two cases in the figure l i asv k is the required distance when the towline model is considered l i asv k 2 d h i fore k 2 d tie 2 2 d h i fore k d tie cos θ i fore k ω in the case that the asvs have a constant configuration fig 10 a the asvs can keep the required distances with the object when the object is following a straight path when turning actions are needed such as for collision avoidance deviations arise however the devinations are all within the predetermined tolerance on the contrary when the required configuration is changing according to the towline model the differences between the actual distances and the required distances always exit see fig 10 b the differences between the heading of the asvs and the object are shown in fig 11 mostly the headings of the three asvs stay aligned with the heading of the object with small deviations when the sharp turning is needed e g at time step k 56 s asv 3 have larger differences in heading with the object than the other two asvs this is mainly because the distance between asv 3 and the object is larger than the others the state changes of the object are enlarged when calculating the expected trajectory of asv 3 thus asv 3 needs larger changes in position and headings than asv 1 and asv 2 for configuration keeping fig 12 provides the forces along the towlines to produce the required forces the horizontal distance between the two ends of each towline ranging from 73 m to 77 m and angles between the towlines and the object ranging from 20 to 30 change accordingly see figs 13 and 14 fig 15 shows the number of iterations and computation time needed for the asvs to achieve consensus at each time step if the reference related positions between the asvs and the object are constant fig 15 a mostly agreements are achieved in two iterations within 1 s which is shorter than the sampling time 1 s in simulation and 10 s in full scale the short computation time shows the potential to apply the proposed cooperative framework in reality at time step k the first solution each asv finds is an extension of the solution at time step k 1 that is to say an asv prefers to follow the trajectories that it sends to other controllers this property can also be used to deal with the communication delays packet loss or connection failure a controller i can assume that an asv j follows the predicted trajectories it broadcast at time step k until the controller i receives an update on the state of asv j however if the nonlinear towline model is integrated into the framework the computation time increased dramatically see fig 15 b the computation time does not have the same trend with the number of iterations any more the most time consuming part is to solve the nonlinear control allocation problem some methods may help to meet the real time requirement under this circumstance such as adopting a sampling time that is larger than the computation time or using a more suitable optimization algorithm or a computer with stronger calculation capability the time step k 124 s is one of the steps in which most iterations are needed to obtain agreements when the asvs have a time varying configuration fig 16 shows how the primal and dual residuals evolve over iterations at this time step the primal residual records the differences between the expected trajectory and the predicted trajectory i e η i s z i s 2 the dual residual records the differences between the expected trajectory at iteration s and the expected trajectory at iteration s 1 i e z i s z i s 1 2 through iterative negotiations both primal and dual residuals decrease and finally meet the stopping criteria the linear and angular velocities of the object and asvs are given in fig 17 surge and sway velocities of the asvs and the object are the same when they are on the straight path however when the object takes turning actions to keep the formation the asvs at different positions have to accelerate or decelerate accordingly fig 18 and fig 19 show the forces and moment each asv provide the solid red lines are the forces and moment including the forces to move the objects and the forces and moment an asv need to keep formation the blue dot lines the limitations on maximum and minimum forces and moments are all met the results indicate that asv 3 is the main source which provides the surge force for the object while asv 1 and 2 provide the moment when turning actions are needed 5 conclusions and future research this paper focuses on cooperative floating object transport i e a group of asvs coordinate their actions to transport floating objects we propose a formation based cooperative object transport system with a multi layer control structure the cooperative transport problem is divided into three sub problems trajectory tracking of the object control allocation and formation tracking of the asvs mpc controllers with a successively linearized prediction model are designed for distributed control of asvs and the object a negotiation framework based on admm is employed to achieve consensus among the asvs the errors introduced by the successively linearized model with numerical simulations a simulation involving moving a large vessel sailing inbound the port of rotterdam is carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative framework the results show that the proposed cooperative system can transport the floating object along a predefined trajectory and avoid potential static and dynamic obstacles ultimately this leads to methods that can also become useful for moving large vessels barges and off shore platforms in future ports where both human operated and autonomous vessels exist further research will consider the following directions firstly although the predictive property of mpc benefits the control of the asvs under disturbances more efforts are needed to analyze the influences of external disturbances methods that take the influences into consideration such as robust mpc and stochastic mpc could be developed in future research secondly formal recursive feasibility and stability analysis for the proposed method can be investigated besides the numerical approach considered here thirdly in this paper as well as in much existing research for asvs the effectiveness of the methods are assessed through simulations physical simulations can be carried out to make steps towards real world application acknowledgment this research is supported by the china scholarship council under grant 201406950041 appendix a linearization errors the successively linearized model introduced in section 3 2 1 is based on taylor s theorem therefore the accuracy of the approximation is influenced by the differences between the seed state and reference state that the controllers want to follow we carry out an analysis on the errors that are brought by linearization the linearization error is defined hereby as the difference between the position p l calculated with the linearized model 8 and the position p n l calculated with the non linear model 3 in the simulations we use the cybership 2 model to represent the dynamics of the asv the motion of the asv is controlled by the proposed mpc controller related parameters are given in table 2 two scenarios are considered to analyze the accuracy of the approximation of the successively linearized model scenario 1 impacts of initial seed state the asv follows the different paths with the same successively linearized model with the same seed state at the first time step the reference paths are shown in fig a20 a the angle between the seed trajectory and the reference path increases from 0 to 180 with an interval of 10 scenario 2 impacts of turning angles the reference path that the asv needs to follow has a turning angle increasing from 0 to 180 at an interval of 10 as shown in fig a20 b fig a20 reference paths in the simulations the thick red line is the seed trajectory for linearization in the first time step fig a20 results of scenario 1 are presented in fig a21 in this case the maximum linearization error arises in the first time step the maximum linearization errors in the situation that the asv follows different reference paths are presented in fig a21 a the maximum error increases when the angle between the seed path and the reference path increases however the successive linearization method can make use of the most up to date information and adapt the linear model according to the control input determined in the first time step in this way the deviations between the seed path and reference path become smaller thus the linearization error reduces dramatically in the second time step see fig a21 b fig a21 simulation results for scenario 1 fig a21 fig a22 simulation results for scenario 2 fig a22 simulation results for scenario 2 are presented in fig a22 fig a22 a shows an increasing tendency the maximum error with the turning angle large linearization errors arise when the asv take turning actions see fig a22 b the main reason is that the differences between the seed state and reference state become larger at the moment when the controllers decide to take turning actions nevertheless the errors are small during the simulations to conclude the accuracy of the successively linearized model is influenced by two factors the differences between the seed state and the reference state and the smoothness of the reference path owing to the property of making use of the latest state of the system the successively linearized model can make adjustments quickly this property provides the linearized model the required accuracy for the motion control

22417,in this paper a novel swarm control strategy based path following guidance is addressed for multiple underactuated surface vehicles usvs with complex unknowns including uncertain dynamics and time varying disturbances by employing swarm center position scp guidance together with neural network approximators the distributed robust controller is developed for each vehicle to follow the desired path and guarantees that path following errors converge to a small neighborhood of origin an improved artificial potential field apf is further responsible for collision avoidance which makes vehicles bypass obstacles smoothly the superiority of the proposed swarm control strategy is that the distributed controller and flexible formation enable usvs to follow the target and avoid collisions autonomously simulation results are proposed to illustrate the universal applicability and effectiveness of the proposed strategy keywords underactuated surface vehicle swarm control collision avoidance swarm center position guidance artificial potential field 1 introduction the research for multi vehicle control systems has attracted extensive attention in the marine engineering applications xiao et al 2016 such as ocean search and rescue mapping and monitoring das et al 2014 swarm confrontation for military purposes and so on liu 2015 peng et al 2012a compared with the traditional single vehicle wang et al 2017a the swarm system provides the possibility of higher reliability and lower complexity hartbauer and romer 2007 the great challenge for swarm control is how to design a control strategy using utility function such collective behaviors can emerge previous works with respect to the collective behaviors can be classified into two categories formation control and collision avoidance three dominant approaches qi and cai 2018 have been universally employed with respect to formation control including leader follower cui et al 2010 belleter and pettersen 2015 virtual structure mehrjerdi et al 2011 kanjanawanishkul 2014 and behavior based chen et al 2016 lee and chwa 2018 approaches unfortunately these formation control techniques are only available for systems where each agent vehicle must maintain a pre designed relative position or formation rout and subudhi 2016 park 2015 moreover there exists an obvious master slave structure among vehicles and lacks self organized coordinated motion loria et al 2016 mehrjerdi et al 2010 wang et al 2017b thereby resulting in great difficulties in formation control with collision avoidance based on the leader follower formation control the leader using the biological inspired neural network model estimates distance and take measures and the formation transforms to come through the obstacle area ding et al 2014 considering a two dimensional environment for the groups of agents the velocity constraints can be added to the collision avoidance restrictions in prodan et al 2010 moreover a networked system consisting of multiple dynamic leaders is considered in peng et al 2015 and distributed out feedback containment controllers are devised based on a neural velocity observer liu et al 2016 address the coordinated path following along one curve forcing the vehicles to follow the same parameterized path between two virtual leaders however the formation structure using leader follower approach is usually fixed once the leader is invalid vehicles will lose their original formation performance due to collision avoidance liu and bucknall 2015 wang et al 2019 and self organized coordinated motion the artificial potential field apf is highly desired to keep safe distance from neighbor vehicles and obstacles ji et al 2017 in the early stage researchers have made much effort on collision avoidance using apf palacios et al 2015 liu and chopra 2013 an attractive potential which force vehicles to the desired trajectory and a set of repulsion potentials away from obstacles were proposed in oland and kristiansen 2013 for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles sun et al 2017 considered the vehicles as dynamic obstacles to realize trajectory planning and proposes a distance factor and jump strategy based traditional apf algorithm to solve the problem for unreachable targets qin et al 2017 built an improved potential field around the vehicle and obstacles and then added a damping technology in collision avoidance to prevent being rebounded however it should be highlighted that previous formation approaches suffer from the vehicle quantitative restriction and apf scheme is easy to cause vehicles oscillation during obstacle avoidance as a consequence it is an imperative to design a distributed swarm strategy and propose an obstacle avoidance scheme for multi vehicle system in this paper we design a novel swarm control strategy consisting of the path following scheme the collision avoidance scheme and the controllers for multiple underactuated usvs under complex unknowns collision avoidance and progress towards the desired path are provided by the improved artificial potential field and the scp guidance law respectively while terms for safe distance will be added to the utility function the scp guidance law and repulsion function are rapidly switched such the vehicle gives priority to avoid collisions rather than get to the target when the vehicles are outside this security area once again the scp guidance is set back to normal the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows i a novel swarm control strategy is first proposed based single vehicle path following and light of sight guidance ii a modified ring shaped repulsion is designed to avoid collisions thereby rendering vehicles bypass obstacles smoothly iii the problems for uncertain dynamics and time varying disturbances can be solved using neural network this paper is organized as follows in section 2 preliminaries and problem formulation are defined the path following scheme the collision avoidance scheme and the controllers are given in section 3 stability analysis of the closed loop system is addressed in section 4 finally two examples for underactuated usvs are carried out in section 5 and conclusion is stated in section 6 2 preliminaries and problem formulation 2 1 notation r n denotes the n dimensional euclidean space represents the euclidean norm t and are the transpose and pseudo inverse of the matrix respectively vectors are bold and i m is a m dimensional identity matrix 2 2 swarm control in this research each usv is assumed to know its own states and obtain the environment information from neighbors or obstacles different from traditional formation control fixed formation is not required in the swarm control whose system is flexible and has the ability to make decisions similar to the migratory flying flocking system has a distinct center position and member dispersion the swarm system function can be described as 1 x s f s η and x s j s η v where f s η x y σ t r 3 1 j s η r 3 2 n is the jacobian matrix oland and kristiansen 2013 and n is the number of swarm system v r 2 n 1 is the swarm velocity x i 1 n x i n and y i 1 n y i n denote the swarm central position σ i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 n is the distance standard deviation between x i y i and x y lemma 1 the swarm system is bounded if the swarm central location x y and standard deviation σ is defined then each usv will eventually gather in the central neighborhood for a limited time liu 2015 2 3 neural network a neural network scheme is employed to approximate the unknown dynamic and time varying disturbances peng et al 2012a 2012b yuan et al 2016 this scheme takes the form w t σ z z ω where ω is a sufficiently large domain w is an unknown time varying matrix satisfying w w with w being positive constant σ z is a known continuous basis function in this paper we use the sigmoid basis function of the form 1 1 exp z with six neural network nodes according to the approximation property given a continuous unknown function f z there exist an ideal weight vector w and any small positive constant c 0 satisfying w t σ z f z c 0 2 4 problem formulation consider a multi vehicle system that consists of n usvs the ith usv kinematics and dynamics equations can be found in fossen 2002 with 2 x i u i cos ψ i v i sin ψ i y i u i sin ψ i v i cos ψ i ψ i r i and 3 u

usv position and ψ i is the heading angle in the geodetic coordinate system u i v i and r i denote the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw angular velocity in the kinetic coordinate system respectively m 11 m 22 m 33 are usv inertial masses and d u d u u d v d v v d r d r r are hydrodynamic damping in the corresponding freedom the control inputs of the ith vehicle are the surge force τ u i and the yaw moment τ r i τ w u i τ w v i τ w r i denote the time varying disturbances 3 swarm control strategy the swarm control objective is stated as follows given a group of swarm vehicles described by 1 and 3 with uncertain dynamics and time varying disturbances we develop a control architecture that enables all vehicles can follow the desired path the utility function should be employed and responsible for the behavior of the controlled vehicle the desired behavior is ranked as follows with avoiding collisions being the most important i avoid collisions ii keep safe distance from neighbor vehicles and obstacles iii follow the desired path therefore the swarm control framework can be illustrated in fig 1 each part of this structure is independent which can be modified and improved with no effect to the total strategy the path following scheme the collision avoidance scheme and the controllers are addressed in this section 3 1 path following scheme design based on the single vehicle path following control liang et al 2017 2018 the swarm path following scheme is designed using swarm center position scp to replace the original single coordinate which converts the swarm into the center position to follow the desired path consequently an attractive guidance method for the swarm path following scheme is the scp guidance where the swarm center heading is computed from the current position to the desired path a geometrical illustration of the scp guidance has been shown in fig 2 consider a geometric path η d x d θ y d θ t as the desired path where θ is an independent variable the path tangential angle is defined as ψ d θ and an along following error x e and a cross following error y e are defined as follows 4 x e y e cos ψ d sin ψ d sin ψ d cos ψ d t x x d θ y y d θ time derivative of 4 along 2 is 5 x e u 1 cos ψ ψ d ψ d y e u p y e u 1 sin ψ ψ d ψ d x e where u 1 u 2 v 2 0 represents the spc velocity similar to the light of sight guidance law the ideal scp velocity u p can be considered as a virtual input choose u p as 6 u p θ x d 2 θ y d 2 θ furthermore the desired scp heading is denoted ψ r where ψ r is a suitable guidance law for straight or curve path the scp guidance law is given by 7 ψ r ψ d θ arctan y e l 0 θ u 1 cos ψ ψ d δ x e x d 2 θ y d 2 θ where l 0 0 denotes the look ahead distance δ 0 is a design parameter using the guidance law 6 and 7 the swarm center can follow the desired path then the swarm path following can be controlled by the desired σ d the actual and desired swarm position function can be described as 8 x s x y σ t and x d x d y d σ d t the corresponding error can be expressed by 9 x e x s x d x x d y y d σ σ d t consider the following lyapunov function 10 v 1 1 2 x e t k 1 x e where k 1 d i a g k 11 k 22 k 33 taking the time derivate of 4 and using 3 yield 11 v 1 x e t k 1 j s η v x d to make the swarm errors converge asymptotically we select 12 v d v 1 d t v 2 d t v n d t t j s k 1 x e x d where v i d η i d x i d y i d t is the desired velocity for the ith usv j s denotes the pseudo inverse of j s which is employed by j s j s t j s j s t 1 and satisfy j s j s i 3 3 2 collision avoidance scheme design based on the proposed control framework the collision avoidance algorithm presented in oland and kristiansen 2013 for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles can be employed for usvs noted that this algorithm is completely independent of the scp guidance presented in the previous section and it could be replaced by other algorithm to implement collision avoidance 3 2 1 inter vehicle collision avoidance the collision avoidance scheme that most rapidly and effectively fits into the optimal swarm control is the artificial potential fields apf in this paper it is assumed that all obstacles can be modeled as circle shaped objects kowalczyk et al 2011 the potential field is consisted of an avoidance function repulsion function that repels the usv when it nears other vehicles or obstacles which keeps safe distance from neighbor vehicles and obstacles the repulsion field for the ith vehicle to avoid colliding others can be given by 13 p a r i 1 2 α 1 x i j 1 d 0 2 if x i j d 0 0 otherwise calculating the negative gradient for 12 the corresponding repulsion function is 14 p a r i α x i j 2 1 x i j 1 d 0 x i j η i if x i j d 0 0 otherwise where d 0 0 is the avoidance distance between vehicles and α 0 is the repulsion gain the repulsion potential does not affect the vehicle motion when it is sufficiently far away from each other thus the repulsion field for swarm system is given by p a r i 1 n p a r i which can be obtain using 12 under the repulsion function the usv will keep safe distance x i j d 0 from neighbor vehicles 3 2 2 avoidance of obstacles in addition to avoiding inter vehicle collision with uncertain dynamics and disturbances avoidance of obstacles is an integral part of this swarm control system as obstacles can cause damage to both vehicles and environment nascimento et al 2014 if there exists obstacle such as reef or floating material among the desired path the group of swarm vehicles must change their path to avoid obstacles and keep safe distance from obstacles based on the traditional apf a modified repulsion field has the linear annulus behavior as shown in fig 3 each usv can bypass obstacles smoothly with safe distance instead of bouncing off by defining the distance between usvs and obstacles the collision avoidance is given by 15 p a o j 1 x o j 1 d 0 α x o j 2 x o j η j if x o j d 1 0 else if x o j d 0 β d 0 x o j d 0 otherwise where η j x o j y o j t is the jth obstacle and β 0 is the repulse gain d 0 0 is the avoidance distance to the obstacle and d 1 represents the distance of the annulus repulse satisfying 0 d 1 d 0 thus the potential field p a o j 1 m p a o j is found as the sum of the obstacles according to the inter vehicle collision avoidance and obstacle avoidance the total potential fields can be obtain as p k 1 i 1 m p a o i k 2 i 1 n p a r i where k 1 k 2 are positive scaling factors thereby collision avoidance and progress towards the desired path are provided by the potential field and scp guidance respectively while terms for safe distance will be added to the path following scheme the modified desired velocity can be rewritten as 16 v d x e t k 1 j s k 3 ρ η t t j s x d k 3 ρ η j s t k 1 x e j s x d where k 3 is a positive constant 3 3 controller design 3 3 1 scp error control the scp error 5 can be rewritten as follows 17 e λ u ζ where e x e y e t λ cos ψ ψ d sin ψ ψ d and u u 1

reformulated by 21 e t e λ e t e 0 0 t λ u ζ e λ e s d s yields 22 lim t e t λ e 1 λ u ζ max it can be clearly seen that λ u ζ max is finite and e t will converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin moreover the neighborhood can be small enough with respect to large constant λ e 3 3 2 heading control since the controller design procedures are the same for each usv in this subsection we just design heading and surge controller for the ith usv to ensure the desired behavior the desired surge and heading for the ith vehicle are given by 23 u i d x i d 2 y i d 2 and ψ i d atan 2 y i d x

22417,in this paper a novel swarm control strategy based path following guidance is addressed for multiple underactuated surface vehicles usvs with complex unknowns including uncertain dynamics and time varying disturbances by employing swarm center position scp guidance together with neural network approximators the distributed robust controller is developed for each vehicle to follow the desired path and guarantees that path following errors converge to a small neighborhood of origin an improved artificial potential field apf is further responsible for collision avoidance which makes vehicles bypass obstacles smoothly the superiority of the proposed swarm control strategy is that the distributed controller and flexible formation enable usvs to follow the target and avoid collisions autonomously simulation results are proposed to illustrate the universal applicability and effectiveness of the proposed strategy keywords underactuated surface vehicle swarm control collision avoidance swarm center position guidance artificial potential field 1 introduction the research for multi vehicle control systems has attracted extensive attention in the marine engineering applications xiao et al 2016 such as ocean search and rescue mapping and monitoring das et al 2014 swarm confrontation for military purposes and so on liu 2015 peng et al 2012a compared with the traditional single vehicle wang et al 2017a the swarm system provides the possibility of higher reliability and lower complexity hartbauer and romer 2007 the great challenge for swarm control is how to design a control strategy using utility function such collective behaviors can emerge previous works with respect to the collective behaviors can be classified into two categories formation control and collision avoidance three dominant approaches qi and cai 2018 have been universally employed with respect to formation control including leader follower cui et al 2010 belleter and pettersen 2015 virtual structure mehrjerdi et al 2011 kanjanawanishkul 2014 and behavior based chen et al 2016 lee and chwa 2018 approaches unfortunately these formation control techniques are only available for systems where each agent vehicle must maintain a pre designed relative position or formation rout and subudhi 2016 park 2015 moreover there exists an obvious master slave structure among vehicles and lacks self organized coordinated motion loria et al 2016 mehrjerdi et al 2010 wang et al 2017b thereby resulting in great difficulties in formation control with collision avoidance based on the leader follower formation control the leader using the biological inspired neural network model estimates distance and take measures and the formation transforms to come through the obstacle area ding et al 2014 considering a two dimensional environment for the groups of agents the velocity constraints can be added to the collision avoidance restrictions in prodan et al 2010 moreover a networked system consisting of multiple dynamic leaders is considered in peng et al 2015 and distributed out feedback containment controllers are devised based on a neural velocity observer liu et al 2016 address the coordinated path following along one curve forcing the vehicles to follow the same parameterized path between two virtual leaders however the formation structure using leader follower approach is usually fixed once the leader is invalid vehicles will lose their original formation performance due to collision avoidance liu and bucknall 2015 wang et al 2019 and self organized coordinated motion the artificial potential field apf is highly desired to keep safe distance from neighbor vehicles and obstacles ji et al 2017 in the early stage researchers have made much effort on collision avoidance using apf palacios et al 2015 liu and chopra 2013 an attractive potential which force vehicles to the desired trajectory and a set of repulsion potentials away from obstacles were proposed in oland and kristiansen 2013 for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles sun et al 2017 considered the vehicles as dynamic obstacles to realize trajectory planning and proposes a distance factor and jump strategy based traditional apf algorithm to solve the problem for unreachable targets qin et al 2017 built an improved potential field around the vehicle and obstacles and then added a damping technology in collision avoidance to prevent being rebounded however it should be highlighted that previous formation approaches suffer from the vehicle quantitative restriction and apf scheme is easy to cause vehicles oscillation during obstacle avoidance as a consequence it is an imperative to design a distributed swarm strategy and propose an obstacle avoidance scheme for multi vehicle system in this paper we design a novel swarm control strategy consisting of the path following scheme the collision avoidance scheme and the controllers for multiple underactuated usvs under complex unknowns collision avoidance and progress towards the desired path are provided by the improved artificial potential field and the scp guidance law respectively while terms for safe distance will be added to the utility function the scp guidance law and repulsion function are rapidly switched such the vehicle gives priority to avoid collisions rather than get to the target when the vehicles are outside this security area once again the scp guidance is set back to normal the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows i a novel swarm control strategy is first proposed based single vehicle path following and light of sight guidance ii a modified ring shaped repulsion is designed to avoid collisions thereby rendering vehicles bypass obstacles smoothly iii the problems for uncertain dynamics and time varying disturbances can be solved using neural network this paper is organized as follows in section 2 preliminaries and problem formulation are defined the path following scheme the collision avoidance scheme and the controllers are given in section 3 stability analysis of the closed loop system is addressed in section 4 finally two examples for underactuated usvs are carried out in section 5 and conclusion is stated in section 6 2 preliminaries and problem formulation 2 1 notation r n denotes the n dimensional euclidean space represents the euclidean norm t and are the transpose and pseudo inverse of the matrix respectively vectors are bold and i m is a m dimensional identity matrix 2 2 swarm control in this research each usv is assumed to know its own states and obtain the environment information from neighbors or obstacles different from traditional formation control fixed formation is not required in the swarm control whose system is flexible and has the ability to make decisions similar to the migratory flying flocking system has a distinct center position and member dispersion the swarm system function can be described as 1 x s f s η and x s j s η v where f s η x y σ t r 3 1 j s η r 3 2 n is the jacobian matrix oland and kristiansen 2013 and n is the number of swarm system v r 2 n 1 is the swarm velocity x i 1 n x i n and y i 1 n y i n denote the swarm central position σ i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 n is the distance standard deviation between x i y i and x y lemma 1 the swarm system is bounded if the swarm central location x y and standard deviation σ is defined then each usv will eventually gather in the central neighborhood for a limited time liu 2015 2 3 neural network a neural network scheme is employed to approximate the unknown dynamic and time varying disturbances peng et al 2012a 2012b yuan et al 2016 this scheme takes the form w t σ z z ω where ω is a sufficiently large domain w is an unknown time varying matrix satisfying w w with w being positive constant σ z is a known continuous basis function in this paper we use the sigmoid basis function of the form 1 1 exp z with six neural network nodes according to the approximation property given a continuous unknown function f z there exist an ideal weight vector w and any small positive constant c 0 satisfying w t σ z f z c 0 2 4 problem formulation consider a multi vehicle system that consists of n usvs the ith usv kinematics and dynamics equations can be found in fossen 2002 with 2 x i u i cos ψ i v i sin ψ i y i u i sin ψ i v i cos ψ i ψ i r i and 3 u i 1 m 11 m 22 v i r i d u d u u u i u i τ u i τ w u i v i 1 m 22 m 11 u i r i d v d v v v i v i τ w v i r i 1 m 33 m 11 m 22 u i v i d r d r r r i r i τ r i τ w r i where x i y i t r 2 represents the usv position and ψ i is the heading angle in the geodetic coordinate system u i v i and r i denote the surge velocity sway velocity and yaw angular velocity in the kinetic coordinate system respectively m 11 m 22 m 33 are usv inertial masses and d u d u u d v d v v d r d r r are hydrodynamic damping in the corresponding freedom the control inputs of the ith vehicle are the surge force τ u i and the yaw moment τ r i τ w u i τ w v i τ w r i denote the time varying disturbances 3 swarm control strategy the swarm control objective is stated as follows given a group of swarm vehicles described by 1 and 3 with uncertain dynamics and time varying disturbances we develop a control architecture that enables all vehicles can follow the desired path the utility function should be employed and responsible for the behavior of the controlled vehicle the desired behavior is ranked as follows with avoiding collisions being the most important i avoid collisions ii keep safe distance from neighbor vehicles and obstacles iii follow the desired path therefore the swarm control framework can be illustrated in fig 1 each part of this structure is independent which can be modified and improved with no effect to the total strategy the path following scheme the collision avoidance scheme and the controllers are addressed in this section 3 1 path following scheme design based on the single vehicle path following control liang et al 2017 2018 the swarm path following scheme is designed using swarm center position scp to replace the original single coordinate which converts the swarm into the center position to follow the desired path consequently an attractive guidance method for the swarm path following scheme is the scp guidance where the swarm center heading is computed from the current position to the desired path a geometrical illustration of the scp guidance has been shown in fig 2 consider a geometric path η d x d θ y d θ t as the desired path where θ is an independent variable the path tangential angle is defined as ψ d θ and an along following error x e and a cross following error y e are defined as follows 4 x e y e cos ψ d sin ψ d sin ψ d cos ψ d t x x d θ y y d θ time derivative of 4 along 2 is 5 x e u 1 cos ψ ψ d ψ d y e u p y e u 1 sin ψ ψ d ψ d x e where u 1 u 2 v 2 0 represents the spc velocity similar to the light of sight guidance law the ideal scp velocity u p can be considered as a virtual input choose u p as 6 u p θ x d 2 θ y d 2 θ furthermore the desired scp heading is denoted ψ r where ψ r is a suitable guidance law for straight or curve path the scp guidance law is given by 7 ψ r ψ d θ arctan y e l 0 θ u 1 cos ψ ψ d δ x e x d 2 θ y d 2 θ where l 0 0 denotes the look ahead distance δ 0 is a design parameter using the guidance law 6 and 7 the swarm center can follow the desired path then the swarm path following can be controlled by the desired σ d the actual and desired swarm position function can be described as 8 x s x y σ t and x d x d y d σ d t the corresponding error can be expressed by 9 x e x s x d x x d y y d σ σ d t consider the following lyapunov function 10 v 1 1 2 x e t k 1 x e where k 1 d i a g k 11 k 22 k 33 taking the time derivate of 4 and using 3 yield 11 v 1 x e t k 1 j s η v x d to make the swarm errors converge asymptotically we select 12 v d v 1 d t v 2 d t v n d t t j s k 1 x e x d where v i d η i d x i d y i d t is the desired velocity for the ith usv j s denotes the pseudo inverse of j s which is employed by j s j s t j s j s t 1 and satisfy j s j s i 3 3 2 collision avoidance scheme design based on the proposed control framework the collision avoidance algorithm presented in oland and kristiansen 2013 for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles can be employed for usvs noted that this algorithm is completely independent of the scp guidance presented in the previous section and it could be replaced by other algorithm to implement collision avoidance 3 2 1 inter vehicle collision avoidance the collision avoidance scheme that most rapidly and effectively fits into the optimal swarm control is the artificial potential fields apf in this paper it is assumed that all obstacles can be modeled as circle shaped objects kowalczyk et al 2011 the potential field is consisted of an avoidance function repulsion function that repels the usv when it nears other vehicles or obstacles which keeps safe distance from neighbor vehicles and obstacles the repulsion field for the ith vehicle to avoid colliding others can be given by 13 p a r i 1 2 α 1 x i j 1 d 0 2 if x i j d 0 0 otherwise calculating the negative gradient for 12 the corresponding repulsion function is 14 p a r i α x i j 2 1 x i j 1 d 0 x i j η i if x i j d 0 0 otherwise where d 0 0 is the avoidance distance between vehicles and α 0 is the repulsion gain the repulsion potential does not affect the vehicle motion when it is sufficiently far away from each other thus the repulsion field for swarm system is given by p a r i 1 n p a r i which can be obtain using 12 under the repulsion function the usv will keep safe distance x i j d 0 from neighbor vehicles 3 2 2 avoidance of obstacles in addition to avoiding inter vehicle collision with uncertain dynamics and disturbances avoidance of obstacles is an integral part of this swarm control system as obstacles can cause damage to both vehicles and environment nascimento et al 2014 if there exists obstacle such as reef or floating material among the desired path the group of swarm vehicles must change their path to avoid obstacles and keep safe distance from obstacles based on the traditional apf a modified repulsion field has the linear annulus behavior as shown in fig 3 each usv can bypass obstacles smoothly with safe distance instead of bouncing off by defining the distance between usvs and obstacles the collision avoidance is given by 15 p a o j 1 x o j 1 d 0 α x o j 2 x o j η j if x o j d 1 0 else if x o j d 0 β d 0 x o j d 0 otherwise where η j x o j y o j t is the jth obstacle and β 0 is the repulse gain d 0 0 is the avoidance distance to the obstacle and d 1 represents the distance of the annulus repulse satisfying 0 d 1 d 0 thus the potential field p a o j 1 m p a o j is found as the sum of the obstacles according to the inter vehicle collision avoidance and obstacle avoidance the total potential fields can be obtain as p k 1 i 1 m p a o i k 2 i 1 n p a r i where k 1 k 2 are positive scaling factors thereby collision avoidance and progress towards the desired path are provided by the potential field and scp guidance respectively while terms for safe distance will be added to the path following scheme the modified desired velocity can be rewritten as 16 v d x e t k 1 j s k 3 ρ η t t j s x d k 3 ρ η j s t k 1 x e j s x d where k 3 is a positive constant 3 3 controller design 3 3 1 scp error control the scp error 5 can be rewritten as follows 17 e λ u ζ where e x e y e t λ cos ψ ψ d sin ψ ψ d and u u 1 u 1 t ζ ζ 1 ζ 2 t is defined as follows 18 ζ 1 y e ψ d u p ζ 2 x e ψ d among that e estimated by the following error signal observer 19 e ˆ λ ˆ u ζ ˆ λ e e λ ˆ λ λ λ λ ˆ ζ ˆ λ ζ ζ ζ ˆ where λ e 0 λ ˆ d i a g λ ˆ 1 λ ˆ 2 e ˆ is the estimate of the scp error λ λ λ ζ are positive constants using 17 and 19 the scp errors are obtained as follows 20 e λ u ζ λ e e where λ λ λ ˆ ζ ζ ζ ˆ e can be reformulated by 21 e t e λ e t e 0 0 t λ u ζ e λ e s d s yields 22 lim t e t λ e 1 λ u ζ max it can be clearly seen that λ u ζ max is finite and e t will converge to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin moreover the neighborhood can be small enough with respect to large constant λ e 3 3 2 heading control since the controller design procedures are the same for each usv in this subsection we just design heading and surge controller for the ith usv to ensure the desired behavior the desired surge and heading for the ith vehicle are given by 23 u i d x i d 2 y i d 2 and ψ i d atan 2 y i d x

employed to handle the unknown dynamic and time varying disturbances 27 k ˆ i r w ˆ i r t σ ζ r where ζ r u i v i r i ψ i d ψ i d τ i w r t w ˆ i r is adaptive weight parameter and its estimate can be computed by 28 w ˆ i r η i r s i 1 σ ζ r where η i r is a positive constant and the estimate error is defined as w i r t w i r t w ˆ i r t there exist an ideal weight vector w i r and any small positive constant c r satisfying w i r t σ ζ r k i r c r 3 3 3 surge control consider the surge dynamics in 3 the surge control law τ i u is designed as follows 29 τ i u m ˆ 22 v i r i d ˆ u d ˆ u u u

22418,this work discussed the transient characteristic of pjp and gave a comparative analysis between steady and transient simulations the simulations employed reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse method with a focus on the transient flow field and tip clearance effect the mutual interference between rotor and stator does not lead to a massive difference in pjp whole open water performance it causes remarkable changes in stator and duct and the increasing of tip clearance enhances the changes the exciting force on blades can not be ignored and represents a different variation between rotor and stator with the effects of advance ratio or tip clearance and possesses a characteristics frequency corresponded to blade passing frequency bpf and their harmonics the exciting force intensity mainly embodies in bpf the stator mainly has better recycling on rotor blade wake and the recycling mainly acts on circumference velocity comparing with axial velocity which shares almost the whole energy in pjp wake both the circumference velocity and radial velocity include a little tip sweeping vortex and tip leakage vortex are the typical vortices in pjp tip leakage vortex plays a vital role in the stator flow field and pjp wake keywords pumpjet propulsor transient analysis tip clearance hydrodynamics vortex 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auv are today of great strategic importance for many countries propulsors play a significant role in underwater propulsion system which guarantees the auv stably navigating for many underwater carriers the universal propulsors mainly contain the conventional propeller contracted rotating propeller ducted propeller between them the contracted rotating propeller can provide more thrust and perform better torque balance but it is easy to occur cavitation later with the development of auv to large scale and high speed the propulsor with massive thrust under high cruise speed is needed the pumpjet propulsor pjp is a multi component propulsor whose advantages over other propulsion systems are heavy load with high efficiency and lower hydro acoustics it can satisfy the need and catches more eyes of researchers on it the research of pjp mainly contains experimental research and computational fluid dynamics cfd research mccormick et al mccormick and eisenhuth 1963 discussed the pjp design and studied the pjp efficiency and cavitation performance with an experimental approach then stephen ivanell ivanell investigated the hydrodynamic performance of pjp behind a torpedo by numerical methods and experimental methods in a wind tunnel in the numerical simulation the ranse solver was employed in conjunction with the k ε turbulence model discretized in the high quality structure mesh yongxiang dong et al 2012 numerically investigated the pjp hydrodynamics performance and compared the thrust with experimental data in the simulation multiple reference frames mrf was used to realize the rotor revolution the pjp effect on the underwater vehicle body was also analyzed ch suryanarayana et al 2010a 2010b 2010c carried out series experiments of pjp behind the vehicle in wind tunnel and cavitation tunnel the investigation shows that the pjp has an excellent balance performance and high efficiency with the heavy load and performs a better cavitation performance pan guang and coworkers shi et al 2015 lu et al 2016a pan et al 2016 numerically studied the pjp open water performance and cavitation they considered the rotor revolution speed and cavitation number effects on cavitation performance and discussed the velocity field and pressure field mehran et al motallebi nejad et al 2017 employed a ranse solver with sst k ω turbulence model in predicting pjp performance the numerical results predicted by a periodic computational domain get better consistency with experiments wang chao et al wang et al 2019 had done a comparison study of pjp between a pre swirl ducted propeller and rear stator pjp by using panel method with proposing a tip leakage model and compared the tip leakage model with traditional method in predicting the hydrodynamics of both propulsors moreover a discussion of the tip clearance effect on stator with potential flow theory was carried out for the duct style propulsor the tip clearance existed between the rotor tip and duct inner surface has a distinct effect on hydrodynamics performance the tip clearance plays important roles not only in the underwater propulsor but also in the pumps and turbine machine the tip clearance research can conduct the researcher to find a proper way or get an inspiration to satisfy the demands of high efficiency and noise level hsiao and chahine 2008 studied the interaction between the cavitation inception and the leakage and trailing tip vortices ding yongle et al 2015 presented an investigation of tip clearance effect on a ducted propeller the study shows that the tip clearance mainly affects the tip region and has slightly effect on the pressure distribution at low spanwise of the blade larger tip clearance will generate more turbulence kinematic energy jie gong et al 2018 and qin zhang et al zhang and jaiman 2019 focused on the wake vortex evolution and its effects on the ducted propeller both the authors discussed the wake vortex forming from the tip leakage vortices which shed from the trailing edge of the duct and the wake vortex evolution mechanics moreover jie gong did a further discussion of the duct shear layer effects on wake vortices evolution donghyun you et al 2004 investigated the tip clearance flow by using a large eddy simulation les combined with an immersed boundary method for the tip clearance effect on tip vortices it also has been discussed in some literature which is about the pumps research wu et al 2011 miorini et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 shen et al 2018 these studies mainly discussed the tip leakage vortex and did series experimental research pan guang lu lin and coworkers lu et al 2016b 2018 studied the hydrodynamics and cavitation performance of two pjp models with the duct of the decelerated and accelerated respectively a discussion of tip vortices by visualizing them with streamlines and pressure was represented they also investigated the tip clearance effect on pjp cavitation performance pan guang and coworkers qin

characteristic and flow field between steady and transient tip vortices of pjp and the tip clearance effects finally section 5 gives the conclusions 2 theoretical background 2 1 governing equations the viscous flow field is numerically simulated by the integration of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for the incompressible and single phase homogeneous flow without the body force the time averaged continuity equation and momentum conservation equation ferziger and perić 2012 can be written as follows 1 ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i τ i j x j ρ u i u j x j where x i x j i j 1 2 3 represent the cartesian coordinate components u i u j are the time averaged values of velocity components ρ is the fluid density p is the time averaged pressure u i u j are the fluctuation velocity τ i j is the viscous tensor ρ u i u j denotes the reynolds stress 2 2 turbulence model in equation 2 the presence of reynolds stress means that the equation contains more variables than there are equations the closure requires the additional equations of some approximations called the turbulence model to solve the reynolds stress term there are two categories of the reynolds stress model and the eddy viscosity model for the eddy viscosity model a parameter μ t called turbulent viscosity or eddy viscosity is used to describe the relationship between reynolds stress term and time averaged variables that is based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis proposed by boussinesq one of the eddy viscosity models that called the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter 1993 was used in this work for solving the additional transport equations the sst k ω turbulence model has been widely applied in predicting the hydrodynamics and cavitation of ducted propeller and pjp lu et al 2016a 2016b 2018 pan et al 2016 motallebi nejad et al 2017 yongle et al 2015 qin et al 2018 both the authors in yongle et al 2015 and qin et al 2018 represented a comparative analysis of the turbulence model effect on predicting the ducted propeller hydrodynamics which showed that the sst k ω turbulence model got more accurate results than the k ε launder and spalding 1974 turbulence model series moreover desheng zhang and coworkers zhang et al 2015 implemented a study of turbulence model impacts on an axial flow pump whose results showed that the sst k ω turbulence model obtained smaller prediction error than the standard k ω wilcox 1988 turbulence model the sst k ω turbulence model is a two equation model developed from the k ε and the standard k ω turbulence model due to the overprediction of the eddy viscosity both the basic models do not account for the transport of the turbulent shear stress and fail to properly predict the onset and amount of flow separation from smooth surfaces then menter 1993 1994 summarized and proposed the sst k ω model that overcomes the shortcomings the complete formulation of the sst k ω model is given with the k equation from the standard k ω model and the ω equation modified by blend functions 3 ρ k t ρ u i k x i x i μ σ k μ t k x i p k ρ β k ω 4 ρ ω t ρ u i ω x i x i μ σ ω μ t ω x i ρ α s 2 β ω 2 2 ρ 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k x i ω x i where p k is the production limiter defined from the production term p k f 1 is the blending functions 5 p k m i n p k 10 β ρ k ω in order to combine the advantages of the standard k ω and k ε model and overcome the shortcomings the formulation of the eddy viscosity is modified in the high reynolds number by a limiter that defined as 6 μ t ρ k ω 1 m a x 1 s f 2 a 1 ω where s is the strain rate and f 2 is the blending function the constant variables for two standard models are a 1 0 31 β 0 09 β 1 3 40 β 2 0 0828 α 1 5 9 α 2 0 44 σ k 1 0 85 σ k 2 1 σ ω 1 0 5 σ ω 2 0 856 and all constant variables are blended from the corresponding ones of the k ε and k ω model by expression φ φ 1 f 1 φ 2 1 f 1 in this study both steady and unsteady simulations were performed with cfx solver in cloud computing platform ccp http www easycae cn en to numerically investigate the open water performance and transient flow field characteristics of a pjp because of the motion the general grid interface ggi algorithm was applied the multiple frames of reference mfr based on the ggi technology allows the simulation involving domains that are rotating relative to one another for the unsteady simulation the sliding mesh technique was aided which was modeled using the transient rotor stator frame change model and could adequately simulate the interaction between the motion domain and stationary domain the cfx solver is based on the finite volume method fvm that discretizes the governing equations and the turbulence model in the rans simulations the simple algorithm was employed to get the pressure velocity coupling equations the advection and turbulence numerics were discretized by using high resolution scheme both in the steady and unsteady simulations the transient was discretized by using the second order backward euler scheme for every time step it was initialized by the previous one 2 3 verification of numerical approach the ducted propeller with the ka4 70 propeller inside the wageningen 19a duct was employed in verifying the numerical simulation scheme this ducted propeller model was presented by maritime research institute netherland marin oosterveld 1970 it was taken as an approach verification model in the work motallebi nejad et al 2017 in this work when generating this model the main parameters were followed by the literature baltazar et al 2017 it has a propeller diameter of d 0 21 m with a constant pitch ratio of p d 1 0 and a uniform gap of δ r 0 8 between the inner duct surface and the blade tip the geometry mesh and computational domains are shown in fig 1 the advance ratio j propeller thrust coefficient k t p and its torque coefficient k q duct thrust coefficient k t d are defined as 7 j v n d k t p t p ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k t d t d ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k t k t p k t d k q q ρ 2 n 2 d 5 η j 2 π k t k q where the n is the propeller revolution speed and t p t d is the propeller thrust and duct thrust respectively q is the propeller torque the computational domain is a cylinder of diameter 10 d which extends 5 d upstream and 10 d downstream from the ducted propeller location the rans simulation referred to a grid consists of 10 9 million cells split into one cylindrical rotating region around the propeller with 4 96 million cells and one region of the rest of the domain with 5 94 million cells in this simulation the inlet boundary was the velocity inlet whose values were set according to the advance ratio which was simulated for a range between 0 1 and 0 8 while the outlet boundary was a pressure outlet with a constant value of p o u t 0 p a and the far field boundary was set as a free slip wall for the propeller revolution speed it was set as n 10 r s with which the reynolds numbers were from 3 54 10 5 to 3 76 10 5 where the reynolds number was defined at the same place and had the approximate range with baltazar work baltazar et al 2017 based on the maximum reynolds number the first layer height of grid was set as 1 5 10 5 m near the blade wall and 2 10 5 m around the duct surface the heights were calculated by definition given in the ansys cfx solver guide ansys 2016 with a target value of y which was lower than 5 the density and temperature of water liquid were ρ 997 k g m 3 and 25 c after being calculated by the steady rans solver the unsteady simulations were conducted with the time step size δ t 2 7778 10 4 s which represented the propeller blade rotating 1 both the steady and unsteady calculations results compared with the experimental data oosterveld 1970 are given in fig 1 the hydrodynamics coefficients and open water efficiency show good consistency between the numerical and experimental data it gets more accurate results with the transient simulation which simulates the propeller wake more proper and that affects the ducted propeller flow field in summary this simulation illustrates that the numerical simulation scheme used in predicting the open water performance of duct style propulsor is applicable and reliable 3 numerical simulation for pumpjet propulsor 3 1 geometry and numerical modeling the pjp model and the coordinate are shown in fig 2 and some main dimensions of pjp are given in table 1 this pjp model is a post swirl pumpjet propulsor which has eleven rotor blades nine stator blades and equipped with a decelerating duct a uniform gap between the duct inner surface and rotor blade tip in the radial direction is called the tip clearance the tip clearance size of the basic model is δ 0 5 m m and the other three derivative models with the tip clearance sizes 1 m m 2 m m and 3 m m were generated by cutting the rotor blade tip with fixing the duct dimensions those derivative models are different from the literature models lu et al 2016b qin et al 2018 which were derived by fixing the rotor dimension and expanding the duct and stator size moreover an ellipse cap guide with ellipticity 2 1 in front of the hub and a circular cap guide behind the hub were added 3 2 mesh generation a cylindrical domain with diameter 10 d t and length 15 d t was used to model the far field boundary and the pjp model was located 5 d t from the flow inlet in order to generate a structural mesh and control the grid size and node spacing the computational domain was divided into three parts the rotor domain the stator domain and external domain shown in fig 3 the node space distribution especially in the wall boundary layer and tip clearance domain could control appropriately by employing the structured mesh the mesh view is shown in fig 3 both rotor and stator domain meshes were generated by the periodic mesh with the o topology refined near the blade moreover the tip clearance mesh was refined with double layers o topological mesh in the radial direction according to the reynolds number the first layer height of grid was set 4 10 5 m that represented a high y value between 30 and 100 was satisfied for the sst k ω turbulence model demands in high reynolds number in order to consider the mesh size effect on hydrodynamics prediction the mesh dependence was verified by using three groups mesh to predict the pjp hydrodynamics all domains are the same grid topology and refined with grid spacing ratio r 1 3 in axial circumference and radial direction and the tip clearance mesh size was set the same as the fine mesh group size in fig 5 the tip clearance meshes of different clearance size are shown details of mesh distribution for the coarse medium and fine are given in table 2 see fig 4 3 3 boundary condition and simulation set in fig 3 the inlet boundary was set as the velocity inlet with the constant value v 25 72 m s and the turbulent intensity 5 the outlet boundary was the pressure outlet with a constant value of p o u t 0 p a and the far field boundary was set as a free slip wall the rotor revolution speeds n r p m or n r s was varied with the step δ n 200 r p m from n 2000 r p m to n 4000 r p m under which the reynolds number was 3 15 10 6 to 4 91 10 6 calculated with the maximum rotor blade radius for the steady simulation the iteration was 500 steps in every operating condition in the unsteady numerical calculations the timestep size was equivalent to the time needed for 1 rotation of the rotor considering the huge requirement of cpu time in transient simulation three operating points of n 2000 r p m 3000 r p m 4000 r p m for the other three tip clearance sizes were selected for conducting the unsteady calculation 4 results and discussion 4 1 definitions of hydrodynamic coefficient of the pjp in order to show the results and discuss the dimensionless hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp are defined the advance ratio j is defined as the same defined in the approach verification the definitions of the rotor thrust coefficient k t r the rotor torque coefficient k q r the stator thrust coefficient k t s the stator torque coefficient k q s the duct thrust coefficient k t d the pjp thrust coefficient k t the pjp torque coefficient k q the pjp open water efficiency η 0 are as follows 8 k t r t r ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k q r q r ρ 2 n 2 d 5 k t s t s ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k q s q s ρ 2 n 2 d 5 k t d t d ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k t k t r k t s k t d k q k q r η 0 j 2 π k t k q where d is equal to d r t r and d r represent the thrust and torque of rotor t s and d s represent the thrust and torque of stator t d is the duct thrust 4 2 mesh discussion the numerical simulation results of pjp with tip clearance δ 0 5 m m at the operating points j 1 6327 j 2 1650 the design point and j 3 2475 were conducted to evaluate the mesh convergence in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of pjp in a uniform and non cavitating flow the y at the operating points of three groups mesh are represented in table 3 it shows that the y satisfies the turbulence model demand and is appropriate for the high reynolds number flow based on the generalized richardson extrapolation re stern and wilson et al stern et al 2001 2006 proposed a method in verification and validation of cfd simulations which can provide a detailed verification under the monotonic convergence when the results represented an oscillatory convergence it also can estimate the uncertainly but can not give the signs and magnitudes of the errors and additionally requires more than m 3 solutions in order to overcome the limitations of the re method and modify the smooth monotonic convergence requirement celik celik et al roacheet al represented an estimation method which can be applied only requiring convergence the grid convergence ratio r g is defined as 9 r g s 3 s 2 s 2 s 1 where s i i 1 2 3 represents the results of the hydrodynamic coefficient corresponding to the coarse medium and fine grids id number three different conditions are possible for the grid convergence ratio 1 r g 1 divergence 2 1 r g 0 oscillatory convergence 3 0 r g 1 monotonic convergence in this work the meshing is implemented by using the structured method and the grid refinement factor r is defined based on the mesh size as 10 r h c o a r s e h f i n e h 1 n t i 1 n t δ i 1 d where n t is the total number of cells used in the calculation d is the dimension which is equal to 3 in this work the computed results of the mesh convergence verification at three advance ratios are shown in table 4 where the apparent order p the extrapolated value φ e x t 21 the approximate relative error e a 21 the extrapolated relative error φ e x t 21 the fine grid convergence index g c i f i n e 21 are defined according to the literature celik et al roacheet al and the definitions of them are as follows 11 p 1 ln r 21 ln φ 3 φ 2 φ 2 φ 1 q p q p ln r 21 p s r 32 p s s 1 s i g n φ 3 φ 2 φ 2 φ 1 φ e x t 21 r 21 p φ 1 φ 2 r 21 p 1 e a 21 φ 1 φ 2 φ 1 e e x t 21 φ e x t 21 φ 1 φ e x t 21 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r 21 p 1 where φ represents the hydrodynamic coefficient of k t or k q and the subscript is corresponded to the mesh group id due to the mesh distribution in tip clearance kept in the fine grid size the grid refinement factor is not a constant as the same in the mesh generation that represents that the q p is not equal to zero so equation 11 was solved by the fixed point iteration method the initial value was got by assuming that q p was equal to zero and then iterated the equation to get the p value it can be seen that the absolute values of grid convergence ratio r g of thrust coefficient and torque coefficient are below 1 demonstrating the monotonic convergence or oscillatory convergence of grids the convergences are proper for the mesh convergence investigation for all the mesh convergence verification cases the maximum numerical uncertainty of the fine mesh solution for the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient should be 2 05 and 0 59 respectively the uncertainty is not sensitive for the torque coefficient though the advance ratio affects the gci values it does not cause a noticeable change and all the results are acceptable the small value of gci shows that refining the grids does not cause an improvement of the hydrodynamics coefficients especially for the torque coefficient so from the maximum values of uncertainty it may make no sense for further refinement of mesh furthermore at the design point j 2 1650 a slice of the pjp internal flow field and the axial velocity profile distribution of a line located on the slice are represented in fig 6 and fig 7 the higher velocity gradients are in the tip leakage area and near the wall and both the areas are prominently affected by the mesh both the hydrodynamics coefficients and the velocity distribution show that the medium mesh and fine mesh are more close to each other and it can get a better representation of the tip leakage flow field with the fine mesh overall the grid convergence investigation indicates that the fine mesh is suitable for the calculations the open water performance curves were calculated under steady simulation with the fine mesh and it is a basis of the mesh generation of other three tip clearance sizes of pjp in table 2 for the other three tip clearance pjp models the increments of total mesh number were mainly caused by the tip clearance size change the external domain and stator domain was the same mesh as the mesh group of tip clearance size δ 0 5 m m though the mesh did not get a noticeable increment it caused a vast and additional cpu time because of the mesh motion during the transient simulation 4 3 the open water performance in fig 8 both the steady and unsteady open water performance of pjp with the tip clearance size δ 0 5 m m and the comparison of them are illustrated the open water curves have slight changes between the steady and unsteady calculations the differences in the whole performance parameters of pjp are lower than 1 the thrust coefficient of pjp is decreased as the advance ratio increased which has a great variation tendency compared to the torque coefficient and open water efficiency the open water efficiency maintains the values higher than 0 6 in all the calculated advance ratios which is a wide range and it gets the maximum value of η 0 0 700 at j 2 7062 in steady simulation however the maximum value is η 0 0 702 at j 2 4981 with transient results the thrust coefficient gets increments during the transient simulation while the torque coefficient is also increased in most of the advance ratios and has negative increments at low advance ratios the torque coefficient gets little changes in all the advance ratio range comparatively and the thrust is more sensitive when considering the time in the simulation the rotor thrust provides the main thrust of pjp the stator also produces some thrust and the duct mainly generates the drag the duct thrust coefficient is a negative value and decreased as the advance going up the torque of pjp mainly comes from the rotor and stator though the stator generates an inverse torque with almost the same absolute value to balanced the rotor torque the stator thrust is less and only to balance the duct drag at low advance ratios when high advance ratios the duct drag needs to be offset by both the thrust of the rotor and stator in transient the thrust and torque of rotor have slight changes and they are not sensitive with the advance ratio change for the stator and duct due to the rotor wake is simulated more proper they get extremely changes the stator thrust coefficient is increased approximate 3 4 at every advance ratio while the duct drag is also increased the same level apart from the low advance ratios that causes a slight change in pjp thrust coefficient the torque coefficient of the stator is decreased and it has a bigger decrement when the pjp operating in a low advance ratio that means the pjp torque balance is changed fig 9 represents the torque balance of pjp which is extremely important in the underwater vehicle navigation to avoid the rolling the torque balance performance is described by the relative torque difference of rotor torque and stator torque which is calculated with the following definition 12 δ k q k q r k q s k q r 100 it has a significant change of the torque balance in unsteady prediction with the stator torque decreasing in all the advance ratios the stator can not produce enough inverse torque to offset the rotor torque it causes the best balance point to moves to high advance ratio where the stator torque is slightly affected by the rotor wake operated in light load pjp is a typical propulsor with the characteristics of high route speed with heavy load compared to conventional propulsor it can maintain high efficiency in a broad range of advance ratio and supply the vast thrust request with smaller size in fig 10 both the steady and transient thrust coefficients of rotor blades and stator blades at design point j 2 1650 are given though the rotor and stator show the constant output of thrust it has a different phenomenon when analyzing per blade load the thrust coefficient of the blade is calculated by definition 13 k t t b ρ n 2 d 4 where t b is the thrust of the blade in steady the rotor flow field was simulated with giving a rotating speed to the coordinate system it did not simulate the real inflow of stator which caused the blade loads were invariant at one blade location it only changed with the blade relative position transformed in the circumference direction in the unsteady simulation due to the relative operating of rotor and stator and the stator blades number is not equal to the number of rotor blades both the blades of rotor and stator show a periodic fluctuating of thrust in the time domain the thrust coefficient curves of the rotor have nine peaks and nine troughs depended on the number of stator blade while it has eleven peaks and eleven troughs of the thrust coefficient curves of stator depended on the number of the rotor blade for the rotor the curves are more fatter at the peak regions due to the tip clearance flow with a time delay the tip clearance flow distorts the curves of stator blades at j 2 1650 for the rotor blade the fluctuation range is approximately 10 of the blade periodic averaged thrust coefficient whose value is 0 0737 and higher than the averaged value 0 0733 of the maximum and minimum due to the asymmetry of curves upper and lower the periodic averaged value of stator blade curves is 0 0234 which is lower than the averaged value 0 0235 calculated by the maximum and minimum it is mainly caused by the distortion which affects the lower of curves and means that stator blades have more time operating with low thrust the fluctuation range is approximately 16 of the periodic averaged value the tip clearance flow has more impacts on the stator flow field the thrust coefficient curves of rotor blades and stator blades show the fluctuation characteristics and it is worthy to analysis in the frequency domain fig 11 shows the frequency domain curves of thrust coefficients transformed from the time domain through fast fourier transform fft the zero frequency component or called it the direct current dc component is 0 0737 and 0 0234 of thrust coefficients of rotor blades and stator blades respectively and they are almost equal to the periodic averaged values in the frequency domain the first peak is distributed at the blade passing frequency bpf of rotor or stator which is related to the number of the blade and the axial passing frequency apf depended on the rotor revolution speed n at j 2 1650 the apf is f a 50 h z and the bpfs of rotor and stator are f b r 11 f a and f b s 9 f a respectively the main peaks of both the frequency domain curves are located at the bpf and its harmonic for the rotor blade the peak locations at frequency domain are affected by the number of stator blade comparatively the peak locations are impacted by the number of the rotor blade for rotor blade load the amplitude at bpf is 0 0035 which has 4 8 of the dc component and it is 0 7 at 2bpf in the high order of the harmonic the amplitudes are smaller compared with the rotor blade the values at peaks of stator blades are decayed slower it has 6 8 of the dc component and 3 at the 2bpf except for the dc components the amplitudes at peaks share the main parts of thrust coefficients of the blade and it will cause the vibration and periodic fluctuation of the flow field those phenomenons will lead to particular peaks in the noise spectrum the changes in open water performance of pjp shows that the pressure field has its typical characteristic due to the rotor and stator mutual interference the pressure distribution has been discussed in many previous works for instance pan guang and coworkers lu et al 2016b qin et al 2018 gave detailed discussions on the pressure distribution of the rotor blade a comparison of the pressure contours of steady and transient results are shown in fig 12 at j 2 1650 the velocity magnitude contours at different radial places of steady and transient simulations are given in fig 13 in order to compare the legend of pressure contours is divided into twenty layers which has more visible difference of color levels than the difference of pressure distribution among blades from the contours representation it follows a similar pressure distribution however in transient simulations it is distributed more regular than the steady results where is slightly affected by the tip clearance flow and rotor wake except that it has notable difference among blades pressure distribution the pressure changes among blades mainly locate at the middle area near the tip region of the rotor pressure side and the trailing edge that is periodically changed as the rotor blade operating comparatively for the stator blades it mainly locates at the leading edge which is greatly affected by the rotor wake and the middle area and all the tip area of stator suction side which is hugely impacted by the rotor tip clearance flow a locale low pressure center is shown which represents the tip clearance flow core for the duct the outer duct surface does not get visible change it also represented a periodic distribution in circumference moreover due to tip leakage flow the pressure of the inner duct surface shows a lower pressure region located coincidentally with the tip leakage flow trajectory in rotor domain in the unsteady simulation the tip leakage flow flows to downstream and affects the pressure of duct inner surface in stator domain it causes a distinct pressure distribution change on the duct surface and influences the high pressure zone periodically according to the velocity magnitude distribution in the flow field it will cause the stator inflow inappropriate in steady simulation that does not represent the blade load operating characteristic in the transient simulation the rotor wake flows into stator domain periodically and the tip clearance flow affects the stator flow field intermittently that causes the pressure changes periodically and represents a fluctuation of thrust coefficient curves and distortion occurs intermittently though the tip clearance leakage flow has greater velocity magnitude its velocity is restricted by the duct and represents a lower value at the tip region and near the inner duct surface the tip clearance flow mainly affects the tip and its downstream near the duct and its effect is also depended on the tip clearance size close to the hub the stator inflow is only periodically affected by the rotor wake in fig 14 a series contours of axial velocity in the axial direction and the recycling of the circumference velocity and radial velocity components by stator blades are shown the axial velocity accelerates in all the pjp inner passage and it shares the major part of velocity in pjp wake the circumference velocity is generated by the rotor revolution and quickly decelerated in the stator domain the radial velocity shares little part and accelerates in rotor domain and it has a slight change in the stator passage the acceleration of axial velocity mainly come from the stator recycling of circumference velocity compared with the contours of axial velocity and radial velocity in x plane the axial velocity absorbs nearly the whole part from the recycling of circumference velocity in the pjp wake the tip clearance flow regions and hub wake have large velocity gradients of the circumference velocity and radial velocity combined with the contour of velocity magnitude near the tip region and downstream shown in fig 13 the stator has better recycling of rotor wake but the recycling of tip clearance flow is inferior at design point j 2 1650 the time domain curves of pressure and the fft results of six monitor points shown in fig 14 are given in fig 15 the pressure is dealt with the dimensionless method in the following equation 14 k p p ρ n 2 d 2 in the time domain the pressure represents the fluctuation due to the rotor revolution and the fluctuations in p2 and p3 are complex the stator has better recycling in rotor wake and the fluctuation shows a sharp reduction in stator wake the fluctuation of stator wake means that stator recycling is imperfect the rotor revolution has a significant effect on the pjp flow field the fluctuation is mainly caused by the rotor that represents eleven main crests on the curves of all monitor points due to the stator and the tip clearance flow interference with the stator it also shows some little locale crests on curves of p2 and p3 considered the velocity contours and the monitor point locations the fluctuations are mainly affected by the tip clearance flow in the stator wake in the frequency domain due to the tip clearance flow and rotor wake have the same period it represents the same locations at the frequency of all peaks the locations are main at first bpf and its harmonic in p1 the pressure has an intense fluctuation which is mainly affected by the rotor operation so the fluctuation is more regular than the fluctuations of p2 and p3 the amplitudes at peaks in the frequency domain are decayed quickly while in p2 and p3 it has larger amplitudes at the high harmonic frequency and decayed slowly p4 p5 and p6 located at the stator wake their frequency curves decay quickly and the amplitude at bpf is smaller than p2 and p3 the specific energy coefficient of the velocity components of four slices s1 s2 s3 s4 shown in fig 14 is represented in fig 16 the rotor wake and stator wake is complex and it is hard to estimate the energy absorption only by velocity or pressure contours the specific energy coefficient is defined as 15 k e i v i 2 π n d 2 v 2 where the v i represents the velocity components of axial circumference or radial the wake energy is mainly contained in axial velocity and it has a lower value at s4 when the pjp with high efficiency at s1 it shows high values of k e a k e c and k e r it indicates that the rotor has a stronger suction effect when the rotor operates at low advance ratios at s2 and s3 the k e a shows slightly changes with the advance ratio change that means the rotor and stator interference has slight acceleration in axial velocity it also can be seen from the axial velocity contours which do not represent the important difference the k e c shows an obvious difference at high advance ratios it illustrates that the rotor and stator interference has a contribution to the recycling of rotor wake the k e r shows a lower value at s4 than s3 when the rotor at high revolution speed 4 4 the tip clearance size effect on pjp hydrodynamics the tip clearance effects on pjp hydrodynamics and cavitation performance has been investigated in detail by pan guang and coworkers lu et al 2016b qin et al 2018 so only three advance ratios were selected to investigate the transient blade load characteristics and the unsteady flow field primarily the stator domain in fig 17 with the steady simulation results the tip clearance effects on open water performance show similar changes as the literature work the open water efficiency is decreased as the tip clearance size increased and it causes more massive efficiency leak when the pjp at high advance ratios similar to the efficiency the torque coefficient also has more obvious change at high advance ratios in fig 18 the relative changes of the dimensionless hydrodynamics coefficients between the steady simulation and transient simulation are shown it can be seen that it is to follow the similar regular as the tip clearance size δ 0 5 m m it causes little changes in the overall parameters of pjp the maximum values of changes are near 1 and it is affected by the advance ratio and tip clearance size for the η 0 it shows smaller changes with the tip clearance increased while it represents an inverse regular pattern of the k t and k q the advance ratio has a slight effect on η 0 and it has a more massive change at low advance ratios however for the k t and k q the advance ratio has a more significant effect and it shows a more massive difference when high advance ratios like the tip clearance δ 0 5 m m it shows little changes of rotor thrust and torque the k t r and k q r has the same variety as the tip clearance however they show the contrary change regularly when considering the advance ratio like the k t r and k q r the stator has the same variety trend but it has a more significant difference and the stator torque is decreased for the k t d it is a negative value and the increments mean that the drag of duct is increased the duct drag is increased as the tip clearance size increased and it shows profound changes caused by the advance ratio change all of those phenomenons mean that it shows low accuracy when preceding the duct and stator force and torque by steady simulation in the case δ 0 5 m m the blade thrust shows intense fluctuation and it indicates that the exciting force can not be ignored fig 19 shows the curves of rotor blades thrust coefficient in the time domain and frequency domain the time domain curves show the same tendency as described in the case δ 0 5 m m the tip clearance size or advance ratio does not cause profound changes in curves shape the increasing of tip clearance mainly leads to a decrement on the dc component and decreases the fluctuation range the tip clearance shows apparent changes on the crests when pjp at a high advance ratio it has a similar distribution in the frequency domain and the locations of the peaks are mainly judged by the rotor revolution speed and the number of stator blades it has non obvious change rule with the tip clearance change at the high frequency band only at the bpf and 2bpf the amplitudes show a clear tendency of descent as the tip clearance size increased in table 5 the relative value of the amplitudes to the dc components at bpf are given a stronger exciting force is generated at every blade at the high advance ratio it represents that the exciting force of per blade decreases as the tip clearance size going up fig 20 shows the curves of stator blades thrust coefficients in the time domain and frequency domain unlike the rotor blades the time domain curves of stator blade thrust coefficient show distinct changes of curve particulars in an overall view the shape of the curves shows the same crests and troughs as tip clearance change the stator blade is affected by both the rotor wake and the tip clearance flow in the case δ 0 5 m m at j 2 1650 the distortion does not affect the crests and troughs of curves however in an ample tip clearance it causes a massive distortion and even a sub crest at the high advance ratio moreover the distortion place is affected by the rotor revolution speed or it should be illustrated that the place depends on the velocities of the rotor wake and tip clearance flow in the frequency domain the curves also represent the same distribution pattern and the locations of peaks are depended on the bpf of the rotor the amplitudes of peaks decay more slowly and it has higher values of the broadband components at the low advance ratio according to the values given in table 5 it represents a relatively higher level of the exciting force of stator blades at the high advance ratio and the increment of tip clearance will aggravate this phenomenon the blade load characteristics indicate that the tip clearance effects on rotor and stator show a contrary reaction for the rotor massive tip clearance reduces the blade load and weaken the interference from the stator though increasing the tip clearance causes more thrust leak it shows a slight effect on rotor blade exciting for stator the blade loads depended on the inflow from the rotor and it represents complex impacts because the tip clearance flow plays a significant role in the stator inflow and the tip clearance flow effect is decided by the tip clearance size and rotor revolution speed from fig 21 to fig 23 the pressure contours of the tip clearance impacts on the rotor blade surface and stator blade surface and duct inner surface and the revolution speed effects on pjp inner flow field are shown the tip clearance increasing causes a broader low pressure region of the tip clearance flow and stronger effect on the downstream and it leads to a higher locale high pressure area on the middle of rotor blade pressure side near the tip those follow the same regular pattern as the literature work the suction side and pressure side of the rotor blade and stator blade has an inverse distribution of pressure so when the tip clearance flows with low pressure lashes against the leading edge of the stator blade it weakens the values of the high pressure area because the low pressure of tip clearance flow has relatively high level than the low pressure area on stator suction side the tip clearance flow increases the values of the lowest pressure area and reduces the low pressure zone and the effect is directly relevant to tip clearance size when the tip clearance flow passes the stator blade a locale low pressure center is located on the suction side and effects the pressure until it flows away from the trailing edge of the stator blade the locale low pressure center is depended on the tip clearance flow which is enhanced with larger tip clearance size the duct is shrunk and the inner flow has negative radial velocity that causes a radial flow of the tip clearance flow and it shows different effects between the suction side and pressure side of the stator on the pressure side the tip clearance has a little impact on its pressure distribution except for the leading edge on the contrary it shows a stronger radial flow effect and this is strengthened with the tip clearance increasing it almost acts in the middle area of suction side in the radial direction when δ 3 0 m m the increasing of tip clearance will cause lower pressure in the tip clearance flow center however it represents higher pressure on the inner duct surface in the tip region due to a big distance of the tip and duct the tip clearance flow is strengthened sharply and it shows a distinct tip clearance flow trajectory on the inner duct surface when it flows in the stator domain from the pressure on the duct in the stator domain the trajectory is deformed by the stator blade the suction side of the stator increases the tip clearance flow due to its higher axial velocity near the surface than tip clearance flow while the pressure side it has a smaller axial velocity relatively that causes a contrary impact compared with fig 23 when the tip clearance flow passes stator blade the suction enhances the tip clearance flow and leads to a larger low pressure zone than upstream while on the pressure side the tip clearance flow is weakened and has a slight effect on its pressure distribution this phenomenon causes an increment of the stator blade thrust the increasing of rotor revolution speed strengthens the tip clearance flow and the phenomenon with high revolution speed a double locale low pressure zones occur on the suction side of one blade and cause a larger increment of the thrust of this blade the tip clearance flow has a significant effect on the stator flow field when the pjp with big tip clearance it even has stronger periodic fluctuation on pjp wake at the same monitor points shown in fig 14 both the time curves and frequency curves of pressure are given in fig 24 the pressure change shows a stronger relationship with the tip clearance size except for p1 where the increasing of tip clearance causes a lower level of curve fluctuation the pressure time domain curves in other points have a broader fluctuation range in the rotor and stator interference flow field where p2 and p3 are located it represents a prominent positive correlation between the tip clearance and pressure fluctuation in p4 p5 and p6 the recycling of stator can not annihilate the fluctuation from the tip clearance flow that causes pulsation in pjp wake also it has a high fluctuation level when big tip clearance though tip clearance increasing does not lead to a consistent regular of change on the dc component the strength of fluctuation is directly affected and decides the amplitude level at peaks of the frequency domain the amplitudes of the dc component and high frequency components are decreased as it flows to the downstream in the rotor domain however it is enhanced when the flow lashes against the stator leading edge both the dc component and high frequency components are strengthened moreover the enhancement level is decided by the tip clearance flow strength which is directly depended on the tip clearance size the dc component is decreased and the amplitudes at peaks have sharply decayed as the flow to pjp wake the attenuation is decelerated with the tip clearance increasing or it should be described as the tip clearance increasing enhances the amplitude of the high frequency components it means that the flow field has stronger pulsation which is terrible for pjp noise performance fig 25 and fig 26 represent the tip clearance effects on pjp axial velocity and energy distribution the increasing of tip clearance weakens the rotor acceleration on flow and cause a higher velocity level of tip clearance flow this phenomenon enhances the impact of tip clearance flow on stator leading edge and causes a series of results of pressure fluctuation and blade loads changes which are harmful to the blade stress fatigue and noise level higher velocity level of tip clearance flow will cause the wake more nonuniform and accelerate the shrinking of wake in the radial direction the specific energy coefficient shows that the tip clearance has directly effect on rotor acceleration of flow the increasing of tip clearance decreases the energy level of axial velocity and cause a higher level of energy carried by the circumference velocity and radial velocity with larger tip clearance though the stator has better recycling of circumference velocity it almost has no recycling effect on circumference velocity and radial velocity of tip clearance flow both the phenomenons exacerbate the energy leak from the previous analysis it can be concluded that the stator has slightly recycling effect on tip clearance flow it causes energy waste in the pjp wake so the increasing of tip clearance decreases the open water efficiency of pjp 4 5 typical vortices of pjp the pressure and velocity indicate that the tip clearance flow and its wake has a high gradient of velocity and locale low pressure this phenomenon satisfies the vortices requirement of vortex criteria it is generally accepted that the vortices locate at the place where the vorticity is a peak or maximum value the vorticity identification can get proper phenomenon in some situations spalart 1988 but it is inappropriate sometimes such as the boundary wall of laminar flow the vorticity magnitude lacks the galilean invariant because its modular depends on the determination of the coordinate system for the rotating machinery it may lead to an improper visualization hunt et al 1988 proposed the q vortex identification which is described by the strain rate tensor s i j and vorticity tensor ω i j then chong et al 1990 proposed the δ criterion hussain et al jeong and hussain 1995 summarized the previous studies and gave a new vortex identification called λ 2 criterion the three definitions of vortex criterion have the galilean invariant and are based on the region criterion both the λ 2 and q criteria are widely used in vortex identifying as it is proposed besides the swirling strength zhou et al 1999 and strain acceleration tensor haller 2005 are also applied in vortex identifying the tip clearance flow forms a series vortices which mainly contains two typical vortices of tip sweeping vortex tip leakage vortex fig 27 represents the vortices iso surface with a huge q value of different tip clearance at three advance ratios a closeup of vortices is given in fig 28 the tip clearance is the main reason for the enhancement of vortices compared with advance ratio the advance ratio mainly plays a role in the interaction between the tip leakage vortex and tip sweeping vortex the tip sweeping vortex will strictly be restrained by tip leakage vortex at the high advance ratio moreover it almost is swallowed when large tip clearance the tip leakage vortex has a further effect on rotor domain and the downstream even the pjp wake both the advance ratio and tip clearance have significant enhancement on tip leakage vortex intensity and an important role in this vortex source with small tip clearance the tip leakage vortex mainly starts from the leading edge of the blade tip at the low advance ratio and this source provides almost the whole intensity of vortex however when the tip clearance or advance ratio is increased it shows two sources of tip leakage vortex and the tip clearance plays a more important effect comparing to advance ratio the second source comes from the separation of tip sweeping vortex and it shares the major part when high advance ratio according to iso surface an induced vortex occurs near the beginning place of tip leakage this vortex is visualized at the high advance ratio and when the tip clearance is increased it occurs first with a lower advance ratio and has higher strength compared to the tip leakage vortex both the tip sweeping vortex and induced vortex have slight effects on the flow field the tip leakage vortex flows to stator domain and is cut off by stator leading edge when it flows into the stator domain it has a relative stretching in the axial direction this is caused by the locale velocity level compared with the tip clearance flow due to a high velocity the vortex near the suction side is accelerated and it shows an inverse effect on the pressure side in the meantime it bends to the hub with the effect of radial velocity in fig 23 the sub figure at j 1 6237 has the same time at t in fig 28 it shows double locale low pressure area on suction side where is corresponded to the vortex cores locations at physics simulation time t marked with a broken circle though the stator has a slight impact on vortex shape it almost has no effect on vortex size when the vortex flows out of stator domain it represents an obvious change of vortex strength with the effect of low velocity flow and the shear layer of the duct from the evolution of vortices and the distributions of pressure and velocity and the energy in the wake the decreasing of open water efficiency is because of not only the decrement of rotor ability to do work on flow but also the almost no effect of recycling the tip clearance flow by the stator the increasing of tip clearance aggravates the flow field fluctuation which is harmful to low noise level design moreover it exacerbates the level of exciting force when the pjp with a heavy load that causes more vibration and accelerate the fatigued of the blade though it is beneficial to the dynamic balance of the rotor it is not cost effective compared with high operating efficiency 5 conclusion in this work transient simulations were conducted to analyze the blades force characteristics unsteady flow field the tip clearance flow effect and the evolution of tip vortices compared with the steady simulations it shows a vast difference in transient simulation which considers the rotor and stator interference based on the discussion the conclusions are given as follows when considering the transient interference between rotor and stator though it would not cause a massive change in whole open water performance of pjp it brings a notable difference in stator and duct hydrodynamics this difference gets a remarkable amplification when pjp has a big tip clearance and the advance ratio also has a significant effect on the difference the balance performance changes when the interference is considered due to the tip clearance flow impacts on the stator flow field the stator torque decreases and it weakens the balance performance of torque moreover the increasing of tip clearance exacerbates the balance because it gets an increment of torque while stator gets decrement of torque the interference between the rotor and stator cause the exciting force of the blade the exciting force frequency is judged by the rotor revolution speed and the blade number and the exciting force mainly acts at the bpf with the mutual interference the exciting force frequency of rotor is relevant to the blade number of the stator while the exciting force frequency of stator has the relationship with blade number of the rotor for the rotor blades the exciting force amplitude is depended on the rotor loads which has a decrement as the tip clearance increasing so it shows low exciting force level with large tip clearance size moreover it has a better improvement at the high advance ratio however for the stator it has no regularity as the tip clearance increasing both the rotor blade wake and tip clearance flow have a significant effect on the stator blade load the rotor revolution causes periodic rotor blade wake and tip clearance flow propagating to downstream that leads to fluctuations in the flow field the stator has better recycling of rotor blade wake but it has slightly effect on tip clearance flow so the dc component is weakened and the high frequency components are strengthened when pjp has a larger tip clearance size the increasing of tip clearance results in a high level of circumference velocity and radial velocity in pjp wake and causes the higher shrinking level of pjp wake the existence of tip clearance causes the leaking flow which has tremendous vorticity intensity with the impact of the rotor revolution two typical vortices of tip sweeping vortex and tip leakage vortex exist in tip clearance region and its downstream the tip sweeping vortex mainly exists in the tip region and it quickly slashed in the region between rotor and stator while the tip leakage vortex has a significant effect in stator domain and pjp wake the stator cuts off and stretches the tip leakage vortex and causes a radial bend after the stator cutting effect the tip leakage vortex propagates to pjp wake with discrete segments decreasing advance ratio or increasing tip clearance will enhance the vortices and it will show different results between tip sweeping vortex and tip leakage vortex acknowledgement this work is supported by the

22418,this work discussed the transient characteristic of pjp and gave a comparative analysis between steady and transient simulations the simulations employed reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse method with a focus on the transient flow field and tip clearance effect the mutual interference between rotor and stator does not lead to a massive difference in pjp whole open water performance it causes remarkable changes in stator and duct and the increasing of tip clearance enhances the changes the exciting force on blades can not be ignored and represents a different variation between rotor and stator with the effects of advance ratio or tip clearance and possesses a characteristics frequency corresponded to blade passing frequency bpf and their harmonics the exciting force intensity mainly embodies in bpf the stator mainly has better recycling on rotor blade wake and the recycling mainly acts on circumference velocity comparing with axial velocity which shares almost the whole energy in pjp wake both the circumference velocity and radial velocity include a little tip sweeping vortex and tip leakage vortex are the typical vortices in pjp tip leakage vortex plays a vital role in the stator flow field and pjp wake keywords pumpjet propulsor transient analysis tip clearance hydrodynamics vortex 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auv are today of great strategic importance for many countries propulsors play a significant role in underwater propulsion system which guarantees the auv stably navigating for many underwater carriers the universal propulsors mainly contain the conventional propeller contracted rotating propeller ducted propeller between them the contracted rotating propeller can provide more thrust and perform better torque balance but it is easy to occur cavitation later with the development of auv to large scale and high speed the propulsor with massive thrust under high cruise speed is needed the pumpjet propulsor pjp is a multi component propulsor whose advantages over other propulsion systems are heavy load with high efficiency and lower hydro acoustics it can satisfy the need and catches more eyes of researchers on it the research of pjp mainly contains experimental research and computational fluid dynamics cfd research mccormick et al mccormick and eisenhuth 1963 discussed the pjp design and studied the pjp efficiency and cavitation performance with an experimental approach then stephen ivanell ivanell investigated the hydrodynamic performance of pjp behind a torpedo by numerical methods and experimental methods in a wind tunnel in the numerical simulation the ranse solver was employed in conjunction with the k ε turbulence model discretized in the high quality structure mesh yongxiang dong et al 2012 numerically investigated the pjp hydrodynamics performance and compared the thrust with experimental data in the simulation multiple reference frames mrf was used to realize the rotor revolution the pjp effect on the underwater vehicle body was also analyzed ch suryanarayana et al 2010a 2010b 2010c carried out series experiments of pjp behind the vehicle in wind tunnel

coworkers shi et al 2015 lu et al 2016a pan et al 2016 numerically studied the pjp open water performance and cavitation they considered the rotor revolution speed and cavitation number effects on cavitation performance and discussed the velocity field and pressure field mehran et al motallebi nejad et al 2017 employed a ranse solver with sst k ω turbulence model in predicting pjp performance the numerical results predicted by a periodic computational domain get better consistency with experiments wang chao et al wang et al 2019 had done a comparison study of pjp between a pre swirl ducted propeller and rear stator pjp by using panel method with proposing a tip leakage model and compared the tip leakage model with traditional method in predicting the hydrodynamics of both propulsors moreover a discussion of the tip clearance effect on stator with potential flow theory was carried out for the duct style propulsor the tip clearance existed between the rotor tip and duct inner surface has a distinct effect on hydrodynamics performance the tip clearance plays important roles not only in the underwater propulsor but also in the pumps and turbine machine the tip clearance research can conduct the researcher to find a proper way or get an inspiration to satisfy the demands of high efficiency and noise level hsiao and chahine 2008 studied the interaction between the cavitation inception and the leakage and trailing tip vortices ding yongle et al 2015 presented an investigation of tip clearance effect on a ducted propeller the study shows that the tip clearance mainly affects the tip region and has slightly effect on the pressure distribution at low spanwise of the blade larger tip clearance will generate more turbulence kinematic energy jie gong et al 2018 and qin zhang et al zhang and jaiman 2019 focused on the wake vortex evolution and its effects on the ducted propeller both the authors discussed the wake vortex forming from the tip leakage vortices which shed from the trailing edge of the duct and the wake vortex evolution mechanics moreover jie gong did a further discussion of the duct shear layer effects on wake vortices evolution donghyun you et al 2004 investigated the tip clearance flow by using a large eddy simulation les combined with an immersed boundary method for the tip clearance effect on tip vortices it also has been discussed in some literature which is about the pumps research wu et al 2011 miorini et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 shen et al 2018 these studies mainly discussed the tip leakage vortex and did series experimental research pan guang lu lin and coworkers lu et al 2016b 2018 studied the hydrodynamics and cavitation performance of two pjp models with the duct of the decelerated and accelerated respectively a discussion of tip vortices by visualizing them with streamlines and pressure was represented they also investigated the tip clearance effect on pjp cavitation performance pan guang and coworkers qin

the viscous flow field is numerically simulated by the integration of the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for the incompressible and single phase homogeneous flow without the body force the time averaged continuity equation and momentum conservation equation ferziger and perić 2012 can be written as follows 1 ρ u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x i τ i j x j ρ u i u j x j where x i x j i j 1 2 3 represent the cartesian coordinate components u i u j are the time averaged values of velocity components ρ is the fluid density p is the time averaged pressure u i u j are the fluctuation velocity τ i j is the viscous tensor ρ u i u j denotes the reynolds stress 2 2 turbulence model in equation 2 the presence of reynolds stress means that the equation contains more variables than there are equations the closure requires the additional equations of some approximations called the turbulence model to solve the reynolds stress term there are two categories of the reynolds stress model and the eddy viscosity model for the eddy viscosity model a parameter μ t called turbulent viscosity or eddy viscosity is used to describe the relationship between reynolds stress term and time averaged variables that is based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis proposed by boussinesq one of the eddy viscosity models that called the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter 1993 was used in this work for solving the additional transport equations the sst k ω turbulence model has been widely applied in predicting the hydrodynamics and cavitation of ducted propeller and pjp lu et al 2016a 2016b 2018 pan et al 2016 motallebi nejad et al 2017 yongle et al 2015 qin et al 2018 both the authors in yongle et al 2015 and qin et al 2018 represented a comparative analysis of the turbulence model effect on predicting the ducted propeller hydrodynamics which showed that the sst k ω turbulence model got more accurate results than the k ε launder and spalding 1974 turbulence model series moreover desheng zhang and coworkers zhang et al 2015 implemented a study of turbulence model impacts on an axial flow pump whose results showed that the sst k ω turbulence model obtained smaller prediction error than the standard k ω wilcox 1988 turbulence model the sst k ω turbulence model is a two equation model developed from the k ε and the standard k ω turbulence model due to the overprediction of the eddy viscosity both the basic models do not account for the transport of the turbulent shear stress and fail to properly predict the onset and amount of flow separation from smooth surfaces then menter 1993 1994 summarized and proposed the sst k ω model that overcomes the shortcomings the complete formulation of the sst k ω model is given with the k equation from the standard k ω model and the ω equation modified by blend functions 3 ρ k t ρ u i k x i x i μ σ k μ t k x i p k ρ β k ω 4 ρ ω t ρ u i ω x i x i μ σ ω μ t ω x i ρ α s 2 β ω 2 2 ρ 1 f

standard k ω and k ε model and overcome the shortcomings the formulation of the eddy viscosity is modified in the high reynolds number by a limiter that defined as 6 μ t ρ k ω 1 m a x 1 s f 2 a 1 ω where s is the strain rate and f 2 is the blending function the constant variables for two standard models are a 1 0 31 β 0 09 β 1 3 40 β 2 0 0828 α 1 5 9 α 2 0 44 σ k 1 0 85 σ k 2 1 σ ω 1 0 5 σ ω 2 0

cfx solver in cloud computing platform ccp http www easycae cn en to numerically investigate the open water performance and transient flow field characteristics of a pjp because of the motion the general grid interface ggi algorithm was applied the multiple frames of reference mfr based on the ggi technology allows the simulation involving domains that are rotating relative to one another for the unsteady simulation the sliding mesh technique was aided which was modeled using the transient rotor stator frame change model and could adequately simulate the interaction between the motion domain and stationary domain the cfx solver is based on the finite volume method fvm that discretizes the governing equations and the turbulence model in the rans simulations the simple algorithm was employed to get the pressure velocity coupling equations the advection and turbulence numerics were discretized by using high resolution scheme both in the steady and unsteady simulations the transient was discretized by using the second order backward euler scheme for every time step it was initialized by the previous one 2 3 verification of numerical approach the ducted propeller with the ka4 70 propeller inside the wageningen 19a duct was employed in verifying the numerical simulation scheme this ducted propeller model was presented by maritime research institute netherland marin oosterveld 1970 it was taken as an approach verification model in the work motallebi nejad et al 2017 in this work when generating this model the main parameters were followed by the literature baltazar et al 2017 it has a propeller diameter of d 0 21 m with a constant pitch ratio of p d 1 0 and a uniform gap of δ r 0 8 between the inner duct surface and the blade tip the geometry mesh and computational domains are shown in fig 1 the advance ratio j propeller thrust coefficient k t p and its torque coefficient k q duct thrust coefficient k t d are defined as 7 j v n d k t p t p ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k t d t d ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k t k t p k t d k q q ρ 2 n 2 d 5 η j 2 π k t k q where the n is the propeller revolution speed and t p t d is the propeller thrust and duct thrust respectively q is the propeller torque the computational domain is a cylinder of diameter 10 d which extends 5 d upstream and 10 d downstream from the ducted propeller location the rans simulation referred to a grid consists of 10 9 million cells split into one cylindrical rotating region around the propeller with 4 96 million cells and one region of the rest of the domain with 5 94 million cells in this simulation the inlet boundary was the velocity inlet whose values were set according to the advance ratio which was simulated for a range between 0 1 and 0 8 while the outlet boundary was a pressure outlet with a constant value of p o u t 0 p a and the far field boundary was set as a free slip wall for the propeller revolution speed it was set as n 10 r s with which the reynolds numbers were from 3 54 10 5 to 3 76 10 5 where the reynolds number was defined at the same place and had the approximate range with baltazar work baltazar et al 2017 based on the maximum reynolds number the first layer height of grid was set as 1 5 10 5 m near the blade wall and 2 10 5 m around the duct surface the heights were calculated by definition given in the ansys cfx solver guide ansys 2016 with a target value of y which was lower than 5 the density and temperature of water liquid were ρ 997 k g m 3 and 25 c after being calculated by the steady rans solver the unsteady simulations were conducted with the time step size δ t 2 7778 10 4 s which represented the propeller blade rotating 1 both the steady and unsteady calculations results compared with the experimental data oosterveld 1970 are given in fig 1 the hydrodynamics coefficients and open water efficiency show good consistency between the numerical and experimental data it gets more accurate results with the transient simulation which simulates the propeller wake more proper and that affects the ducted propeller flow field in summary this simulation illustrates that the numerical simulation scheme used in predicting the open water performance of duct style propulsor is applicable and reliable 3 numerical simulation for pumpjet propulsor 3 1 geometry and numerical modeling the pjp model and the coordinate are shown in fig 2 and some main dimensions of pjp are given in table 1 this pjp model is a post swirl pumpjet propulsor which has eleven rotor blades nine stator blades and equipped with a decelerating duct a uniform gap between the duct inner surface and rotor blade tip in the radial direction is called the tip clearance the tip clearance size of the basic model is δ 0 5 m m and the other three derivative models with the tip clearance sizes 1 m m 2 m m and 3 m m were generated by cutting the rotor blade tip with fixing the duct dimensions those derivative models are different from the literature models lu et al 2016b qin et al 2018 which were derived by fixing the rotor dimension and expanding the duct and stator size moreover an ellipse cap guide with ellipticity 2 1 in front of the hub and a circular cap guide behind the hub were added 3 2 mesh generation a cylindrical domain with diameter 10 d t and length 15 d t was used to model the far field boundary and the pjp model was located 5 d t from the flow inlet in order to generate a structural mesh and control the grid size and node spacing the computational domain was divided into three parts the rotor domain the stator domain and external domain shown in fig 3 the node space distribution especially in the wall boundary layer and tip clearance domain could control appropriately by employing the structured mesh the mesh view is shown in fig 3 both rotor and stator domain meshes were generated by the periodic mesh with the o topology refined near the blade moreover the tip clearance mesh was refined with double layers o topological mesh in the radial direction according to the reynolds number the first layer height of grid was set 4 10 5 m that represented a high y value between 30 and 100 was satisfied for the sst k ω turbulence model demands in high reynolds number in order to consider the mesh size effect on hydrodynamics prediction the mesh dependence was verified by using three groups mesh to predict the pjp hydrodynamics all domains are the same grid topology and refined with grid spacing ratio r 1 3 in axial circumference and radial direction and the tip clearance mesh size was set the same as the fine mesh group size in fig 5 the tip clearance meshes of different clearance size are shown details of mesh distribution for the coarse medium and fine are given in table 2 see fig 4 3 3 boundary condition and simulation set in fig 3 the inlet boundary was set as the velocity inlet with the constant value v 25 72 m s and the turbulent intensity 5 the outlet boundary was the pressure outlet with a constant value of p o u t 0 p a and the far field boundary was set as a free slip wall the rotor revolution speeds n r p m or n r s was varied with the step δ n 200 r p m from n 2000 r p m to n 4000 r p m under which the reynolds number was 3 15 10 6 to 4 91 10 6 calculated with the maximum rotor blade radius for the steady simulation the iteration was 500 steps in every operating condition in the unsteady numerical calculations the timestep size was equivalent to the time needed for 1 rotation of the rotor considering the huge requirement of cpu time in transient simulation three operating points of n 2000 r p m 3000 r p m 4000 r p m for the other three tip clearance sizes were selected for conducting the unsteady calculation 4 results and discussion 4 1 definitions of hydrodynamic coefficient of the pjp in order to show the results and discuss the dimensionless hydrodynamic coefficients of pjp are defined the advance ratio j is defined as the same defined in the approach verification the definitions of the rotor thrust coefficient k t r the rotor torque coefficient k q r the stator thrust coefficient k t s the stator torque coefficient k q s the duct thrust coefficient k t d the pjp thrust coefficient k t the pjp torque coefficient k q the pjp open water efficiency η 0 are as follows 8 k t r t r ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k q r q r ρ 2 n 2 d 5 k t s t s ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k q s q s ρ 2 n 2 d 5 k t d t d ρ 2 n 2 d 4 k t k t r k t s k t d k q k q r η 0 j 2 π k t k q where d is equal to d r t r and d r represent the thrust and torque of rotor t s and d s represent the thrust and torque of stator t d is the duct thrust 4 2 mesh discussion the numerical simulation results of pjp with tip clearance δ 0 5 m m at the operating points j 1 6327 j 2 1650 the design point and j 3 2475 were conducted to evaluate the mesh convergence in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of pjp in a uniform and non cavitating flow the y at the operating points of three groups mesh are represented in table 3 it shows that the y satisfies the turbulence model demand and is appropriate for the high reynolds number flow based on the generalized richardson extrapolation re stern and wilson et al stern et al 2001 2006 proposed a method in verification and validation of cfd simulations which can provide a detailed verification under the monotonic convergence when the results represented an oscillatory convergence it also can estimate the uncertainly but can not give the signs and magnitudes of the errors and additionally requires more than m 3 solutions in order to overcome the limitations of the re method and modify the smooth monotonic convergence requirement celik celik et al roacheet al represented an estimation method which can be applied only requiring convergence the grid convergence ratio r g is defined as 9 r g s 3 s 2 s 2 s 1 where s i i 1 2 3 represents the results of the hydrodynamic coefficient corresponding to the coarse medium and fine grids id number three different conditions are possible for the grid convergence ratio 1 r g 1 divergence 2 1 r g 0 oscillatory convergence 3 0 r g 1 monotonic convergence in this work the meshing is implemented by using the structured method and the grid refinement factor r is defined based on the mesh size as 10 r h c o a r s e h f i n e h 1 n t i 1 n t δ i 1 d where n t is the total number of cells used in the calculation d is the dimension which is equal to 3 in this work the computed results of the mesh convergence verification at three advance ratios are shown in table 4 where the apparent order p the extrapolated value φ e x t 21 the approximate relative error e a 21 the extrapolated relative error φ e x t 21 the fine grid convergence index g c i f i n e 21 are defined according to the literature celik et al roacheet al and the definitions of them are as follows 11 p 1 ln r 21 ln φ 3 φ 2 φ 2 φ 1 q p q p ln r 21 p s r 32 p s s 1 s i g n φ 3 φ 2 φ 2 φ 1 φ e x t 21 r 21 p φ 1 φ 2 r 21 p 1 e a 21 φ 1 φ 2 φ 1 e e x t 21 φ e x t 21 φ 1 φ e x t 21 g c i f i n e 21 1 25 e a 21 r 21 p 1 where φ represents the hydrodynamic coefficient of k t or k q and the subscript is corresponded to the mesh group id due to the mesh distribution in tip clearance kept in the fine grid size the grid refinement factor is not a constant as the same in the mesh generation that represents that the q p is not equal to zero so equation 11 was solved by the fixed point iteration method the initial value was got by assuming that q p was equal to zero and then iterated the equation to get the p value it can be seen that the absolute values of grid convergence ratio r g of thrust coefficient and torque coefficient are below 1 demonstrating the monotonic convergence or oscillatory convergence of grids the convergences are proper for the mesh convergence investigation for all the mesh convergence verification cases the maximum numerical uncertainty of the fine mesh solution for the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient should be 2 05 and 0 59 respectively the uncertainty is not sensitive for the torque coefficient though the advance ratio affects the gci values it does not cause a noticeable change and all the results are acceptable the small value of gci shows that refining the grids does not cause an improvement of the hydrodynamics coefficients especially for the torque coefficient so from the maximum values of uncertainty it may make no sense for further refinement of mesh furthermore at the design point j 2 1650 a slice of the pjp internal flow field and the axial velocity profile distribution of a line located on the slice are represented in fig 6 and fig 7 the higher velocity gradients are in the tip leakage area and near the wall and both the areas are prominently affected by the mesh both the hydrodynamics coefficients and the velocity distribution show that the medium mesh and fine mesh are more close to each other and it can get a better representation of the tip leakage flow field with the fine mesh overall the grid convergence investigation indicates that the fine mesh is suitable for the calculations the open water performance curves were calculated under steady simulation with the fine mesh and it is a basis of the mesh generation of other three tip clearance sizes of pjp in table 2 for the other three tip clearance pjp models the increments of total mesh number were mainly caused by the tip clearance size change the external domain and stator domain was the same mesh as the mesh group of tip clearance size δ 0 5 m m though the mesh did not get a noticeable increment it caused a vast and additional cpu time because of the mesh motion during the transient simulation 4 3 the open water performance in fig 8 both the steady and unsteady open water performance of pjp with the tip clearance size δ 0 5 m m and the comparison of them are illustrated the open water curves have slight changes between the steady and unsteady calculations the differences in the whole performance parameters of pjp are lower than 1 the thrust coefficient of pjp is decreased as the advance ratio increased which has a great variation tendency compared to the torque coefficient and open water efficiency the open water efficiency maintains the values higher than 0 6 in all the calculated advance ratios which is a wide range and it gets the maximum value of η 0 0 700 at j 2 7062 in steady simulation however the maximum value is η 0 0 702 at j 2 4981 with transient results the thrust coefficient gets increments during the transient simulation while the torque coefficient is also increased in most of the advance ratios and has negative increments at low advance ratios the torque coefficient gets little changes in all the advance ratio range comparatively and the thrust is more sensitive when considering the time in the simulation the rotor thrust provides the main thrust of pjp the stator also produces some thrust and the duct mainly generates the drag the duct thrust coefficient is a negative value and decreased as the advance going up the torque of pjp mainly comes from the rotor and stator though the stator generates an inverse torque with almost the same absolute value to balanced the rotor torque the stator thrust is less and only to balance the duct drag at low advance ratios when high advance ratios the duct drag needs to be offset by both the thrust of the rotor and stator in transient the thrust and torque of rotor have slight changes and they are not sensitive with the advance ratio change for the stator and duct due to the rotor wake is simulated more proper they get extremely changes the stator thrust coefficient is increased approximate 3 4 at every advance ratio while the duct drag is also increased the same level apart from the low advance ratios that causes a slight change in pjp thrust coefficient the torque coefficient of the stator is decreased and it has a bigger decrement when the pjp operating in a low advance ratio that means the pjp torque balance is changed fig 9 represents the torque balance of pjp which is extremely important in the underwater vehicle navigation to avoid the rolling the torque balance performance is described by the relative torque difference of rotor torque and stator torque which is calculated with the following definition 12 δ k q k q r k q s k q r 100 it has a significant change of the torque balance in unsteady prediction with the stator torque decreasing in all the advance ratios the stator can not produce enough inverse torque to offset the rotor torque it causes the best balance point to moves to high advance ratio where the stator torque is slightly affected by the rotor wake operated in light load pjp is a typical propulsor with the characteristics of high route speed with heavy load compared to conventional propulsor it can maintain high efficiency in a broad range of advance ratio and supply the vast thrust request with smaller size in fig 10 both the steady and transient thrust coefficients of rotor blades and stator blades at design point j 2 1650 are given though the rotor and stator show the constant output of thrust it has a different phenomenon when analyzing per blade load the thrust coefficient of the blade is calculated by definition 13 k t t b ρ n 2 d 4 where t b is the thrust of the blade in steady the rotor flow field was simulated with giving a rotating speed to the coordinate system it did not simulate the real inflow of stator which caused the blade loads were invariant at one blade location it only changed with the blade relative position transformed in the circumference direction in the unsteady simulation due to the relative operating of rotor and stator and the stator blades number is not equal to the number of rotor blades both the blades of rotor and stator show a periodic fluctuating of thrust in the time domain the thrust coefficient curves of the rotor have nine peaks and nine troughs depended on the number of stator blade while it has eleven peaks and eleven troughs of the thrust coefficient curves of stator depended on the number of the rotor blade for the rotor the curves are more fatter at the peak regions due to the tip clearance flow with a time delay the tip clearance flow distorts the curves of stator blades at j 2 1650 for the rotor blade the fluctuation range is approximately 10 of the blade periodic averaged thrust coefficient whose value is 0 0737 and higher than the averaged value 0 0733 of the maximum and minimum due to the asymmetry of curves upper and lower the periodic averaged value of stator blade curves is 0 0234 which is lower than the averaged value 0 0235 calculated by the maximum and minimum it is mainly caused by the distortion which affects the lower of curves and means that stator blades have more time operating with low thrust the fluctuation range is approximately 16 of the periodic averaged value the tip clearance flow has more impacts on the stator flow field the thrust coefficient curves of rotor blades and stator blades show the fluctuation characteristics and it is worthy to analysis in the frequency domain fig 11 shows the frequency domain curves of thrust coefficients transformed from the time domain through fast fourier transform fft the zero frequency component or called it the direct current dc component is 0 0737 and 0 0234 of thrust coefficients of rotor blades and stator blades respectively and they are almost equal to the periodic averaged values in the frequency domain the first peak is distributed at the blade passing frequency bpf of rotor or stator which is related to the number of the blade and the axial passing frequency apf depended on the rotor revolution speed n at j 2 1650 the apf is f a 50 h z and the bpfs of rotor and stator are f b r 11 f a and f b s 9 f a respectively the main peaks of both the frequency domain curves are located at the bpf and its harmonic for the rotor blade the peak locations at frequency domain are affected by the number of stator blade comparatively the peak locations are impacted by the number of the rotor blade for rotor blade load the amplitude at bpf is 0 0035 which has 4 8 of the dc component and it is 0 7 at 2bpf in the high order of the harmonic the amplitudes are smaller compared with the rotor blade the values at peaks of stator blades are decayed slower it has 6 8 of the dc component and 3 at the 2bpf except for the dc components the amplitudes at peaks share the main parts of thrust coefficients of the blade and it will cause the vibration and periodic fluctuation of the flow field those phenomenons will lead to particular peaks in the noise spectrum the changes in open water performance of pjp shows that the pressure field has its typical characteristic due to the rotor and stator mutual interference the pressure distribution has been discussed in many previous works for instance pan guang and coworkers lu et al 2016b qin et al 2018 gave detailed discussions on the pressure distribution of the rotor blade a comparison of the pressure contours of steady and transient results are shown in fig 12 at j 2 1650 the velocity magnitude contours at different radial places of steady and transient simulations are given in fig 13 in order to compare the legend of pressure contours is divided into twenty layers which has more visible difference of color levels than the difference of pressure distribution among blades from the contours representation it follows a similar pressure distribution however in transient simulations it is distributed more regular than the steady results where is slightly affected by the tip clearance flow and rotor wake except that it has notable difference among blades pressure distribution the pressure changes among blades mainly locate at the middle area near the tip region of the rotor pressure side and the trailing edge that is periodically changed as the rotor blade operating comparatively for the stator blades it mainly locates at the leading edge which is greatly affected by the rotor wake and the middle area and all the tip area of stator suction side which is hugely impacted by the rotor tip clearance flow a locale low pressure center is shown which represents the tip clearance flow core for the duct the outer duct surface does not get visible change it also represented a periodic distribution in circumference moreover due to tip leakage flow the pressure of the inner duct surface shows a lower pressure region located coincidentally with the tip leakage flow trajectory in rotor domain in the unsteady simulation the tip leakage flow flows to downstream and affects the pressure of duct inner surface in stator domain it causes a distinct pressure distribution change on the duct surface and influences the high pressure zone periodically according to the velocity magnitude distribution in the flow field it will cause the stator inflow inappropriate in steady simulation that does not represent the blade load operating characteristic in the transient simulation the rotor wake flows into stator domain periodically and the tip clearance flow affects the stator flow field intermittently that causes the pressure changes periodically and represents a fluctuation of thrust coefficient curves and distortion occurs intermittently though the tip clearance leakage flow has greater velocity magnitude its velocity is restricted by the duct and represents a lower value at the tip region and near the inner duct surface the tip clearance flow mainly affects the tip and its downstream near the duct and its effect is also depended on the tip clearance size close to the hub the stator inflow is only periodically affected by the rotor wake in fig 14 a series contours of axial velocity in the axial direction and the recycling of the circumference velocity and radial velocity components by stator blades are shown the axial velocity accelerates in all the pjp inner passage and it shares the major part of velocity in pjp wake the circumference velocity is generated by the rotor revolution and quickly decelerated in the stator domain the radial velocity shares little part and accelerates in rotor domain and it has a slight change in the stator passage the acceleration of axial velocity mainly come from the stator recycling of circumference velocity compared with the contours of axial velocity and radial velocity in x plane the axial velocity absorbs nearly the whole part from the recycling of circumference velocity in the pjp wake the tip clearance flow regions and hub wake have large velocity gradients of the circumference velocity and radial velocity combined with the contour of velocity magnitude near the tip region and downstream shown in fig 13 the stator has better recycling of rotor wake but the recycling of tip clearance flow is inferior at design point j 2 1650 the time domain curves of pressure and the fft results of six monitor points shown in fig 14 are given in fig 15 the pressure is dealt with the dimensionless method in the following equation 14 k p p ρ n 2 d 2 in the time domain the pressure represents the fluctuation due to the rotor revolution and the fluctuations in p2 and p3 are complex the stator has better recycling in rotor wake and the fluctuation shows a sharp reduction in stator wake the fluctuation of stator wake means that stator recycling is imperfect the rotor revolution has a significant effect on the pjp flow field the fluctuation is mainly caused by the rotor that represents eleven main crests on the curves of all monitor points due to the stator and the tip clearance flow interference with the stator it also shows some little locale crests on curves of p2 and p3 considered the velocity contours and the monitor point locations the fluctuations are mainly affected by the tip clearance flow in the stator wake in the frequency domain due to the tip clearance flow and rotor wake have the same period it represents the same locations at the frequency of all peaks the locations are main at first bpf and its harmonic in p1 the pressure has an intense fluctuation which is mainly affected by the rotor operation so the fluctuation is more regular than the fluctuations of p2 and p3 the amplitudes at peaks in the frequency domain are decayed quickly while in p2 and p3 it has larger amplitudes at the high harmonic frequency and decayed slowly p4 p5 and p6 located at the stator wake their frequency curves decay quickly and the amplitude at bpf is smaller than p2 and p3 the specific energy coefficient of the velocity components of four slices s1 s2 s3 s4 shown in fig 14 is represented in fig 16 the rotor wake and stator wake is complex and it is hard to estimate the energy absorption only by velocity or pressure contours the specific energy coefficient is defined as 15 k e i v i 2 π n d 2 v 2 where the v i represents the velocity components of axial circumference or radial the wake energy is mainly contained in axial velocity and it has a lower value at s4 when the pjp with high efficiency at s1 it shows high values of k e a k e c and k e r it indicates that the rotor has a stronger suction effect when the rotor operates at low advance ratios at s2 and s3 the k e a shows slightly changes with the advance ratio change that means the rotor and stator interference has slight acceleration in axial velocity it also can be seen from the axial velocity contours which do not represent the important difference the k e c shows an obvious difference at high advance ratios it illustrates that the rotor and stator interference has a contribution to the recycling of rotor wake the k e r shows a lower value at s4 than s3 when the rotor at high revolution speed 4 4 the tip clearance size effect on pjp hydrodynamics the tip clearance effects on pjp hydrodynamics and cavitation performance has been investigated in detail by pan guang and coworkers lu et al 2016b qin et al 2018 so only three advance ratios were selected to investigate the transient blade load characteristics and the unsteady flow field primarily the stator domain in fig 17 with the steady simulation results the tip clearance effects on open water performance show similar changes as the literature work the open water efficiency is decreased as the tip clearance size increased and it causes more massive efficiency leak when the pjp at high advance ratios similar to the efficiency the torque coefficient also has more obvious change at high advance ratios in fig 18 the relative changes of the dimensionless hydrodynamics coefficients between the steady simulation and transient simulation are shown it can be seen that it is to follow the similar regular as the tip clearance size δ 0 5 m m it causes little changes in the overall parameters of pjp the maximum values of changes are near 1 and it is affected by the advance ratio and tip clearance size for the η 0 it shows smaller changes with the tip clearance increased while it represents an inverse regular pattern of the k t and k q the advance ratio has a slight effect on η 0 and it has a more massive change at low advance ratios however for the k t and k q the advance ratio has a more significant effect and it shows a more massive difference when high advance ratios like the tip clearance δ 0 5 m m it shows little changes of rotor thrust and torque the k t r and k q r has the same variety as the tip clearance however they show the contrary change regularly when considering the advance ratio like the k t r and k q r the stator has the same variety trend but it has a more significant difference and the stator torque is decreased for the k t d it is a negative value and the increments mean that the drag of duct is increased the duct drag is increased as the tip clearance size increased and it shows profound changes caused by the advance ratio change all of those phenomenons mean that it shows low accuracy when preceding the duct and stator force and torque by steady simulation in the case δ 0 5 m m the blade thrust shows intense fluctuation and it indicates that the exciting force can not be ignored fig 19 shows the curves of rotor blades thrust coefficient in the time domain and frequency domain the time domain curves show the same tendency as described in the case δ 0 5 m m the tip clearance size or advance ratio does not cause profound changes in curves shape the increasing of tip clearance mainly leads to a decrement on the dc component and decreases the fluctuation range the tip clearance shows apparent changes on the crests when pjp at a high advance ratio it has a similar distribution in the frequency domain and the locations of the peaks are mainly judged by the rotor revolution speed and the number of stator blades it has non obvious change rule with the tip clearance change at the high frequency band only at the bpf and 2bpf the amplitudes show a clear tendency of descent as the tip clearance size increased in table 5 the relative value of the amplitudes to the dc components at bpf are given a stronger exciting force is generated at every blade at the high advance ratio it represents that the exciting force of per blade decreases as the tip clearance size going up fig 20 shows the curves of stator blades thrust coefficients in the time domain and frequency domain unlike the rotor blades the time domain curves of stator blade thrust coefficient show distinct changes of curve particulars in an overall view the shape of the curves shows the same crests and troughs as tip clearance change the stator blade is affected by both the rotor wake and the tip clearance flow in the case δ 0 5 m m at j 2 1650 the distortion does not affect the crests and troughs of curves however in an ample tip clearance it causes a massive distortion and even a sub crest at the high advance ratio moreover the distortion place is affected by the rotor revolution speed or it should be illustrated that the place depends on the velocities of the rotor wake and tip clearance flow in the frequency domain the curves also represent the same distribution pattern and the locations of peaks are depended on the bpf of the rotor the amplitudes of peaks decay more slowly and it has higher values of the broadband components at the low advance ratio according to the values given in table 5 it represents a relatively higher level of the exciting force of stator blades at the high advance ratio and the increment of tip clearance will aggravate this phenomenon the blade load characteristics indicate that the tip clearance effects on rotor and stator show a contrary reaction for the rotor massive tip clearance reduces the blade load and weaken the interference from the stator though increasing the tip clearance causes more thrust leak it shows a slight effect on rotor blade exciting for stator the blade loads depended on the inflow from the rotor and it represents complex impacts because the tip clearance flow plays a significant role in the stator inflow and the tip clearance flow effect is decided by the tip clearance size and rotor revolution speed from fig 21 to fig 23 the pressure contours of the tip clearance impacts on the rotor blade surface and stator blade surface and duct inner surface and the revolution speed effects on pjp inner flow field are shown the tip clearance increasing causes a broader low pressure region of the tip clearance flow and stronger effect on the downstream and it leads to a higher locale high pressure area on the middle of rotor blade pressure side near the tip those follow the same regular pattern as the literature work the suction side and pressure side of the rotor blade and stator blade has an inverse distribution of pressure so when the tip clearance flows with low pressure lashes against the leading edge of the stator blade it weakens the values of the high pressure area because the low pressure of tip clearance flow has relatively high level than the low pressure area on stator suction side the tip clearance flow increases the values of the lowest pressure area and reduces the low pressure zone and the effect is directly relevant to tip clearance size when the tip clearance flow passes the stator blade a locale low pressure center is located on the suction side and effects the pressure until it flows away from the trailing edge of the stator blade the locale low pressure center is depended on the tip clearance flow which is enhanced with larger tip clearance size the duct is shrunk and the inner flow has negative radial velocity that causes a radial flow of the tip clearance flow and it shows different effects between the suction side and pressure side of the stator on the pressure side the tip clearance has a little impact on its pressure distribution except for the leading edge on the contrary it shows a stronger radial flow effect and this is strengthened with the tip clearance increasing it almost acts in the middle area of suction side in the radial direction when δ 3 0 m m the increasing of tip clearance will cause lower pressure in the tip clearance flow center however it represents higher pressure on the inner duct surface in the tip region due to a big distance of the tip and duct the tip clearance flow is strengthened sharply and it shows a distinct tip clearance flow trajectory on the inner duct surface when it flows in the stator domain from the pressure on the duct in the stator domain the trajectory is deformed by the stator blade the suction side of the stator increases the tip clearance flow due to its higher axial velocity near the surface than tip clearance flow while the pressure side it has a smaller axial velocity relatively that causes a contrary impact compared with fig 23 when the tip clearance flow passes stator blade the suction enhances the tip clearance flow and leads to a larger low pressure zone than upstream while on the pressure side the tip clearance flow is weakened and has a slight effect on its pressure distribution this phenomenon causes an increment of the stator blade thrust the increasing of rotor revolution speed strengthens the tip clearance flow and the phenomenon with high revolution speed a double locale low pressure zones occur on the suction side of one blade and cause a larger increment of the thrust of this blade the tip clearance flow has a significant effect on the stator flow field when the pjp with big tip clearance it even has stronger periodic fluctuation on pjp wake at the same monitor points shown in fig 14 both the time curves and frequency curves of pressure are given in fig 24 the pressure change shows a stronger relationship with the tip clearance size except for p1 where the increasing of tip clearance causes a lower level of curve fluctuation the pressure time domain curves in other points have a broader fluctuation range in the rotor and stator interference flow field where p2 and p3 are located it represents a prominent positive correlation between the tip clearance and pressure fluctuation in p4 p5 and p6 the recycling of stator can not annihilate the fluctuation from the tip clearance flow that causes pulsation in pjp wake also it has a high fluctuation level when big tip clearance though tip clearance increasing does not lead to a consistent regular of change on the dc component the strength of fluctuation is directly affected and decides the amplitude level at peaks of the frequency domain the amplitudes of the dc component and high frequency components are decreased as it flows to the downstream in the rotor domain however it is enhanced when the flow lashes against the stator leading edge both the dc component and high frequency components are strengthened moreover the enhancement level is decided by the tip clearance flow strength which is directly depended on the tip clearance size the dc component is decreased and the amplitudes at peaks have sharply decayed as the flow to pjp wake the attenuation is decelerated with the tip clearance increasing or it should be described as the tip clearance increasing enhances the amplitude of the high frequency components it means that the flow field has stronger pulsation which is terrible for pjp noise performance fig 25 and fig 26 represent the tip clearance effects on pjp axial velocity and energy distribution the increasing of tip clearance weakens the rotor acceleration on flow and cause a higher velocity level of tip clearance flow this phenomenon enhances the impact of tip clearance flow on stator leading edge and causes a series of results of pressure fluctuation and blade loads changes which are harmful to the blade stress fatigue and noise level higher velocity level of tip clearance flow will cause the wake more nonuniform and accelerate the shrinking of wake in the radial direction the specific energy coefficient shows that the tip clearance has directly effect on rotor acceleration of flow the increasing of tip clearance decreases the energy level of axial velocity and cause a higher level of energy carried by the circumference velocity and radial velocity with larger tip clearance though the stator has better recycling of circumference velocity it almost has no recycling effect on circumference velocity and radial velocity of tip clearance flow both the phenomenons exacerbate the energy leak from the previous analysis it can be concluded that the stator has slightly recycling effect on tip clearance flow it causes energy waste in the pjp wake so the increasing of tip clearance decreases the open water efficiency of pjp 4 5 typical vortices of pjp the pressure and velocity indicate that the tip clearance flow and its wake has a high gradient of velocity and locale low pressure this phenomenon satisfies the vortices requirement of vortex criteria it is generally accepted that the vortices locate at the place where the vorticity is a peak or maximum value the vorticity identification can get proper phenomenon in some situations spalart 1988 but it is inappropriate sometimes such as the boundary wall of laminar flow the vorticity magnitude lacks the galilean invariant because its modular depends on the determination of the coordinate system for the rotating machinery it may lead to an improper visualization hunt et al 1988 proposed the q vortex identification which is described by the strain rate tensor s i j and vorticity tensor ω i j then chong et al 1990 proposed the δ criterion hussain et al jeong and hussain 1995 summarized the previous studies and gave a new vortex identification called λ 2 criterion the three definitions of vortex criterion have the galilean invariant and are based on the region criterion both the λ 2 and q criteria are widely used in vortex identifying as it is proposed besides the swirling strength zhou et al 1999 and strain acceleration tensor haller 2005 are also applied in vortex identifying the tip clearance flow forms a series vortices which mainly contains two typical vortices of tip sweeping vortex tip leakage vortex fig 27 represents the vortices iso surface with a huge q value of different tip clearance at three advance ratios a closeup of vortices is given in fig 28 the tip clearance is the main reason for the enhancement of vortices compared with advance ratio the advance ratio mainly plays a role in the interaction between the tip leakage vortex and tip sweeping vortex the tip sweeping vortex will strictly be restrained by tip leakage vortex at the high advance ratio moreover it almost is swallowed when large tip clearance the tip leakage vortex has a further effect on rotor domain and the downstream even the pjp wake both the advance ratio and tip clearance have significant enhancement on tip leakage vortex intensity and an important role in this vortex source with small tip clearance the tip leakage vortex mainly starts from the leading edge of the blade tip at the low advance ratio and this source provides almost the whole intensity of vortex however when the tip clearance or advance ratio is increased it shows two sources of tip leakage vortex and the tip clearance plays a more important effect comparing to advance ratio the second source comes from the separation of tip sweeping vortex and it shares the major part when high advance ratio according to iso surface an induced vortex occurs near the beginning place of tip leakage this vortex is visualized at the high advance ratio and when the tip clearance is increased it occurs first with a lower advance ratio and has higher strength compared to the tip leakage vortex both the tip sweeping vortex and induced vortex have slight effects on the flow field the tip leakage vortex flows to stator domain and is cut off by stator leading edge when it flows into the stator domain it has a relative stretching in the axial direction this is caused by the locale velocity level compared with the tip clearance flow due to a high velocity the vortex near the suction side is accelerated and it shows an inverse effect on the pressure side in the meantime it bends to the hub with the effect of radial velocity in fig 23 the sub figure at j 1 6237 has the same time at t in fig 28 it shows double locale low pressure area on suction side where is corresponded to the vortex cores locations at physics simulation time t marked with a broken circle though the stator has a slight impact on vortex shape it almost has no effect on vortex size when the vortex flows out of stator domain it represents an obvious change of vortex strength with the effect of low velocity flow and the shear layer of the duct from the evolution of vortices and the distributions of pressure and velocity and the energy in the wake the decreasing of open water efficiency is because of not only the decrement of rotor ability to do work on flow but also the almost no effect of recycling the tip clearance flow by the stator the increasing of tip clearance aggravates the flow field fluctuation which is harmful to low noise level design moreover it exacerbates the level of exciting force when the pjp with a heavy load that causes more vibration and accelerate the fatigued of the blade though it is beneficial to the dynamic balance of the rotor it is not cost effective compared with high operating efficiency 5 conclusion in this work transient simulations were conducted to analyze the blades force characteristics unsteady flow field the tip clearance flow effect and the evolution of tip vortices compared with the steady simulations it shows a vast difference in transient simulation which considers the rotor and stator interference based on the discussion the conclusions are given as follows when considering the transient interference between rotor and stator though it would not cause a massive change in whole open water performance of pjp it brings a notable difference in stator and duct hydrodynamics this difference gets a remarkable amplification when pjp has a big tip clearance and the advance ratio also has a significant effect on the difference the balance performance changes when the interference is considered due to the tip clearance flow impacts on the stator flow field the stator torque decreases and it weakens the balance performance of torque moreover the increasing of tip clearance exacerbates the balance because it gets an increment of torque while stator gets decrement of torque the interference between the rotor and stator cause the exciting force of the blade the exciting force frequency is judged by the rotor revolution speed and the blade number and the exciting force mainly acts at the bpf with the mutual interference the exciting force frequency of rotor is relevant to the blade number of the stator while the exciting force frequency of stator has the relationship with blade number of the rotor for the rotor blades the exciting force amplitude is depended on the rotor loads which has a decrement as the tip clearance increasing so it shows low exciting force level with large tip clearance size moreover it has a better improvement at the high advance ratio however for the stator it has no regularity as the tip clearance increasing both the rotor blade wake and tip clearance flow have a significant effect on the stator blade load the rotor revolution causes periodic rotor blade wake and tip clearance flow propagating to downstream that leads to fluctuations in the flow field the stator has better recycling of rotor blade wake but it has slightly effect on tip clearance flow so the dc component is weakened and the high frequency components are strengthened when pjp has a larger tip clearance size the increasing of tip clearance results in a high level of circumference velocity and radial velocity in pjp wake and causes the higher shrinking level of pjp wake the existence of tip clearance causes the leaking flow which has tremendous vorticity intensity with the impact of the rotor revolution two typical vortices of tip sweeping vortex and tip leakage vortex exist in tip clearance region and its downstream the tip sweeping vortex mainly exists in the tip region and it quickly slashed in the region between rotor and stator while the tip leakage vortex has a significant effect in stator domain and pjp wake the stator cuts off and stretches the tip leakage vortex and causes a radial bend after the stator cutting effect the tip leakage vortex propagates to pjp wake with discrete segments decreasing advance ratio or increasing tip clearance will enhance the vortices and it will show different results between tip sweeping vortex and tip leakage vortex acknowledgement this work is supported by the

22419,as humans accelerate the pace of marine development autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are increasingly attracting worldwide attention due to the limitations of carrying energy and battery technology auv s endurance is nonideal therefore designers usually make auvs more streamlined to reduce drag here we show that when a layer of porous material is attached to an auv s surface the auv s drag changes significantly in this paper simulations of the basic body of a remus100 and suboff submarine model were carried out under multiple conditions it is found that the drag increases as the porous viscosity coefficient or the thickness of the porous material increases when remus100 and suboff models are attached to the porous material with suitable porous viscosity coefficient their drag becomes smaller boundary layer theory is also used to explain and analyze the phenomenon of the proportional increase of viscous pressure drag when using porous material which is verified by vertical plate numerical simulations finally we tested the mechanical properties of porous nickel and aluminum alloy 6061 and found that the porous material does have an effect of drag reduction and can reduce the fluctuation range of the drag during the movement keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv porous material computational fluid dynamics cfd hydrodynamics 1 introduction the ocean area accounts for 70 8 of the total area of the earth in this vast and innocent ocean space there are abundant resources and energy in recent years in order to explore and develop the ocean a variety of underwater vehicles have been developed around the world including remote operated vehicles rovs autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and underwater glider vehicles ugvs these vehicles especially auvs are widely used in mine countermeasure operations hydrographic surveys harbor security operations environmental monitoring and scientific sampling mapping kirkwood 2008 nicholson and healey 2008 xu and li 2011 wang et al 2013 sahoo et al 2019 an auv sails autonomously and performs related tasks which can greatly reduce the work required of the operator however since the auv carries its own energy its endurance is one of the important indicators of its performance despite developments in battery energy technology in recent years no large breakthroughs have been achieved therefore endurance capability has always been an important factor that hinders the development of auv s table 1 contains the basic performance parameters of the world s best known auvs from table 1 we can see that an auv s endurance is usually about 10 30 h due to its small size and small carrying capacity small auvs generally have a cruising capability of around 10 h medium sized and large auvs can carry more energy and their endurance capacity is usually around 25 30 h this paper investigates middle velocity auvs driven by propellers not underwater glider vehicles some underwater glider vehicles can cruise for more than several months without charging in order to solve the problem of increasing the endurance of auvs researchers have also studied related technologies and equipment such as underwater docking technology and underwater base stations zhang et al 2017 pan et al 2008 li et al 2015 fukasawa et al 2003 however these technologies cannot improve their endurance at present designers streamline auvs to reduce its drag and increase its endurance morton 1950 song and li 1994 mitra et al 2019 an auv s drag is mainly composed of viscous pressure drag and frictional drag finnemore 2013 since the viscous pressure drag mainly depends on the shape of the object the viscous pressure drag is usually also called the shape drag which is the sum of the force components of all pressures acting on the surface of the object in the direction of motion the formula of an object s viscous pressure drag is shown in equation 1 myring 1976 where c p is the viscous pressure drag coefficient which depends on the object s shape and generally determined by the experiments ρ is the density of the fluid and s is the area projected in the direction of the normal along the moving object around the flow for an auv s is the wet surface area v is the auv s velocity 1 f p 1 2 c p ρ s v 2 frictional drag is the resultant force of the shear force acting on the surface of an object for the sake of convenience frictional drag is generally expressed in the same manner as in equation 2 2 f f 1 2 c f ρ b l v 2 where c f is the fluid dependent frictional drag coefficient l is the length of the object in the direction of fluid movement and b is the width in the transverse direction for irregular shapes b is roughly represented by the total surface area divided by l in recent years researchers have conducted in depth discussions and research on a wide variety of porous media materials and found multiple applications hahn et al 2002 simulated channel turbulence with porous walls and found that the porous medium weakened the turbulence intensity and the velocity pulsation and reynolds stress were also weakened resulting in a certain drag reduction effect zhang et al 2018 also studied the effects of flow drag and heat transfer in turbulent flow in porous wall channels the results show that porosity has a certain relationship with flow resistance chen et al 2019 analyzed the influence of porous seabed characteristics on wave forces acting on monopile and found that wave forces are related to the thickness and the porosity of each layer of porous seabed yuan and gu 2019 analyzed the aerodynamic drag reduction mechanism of automobile spoiler based on porous media and bionic design and found that the porous medium spoiler can improve the flow field of the bottom of the automobile head and solve the problem that the traditional spoiler has too large aerodynamic drag through related research and analysis it has been found that the addition of a porous material can change how a fluid flows next to an object s surface for medium and low speed auvs drag is mainly due to frictional drag therefore if using a porous material as the auv s outer layer can effectively reduce drag this translates to an increase in endurance in this paper remus100 and suboff submarine models are used as simulation objects and the surface of the pressure shells are replaced with a porous material for numerical simulation and analysis it was found that the drag changes significantly which has a certain relationship with the porous viscosity coefficients and the thickness of the porous material finally boundary layer theory was used to explain and analyze the phenomenon 2 simulation model and porous material an auv usually has a pressure shell or pressure capsule to provide a safe and reliable storage space for electronic equipment for small sized auvs such as the remus 100 all parts are placed in the pressure capsule however for medium and large scale auvs due to the large number of electronic devices electronic equipment is placed in different pressure capsules which are fixed to the frame in the case of the bluefin 21 a layer of buoyant material is used outside to keep the auv s shape in order to verify the accuracy of numerical simulation the body of a remus100 and suboff submarine model with real test data is used as the simulation object in this paper the remus remote environmental monitoring units series are autonomous underwater vehicles made by woods hole oceanographic institution and designed by their oceanographic systems lab osl moline and chang 2005 more recently remus vehicles have been manufactured by the spinoff company hydroid inc the series has been designed to be low cost and operable from a laptop computer suboff is a submarine model designed by the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa specifically for computational fluid dynamics research and the specific parameters of the suboff submarine model are given in groves and chang groves and chang 1989 the basic dimensions of a remus100 s body are shown in fig 1 which are 1333 mm in length and 191 mm in diameter the basic dimensions of the suboff submarine model body are shown in fig 2 with a length of 4356 mm and a diameter of 508 mm and c is the thickness of the porous media material on the surface of the model porous material is a solid material containing pores voids davis 2002 collins 1976 yang et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 the skeletal portion of the material is often called the matrix or frame the pores are typically filled with a fluid liquid or gas the skeletal material is usually a solid but structures like foams are often also usefully analyzed using concept of porous material the concept of porous materials is used in many areas of applied science and engineering filtration acoustics geomechanics soil mechanics construction engineering hydrogeology biology and biophysics and material science relative to continuous media materials porous materials generally have the advantages of low relative density high specific strength high specific surface area light weight sound insulation heat insulation and good permeability specifically porous materials generally have six characteristics and different porous materials have different permeability k and porous viscosity coefficient c2 and other characteristics 3 cfd simulations over the past decade due to the rapid increase in computer speed and capacity and the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd theory cfd technology has been increasingly used in the research of various types of hydrodynamic performance hu 2013 because cfd technology can obtain the hydrodynamic value of an underwater object quickly and at low cost flow details in the flow field can also be obtained compared with traditional model test methods and the semi theoretical semi empirical formula calculation method the cfd method has become effective means for the research of drag propulsion steering and wave resistance in the numerical simulation process the turbulence model needs to be selected which can be broadly classified as reynolds stress models large eddy simulations and direct numerical simulations pope 2000 panda et al 2018 launder et al 1975 among them the latter two methods can be regarded as direct numerical simulation methods due to the limitations of computing resources large eddy simulations and direct numerical simulations are rarely used in practical engineering and more numerical simulations are performed by solving the n s equations using reynolds stress models due to the unclosed nature of the n s equation the turbulence models are introduced in this paper the fluid numerical simulation software star ccm stoll and aviation 2015 and the k ɛ turbulence numerical model are used according to the experience of numerical simulation and verification this software and turbulence model are suitable for outfield flow widely used in the simulation process of the real project and the simulation accuracy also meets the engineering requirements jagadeesh et al 2009 in the following simulation process the domain is a cylindrical computational space with a size of ф3m 6 5 m for remus100 and ф4m 17 m for suboff model in the domain parameter settings the surface of the remus100 and suboff is set to a non slip condition the surface of the porous media material is set to an interface the front end of the domain is set as velocity inlet condition and the rear end is set as the pressure outlet condition and the outer surface of the cylindrical watershed is set as the slip surface condition note in star ccm there are two types of computational domains fluid domain and porous medium media in order to simulate the adhesion of a porous medium to the auv s surface the domain of the auv surface layer needs to be set as a porous medium and it is also necessary to set porous medium parameters such as a porous viscosity coefficient and a porosity the outer surface of the porous medium domain is set as the interface which is a type of boundary type used to connect different computing domains to ensure data transfer between two computing domains it should be emphasized that interface is the boundary of two separate areas and is the actual boundary in order to increase the accuracy of the simulation results grid independent verification is tested first when the number of cells is 288 807 for remus100 and 329 120 for suboff the meshing schematic diagram of the remus100 and suboff surfaces and their vicinity is shown in fig 4 in order to get more accurate results we performed a mesh refinement on local large curvature part and set an encryption zone at the rear of suboff model in addition drag simulations were performed on a remus100 and suboff body by comparing with the experimental data in the literature prestero 2001 ye 2013 the simulation results are shown in table 2 from table 2 we can see that the simulation error gradually decreases as the number of cells increases and when the number of cells is 288 807 for remus100 and 329 120 for suboff the simulation accuracy can be controlled within 2 and meet the engineering requirements indicating that the grid division numerical turbulence model and simulation parameters settings are reasonable while an increase in the number of cells would decrease simulation error simulation time would be greatly increased in order to improve the simulation efficiency while maintaining calculation accuracy we finally selected the above cells as the basis for simulation therefore in the following simulations the same meshing turbulence models and some simulation parameters are used for the remus100 and suboff models with porous media attached to the surface remus600 bluefin 21 qianlong 1 and so on have similar size and drainage volume as the suboff model stokey et al 2005 zeng et al 2015 wu et al 2014 and the surface of these auvs is made of buoyant material the thickness of the buoyant material is about 120 mm therefore 110 mm 120 mm 130 mm and 140 mm are selected when setting the suboff model porous material thickness the thickness of the porous material for remus 100 body is 35 mm 40 mm 45 mm and 50 mm respectively since the sailing velocity of remus100 and suboff is 1 54 m s and 3 045 m s respectively during the towing test in order to compare the simulation results with the test values their velocities during the simulations are set to be the same as the velocity of the towing test when the velocity is 1 54 m s the velocity contours and pressure contours of remus100 with and without different porous dielectric material are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively when the remus100 s surface is covered with the porous material a velocity gradient stratification occurs near the porous material when the porous viscosity coefficient is 100kg m3s the remus 100 with surface attached porous material has a smaller interference area with the fluid in the front and tail region however when the porous viscosity coefficient is 1000kg m3s the interference area with the fluid in the front and tail region is larger than that of remus100 without the porous material and with the increase of porous viscosity coefficient the influence area of remus100 on the fluid near the middle rear surface also increases and the area tends to move outward towards the front at the same time the interference area around the surface of the porous material of the first section will also increase and the area tends to move towards the rear it can also be seen from fig 6 that when the porous viscosity coefficient is 100kg m3s or 500kg m3s a remus100 with the surface attached porous material has a smaller interference area with the fluid in the front and rear regions and the pressure difference in the front and rear regions also decreases with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient the influence area of remus100 on the fluid near the front and rear surface also increases and the pressure difference of the fluid near the front and rear regions will gradually increase when the velocity is 3 045 m s the velocity contours and pressure contours of suboff model without and with different porous dielectric material are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively when porous material is attached to the suboff surface velocity gradient delamination appears near the porous material while the porous coefficient of viscosity increases similar to the remus100 velocity distribution as the porous viscosity coefficient increases the influence area of the suboff model on the fluid near the middle rear surface increases and this area also tends to move toward the front as can be seen from fig 8 similar to remus100 pressure distribution when the porous viscosity coefficient is 100 kg m3s the suboff of the surface attached porous material has a smaller interference area with the fluid in the front and rear regions and the pressure difference in the front and rear regions also decreases with the increase of porous viscosity coefficient the influence zone of suboff on the front and back fluid gradually increases similarly the low pressure area at the end of suboff model tends to move forward when the velocity is 1 54 m s and the porous material takes different thickness values the relationship between the remus100 body s drag and the porous viscosity coefficient is shown in fig 9 the drag of remus100 body increases with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient at the same velocity and thickness of the porous material from table 1 it can be seen that the test data of remus100 body s drag is approximately 3 39 n when the porous viscosity coefficient is approximately 830kg m3s the drag of remus100 body is relatively close to the test value when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 830kg m3s the drag will be smaller than the test value when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 830kg m3s the drag will be greater than the test value of course these are not absolutely accurate because the drag of remus100 body with porous material attached is also related to the thickness of the porous material when the porous viscosity coefficient is the same the drag also increases with the increase of the thickness of the porous material for example when the porous viscosity coefficient is approximately 800kg m3s and the thickness of the porous material is 35 mm the drag is about 3 n but when the thickness of the porous material is 50 mm the drag is about 3 5 n therefore the porous viscosity coefficient 830kg m3s is just a reference value in addition the smaller the porous viscosity coefficient the smaller the drag increases with the thickness of the porous material when the velocity is 3 045 m s and the thickness of the porous material varies the relationship between suboff model body s drag and the porous viscosity coefficient is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from fig 10 the change in the suboff model body s drag is similar to fig 9 that is the drag of suboff model body increases with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient at the same velocity and thickness of the porous material from table 1 the test data of suboff model body s drag is approximately 84 n when the porous viscosity coefficient is approximately 500 kg m3s the drag on the suboff model body with porous material attached is relatively close to the test value when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 500kg m3s the drag of suboff model body will be smaller than the test value when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 500kg m3s the drag of suboff model body will be greater than the test value in addition the drag on the suboff model body covered in porous material is also related to the thickness of the porous material which has the similar relationship between remus100 s drag and the thickness of the porous material remark when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 1000kg m3s remus100 body s drag still increases rapidly as the porous viscosity coefficient increases but the suboff model s drag increases slowly with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient in addition when the velocity is 1 54 m s and the thickness of the porous material is 35 mm the relationship between the total drag the viscous pressure drag and the frictional drag of remus100 s body with the porous viscosity coefficient is shown in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that the total drag and viscous pressure drag increase with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient which is consistent with fig 9 but the frictional drag decreases with the increasing porous viscosity coefficient in other words when the porous materials are used the proportion of frictional drag in the total drag is greatly reduced there are similar phenomena for other thicknesses of porous material thickness and the suboff model and the specific reasons will be explained in the next section 4 theory and principle analysis it can be seen from section 3 that when a porous medium with a suitable porous viscosity coefficient is attached to the surface of the underwater robot the auv s drag will be significantly reduced for remus100 when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 830 kg m3s the porous material will reduce remus100 s drag for remus100 when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 500 kg m3s the porous material will reduce suboff s drag in addition the drag of an underwater robot attached to the porous medium also has a certain relationship with the thickness of the porous medium drag will increase with the increase of the thickness of the porous material the following is an analysis of the principle of drag reduction of porous materials from the theory of fluid mechanics when the fluid flows around a large reynolds number the viscous force is much less than the inertial force at a large distance from the wall and can be ignored however in the thin layer near the solid wall the influence of the viscous force cannot be ignored there is a considerable velocity gradient in the normal direction of the wall surface and this thin layer is called the boundary layer the schematic diagram of the plate s boundary layer is shown in fig 12 we usually define δ as the thickness of the boundary layer in the boundary layer the distance from the surface of the plate the local velocity is zero to the position along the normal to the position where the velocity is equal to the local free flow velocity u usually equal to 0 99u or 0 995u schlichting et al 1968 the greater the reynolds number of the fluid the thinner the boundary layer and the large velocity gradient of the fluid in the boundary layer means that the viscous force has more influence on the flow while the velocity gradient is very small in the vast area outside the boundary layer the viscosity effect can be ignored and the flow can be regarded as an ideal fluid without rotation flow from the above analysis an auv s drag is mainly caused by frictional drag and viscous pressure drag frictional drag is the embodiment of fluid viscosity in fact the root cause of viscous pressure drag is also the viscosity of fluid taking flow around a cylinder as an example when the ideal fluid flows around a cylinder the pressure distribution on the cylinder surface is symmetrical and the viscous pressure drag is zero when the viscous fluid flows around the cylinder a boundary layer appears on the surface after the separation of the boundary layer a wake region appears behind the object the pressure in the wake region is lower and almost equal to the pressure at the separation point therefore the wake region is in the negative pressure zone this causes a significant pressure difference between the front and the back of the object which increases the object s drag and the larger the separation area the greater the viscous pressure drag therefore the low pressure wake vortex caused by the separation flow is the root cause of the viscous pressure drag and the formation of viscous pressure drag is also related to the boundary layer mo 2013 next starting from the derivation of the boundary layer equation the mechanism of the drag reduction and the increase in the proportion of viscous pressure drag after the application of porous media is explained below the velocity curve of the fluid passing through the surface of a flat object with or without the porous material is shown in fig 13 the wall thickness of the object with or without the porous material is t for the object with the surface attached porous material the actual solid thickness is t 1 and the thickness of the porous layer is t 2 because porous material has a certain permeability liquid can flow in the porous material assume that the velocity of the fluid in the porous medium is u 1 x and the velocity of fluid on the outer surface of porous media is u x as shown in fig 13 the fluid velocity will have a transition zone on the surface of the porous material the change in the liquid s velocity in the transition zone is u x u 1 x so that the boundary layer thickness and velocity gradient will be greatly reduced and the work done by the object on the surrounding fluid will be reduced known from the law of conservation of energy the object s drag is significantly reduced in the cartesian coordinate system the continuity and navier stokes ns equations for two dimensional steady state incompressible flow are given by marner et al 2017 dimitriou 2017 u x υ y 0 3 u u x υ u y x 1 ρ p x ν 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 u υ x υ υ y y 1 ρ p y ν 2 υ x 2 2 υ y 2 where u and υ are the velocity components ρ is the density x and y are the mass s forces p is the pressure and v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid considering that the incompressible fluid is used for the plane steady laminar flow the mass force has less influence on the flow so the equations after removing the mass force can be obtained from the two dimensional stationary ns equation as shown below u x υ y 0 4 u u x υ u y 1 ρ p x ν 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 u υ x υ υ y 1 ρ p y ν 2 υ x 2 2 υ y 2 4 1 quantitative analysis by using dimensional analysis we obtain 5 δ x u ρ u x 1 re x note the symbol indicates the same order of magnitude taking the length l of the object instead of the value of x in equation 5 then equation 5 becomes 6 δ l 1 re l where rel is called the reynolds number around the flow field according to prandtl s theory of boundary layer theory the reynolds number for this test is 105 106 so from the above equation 6 we concluded that the thickness δ of the boundary layer is relatively small for an object with a length of l which means its order of magnitude relative to the length l is very small we assume that the length of the models in the x direction is on the order of l 0 x l and the thickness of the boundary layer in the y direction on the order of 0 y ξ then x l δ ξ y ξ ξ l according to prandtl s boundary layer theory the range of fluid velocity u in the x direction is 0 u u we can therefore estimate that u and u are of the same order of magnitude then u u from the continuity equation u x υ y 0 we can get that the order of υ is υ ε u l the magnitude of other velocity derivatives can be derived from the determination of the magnitude of the geometric dimension and the specific results are shown in table 3 orders of magnitude of each term of equation 4 are given in equations 7 and 8 with the corresponding order of magnitude exhibited below each term 7 u x υ y 0 u l u l in equation 7 the two items are of the same magnitude and equally important so each item cannot be omitted 8 u u x υ u y 1 ρ p x ν 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 u 2 l u 2 l ξ 2 u 2 l 3 u 2 l since re u l v from equation 6 we can get the order of re re l 2 ξ 2 so v u ξ 2 l since ξ 2 u 2 l 3 u 2 l 3 u 2 l so ξ 2 u 2 l 3 is infinitely small and can be omitted the order of magnitude of both the viscosity term on the right and the inertia term on the left is u 2 l which means that the viscous force and the inertial force are equally important in the x direction and cannot be ignored 9 u υ x υ υ y 1 ρ p y ν 2 υ x 2 2 υ y 2 ξ u 2 l 2 ξ u 2 l 2 ξ 3 u 2 l 4 ξ u 2 l 2 in the above equation both the right viscous term and the left inertia term contain infinitesimal ξ so the forces at the left and right ends of the equation can be ignored as a small relative to the corresponding forces in equation 8 and the pressure term can be treated as a small quantity balance with other forces that is 10 p y 0 by analyzing and comparing the magnitudes of the above equations after omitting the infinitesimal term the equations can be simplified into the following form u x υ y 0 11 u u x υ u y 1 ρ p x ν 2 u y 2 p y 0 from the boundary conditions on the auv s surface u υ 0 so 12 u x 0 u y 0 and we can get 13 p x μ 2 u y 2 where μ ρ ν μ is the dynamic viscosity ν is the kinematic viscosity and ρ is the fluid density next remus100 is used as an example to explain the why the proportion of viscous pressure drag increases after using the porous material because most underwater robots have vertical or nearly vertical surfaces the principle is the same when remus100 s surface is not attached with the porous material and the flow hits the remus100 s front surface the velocity profile of the fluid is shown in fig 14 according to the bernoulli equation the pressure at point a is the highest qin and duan 2017 from the velocity curve of the fluid near point b it can be seen that the first derivative of the fluid velocity to y in the boundary layer is greater than 0 and the second derivative to y is less than zero that is u y 0 2 u y 2 0 put them into equation 5 and we can get p x 0 it shows that the pressure on the surface of the object gradually decreases from point a to all around when remus100 s surface is covered with porous material and the flow hits the remus100 s front surface the velocity profile of the fluid is shown in fig 15 much as in the case where non porous material is attached to remus100 s surface the pressure at point a is the highest as shown in fig 15 the fluid velocity will have a transition zone on the surface of the porous material it can be seen from the velocity curve of the fluid near point b that the first derivative of the fluid velocity is greater than 0 and the second derivative is greater than or equal to 0 in the transition zone that is u y 0 2 u y 2 0 put them into equation 5 and we can get p x 0 it shows that the pressure on remus100 s front surface will not decrease immediately from point a to all around instead it tends to stay the same or increase therefore the high pressure area of remus100 s front surface will increase resulting in a corresponding increase in the viscous pressure drag this is the reason why the proportion of the viscous pressure drag in the total drag will increase after porous material is applied in order to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis we performed a numerical simulation of the vertical plate the size of the vertical plate is 1 6 m 1 6 m x 0 1 m when the flow velocity is 1 54 m s the pressure distribution of the fluid near the surface area of the vertical plate with or without the porous material is shown in fig 16 no matter whether or not porous material is located on the surface of the vertical plate the maximum pressure point is at the center of the vertical plate s front face however for a vertical plate without porous material the pressure gradually decreases from the center of the front face to the periphery for the vertical plate with the porous material the pressure on the front face tends to expand outwards so the high pressure area of the vertical plate s front face increases accordingly this verifies the correctness of the above theoretical analysis 5 experiment in order to verify the drag reduction characteristics of the porous material we selected porous nickel and aluminum alloy 6061 as test objects to analyze their mechanical properties during motion the porous nickel has a specific gravity of 0 2 0 3 and a porosity of 98 aluminum alloy 6061 has medium strength good corrosion resistance weldability and good oxidation effect it is commonly used in the manufacture of pressure resistant shells for underwater robots their dimensions are 200 mm 300 mm 5 mm as shown in fig 17 the test was carried out in a sink of 1 2 m in length 0 6 m in width and 0 6 m in height a set of screw sliding tables is fixedly mounted on the upper surface of the sink and the six axis force torque transducer was connected to the sliding table and the test sample through the bracket as shown in fig 18 the sensor used in the test was gamma ip68 manufactured by ati industrial automation since the screw s lead was constant the different velocities of the slide can be achieved by controlling the motor s speed so that the drag of the porous nickel and the aluminum alloy at different velocities can be measured due to limited test conditions we only tested the mechanical properties of porous nickel and aluminum alloys at low velocities 0 05 m s and 0 1 m s next we will improve the test equipment and test them at higher velocity however by measuring the mechanical properties at low velocity the mechanical properties at higher velocity can be derived the drag curves of porous nickel and aluminum alloy at different velocities are shown in fig 19 the movement process can be divided into three stages the acceleration stage the constant speed stage and the deceleration stage we focus on the first two processes when the desired velocity is 0 1 m s the maximum drag of porous nickel in the acceleration stage is about 3 3 n and the maximum drag of aluminum alloy at this stage is about 7 n in the constant speed stage the average drag of porous nickel is about 1 n and the fluctuation range is 0 2 1 8 n the average drag of aluminum alloy at this stage is about 2 n and the fluctuation range is 0 2 4 2 n when the desired velocity is 0 05 m s the maximum drag of porous nickel in the acceleration stage is about 1 3 n and the maximum drag of aluminum alloy is about 2 n in the constant speed stage the average drag of porous nickel is about 0 25 n and the fluctuation range is 0 2 to 0 9 n the average drag of aluminum alloy at this stage is about 0 45 n and the fluctuation range is 0 8 to 1 5 n at the same velocity the maximum drag of porous nickel is about half of that of the aluminum alloy during the acceleration stage at the constant speed stage the average drag of porous nickel is also about half of that of the aluminum alloy in addition it can be seen that as the velocity increases the drag of both materials increases which is in line with the theoretical knowledge of fluid mechanics through tests we can see that the porous material does have the effect of drag reduction and will reduce the fluctuation range of the drag during the movement 6 conclusion through research and analysis we found that the addition of a porous material can change how a fluid flows next to an object s surface this means that the porous media material can change the fluid s motion characteristics near the surface of the object and the appropriate porous media material can effectively reduce its drag in this paper remus100 and suboff models were used as simulation objects to study the effects of porous materials with different porous viscosity coefficients and thicknesses on their hydrodynamic properties 1 the drag of remus100 and suboff models increased as the porous viscosity coefficient increases for remus100 a turning point occurred when the porous viscosity coefficient is 830 kg m3s when the porous viscosity coefficient was less than 830 kg m3s porous material reduced remus100 s drag when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 830 kg m3s the porous material will increase remus100 s drag instead for the suboff model it is a turning point when the porous viscosity coefficient is 500 kg m3s when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 500 kg m3s the porous material will reduce its drag when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 500 kg m3s the porous material will increase its drag instead 2 the drag of remus100 and suboff models also increases with the increase of the thickness of the porous material 3 when remus100 and suboff models are attached with the porous material with suitable porous viscosity coefficient their drag becomes smaller but the proportion of viscous pressure drag increases significantly from boundary layer theory the mechanism of the porous material reduces remus100 and suboff model s drag and increases the ratio of viscous pressure drag is analyzed in this paper and the simulation of the vertical plate validates the correctness of the analysis of increasing pressure viscous resistance ratio finally we selected porous nickel and aluminum alloy 6061 as test objects to analyze their mechanical properties during motion and we found that at the same velocity the average drag of the porous nickel in the constant speed stage and the maximum drag in the acceleration stage were about half of that of aluminum alloy this shows that the porous material does have the effect of drag reduction and can reduce the fluctuation range of the drag during the movement acknowledgments grateful acknowledgement is given to the financial supports from

22419,as humans accelerate the pace of marine development autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are increasingly attracting worldwide attention due to the limitations of carrying energy and battery technology auv s endurance is nonideal therefore designers usually make auvs more streamlined to reduce drag here we show that when a layer of porous material is attached to an auv s surface the auv s drag changes significantly in this paper simulations of the basic body of a remus100 and suboff submarine model were carried out under multiple conditions it is found that the drag increases as the porous viscosity coefficient or the thickness of the porous material increases when remus100 and suboff models are attached to the porous material with suitable porous viscosity coefficient their drag becomes smaller boundary layer theory is also used to explain and analyze the phenomenon of the proportional increase of viscous pressure drag when using porous material which is verified by vertical plate numerical simulations finally we tested the mechanical properties of porous nickel and aluminum alloy 6061 and found that the porous material does have an effect of drag reduction and can reduce the fluctuation range of the drag during the movement keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv porous material computational fluid dynamics cfd hydrodynamics 1 introduction the ocean area accounts for 70 8 of the total area of the earth in this vast and innocent ocean space there are abundant resources and energy in recent years in order to explore and develop the ocean a variety of underwater vehicles have been developed around the world including remote operated vehicles rovs autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and underwater glider vehicles ugvs these vehicles especially auvs are widely used in mine countermeasure operations hydrographic surveys harbor security operations environmental monitoring and scientific sampling mapping kirkwood 2008 nicholson and healey 2008 xu and li 2011 wang et al 2013 sahoo et al 2019 an auv sails autonomously and performs related tasks which can greatly reduce the work required of the operator however since the auv carries its own energy its endurance is one of the important indicators of its performance despite developments in battery energy technology in recent years no large breakthroughs have been achieved therefore endurance capability has always been an important factor that hinders the development of auv s table 1 contains the basic performance parameters of the world s best known auvs from table 1 we can see that an auv s endurance is usually about 10 30 h due to its small size and small carrying capacity small auvs generally have a cruising capability of around 10 h medium sized and large auvs can carry more energy and their endurance capacity is usually around 25 30 h this paper investigates middle velocity auvs driven by propellers not underwater glider vehicles some underwater glider vehicles can cruise for more than several months without charging in order to solve the problem of increasing the endurance of auvs researchers have also studied related technologies and equipment such as underwater docking technology and underwater base stations zhang et al 2017 pan et al 2008 li et al 2015 fukasawa et al 2003 however these technologies cannot improve their endurance at present designers streamline auvs to reduce its drag and increase its endurance morton 1950 song and li 1994 mitra et al 2019 an auv s drag is mainly composed of viscous pressure drag and frictional drag finnemore 2013 since the viscous pressure drag mainly depends on the shape of the object the viscous pressure drag is usually also called the shape drag which is the sum of the force components of all pressures acting on the surface of the object in the direction of motion the formula of an object s viscous pressure drag is shown in equation 1 myring 1976 where c p is the viscous pressure drag coefficient which depends on the object s shape and generally determined by the experiments ρ is the density of the fluid and s is the area projected in the direction of the normal along the moving object around the flow for an auv s is the wet surface area v is the auv s velocity 1 f p 1 2 c p ρ s v 2 frictional drag is the resultant force of the shear force acting on the surface of an object for the sake of convenience frictional drag is generally expressed in the same manner as in equation 2 2 f f 1 2 c f ρ b l v 2 where c f is the fluid dependent frictional drag coefficient l is the length of the object in the direction of fluid movement and b is the width in the transverse direction for irregular shapes b is roughly represented by the total surface area divided by l in recent years researchers have conducted in depth discussions and research on a wide variety of porous media materials and found multiple applications hahn et al 2002 simulated channel turbulence with porous walls and found that the porous medium weakened the turbulence intensity and the velocity pulsation and reynolds stress were also weakened resulting in a certain drag reduction effect zhang et al 2018 also studied the effects of flow drag and heat transfer in turbulent flow in porous wall channels the results show that porosity has a certain relationship with flow resistance chen et al 2019 analyzed the influence of porous seabed characteristics on wave forces acting on monopile and found that wave forces are related to the thickness and the porosity of each layer of porous seabed yuan and gu 2019 analyzed the aerodynamic drag reduction mechanism of automobile spoiler based on porous media and bionic design and found that the porous medium spoiler can improve the flow field of the bottom of the automobile head and solve the problem that the traditional spoiler has too large aerodynamic drag through related research and analysis it has been found that the addition of a porous material can change how a fluid flows next to an object s surface for medium and low speed auvs drag is mainly due to frictional drag therefore if using a porous material as the auv s outer layer can effectively reduce drag this translates to an increase in endurance in this paper remus100 and suboff submarine models are used as simulation objects and the surface of the pressure shells are replaced with a porous material for numerical simulation and analysis it was found that the drag changes significantly which has a certain relationship with the porous viscosity coefficients and the thickness of the porous material finally boundary layer theory was used to explain and analyze the phenomenon 2 simulation model and porous material an auv usually has a pressure shell or pressure capsule to provide a safe and reliable storage space for electronic equipment for small sized auvs such as the remus 100 all parts are placed in the pressure capsule however for medium and large scale auvs due to the large number of electronic devices electronic equipment is placed in different pressure capsules which are fixed to the frame in the case of the bluefin 21 a layer of buoyant material is used outside to keep the auv s shape in order to verify the accuracy of numerical simulation the body of a remus100 and suboff submarine model with real test data is used as the simulation object in this paper the remus remote environmental monitoring units series are autonomous underwater vehicles made by woods hole oceanographic institution and designed by their oceanographic systems lab osl moline and chang 2005 more recently remus vehicles have been manufactured by the spinoff company hydroid inc the series has been designed to be low cost and operable from a laptop computer suboff is a submarine model designed by the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa specifically for computational fluid dynamics research and the specific parameters of the suboff submarine model are given in groves and chang groves and chang 1989 the basic dimensions of a remus100 s body are shown in fig 1 which are 1333 mm in length and 191 mm in diameter the basic dimensions of the suboff submarine model body are shown in fig 2 with a length of 4356 mm and a diameter of 508 mm and c is the thickness of the porous media material on the surface of the model porous material is a solid material containing pores voids davis 2002 collins 1976 yang et al 2016 as shown in fig 3 the skeletal portion of the material is often called the matrix or frame the pores are typically filled with a fluid liquid or gas the skeletal material is usually a solid but structures like foams are often also usefully analyzed using concept of porous material the concept of porous materials is used in many areas of applied science and engineering filtration acoustics geomechanics soil mechanics construction engineering hydrogeology biology and biophysics and material science relative to continuous media materials porous materials generally have the advantages of low relative density high specific strength high specific surface area light weight sound insulation heat insulation and good permeability specifically porous materials generally have six characteristics and different porous materials have different permeability k and porous viscosity coefficient c2 and other characteristics 3 cfd simulations over the past decade due to the rapid increase in computer speed and capacity and the development of computational fluid dynamics cfd theory cfd technology has been increasingly used in the research of various types of hydrodynamic performance hu 2013 because cfd technology can obtain the hydrodynamic value of an underwater object quickly and at low cost flow details in the flow field can also be obtained compared with traditional model test methods and the semi theoretical semi empirical formula calculation method the cfd method has become effective means for the research of drag propulsion steering and wave resistance in the numerical simulation process the turbulence model needs to be selected which can be broadly classified as reynolds stress models large eddy simulations and direct numerical simulations pope 2000 panda et al 2018 launder et al 1975 among them the latter two methods can be regarded as direct numerical simulation methods due to the limitations of computing resources large eddy simulations and direct numerical simulations are rarely used in practical engineering and more numerical simulations are performed by solving the n s equations using reynolds stress models due to the unclosed nature of the n s equation the turbulence models are introduced in this paper the fluid numerical simulation software star ccm stoll and aviation 2015 and the k ɛ turbulence numerical model are used according to the experience of numerical simulation and verification this software and turbulence model are suitable for outfield flow widely used in the simulation process of the real project and the simulation accuracy also meets the engineering requirements jagadeesh et al 2009 in the following simulation process the domain is a cylindrical computational space with a size of ф3m 6 5 m for remus100 and ф4m 17 m for suboff model in the domain parameter settings the surface of the remus100 and suboff is set to a non slip condition the surface of the porous media material is set to an interface the front end of the domain is set as velocity inlet condition and the rear end is set as the pressure outlet condition and the outer surface of the cylindrical watershed is set as the slip surface condition note in star ccm there are two types of computational domains fluid domain and porous medium media in order to simulate the adhesion of a porous medium to the auv s surface the domain of the auv surface layer needs to be set as a porous medium and it is also necessary to set porous medium parameters such as a porous viscosity coefficient and a porosity the outer surface of the porous medium domain is set as the interface which is a type of boundary type used to connect different computing domains to ensure data transfer between two computing domains it should be emphasized that interface is the boundary of two separate areas and is the actual boundary in order to increase the accuracy of the simulation results grid independent verification is tested first when the number of cells is 288 807 for remus100 and 329 120 for suboff the meshing schematic diagram of the remus100 and suboff surfaces and their vicinity is shown in fig 4 in order to get more accurate results we performed a mesh refinement on local large curvature part and set an encryption zone at the rear of suboff model in addition drag simulations were performed on a remus100 and suboff body by comparing with the experimental data in the literature prestero 2001 ye 2013 the simulation results are shown in table 2 from table 2 we can see that the simulation error gradually decreases as the number of cells increases and when the number of cells is 288 807 for remus100 and 329 120 for suboff the simulation accuracy can be controlled within 2 and meet the engineering requirements indicating that the grid division numerical turbulence model and simulation parameters settings are reasonable while an increase in the number of cells would decrease simulation error simulation time would be greatly increased in order to improve the simulation efficiency while maintaining calculation accuracy we finally selected the above cells as the basis for simulation therefore in the following simulations the same meshing turbulence models and some simulation parameters are used for the remus100 and suboff models with porous media attached to the surface remus600 bluefin 21 qianlong 1 and so on have similar size and drainage volume as the suboff model stokey et al 2005 zeng et al 2015 wu et al 2014 and the surface of these auvs is made of buoyant material the thickness of the buoyant material is about 120 mm therefore 110 mm 120 mm 130 mm and 140 mm are selected when setting the suboff model porous material thickness the thickness of the porous material for remus 100 body is 35 mm 40 mm 45 mm and 50 mm respectively since the sailing velocity of remus100 and suboff is 1 54 m s and 3 045 m s respectively during the towing test in order to compare the simulation results with the test values their velocities during the simulations are set to be the same as the velocity of the towing test when the velocity is 1 54 m s the velocity contours and pressure contours of remus100 with and without different porous dielectric material are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively when the remus100 s surface is covered with the porous material a velocity gradient stratification occurs near the porous material when the porous viscosity coefficient is 100kg m3s the remus 100 with surface attached porous material has a smaller interference area with the fluid in the front and tail region however when the porous viscosity coefficient is 1000kg m3s the interference area with the fluid in the front and tail region is larger than that of remus100 without the porous material and with the increase of porous viscosity coefficient the influence area of remus100 on the fluid near the middle rear surface also increases and the area tends to move outward towards the front at the same time the interference area around the surface of the porous material of the first section will also increase and the area tends to move towards the rear it can also be seen from fig 6 that when the porous viscosity coefficient is 100kg m3s or 500kg m3s a remus100 with the surface attached porous material has a smaller interference area with the fluid in the front and rear regions and the pressure difference in the front and rear regions also decreases with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient the influence area of remus100 on the fluid near the front and rear surface also increases and the pressure difference of the fluid near the front and rear regions will gradually increase when the velocity is 3 045 m s the velocity contours and pressure contours of suboff model without and with different porous dielectric material are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively when porous material is attached to the suboff surface velocity gradient delamination appears near the porous material while the porous coefficient of viscosity increases similar to the remus100 velocity distribution as the porous viscosity coefficient increases the influence area of the suboff model on the fluid near the middle rear surface increases and this area also tends to move toward the front as can be seen from fig 8 similar to remus100 pressure distribution when the porous viscosity coefficient is 100 kg m3s the suboff of the surface attached porous material has a smaller interference area with the fluid in the front and rear regions and the pressure difference in the front and rear regions also decreases with the increase of porous viscosity coefficient the influence zone of suboff on the front and back fluid gradually increases similarly the low pressure area at the end of suboff model tends to move forward when the velocity is 1 54 m s and the porous material takes different thickness values the relationship between the remus100 body s drag and the porous viscosity coefficient is shown in fig 9 the drag of remus100 body increases with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient at the same velocity and thickness of the porous material from table 1 it can be seen that the test data of remus100 body s drag is approximately 3 39 n when the porous viscosity coefficient is approximately 830kg m3s the drag of remus100 body is relatively close to the test value when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 830kg m3s the drag will be smaller than the test value when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 830kg m3s the drag will be greater than the test value of course these are not absolutely accurate because the drag of remus100 body with porous material attached is also related to the thickness of the porous material when the porous viscosity coefficient is the same the drag also increases with the increase of the thickness of the porous material for example when the porous viscosity coefficient is approximately 800kg m3s and the thickness of the porous material is 35 mm the drag is about 3 n but when the thickness of the porous material is 50 mm the drag is about 3 5 n therefore the porous viscosity coefficient 830kg m3s is just a reference value in addition the smaller the porous viscosity coefficient the smaller the drag increases with the thickness of the porous material when the velocity is 3 045 m s and the thickness of the porous material varies the relationship between suboff model body s drag and the porous viscosity coefficient is shown in fig 10 as can be seen from fig 10 the change in the suboff model body s drag is similar to fig 9 that is the drag of suboff model body increases with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient at the same velocity and thickness of the porous material from table 1 the test data of suboff model body s drag is approximately 84 n when the porous viscosity coefficient is approximately 500 kg m3s the drag on the suboff model body with porous material attached is relatively close to the test value when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 500kg m3s the drag of suboff model body will be smaller than the test value when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 500kg m3s the drag of suboff model body will be greater than the test value in addition the drag on the suboff model body covered in porous material is also related to the thickness of the porous material which has the similar relationship between remus100 s drag and the thickness of the porous material remark when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 1000kg m3s remus100 body s drag still increases rapidly as the porous viscosity coefficient increases but the suboff model s drag increases slowly with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient in addition when the velocity is 1 54 m s and the thickness of the porous material is 35 mm the relationship between the total drag the viscous pressure drag and the frictional drag of remus100 s body with the porous viscosity coefficient is shown in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that the total drag and viscous pressure drag increase with the increase of the porous viscosity coefficient which is consistent with fig 9 but the frictional drag decreases with the increasing porous viscosity coefficient in other words when the porous materials are used the proportion of frictional drag in the total drag is greatly reduced there are similar phenomena for other thicknesses of porous material thickness and the suboff model and the specific reasons will be explained in the next section 4 theory and principle analysis it can be seen from section 3 that when a porous medium with a suitable porous viscosity coefficient is attached to the surface of the underwater robot the auv s drag will be significantly reduced for remus100 when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 830 kg m3s the porous material will reduce remus100 s drag for remus100 when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 500 kg m3s the porous material will reduce suboff s drag in addition the drag of an underwater robot attached to the porous medium also has a certain relationship with the thickness of the porous medium drag will increase with the increase of the thickness of the porous material the following is an analysis of the principle of drag reduction of porous materials from the theory of fluid mechanics when the fluid flows around a large reynolds number the viscous force is much less than the inertial force at a large distance from the wall and can be ignored however in the thin layer near the solid wall the influence of the viscous force cannot be ignored there is a considerable velocity gradient in the normal direction of the wall surface and this thin layer is called the boundary layer the schematic diagram of the plate s boundary layer is shown in fig 12 we usually define δ as the thickness of the boundary layer in the boundary layer the distance from the surface of the plate the local velocity is zero to the position along the normal to the position where the velocity is equal to the local free flow velocity u usually equal to 0 99u or 0 995u schlichting et al 1968 the greater the reynolds number of the fluid the thinner the boundary layer and the large velocity gradient of the fluid in the boundary layer means that the viscous force has more influence on the flow while the velocity gradient is very small in the vast area outside the boundary layer the viscosity effect can be ignored and the flow can be regarded as an ideal fluid without rotation flow from the above analysis an auv s drag is mainly caused by frictional drag and viscous pressure drag frictional drag is the embodiment of fluid viscosity in fact the root cause of viscous pressure drag is also the viscosity of fluid taking flow around a cylinder as an example when the ideal fluid flows around a cylinder the pressure distribution on the cylinder surface is symmetrical and the viscous pressure drag is zero when the viscous fluid flows around the cylinder a boundary layer appears on the surface after the separation of the boundary layer a wake region appears behind the object the pressure in the wake region is lower and almost equal to the pressure at the separation point therefore the wake region is in the negative pressure zone this causes a significant pressure difference between the front and the back of the object which increases the object s drag and the larger the separation area the greater the viscous pressure drag therefore the low pressure wake vortex caused by the separation flow is the root cause of the viscous pressure drag and the formation of viscous pressure drag is also related to the boundary layer mo 2013 next starting from the derivation of the boundary layer equation the mechanism of the drag reduction and the increase in the proportion of viscous pressure drag after the application of porous media is explained below the velocity curve of the fluid passing through the surface of a flat object with or without the porous material is shown in fig 13 the wall thickness of the object with or without the porous material is t for the object with the surface attached porous material the actual solid thickness is t 1 and the thickness of the porous layer is t 2 because porous material has a certain permeability liquid can flow in the porous material assume that the velocity of the fluid in the porous medium is u 1 x and the velocity of fluid on the outer surface of porous media is u x as shown in fig 13 the fluid velocity will have a transition zone on the surface of the porous material the change in the liquid s velocity in the transition zone is u x u 1 x so that the boundary layer thickness and velocity gradient will be greatly reduced and the work done by the object on the surrounding fluid will be reduced known from the law of conservation of energy the object s drag is significantly reduced in the cartesian coordinate system the continuity and navier stokes ns equations for two dimensional steady state incompressible flow are given by marner et al 2017 dimitriou 2017 u x υ y 0 3 u u x υ u y x 1 ρ p x ν 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 u υ x υ υ y y 1 ρ p y ν 2 υ x 2 2 υ y 2 where u and υ are the velocity components ρ is the density x and y are the mass s forces p is the pressure and v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid considering that the incompressible fluid is used for the plane steady laminar flow the mass force has less influence on the flow so the equations after removing the mass force can be obtained from the two dimensional stationary ns equation as shown below u x υ y 0 4 u u x υ u y 1 ρ p x ν 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 u υ x υ υ y 1 ρ

instead of the value of x in equation 5 then equation 5 becomes 6 δ l 1 re l where rel is called the reynolds number around the flow field according to prandtl s theory of boundary layer theory the reynolds number for this test is 105 106 so from the above equation 6 we concluded that the thickness δ of the boundary layer is relatively small for an object with a length of l which means its order of magnitude relative to the length l is very small we assume that the length of the models in the x direction is on the order of l 0 x l and the thickness of the boundary layer in the y direction on the order of 0 y ξ then x l δ ξ y ξ ξ l according to prandtl s boundary layer theory the range of fluid velocity u in the x direction is 0 u u we can therefore estimate that u and u are of the same order of magnitude then u u from the continuity equation u x υ y 0 we can get that the order of υ is υ ε u l the magnitude of other velocity derivatives can be derived from the determination of the magnitude of the geometric dimension and the specific results are shown in table 3 orders of magnitude of each term of equation 4 are given in equations 7 and 8 with the corresponding order of

the order of magnitude of both the viscosity term on the right and the inertia term on the left is u 2 l which means that the viscous force and the inertial force are equally important in the x direction and cannot be ignored 9 u υ x υ υ y 1 ρ p y ν 2 υ x 2 2 υ y 2 ξ u 2 l 2 ξ u 2 l 2 ξ 3 u 2 l 4 ξ u 2 l 2 in the above equation both the right viscous term and the left inertia term contain infinitesimal ξ so the forces at the left and right ends of the equation can be ignored as a small relative to the corresponding forces in equation 8 and the pressure term can be treated as a small quantity balance with other forces that is 10 p y 0 by analyzing and comparing the magnitudes of the above equations after omitting the infinitesimal term the equations can be simplified into the following form u x υ y 0 11 u u x υ u y 1 ρ p x ν 2 u y 2 p y 0 from the boundary conditions on the auv s surface u υ 0 so 12 u x 0 u y 0 and we can get 13 p x μ 2 u y 2 where μ ρ ν μ is the dynamic viscosity ν is the kinematic viscosity and ρ is the fluid density next remus100 is used as an example to explain the why the proportion of viscous pressure drag increases after using the porous material because most underwater robots have vertical or nearly vertical surfaces the principle is the same when remus100 s surface is not attached with the porous material and the flow hits the remus100 s front surface the velocity profile of the fluid is shown in fig 14 according to the bernoulli equation the pressure at point a is the highest qin and duan 2017 from the velocity curve of the fluid near point b it can be seen that the first derivative of the fluid velocity to y in the boundary layer is greater than 0 and the second derivative to y is less than zero that is u y 0 2 u y 2 0 put them into equation 5 and we can get p x 0 it shows that the pressure on the surface of the object gradually decreases from point a to all around when remus100 s surface is covered with porous material and the flow hits the remus100 s front surface the velocity profile of the fluid is shown in fig 15 much as in the case where non porous material is attached to remus100 s surface the pressure at point a is the highest as shown in fig 15 the fluid velocity will have a transition zone on the surface of the porous material it can be seen from the velocity curve of the fluid near point b that the first derivative of the fluid velocity is greater than 0 and the second derivative is greater than or equal to 0 in the transition zone that is u y 0 2 u y 2 0 put them into equation 5 and we can get p x 0 it shows that the pressure on remus100 s front surface will not decrease immediately from point a to all around instead it tends to stay the same or increase therefore the high pressure area of remus100 s front surface will increase resulting in a corresponding increase in the viscous pressure drag this is the reason why the proportion of the viscous pressure drag in the total drag will increase after porous material is applied in order to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis we performed a numerical simulation of the vertical plate the size of the vertical plate is 1 6 m 1 6 m x 0 1 m when the flow velocity is 1 54 m s the pressure distribution of the fluid near the surface area of the vertical plate with or without the porous material is shown in fig 16 no matter whether or not porous material is located on the surface of the vertical plate the maximum pressure point is at the center of the vertical plate s front face however for a vertical plate without porous material the pressure gradually decreases from the center of the front face to the periphery for the vertical plate with the porous material the pressure on the front face tends to expand outwards so the high pressure area of the vertical plate s front face increases accordingly this verifies the correctness of the above theoretical analysis 5 experiment in order to verify the drag reduction characteristics of the porous material we selected porous nickel and aluminum alloy 6061 as test objects to analyze their mechanical properties during motion the porous nickel has a specific gravity of 0 2 0 3 and a porosity of 98 aluminum alloy 6061 has medium strength good corrosion resistance weldability and good oxidation effect it is commonly used in the manufacture of pressure resistant shells for underwater robots their dimensions are 200 mm 300 mm 5 mm as shown in fig 17 the test was carried out in a sink of 1 2 m in length 0 6 m in width and 0 6 m in height a set of screw sliding tables is fixedly mounted on the upper surface of the sink and the six axis force torque transducer was connected to the sliding table and the test sample through the bracket as shown in fig 18 the sensor used in the test was gamma ip68 manufactured by ati industrial automation since the screw s lead was constant the different velocities of the slide can be achieved by controlling the motor s speed so that the drag of the porous nickel and the aluminum alloy at different velocities can be measured due to limited test conditions we only tested the mechanical properties of porous nickel and aluminum alloys at low velocities 0 05 m s and 0 1 m s next we will improve the test equipment and test them at higher velocity however by measuring the mechanical properties at low velocity the mechanical properties at higher velocity can be derived the drag curves of porous nickel and aluminum alloy at different velocities are shown in fig 19 the movement process can be divided into three stages the acceleration stage the constant speed stage and the deceleration stage we focus on the first two processes when the desired velocity is 0 1 m s the maximum drag of porous nickel in the acceleration stage is about 3 3 n and the maximum drag of aluminum alloy at this stage is about 7 n in the constant speed stage the average drag of porous nickel is about 1 n and the fluctuation range is 0 2 1 8 n the average drag of aluminum alloy at this stage is about 2 n and the fluctuation range is 0 2 4 2 n when the desired velocity is 0 05 m s the maximum drag of porous nickel in the acceleration stage is about 1 3 n and the maximum drag of aluminum alloy is about 2 n in the constant speed stage the average drag of porous nickel is about 0 25 n and the fluctuation range is 0 2 to 0 9 n the average drag of aluminum alloy at this stage is about 0 45 n and the fluctuation range is 0 8 to 1 5 n at the same velocity the maximum drag of porous nickel is about half of that of the aluminum alloy during the acceleration stage at the constant speed stage the average drag of porous nickel is also about half of that of the aluminum alloy in addition it can be seen that as the velocity increases the drag of both materials increases which is in line with the theoretical knowledge of fluid mechanics through tests we can see that the porous material does have the effect of drag reduction and will reduce the fluctuation range of the drag during the movement 6 conclusion through research and analysis we found that the addition of a porous material can change how a fluid flows next to an object s surface this means that the porous media material can change the fluid s motion characteristics near the surface of the object and the appropriate porous media material can effectively reduce its drag in this paper remus100 and suboff models were used as simulation objects to study the effects of porous materials with different porous viscosity coefficients and thicknesses on their hydrodynamic properties 1 the drag of remus100 and suboff models increased as the porous viscosity coefficient increases for remus100 a turning point occurred when the porous viscosity coefficient is 830 kg m3s when the porous viscosity coefficient was less than 830 kg m3s porous material reduced remus100 s drag when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 830 kg m3s the porous material will increase remus100 s drag instead for the suboff model it is a turning point when the porous viscosity coefficient is 500 kg m3s when the porous viscosity coefficient is less than 500 kg m3s the porous material will reduce its drag when the porous viscosity coefficient is greater than 500 kg m3s the porous material will increase its drag instead 2 the drag of remus100 and suboff models also increases with the increase of the thickness of the porous material 3 when remus100 and suboff models are attached with the porous material with suitable porous viscosity coefficient their drag becomes smaller but the proportion of viscous pressure drag increases significantly from boundary layer theory the mechanism of the porous material reduces remus100 and suboff model s drag and increases the ratio of viscous pressure drag is analyzed in this paper and the simulation of the vertical plate validates the correctness of the analysis of increasing pressure viscous resistance ratio finally we selected porous nickel and aluminum alloy 6061 as test objects to analyze their mechanical properties during motion and we found that at the same velocity the average drag of the porous nickel in the constant speed stage and the maximum drag in the acceleration stage were about half of that of aluminum alloy this shows that the porous material does have the effect of drag reduction and can reduce the fluctuation range of the drag during the movement acknowledgments grateful acknowledgement is given to the financial supports from
