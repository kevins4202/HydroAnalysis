10390,storm generated surface runoff is responsible for significant portions of the contaminants exported from grazed pastures that contribute to water quality impairment in inland and coastal waters detainment bunds dbs were investigated as a novel strategy to mitigate the losses of nutrients and sediment in surface runoff from pastures in the lake rotorua catchment in new zealand a db is a 1 5 2 m high earthen stormwater retention structure constructed on productive pastures in the flow path of targeted ephemeral streams the current db design protocol recommends a minimum pond volume of 120 m3 per hectare of contributing catchment bunds are capable of temporarily ponding up to 10 000 m3 of surface runoff which can be rapidly drained by opening an outlet valve this 12 month study of 2 db sites with 55 ha and 20 ha subcatchments in the lake rotorua catchment found that dbs effectively decreased annual discharge volumes by 31 and 43 decreased runoff discharges were the result of increased soil infiltration facilitated by increased stormwater residence times on well drained soils in the ponding area furthermore discharges from the dbs occurring after runoff generation in the catchment had ceased were likely to infiltrate the soils downstream of the dbs combining the in pond and downstream infiltration the dbs prevented 43 and 63 of the annual runoff generated in the targeted catchments from reaching downstream surface waters the results of this study demonstrate that dbs constructed on sufficiently permeable soils reduce surface runoff volumes from pastures and are thereby capable of decreasing contaminant loads delivered to receiving surface waters as such dbs are likely to be an effective strategy to add to the nutrient mitigation toolbox in the lake rotorua catchment and in other pastoral locations where contaminants mobilised by surface runoff contribute to water quality degradation keywords stormflow diffuse pollution soil infiltration nutrient loss mitigation pastoral agriculture water quality 1 introduction storm generated surface runoff drives contaminant losses from pastoral catchments that cause water quality degradation in receiving waters areas where precipitation patterns are variable with very wet winters and dry summers interspersed with large storms contribute to hydrological conditions that create challenges for nutrient management and loss mitigation mcdowell et al 2013 wetter soils often have a greater potential for surface runoff than drier soils mcdowell et al 2004 although hydrophobicity in very dry soils may contribute to high rates of surface runoff mcdowell and sharpley 2002 furthermore climate change is projected to cause more dramatic hydrological conditions that result in greater runoff and associated nutrient losses from agricultural areas ministry for the envrironment 2019 ockenden et al 2016 in temperate areas processes in headwaters dominate the response of surface water catchments to rainfall ockenden et al 2016 headwaters including ephemeral streams are estimated to contribute 70 of the mean annual water volume to second order streams and 55 of higher order rivers alexander et al 2007 headwater sub catchments have been found to be responsible for the majority of the streamflow and hydrochemical responses to storms in a stream network bieroza et al 2018 a range of mitigation strategies have been developed to target different hydrological pathways to address sediment and nutrient losses from pastures mcdowell et al 2013 edge of field mitigation strategies that increase stormflow residence time have been found to decrease surface runoff flows and facilitate sediment deposition by decreasing the kinetic energy of flowing water mckergow et al 2007 since nutrient loads transported by runoff are the product of the volume of runoff and the concentration of contaminants mitigation strategies that decrease runoff volumes are likely to mitigate associated nutrient losses gburek and sharpley 1998 while soil infiltration in the flow pathway of surface runoff has been found to reduce contaminant loads the impacts of specific mitigation strategies on surface runoff volumes have rarely been reported mckergow et al 2007 common edge of field mitigation strategies that address surface runoff include riparian buffer strips and stormwater detention areas sdas such as sedimentation ponds and constructed wetlands stormwater detention areas are commonly used for flood protection but are increasingly being used for water quality improvement in agricultural and urban settings shukla et al 2017 stanley 1996 agricultural sda is a collective term used for natural or manmade depressions ponds and reservoirs shukla et al 2017 due to the nonuniformity in location and design and the varying approaches used to investigate their mitigation performance studies on sdas are often not directly applicable to one another however the processes for contaminant retention and treatment for the varying sda applications are similar such as soil infiltration sedimentation plant uptake soil adsorption and microbial uptake shukla et al 2017 detainment bunds form sdas by impeding stormflow and increasing surface runoff residence times with earthen stormwater retention structures that form temporary ponds fig 1 detainment bunds dbs were developed in the lake rotorua catchment in new zealand starting in 2010 to address phosphorus p losses from pastoral agriculture clarke 2013 a design feature that sets dbs apart from other stormwater detention structures is the incorporation of an upstand riser that is connected to an outlet pipe that passes through the bund and discharges ponded runoff on the downstream side of the db fig 1 the upstand riser is a 1 m diameter vertical pipe reaching to 20 cm below the lowest point of the db installed near the bund at the low point of the ponding area ponded water is discharged from the outlet pipe if the pond height exceeds that of the riser during large runoff events that overwhelm the pond storage capacity and discharge rates from the upstand riser water may also be discharged via an emergency spillway at the lowest point of the bund the surface of the emergency spillway is protected by either a mat material compacted substrate or stable grass cover an outlet valve connected to the upstand riser at ground level is able to be unplugged to rapidly drain the pond although ryegrass based pastures in new zealand have some tolerance to saturated soil conditions early adopters of the db strategy restrict the inundation period to a maximum of 3 days to reduce the risk of pasture damage in the ponding area paterson and clarke 2013 in the lake rotorua catchment dbs may be approximately 1 5 2 m high and 20 80 m long and are constructed on pastures across the flow path of targeted low order ephemeral streams a db can be purpose built or constructed by modifying an existing structure such as a raised raceway that divides a paddock the local db site selection and design protocol promotes a minimum ratio of 120 m3 pond volume capacity per 1 ha of contributing catchment area and a 10 000 m3 maximum pond volume due to local regulatory requirements paterson and clarke 2013 because of design and regulatory limitations some landscapes such as steep hill country with incised valley floors and flat flood plains are not appropriate for db locations due to their topography paterson 2019 developing a thorough understanding of the effect the db strategy has on surface runoff hydrology is essential due to the critical role hydrological factors play in determining the impacts of agriculture on water quality a preliminary study of 3 non consecutive ponding events at a single db site in the lake rotorua catchment reported that discharge volumes were 30 67 lower than event inflow volumes levine et al 2019 while the previous study serves as a proof of concept there is currently no definitive research quantifying the impact of the db strategy on surface runoff volumes discharged from pastoral landscapes the main objective of this present study was to measure the effect of dbs on annual surface runoff volumes at 2 sites in the lake rotorua catchment we also aimed to identify factors that influence the hydraulic performance of dbs due to the prevalence of well drained soils in pastures in the catchment which could allow for significant infiltration we hypothesised that increasing surface runoff residence time by impeding stormflow will facilitate soil infiltration during the ponding period and decrease runoff volumes discharged from the catchment if dbs are capable of decreasing the volume of surface runoff leaving pastures by facilitating soil infiltration particularly during large storm events we expect that the strategy would also decrease nutrient and sediment loads delivered to surface waters downstream of the db catchment the effect of the db strategy on nutrient and sediment loads were investigated in concurrent studies investigating the same runoff events as this present study levine et al in prep a b and c due to the importance of hydrology on contaminant losses from pastures contributing to water quality degradation the results of this present study could offer insight into whether dbs could be an effective nutrient mitigation strategy in the lake rotorua catchment and other areas where dbs could be located 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description lake rotorua in the north island of new zealand is culturally recognised

required to achieve nutrient load reduction targets mcdowell 2010 two db sites located on pastoral dairy farms in the north western portion of the lake rotorua catchment were monitored during this 12 month study fig 2 a digital elevation model derived from lidar data 2 m resolution was used to identify appropriate locations to construct the dbs measure catchment and pond areas and determine pond slopes site selection criteria for this study stipulated that a single main ephemeral stream delivered runoff to the db ponding area in a manner that allowed for accurate measurement of inflow volumes the two dbs varied in catchment size but had similar pond storage volume to catchment size ratios table 1 2 2 soil characteristics the 2 db study catchments were in the mamaku region of the lake rotorua catchment which has relatively coarse textured volcanic tephra soils landcare research 2017 the mamaku ignimbrite soils found in this region were deposited 220 230 thousand years ago during the formation of the rotorua caldera milner et al 2003 at the hauraki site soils in the ponding area are in the oropi series which is classified as vitric hapludand in the usa soil classification and buried allophanic orthic pumice in the new zealand soil classification these soils have a dark brown loamy sand topsoil which overlays a dark yellow brownish sandy loam on a layer of yellow brown silt

have been measured on these soil types rijkse and guinto 2010 2 3 equipment and monitoring field monitoring was conducted from 1 december 2017 to 30 november 2018 rainfall was measured at each site using unidata willetton western australia 6506b tipping bucket 0 5 mm rain gauges pond heights were continuously measured with envco auckland new zealand pt12 pressure transducers installed near the base of the upstand riser flowmeters unidata 6527 starflow qsd which were fitted to pipes at both dbs were used to measure inflows and discharges with the exception of inflow measurements at the hauraki site where a 160 v notch weir and float counterweight for height measurement was deployed inflow i e upstream monitoring occurred at elevations high enough to avoid inundation by the pond rainfall pond height and flow rates were collected at 5 minute intervals and stored using serial digital interface communications linked to telemetered unidata neon 2013 f 3 g external memory metering module data loggers standard quality controls were followed for calibration and maintenance of the monitoring equipment niwa 2004 additional historical rainfall data was collected from the bay of plenty regional council s climate monitoring site at oturoa road 550 m above sea level 3 km away from the awahou site and 7 km from the hauraki site fig 2 bay of plenty regional council 2018 these data were used to calculate the average seasonal rainfall pattern over the 10 years prior to the study soil moisture content for the hauraki site was measured at 5 minute intervals on a paddock 650 m from the bund using a soil moisture probe model aos220a 20 aovictech beijing china inserted 15 cm into the soil at 45 soil moisture data for the awahou site was obtained from bay of plenty regional council s monitoring site at oturoa road fig 2 where soil moisture content was measured at 15 min intervals in the top 25 cm of soil using an aquaflex christchurch new zealand si 99 soil moisture and temperature sensor bay of plenty regional council 2018 the soil moisture data was used to calculate the average soil moisture content in the 24 h period prior to each runoff event deasy et al 2009 evaporation data was calculated using the penman method and climate data measured 17 km from the study sites 38 146 s 176 258 e niwa 2019 the maximum evaporation rate over any 72 h period was 7 2 mm d during this 12 month study period niwa 2019 when applying this maximal evaporation rate to the ponding periods 1 of the annual inflow evaporated from the ponds at both sites because the maximum evaporation rates took place during the warmest driest times of the year and typical ponding events took place during periods with low evaporation rates i e rainy periods and winter the data suggests that evaporation from the ponds was negligible and therefore was not considered in calculating water lost from the pond during the study 2 4 event types event types were differentiated according to the mode s which ponded water was discharged from the db overflow events occurred during larger runoff events when inflow continued to be delivered to the pond after the pond height exceeded the height of the upstand riser fig 1 generating overflow discharge after 3 days of ponding any residual ponded water was evacuated when the outlet valve was opened creating release discharge therefore overflow events had both overflow discharge and release discharge components fig 3 in contrast non overflow events were smaller storms that did not contribute enough runoff to overtop the riser non overflow events included events which at the end of the 3 day treatment period either had a portion of ponded runoff to discharge by opening the outlet valve or had no runoff to discharge due to leakage and infiltration into the soil throughout all ponding events leak discharge from an intractable leak at the connection point of the outlet pipe and the base of the upstand riser generated a constant measured flow of 2 4 m3 h at both sites attempts at sealing this leak during the study period were unsuccessful 2 5 runoff data analysis inflow and discharge volumes were calculated by multiplying the measured flow rate by the time elapsed between flow measurements harmel et al 2003 event inflow volumes were corrected on a pro rata basis increases of 15 at the hauraki site 9 at awahou to account for the small catchment area between the inflow monitoring point i e upstream and the db table 1 all volume measurements including inflow infiltration and discharges are expressed as yields mm i e volume per unit of contributing catchment area the percentage of rainfall occurring as inflow was calculated by dividing the total rainfall measured onsite with a rain gauge by the inflow yield overflow discharge from the upstand riser release discharge which occurred during overflow events and some non overflow events and leak discharge throughout ponding during all events were measured at the outlet pipe fig 1 for all events apart from those with emergency spillway discharge the infiltration volume was determined by subtracting the measured leak volume and upstand riser overflow and release volumes if applicable from the event inflow event infiltration rates mm h were calculated by dividing the infiltration yield mm by the duration of event ponding the emergency spillway was breached during the 2 large runoff overflow events that occurred at both sites since both the spillway discharge and soil infiltration were unmeasured the event average soil infiltration rates were calculated for each of the overflow events to determine the volume discharged over the spillway for each respective event during these events whenever the water level was below the spillway height it was possible to calculate the infiltration rate using inflow and discharge volumes measured by the flowmeters and the change in ponded water volume these calculations were performed on an hourly time step the change in the volume of water in the pond was calculated from pond height data which were used to determine the inundated ponding area the average pond inundation area during each time step was the mean value of the area inundated by ponded water calculated at five minute intervals using measurements of pond heights and the slope of the ponding area the slope of the ponding area was determined using lidar data and gis software that calculated the ponding area at various elevations the equation used to find the slope of the pond was integrated to determine the pond volume at various pond heights measured at the lowest point of the pond the calculated infiltration rate was applied to the period during the breach of the spillway thus enabling a calculation of the entire event infiltration volume the spillway volume was then determined by subtracting the measured leak riser overflow and release volumes and calculated infiltration volumes from the event inflow during the overflow event at the awahou site on 28th april 2018 surface runoff bypassed the inflow monitoring station due to flows overwhelming and flanking the inlet pipe the missforest package stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 was used to run a random forest model 1000 times using r version 3 6 r development core team 2019 to estimate the inflow volume during this event the model utilised the following data from both sites for each ponding event to determine the inflow volume of this event average soil moisture content in the 24 hours prior to inflow delivered to the db duration of rainfall total rainfall average rainfall intensity duration of rainfall intensity greater than 6 and 12 mm h maximum rainfall intensity and the runoff volume delivered to the db the minimum and maximum 95 confidence interval values of the predicted values were within 92 of the mean value used as the volume for the event 2 6 in field soil infiltration measurement soil infiltration rates were collected in the field at the 2 sites using 40 cm diameter stainless steel rings charged with water approximately 50 mm high on 16th september 2019 seven replicate rings were used to measure the infiltration rates near the upstand riser in the lowest portion of the ponding area as well as outside of the ponding area upstream of the db 3 results annual rainfall in the monitor year was 2 162 mm at the hauraki site and 2 098 mm at the awahou site annual rainfall at the sites were very similar to the 10 year average of 2 197 mm y 1 measured at a nearby climate monitoring station bay of plenty regional council 2018 fig 2 however the seasonal rainfall distribution during this study varied slightly from the 10 year seasonal averages fig 4 although local rainfall can vary substantially between lake sub catchments abell et al 2013 both sites showed similar rainfall patterns during the study year the summer of the study year had the greatest seasonal rainfall total at both sites which was different to the 10 year average pattern fig 4 the total annual inflow yield at the hauraki site was 167 mm 91 801 m3 compared to 114 mm 22 404 m3 at the awahou site fig 5 these measurements show that only a small fraction of the annual rainfall generated significant surface runoff 8 at the hauraki site and 5 at the awahou site seasonal inflow yields and the percentage of rainfall occurring as runoff were greatest in winter at both sites fig 4 the major difference in the seasonal runoff patterns between the two sites during the study period was the greater proportion of autumn rainfall delivered as runoff to the hauraki site 11 compared to the awahou site 5 storm generated surface runoff resulted in 18 ponding events at the hauraki site and 19 ponding events at the awahou site however not all of the measured inflow contributed to measurable ponding events on occasion inflow yields were relatively small and presumably the soil was sufficiently dry to accommodate this inflow without generating measurable ponding and the entire inflow was considered to infiltrate the soil ponding events occurred most prevalently during the winter months 50 of the events at both sites compared to the other seasons table 2 two large overflow events occurred at both sites during the same storm events fig 5 the total annual discharge yield from the hauraki db was 116 mm 62 969 m3 and 65 mm 12 807 m3 from the awahou db the 50 mm difference occurring between annual inflows and discharges at both sites were attributed to soil infiltration occurring in the ponding area leak discharges accounted for 5 6 mm 3 221 m3 of the total annual discharge from the hauraki site and 26 17 mm 3 267 m3 at the awahou site calculated infiltration rates ranged from 5 to 24 mm h at the hauraki site and from 3 to 16 mm h at the awahou site fig 6 the calculated mean event infiltration rates were 13 mm hr and 9 mm hr at the hauraki and awahou sites respectively a seasonal trend was observed for the calculated infiltration rates with the lower rates tending to occur during colder periods in the late winter and early spring at both db sites field measured infiltration rates collected adjacent to the upstand riser in the lowest portion of the ponding area fell within the range of calculated event infiltration rates table 3 interestingly the mean measured infiltration rates outside the ponding area exceeded those measured inside the ponding area and the calculated event maximum infiltration rates for both sites fig 6 table 3 the mean calculated event infiltration rate and mean field measured rates inside the ponding area were greater at the hauraki site than the awahou site while measured infiltration rates outside the ponding area were very similar between the 2 sites two large overflow events occurred during the study period in which overflow discharge was generated when the pond height exceeded the height of the riser and then the emergency spillway at each site fig 1 table 2 the combined inflow yield of these two overflow events was 114 mm 62 938 m3 at the hauraki site and 54 mm 10 571 m3 at the awahou site which accounted for 69 and 47 of the total annual inflow at the sites respectively the combined overflow discharge yields riser overflow and spillway discharges combined at the hauraki site was 92 mm 50 579 m3 at the hauraki site and 37 mm 7 367 m3 at the awahou site which accounted for 80 and 58 of the total annual discharge from the db infiltration yields during overflow events were 16 mm 8 650 m3 at the hauraki site and 12 mm 2 335 m3 at the awahou site i e 14 and 22 of the overflow event inflow yields at each site respectively the fate of the water discharged from the dbs must be considered none of the overflow discharge riser overflow and spillway discharges combined was likely to infiltrate the soil downstream of the dbs since runoff was still being generated in the catchments during this discharge furthermore any leak discharge generated while runoff was being generated in the catchment was also likely to have reached downstream surface waters in contrast discharges including leakage after runoff from the catchment had ceased and the release discharge generated when the pond outlet valve was opened after the prescribed 3 day period were expected to infiltrate the dried soil downstream of the db before reaching a downstream surface water at the hauraki site 21 mm 11 622 m3 or 18 of the annual discharge yield was expected to infiltrate the soil downstream of the bund and 23 mm 4 603 m3 or 36 was expected for the awahou site the combined infiltration occurring during the ponding period and downstream of the bund prevented 73 mm 40 324 m3 of surface runoff from reaching downstream surface waters at the hauraki site and 72 mm 14 118 m3 at the awahou site the total surface runoff prevented from reaching downstream surface waters equated to 43 of the inflow at the hauraki site and 63 at the awahou site fig 7 4 discussion the major finding of this study was that the dbs prevented 43 and 63 of the inflow runoff from reaching surface waters downstream of the hauraki and awahou sites respectively the results of this study show for the first time that in a typical year in the lake rotorua catchment dbs can substantially decrease surface runoff volumes by impeding stormflow and facilitating soil infiltration by increasing residence time on sufficiently permeable soils soil infiltration occurs during the ponding period typically 3 days and when water that is discharged from the db infiltrates dried soil downstream of the bund related studies of other stormwater mitigation strategies have found that mitigation strategies that are capable of decreasing surface runoff volumes also reduce nutrient loads transported by surface runoff harper et al 1999 mckergow et al 2007 the results of this present study measuring db inflow and outflow runoff volumes were used in concurrent studies to calculate the impact of the strategy on sediments and nutrient loads being transported by surface runoff the concurrent studies found that the db strategy decreased the annual loads of suspended sediments total p and total n reaching lake rotorua from the hauraki site by 51 47 and 57 respectively and by 59 68 and 72 from awahou unpublished data the findings that the awahou site facilitated greater soil infiltration in this present study and prevented greater contaminant loads from reaching downstream of the db catchments in concurrent studies highlights the important role hydrology plays in nutrient losses and mitigation strategy efficacy the results of this current study and unpublished concurrent studies which found that dbs are able to reduce the quantity of surface runoff and its associated contaminants suggest that soil infiltration is a feature of the mitigation strategy however in some cases infiltration may result in groundwater quality issues where dissolved nutrients are not readily sorbed and groundwater resources are sensitive to nutrient inputs in the case of the catchments in this current study the soils in the lake rotorua catchment generally have high anion storage capacities ascs and high cation exchange capacities cecs and have the ability to sorb dissolved p and ammonium that infiltrate the soil morgenstern et al 2015 reddy and delaune 2008 nitrate leaching into the groundwater however is prevalent in the lake rotorua catchment due to fertiliser applications and the presence of livestock depositing concentrated patches of urine onto well drained pasture soils morgenstern et al 2015 still a survey by gordon 2002 found that 81 of the 295 groundwater samples were less than half of the nitrate n drinking water guideline values new zealand ministry of health 2000 furthermore a concurrent study to this present study found that only 10 of the estimated annual total n losses from pastures were transported in surface runoff unpublished data therefore utilising dbs is highly unlikely to contribute in a significant way to the nitrate contamination groundwater in the study catchment given differences between the study site geomorphologies varying management factors and localised differences in storm rainfall intensity and duration most of the results reported in this study for the two sites are reasonably consistent the differences in annual inflow yields and the percentage of rainfall as runoff between sites with 167 mm delivered 8 of rainfall to the hauraki db and 114 mm delivered 5 of rainfall to the awahou db are at least partially explained by the greater total rainfall occurring during the large overflow events at the hauraki site during the two overflow events which occurred on the same dates at the sites 423 mm of rainfall occurred resulting in 114 mm of inflow at the hauraki site compared to 369 mm of rainfall resulting in 54 mm of inflow at the awahou site the 56 mm difference in rainfall contributed to the 60 mm difference in inflow yields during the overflow events and the 53 mm difference in annual inflow yields between the sites the proportion of annual inflows delivered during the large overflow events was 69 at the hauraki site and 47 at the awahou site which is consistent with other studies that found rare high magnitude storm events contribute the majority of annual runoff and associated sediment and nutrient loads delivered to streams in the lake rotorua catchment abell et al 2013 dare 2018 the overflow events at the 2 sites were also responsible for the differences in the proportion of the annual inflow yields undergoing soil infiltration before reaching downstream surface waters due to the larger storm events and greater inflows at the hauraki site 67 of the inflow yield went over the upstand riser and spillway as overflow discharge at the hauraki site compared to 47 at the awahou site these overflow discharges accounted for 80 of total annual discharge at the hauraki site and 58 at the awahou site since it was assumed that infiltration did not occur downstream of the db while runoff was still being delivered to the pond all of the overflow discharge is likely to have reached downstream waterways this highlights the importance of locating and constructing dbs to maximise the pond volume catchment ratio in order to minimise overflow discharges still the dbs prevented 19 and 29 of the overflow event inflow from reaching downstream waterways from the hauraki and awahou sites respectively the results showing that a smaller portion of the inflow yield escaped as overflow discharge from the awahou db compared to the hauraki db despite the similar ratios for pond volume to catchment area suggest that the potential magnitude and intensity of large storm events and subsequent runoff are important to consider when sizing a bund these results also suggest that the size of very large storm events have implications for the effectiveness of dbs as a mitigation tool to address sediments and nutrients transported in surface runoff since greater contaminant loads have been found to be transported from pastures during large runoff events in new zealand cooke and dons 1988 smith and monaghan 2003 and the lake rotorua catchment specifically abell et al 2013 dare 2018 the relative importance of the size of pond storage versus the infiltration rate in the ponded area is clearly illustrated in fig 3 where the overflow discharge is seen to be much greater than soil infiltration these results suggest that the currently suggested minimum 120 m3 pond capacity to 1 ha contributing catchment ratio could be increased in order to avoid excess overflow discharge and increase the potential for ponded and released water to infiltrate the soil however it is important to consider the costs and benefits of the db strategy before revising the protocol since such measures could significantly limit the relatively small number of viable db locations in the lake rotorua catchment 300 dbs with 120 m3 1 ha ratios paterson 2019 and restrict the potential benefits of their implementation multiple factors could be responsible for the seasonal trend observed between soil infiltration rates being lower during colder months including sediments clogging soil pores stocking rates and timing and the potential for macropores to develop during the warmer drier seasons the influence water temperature on viscosity could also contribute to lower soil infiltration rates in the winter months the viscosity of water decreases by 41 when decreasing temperature from 25 to 5 c korson et al 1969 which is roughly the range of temperatures observed in the ponded water at the db sites during this study the influence of seasonal and diurnal temperature changes on infiltration rates have been observed in studies investigating stormwater management emerson and traver 2008 jaynes 1990 because infiltration rates affect db discharge volumes the influence of temperature on infiltration rates should be considered when developing db design protocols and when developing models used to estimate db performance this is particularly important in climates where the majority of annual runoff occurs in winter when soil infiltration rates are likely to be the slowest due to greater water viscosity there was good agreement between the calculated event infiltration rates and field measured infiltration rates table 3 both of these rates were considerably smaller than the 72 mm h value reported by rijkse and guinto 2010 and likely reflects the effect of treading damage under intensive dairying on infiltration rates mcdowell et al 2003 the decline in infiltration rates in the lower portion of the ponding area compared to rates outside of the ponding area might also be due to increased treading damage in the lower lying and wetter ponding areas curran cournane et al 2010 or perhaps the large volumes of water that pond and infiltrate the soil cause deterioration in soil structure furthermore given that the dbs in this current study have been operating for 6 years and that during the course of this 12 month study a concurrent study found that 789 kg and 1 280 kg of sediments were deposited at the hauraki and awahou ponding areas respectively unpublished data deposited sediments may have formed a less permeable layer on top of existing soils and or be clogging soil pores soil pore clogging by sediments has been observed in studies investigating the effects of sedimentation on soil infiltration rates rice 1974 and soil filter permeability reddi et al 2000 this theory is further supported by the greater decrease in the infiltration rates in the awahou ponding area where greater quantities of sediments were deposited in a smaller ponding area the results of this current study suggest dbs may facilitate greater infiltration during the first few years after construction however infiltration rates may decline over time therefore the effect of repetitive ponding on the long term ability of dbs to decrease surface runoff volumes should be the subject of future research to further inform the development of db design protocols and performance models strategies to remediate soil infiltration rates in the ponding area should also be investigated this study identified factors that will vary spatially and temporarily which affected the proportion of runoff infiltrating the soil before reaching surface waters downstream of dbs including precipitation patterns particularly the magnitude of overflow events soil permeability and changes to infiltration rates due to sedimentation and repetitive ponding and the catchment size pond volume ratio this study should be expanded to collect longer term data from more db locations to investigate ways to maximise the proportion of surface runoff infiltrating soils since decreasing runoff discharges contribute to lower contaminant discharges lastly the results from this current study and future studies should be used to develop models that estimate runoff and contaminant yields delivered to and treated by dbs in specific locations based on hydrologic and landscape conditions the development of these models will help decision makers determine the applicability of dbs as a stormwater mitigation strategy in their catchments 5 conclusion this 12 month study found that 2 detainment bunds prevented 43 at the hauraki site and 63 at the awahou site of the annual surface runoff from reaching surface waters downstream of targeted pastoral areas in the lake rotorua catchment the detainment bunds effectively decreased surface runoff volumes by impeding stormflow which increased runoff residence time and facilitated soil infiltration during the ponding phase and when the ponded runoff was released onto what was dried soils downstream of the detainment bunds by decreasing surface runoff discharges and associated contaminant loads the detainment bund strategy should be considered a viable nutrient mitigation strategy in places where stormflows contribute to water quality degradation and soils are sufficiently permeable the magnitude of surface runoff generated during rare high magnitude storm events soil infiltration rates and the detainment bunds pond volume to catchment size ratios are important factors determining the ability of detainment bunds to decrease surface runoff in order to optimise detainment bunds performance it is necessary to maximize the pond volume to catchment size ratio so as to be able to handle the larger storm events that are responsible for significant runoff and nutrient loads in the lake rotorua catchment this study found infiltration rates in the ponding area declined due to repetitive ponding over the

10390,storm generated surface runoff is responsible for significant portions of the contaminants exported from grazed pastures that contribute to water quality impairment in inland and coastal waters detainment bunds dbs were investigated as a novel strategy to mitigate the losses of nutrients and sediment in surface runoff from pastures in the lake rotorua catchment in new zealand a db is a 1 5 2 m high earthen stormwater retention structure constructed on productive pastures in the flow path of targeted ephemeral streams the current db design protocol recommends a minimum pond volume of 120 m3 per hectare of contributing catchment bunds are capable of temporarily ponding up to 10 000 m3 of surface runoff which can be rapidly drained by opening an outlet valve this 12 month study of 2 db sites with 55 ha and 20 ha subcatchments in the lake rotorua catchment found that dbs effectively decreased annual discharge volumes by 31 and 43 decreased runoff discharges were the result of increased soil infiltration facilitated by increased stormwater residence times on well drained soils in the ponding area furthermore discharges from the dbs occurring after runoff generation in the catchment had ceased were likely to infiltrate the soils downstream of the dbs combining the in pond and downstream infiltration the dbs prevented 43 and 63 of the annual runoff generated in the targeted catchments from reaching downstream surface waters the results of this study demonstrate that dbs constructed on sufficiently permeable soils reduce surface runoff volumes from pastures and are thereby capable of decreasing contaminant loads delivered to receiving surface waters as such dbs are likely to be an effective strategy to add to the nutrient mitigation toolbox in the lake rotorua catchment and in other pastoral locations where contaminants mobilised by surface runoff contribute to water quality degradation keywords stormflow diffuse pollution soil infiltration nutrient loss mitigation pastoral agriculture water quality 1 introduction storm generated surface runoff drives contaminant losses from pastoral catchments that cause water quality degradation in receiving waters areas where precipitation patterns are variable with very wet winters and dry summers interspersed with large storms contribute to hydrological conditions that create challenges for nutrient management and loss mitigation mcdowell et al 2013 wetter soils often have a greater potential for surface runoff than drier soils mcdowell et al 2004 although hydrophobicity in very dry soils may contribute to high rates of surface runoff mcdowell and sharpley 2002 furthermore climate change is projected to cause more dramatic hydrological conditions that result in greater runoff and associated nutrient losses from agricultural areas ministry for the envrironment 2019 ockenden et al 2016 in temperate areas processes in headwaters dominate the response of surface water catchments to rainfall ockenden et al 2016 headwaters including ephemeral streams are estimated to contribute 70 of the mean annual water volume to second order streams and 55 of higher order rivers alexander et al 2007 headwater sub catchments have been found to be responsible for the majority of the streamflow and hydrochemical responses to storms in a stream network bieroza et al 2018 a range of mitigation strategies have been developed to target different hydrological pathways to address sediment and nutrient losses from pastures mcdowell et al 2013 edge of field mitigation strategies that increase stormflow residence time have been found to decrease surface runoff flows and facilitate sediment deposition by decreasing the kinetic energy of flowing water mckergow et al 2007 since nutrient loads transported by runoff are the product of the volume of runoff and the concentration of contaminants mitigation strategies that decrease runoff volumes are likely to mitigate associated nutrient losses gburek and sharpley 1998 while soil infiltration in the flow pathway of surface runoff has been found to reduce contaminant loads the impacts of specific mitigation strategies on surface runoff volumes have rarely been reported mckergow et al 2007 common edge of field mitigation strategies that address surface runoff include riparian buffer strips and stormwater detention areas sdas such as sedimentation ponds and constructed wetlands stormwater detention areas are commonly used for flood protection but are increasingly being used for water quality improvement in agricultural and urban settings shukla et al 2017 stanley 1996 agricultural sda is a collective term used for natural or manmade depressions ponds and reservoirs shukla et al 2017 due to the nonuniformity in location and design and the varying approaches used to investigate their mitigation performance studies on sdas are often not directly applicable to one another however the processes for contaminant retention and treatment for the varying sda applications are similar such as soil infiltration sedimentation plant uptake soil adsorption and microbial uptake shukla et al 2017 detainment bunds form sdas by impeding stormflow and increasing surface runoff residence times with earthen stormwater retention structures that form temporary ponds fig 1 detainment bunds dbs were developed in the lake rotorua catchment in new zealand starting in 2010 to address phosphorus p losses from pastoral agriculture clarke 2013 a design feature that sets dbs apart from other stormwater detention structures is the incorporation of an upstand riser that is connected to an outlet pipe that passes through the bund and discharges ponded runoff on the downstream side of the db fig 1 the upstand riser is a 1 m diameter vertical pipe reaching to 20 cm below the lowest point of the db installed near the bund at the low point of the ponding area ponded water is discharged from the outlet pipe if the pond height exceeds that of the riser during large runoff events that overwhelm the pond storage capacity and discharge rates from the upstand riser water may also be discharged via an emergency spillway at the lowest point of the bund the surface of the emergency spillway is protected by either a mat material compacted substrate or stable grass cover an outlet valve connected to the upstand riser at ground level is able to be unplugged to rapidly drain the pond although ryegrass based pastures in new zealand have some tolerance to saturated soil conditions early adopters of the db strategy restrict the inundation period to a maximum of 3 days to reduce the risk of pasture damage in the ponding area paterson and clarke 2013 in the lake rotorua catchment dbs may be approximately 1 5 2 m high and 20 80 m long and are constructed on pastures across the flow path of targeted low order ephemeral streams a db can be purpose built or constructed by modifying an existing structure such as a raised raceway that divides a paddock the local db site selection and design protocol promotes a minimum ratio of 120 m3 pond volume capacity per 1 ha of contributing catchment area and a 10 000 m3 maximum pond volume due to local regulatory requirements paterson and clarke 2013 because of design and regulatory limitations some landscapes such as steep hill country with incised valley floors and flat flood plains are not appropriate for db locations due to their topography paterson 2019 developing a thorough understanding of the effect the db strategy has on surface runoff hydrology is essential due to the critical role hydrological factors play in determining the impacts of agriculture on water quality a preliminary study of 3 non consecutive ponding events at a single db site in the lake rotorua catchment reported that discharge volumes were 30 67 lower than event inflow volumes levine et al 2019 while the previous study serves as a proof of concept there is currently no definitive research quantifying the impact of the db strategy on surface runoff volumes discharged from pastoral landscapes the main objective of this present study was to measure the effect of dbs on annual surface runoff volumes at 2 sites in the lake rotorua catchment we also aimed to identify factors that influence the hydraulic performance of dbs due to the prevalence of well drained soils in pastures in the catchment which could allow for significant infiltration we hypothesised that increasing surface runoff residence time by impeding stormflow will facilitate soil infiltration during the ponding period and decrease runoff volumes discharged from the catchment if dbs are capable of decreasing the volume of surface runoff leaving pastures by facilitating soil infiltration particularly during large storm events we expect that the strategy would also decrease nutrient and sediment loads delivered to surface waters downstream of the db catchment the effect of the db strategy on nutrient and sediment loads were investigated in concurrent studies investigating the same runoff events as this present study levine et al in prep a b and c due to the importance of hydrology on contaminant losses from pastures contributing to water quality degradation the results of this present study could offer insight into whether dbs could be an effective nutrient mitigation strategy in the lake rotorua catchment and other areas where dbs could be located 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description lake rotorua in the north island of new zealand is culturally recognised

month study fig 2 a digital elevation model derived from lidar data 2 m resolution was used to identify appropriate locations to construct the dbs measure catchment and pond areas and determine pond slopes site selection criteria for this study stipulated that a single main ephemeral stream delivered runoff to the db ponding area in a manner that allowed for accurate measurement of inflow volumes the two dbs varied in catchment size but had similar pond storage volume to catchment size ratios table 1 2 2 soil characteristics the 2 db study catchments were in the mamaku region of the lake

the formation of the rotorua caldera milner et al 2003 at the hauraki site soils in the ponding area are in the oropi series which is classified as vitric hapludand in the usa soil classification and

have been measured on these soil types rijkse and guinto 2010 2 3 equipment and monitoring field monitoring was conducted from 1 december 2017 to 30 november 2018 rainfall was measured at each site using unidata willetton western australia 6506b tipping bucket 0 5 mm rain gauges pond heights were continuously measured with envco auckland new zealand pt12 pressure transducers installed near the base of the upstand riser flowmeters unidata 6527 starflow qsd which were fitted to pipes at both dbs were used to measure inflows and discharges with the exception of inflow measurements at the hauraki site where a 160 v notch weir and float counterweight for height measurement was deployed inflow i e upstream monitoring occurred at elevations high enough to avoid inundation by the pond rainfall pond height and flow rates were collected at 5 minute intervals and stored using serial digital interface communications linked to telemetered unidata neon 2013 f 3 g external memory metering module data loggers standard quality controls were followed for calibration and maintenance of the monitoring equipment niwa 2004 additional historical rainfall data was collected from the bay of plenty regional council s climate monitoring site at oturoa road 550 m above sea level 3 km away from the awahou site and 7 km from the hauraki site fig 2 bay of plenty regional council 2018 these data were used to calculate the average seasonal rainfall pattern over the 10 years prior to the study soil moisture content for the hauraki site was measured at 5 minute intervals on a paddock 650 m from the bund using a soil moisture probe model aos220a 20 aovictech beijing china inserted 15 cm into the soil at 45 soil moisture data for the awahou site was obtained from bay of plenty regional council s monitoring site at oturoa road fig 2 where soil moisture content was measured at 15 min intervals in the top 25 cm of soil using an aquaflex christchurch new zealand si 99 soil moisture and temperature sensor bay of plenty regional council 2018 the soil moisture data was used to calculate the average soil moisture content in the 24 h period prior to each runoff event deasy et al 2009 evaporation data was calculated using the penman method and climate data measured 17 km from the study sites 38 146 s 176 258 e niwa 2019 the maximum evaporation rate over any 72 h period was 7 2 mm d during this 12 month study period niwa 2019 when applying this maximal evaporation rate to the ponding periods 1 of the annual inflow evaporated from the ponds at both sites because the maximum evaporation rates took place during the warmest driest times of the year and typical ponding events took place during periods with low evaporation rates i e rainy periods and winter the data suggests that evaporation from the ponds was negligible and therefore was not considered in calculating water lost from the pond during the study 2 4 event types event types were differentiated according to the mode s which ponded water was discharged from the db overflow events occurred during larger runoff events when inflow continued to be delivered to the pond after the pond height exceeded the height of the upstand riser fig 1 generating overflow discharge after 3 days of ponding any residual ponded water was evacuated when the outlet valve was opened creating release discharge therefore overflow events had both overflow discharge and release discharge components fig 3 in contrast non overflow events were smaller storms that did not contribute enough runoff to overtop the riser non overflow events included events which at the end of the 3 day treatment period either had a portion of ponded runoff to discharge by opening the outlet valve or had no runoff to discharge due to leakage and infiltration into the soil throughout all ponding events leak discharge from an intractable leak at the connection point of the outlet pipe and the base of the upstand riser generated a constant measured flow of 2 4 m3 h at both sites attempts at sealing this leak during the study period were unsuccessful 2 5 runoff data analysis inflow and discharge volumes were calculated by multiplying the measured flow rate by the time elapsed between flow measurements harmel et al 2003 event inflow volumes were corrected on a pro rata basis increases of 15 at the hauraki site 9 at awahou to account for the small catchment area between the inflow monitoring point i e upstream and the db table 1 all volume measurements including inflow infiltration and discharges are expressed as yields mm i e volume per unit of contributing catchment area the percentage of rainfall occurring as inflow was calculated by dividing the total rainfall measured onsite with a rain gauge by the inflow yield overflow discharge from the upstand riser release discharge which occurred during overflow events and some non overflow events and leak discharge throughout ponding during all events were measured at the outlet pipe fig 1 for all events apart from those with emergency spillway discharge the infiltration volume was determined by subtracting the measured leak volume and upstand riser overflow and release volumes if applicable from the event inflow event infiltration rates mm h were calculated by dividing the infiltration yield mm by the duration of event ponding the emergency spillway was breached during the 2 large runoff overflow events that occurred at both sites since both the spillway discharge and soil infiltration were unmeasured the event average soil infiltration rates were calculated for each of the overflow events to determine the volume discharged over the spillway for each respective event during these events whenever the water level was below the spillway height it was possible to calculate the infiltration rate using inflow and discharge volumes measured by the flowmeters and the change in ponded water volume these calculations were performed on an hourly time step the change in the volume of water in the pond was calculated from pond height data which were used to determine the inundated ponding area the average pond inundation area during each time step was the mean value of the area inundated by ponded water calculated at five minute intervals using measurements of pond heights and the slope of the ponding area the slope of the ponding area was determined using lidar data and gis software that calculated the ponding area at various elevations the equation used to find the slope of the pond was integrated to determine the pond volume at various pond heights measured at the lowest point of the pond the calculated infiltration rate was applied to the period during the breach of the spillway thus enabling a calculation of the entire event infiltration volume the spillway volume was then determined by subtracting the measured leak riser overflow and release volumes and calculated infiltration volumes from the event inflow during the overflow event at the awahou site on 28th april 2018 surface runoff bypassed the inflow monitoring station due to flows overwhelming and flanking the inlet pipe the missforest package stekhoven and bühlmann 2012 was used to run a random forest model 1000 times using r version 3 6 r development core team 2019 to estimate the inflow volume during this event the model utilised the following data from both sites for each ponding event to determine the inflow volume of this event average soil moisture content in the 24 hours prior to inflow delivered to the db duration of rainfall total rainfall average rainfall intensity duration of rainfall intensity greater than 6 and 12 mm h maximum rainfall intensity and the runoff volume delivered to the db the minimum and maximum 95 confidence interval values of the predicted values were within 92 of the mean value used as the volume for the event 2 6 in field soil infiltration measurement soil infiltration rates were collected in the field at the 2 sites using 40 cm diameter stainless steel rings charged with water approximately 50 mm high on 16th september 2019 seven replicate rings were used to measure the infiltration rates near the upstand riser in the lowest portion of the ponding area as well as outside of the ponding area upstream of the db 3 results annual rainfall in the monitor year was 2 162 mm at the hauraki site and 2 098 mm at the awahou site annual rainfall at the sites were very similar to the 10 year average of 2 197 mm y 1 measured at a nearby climate monitoring station bay of plenty regional council 2018 fig 2 however the seasonal rainfall distribution during this study varied slightly from the 10 year seasonal averages fig 4 although local rainfall can vary substantially between lake sub catchments abell et al 2013 both sites showed similar rainfall patterns during the study year the summer of the study year had the greatest seasonal rainfall total at both sites which was different to the 10 year average pattern fig 4 the total annual inflow yield at the hauraki site was 167 mm 91 801 m3 compared to 114 mm 22 404 m3 at the awahou site fig 5 these measurements show that only a small fraction of the annual rainfall generated significant surface runoff 8 at the hauraki site and 5 at the awahou site seasonal inflow yields and the percentage of rainfall occurring as runoff were greatest in winter at both sites fig 4 the major difference in the seasonal runoff patterns between the two sites during the study period was the greater proportion of autumn rainfall delivered as runoff to the hauraki site 11 compared to the awahou site 5 storm generated surface runoff resulted in 18 ponding events at the hauraki site and 19 ponding events at the awahou site however not all of the measured inflow contributed to measurable ponding events on occasion inflow yields were relatively small and presumably the soil was sufficiently dry to accommodate this inflow without generating measurable ponding and the entire inflow was considered to infiltrate the soil ponding events occurred most prevalently during the winter months 50 of the events at both sites compared to the other seasons table 2 two large overflow events occurred at both sites during the same storm events fig 5 the total annual discharge yield from the hauraki db was 116 mm 62 969 m3 and 65 mm 12 807 m3 from the awahou db the 50 mm difference occurring between annual inflows and discharges at both sites were attributed to soil infiltration occurring in the ponding area leak discharges accounted for 5 6 mm 3 221 m3 of the total annual discharge from the hauraki site and 26 17 mm 3 267 m3 at the awahou site calculated infiltration rates ranged from 5 to 24 mm h at the hauraki site and from 3 to 16 mm h at the awahou site fig 6 the calculated mean event infiltration rates were 13 mm hr and 9 mm hr at the hauraki and awahou sites respectively a seasonal trend was observed for the calculated infiltration rates with the lower rates tending to occur during colder periods in the late winter and early spring at both db sites field measured infiltration rates collected adjacent to the upstand riser in the lowest portion of the ponding area fell within the range of calculated event infiltration rates table 3 interestingly the mean measured infiltration rates outside the ponding area exceeded those measured inside the ponding area and the calculated event maximum infiltration rates for both sites fig 6 table 3 the mean calculated event infiltration rate and mean field measured rates inside the ponding area were greater at the hauraki site than the awahou site while measured infiltration rates outside the ponding area were very similar between the 2 sites two large overflow events occurred during the study period in which overflow discharge was generated when the pond height exceeded the height of the riser and then the emergency spillway at each site fig 1 table 2 the combined inflow yield of these two overflow events was 114 mm 62 938 m3 at the hauraki site and 54 mm 10 571 m3 at the awahou site which accounted for 69 and 47 of the total annual inflow at the sites respectively the combined overflow discharge yields riser overflow and spillway discharges combined at the hauraki site was 92 mm 50 579 m3 at the hauraki site and 37 mm 7 367 m3 at the awahou site which accounted for 80 and 58 of the total annual discharge from the db infiltration yields during overflow events were 16 mm 8 650 m3 at the hauraki site and 12 mm 2 335 m3 at the awahou site i e 14 and 22 of the overflow event inflow yields at each site respectively the fate of the water discharged from the dbs must be considered none of the overflow discharge riser overflow and spillway discharges combined was likely to infiltrate the soil downstream of the dbs since runoff was still being generated in the catchments during this discharge furthermore any leak discharge generated while runoff was being generated in the catchment was also likely to have reached downstream surface waters in contrast discharges including leakage after runoff from the catchment had ceased and the release discharge generated when the pond outlet valve was opened after the prescribed 3 day period were expected to infiltrate the dried soil downstream of the db before reaching a downstream surface water at the hauraki site 21 mm 11 622 m3 or 18 of the annual discharge yield was expected to infiltrate the soil downstream of the bund and 23 mm 4 603 m3 or 36 was expected for the awahou site the combined infiltration occurring during the ponding period and downstream of the bund prevented 73 mm 40 324 m3 of surface runoff from reaching downstream surface waters at the hauraki site and 72 mm 14 118 m3 at the awahou site the total surface runoff prevented from reaching downstream surface waters equated to 43 of the inflow at the hauraki site and 63 at the awahou site fig 7 4 discussion the major finding of this study was that the dbs prevented 43 and 63 of the inflow runoff from reaching surface waters downstream of the hauraki and awahou sites respectively the results of this study show for the first time that in a typical year in the lake rotorua catchment dbs can substantially decrease surface runoff volumes by impeding stormflow and facilitating soil infiltration by increasing residence time on sufficiently permeable soils soil infiltration occurs during the ponding period typically 3 days and when water that is discharged from the db infiltrates dried soil downstream of the bund related studies of other stormwater mitigation strategies have found that mitigation strategies that are capable of decreasing surface runoff volumes also reduce nutrient loads transported by surface runoff harper et al 1999 mckergow et al 2007 the results of this present study measuring db inflow and outflow runoff volumes were used in concurrent studies to calculate the impact of the strategy on sediments and nutrient loads being transported by surface runoff the concurrent studies found that the db strategy decreased the annual loads of suspended sediments total p and total n reaching lake rotorua from the hauraki site by 51 47 and 57 respectively and by 59 68 and 72 from awahou unpublished data the findings that the awahou site facilitated greater soil infiltration in this present study and prevented greater contaminant loads from reaching downstream of the db catchments in concurrent studies highlights the important role hydrology plays in nutrient losses and mitigation strategy efficacy the results of this current study and unpublished concurrent studies which found that dbs are able to reduce the quantity of surface runoff and its associated contaminants suggest that soil infiltration is a feature of the mitigation strategy however in some cases infiltration may result in groundwater quality issues where dissolved nutrients are not readily sorbed and groundwater resources are sensitive to nutrient inputs in the case of the catchments in this current study the soils in the lake rotorua catchment generally have high anion storage capacities ascs and high cation exchange capacities cecs and have the ability to sorb dissolved p and ammonium that infiltrate the soil morgenstern et al 2015 reddy and delaune 2008 nitrate leaching into the groundwater however is prevalent in the lake rotorua catchment due to fertiliser applications and the presence of livestock depositing concentrated patches of urine onto well drained pasture soils morgenstern et al 2015 still a survey by gordon 2002 found that 81 of the 295 groundwater samples were less than half of the nitrate n drinking water guideline values new zealand ministry of health 2000 furthermore a concurrent study to this present study found that only 10 of the estimated annual total n losses from pastures were transported in surface runoff unpublished data therefore utilising dbs is highly unlikely to contribute in a significant way to the nitrate contamination groundwater in the study catchment given differences between the study site geomorphologies varying management factors and localised differences in storm rainfall intensity and duration most of the results reported in this study for the two sites are reasonably consistent the differences in annual inflow yields and the percentage of rainfall as runoff between sites with 167 mm delivered 8 of rainfall to the hauraki db and 114 mm delivered 5 of rainfall to the awahou db are at least partially explained by the greater total rainfall occurring during the large overflow events at the hauraki site during the two overflow events which occurred on the same dates at the sites 423 mm of rainfall occurred resulting in 114 mm of inflow at the hauraki site compared to 369 mm of rainfall resulting in 54 mm of inflow at the awahou site the 56 mm difference in rainfall contributed to the 60 mm difference in inflow yields during the overflow events and the 53 mm difference in annual inflow yields between the sites the proportion of annual inflows delivered during the large overflow events was 69 at the hauraki site and 47 at the awahou site which is consistent with other studies that found rare high magnitude storm events contribute the majority of annual runoff and associated sediment and nutrient loads delivered to streams in the lake rotorua catchment abell et al 2013 dare 2018 the overflow events at the 2 sites were also responsible for the differences in the proportion of the annual inflow yields undergoing soil infiltration before reaching downstream surface waters due to the larger storm events and greater inflows at the hauraki site 67 of the inflow yield went over the upstand riser and spillway as overflow discharge at the hauraki site compared to 47 at the awahou site these overflow discharges accounted for 80 of total annual discharge at the hauraki site and 58 at the awahou site since it was assumed that infiltration did not occur downstream of the db while runoff was still being delivered to the pond all of the overflow discharge is likely to have reached downstream waterways this highlights the importance of locating and constructing dbs to maximise the pond volume catchment ratio in order to minimise overflow discharges still the dbs prevented 19 and 29 of the overflow event inflow from reaching downstream waterways from the hauraki and awahou sites respectively the results showing that a smaller portion of the inflow yield escaped as overflow discharge from the awahou db compared to the hauraki db despite the similar ratios for pond volume to catchment area suggest that the potential magnitude and intensity of large storm events and subsequent runoff are important to consider when sizing a bund these results also suggest that the size of very large storm events have implications for the effectiveness of dbs as a mitigation tool to address sediments and nutrients transported in surface runoff since greater contaminant loads have been found to be transported from pastures during large runoff events in new zealand cooke and dons 1988 smith and monaghan 2003 and the lake rotorua catchment specifically abell et al 2013 dare 2018 the relative importance of the size of pond storage versus the infiltration rate in the ponded area is clearly illustrated in fig 3 where the overflow discharge is seen to be much greater than soil infiltration these results suggest that the currently suggested minimum 120 m3 pond capacity to 1 ha contributing catchment ratio could be increased in order to avoid excess overflow discharge and increase the potential for ponded and released water to infiltrate the soil however it is important to consider the costs and benefits of the db strategy before revising the protocol since such measures could significantly limit the relatively small number of viable db locations in the lake rotorua catchment 300 dbs with 120 m3 1 ha ratios paterson 2019 and restrict the potential benefits of their implementation multiple factors could be responsible for the seasonal trend observed between soil infiltration rates being lower during colder months including sediments clogging soil pores stocking rates and timing and the potential for macropores to develop during the warmer drier seasons the influence water temperature on viscosity could also contribute to lower soil infiltration rates in the winter months the viscosity of water decreases by 41 when decreasing temperature from 25 to 5 c korson et al 1969 which is roughly the range of temperatures observed in the ponded water at the db sites during this study the influence of seasonal and diurnal temperature changes on infiltration rates have been observed in studies investigating stormwater management emerson and traver 2008 jaynes 1990 because infiltration rates affect db discharge volumes the influence of temperature on infiltration rates should be considered when developing db design protocols and when developing models used to estimate db performance this is particularly important in climates where the majority of annual runoff occurs in winter when soil infiltration rates are likely to be the slowest due to greater water viscosity there was good agreement between the calculated event infiltration rates and field measured infiltration rates table 3 both of these rates were considerably smaller than the 72 mm h value reported by rijkse and guinto 2010 and likely reflects the effect of treading damage under intensive dairying on infiltration rates mcdowell et al 2003 the decline in infiltration rates in the lower portion of the ponding area compared to rates outside of the ponding area might also be due to increased treading damage in the lower lying and wetter ponding areas curran cournane et al 2010 or perhaps the large volumes of water that pond and infiltrate the soil cause deterioration in soil structure furthermore given that the dbs in this current study have been operating for 6 years and that during the course of this 12 month study a concurrent study found that 789 kg and 1 280 kg of sediments were deposited at the hauraki and awahou ponding areas respectively unpublished data deposited sediments may have formed a less permeable layer on top of existing soils and or be clogging soil pores soil pore clogging by sediments has been observed in studies investigating the effects of sedimentation on soil infiltration rates rice 1974 and soil filter permeability reddi et al 2000 this theory is further supported by the greater decrease in the infiltration rates in the awahou ponding area where greater quantities of sediments were deposited in a smaller ponding area the results of this current study suggest dbs may facilitate greater infiltration during the first few years after construction however infiltration rates may decline over time therefore the effect of repetitive ponding on the long term ability of dbs to decrease surface runoff volumes should be the subject of future research to further inform the development of db design protocols and performance models strategies to remediate soil infiltration rates in the ponding area should also be investigated this study identified factors that will vary spatially and temporarily which affected the proportion of runoff infiltrating the soil before reaching surface waters downstream of dbs including precipitation patterns particularly the magnitude of overflow events soil permeability and changes to infiltration rates due to sedimentation and repetitive ponding and the catchment size pond volume ratio this study should be expanded to collect longer term data from more db locations to investigate ways to maximise the proportion of surface runoff infiltrating soils since decreasing runoff discharges contribute to lower contaminant discharges lastly the results from this current study and future studies should be used to develop models that estimate runoff and contaminant yields delivered to and treated by dbs in specific locations based on hydrologic and landscape conditions the development of these models will help decision makers determine the applicability of dbs as a stormwater mitigation strategy in their catchments 5 conclusion this 12 month study found that 2 detainment bunds prevented 43 at the hauraki site and 63 at the awahou site of the annual surface runoff from reaching surface waters downstream of targeted pastoral areas in the lake rotorua catchment the detainment bunds effectively decreased surface runoff volumes by impeding stormflow which increased runoff residence time and facilitated soil infiltration during the ponding phase and when the ponded runoff was released onto what was dried soils downstream of the detainment bunds by decreasing surface runoff discharges and associated contaminant loads the detainment bund strategy should be considered a viable nutrient mitigation strategy in places where stormflows contribute to water quality degradation and soils are sufficiently permeable the magnitude of surface runoff generated during rare high magnitude storm events soil infiltration rates and the detainment bunds pond volume to catchment size ratios are important factors determining the ability of detainment bunds to decrease surface runoff in order to optimise detainment bunds performance it is necessary to maximize the pond volume to catchment size ratio so as to be able to handle the larger storm events that are responsible for significant runoff and nutrient loads in the lake rotorua catchment this study found infiltration rates in the ponding area declined due to repetitive ponding over the lifespan of a detainment bund which could affect the longer term hydrochemical treatment efficiencies of the detainment bund mitigation strategy methods to remediate declining infiltration rates in ponding areas should be investigated declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements this applied research on detainment bunds was initiated and is

zone by reducing the evaporation from the soil surface and surface runoff and enhances the infiltration vohland and barry 2009 ojasvi et al 1999 found that growing jujube zizyphus mauritiana seedlings with micro catchment conical micro catchments of 1 0 m radius had better chances of establishment in rainfed conditions as compared with conventional plantation technique the adoption of irrigation management strategies specifically water harvesting and deficit irrigation strategies in rainfed regions andhra pradesh india had the potential to improve the productivity by 20 and bring more area under irrigation with an increase of 140 mandal et al 2020 in addition to water harvesting mulching technique improves soil properties soil water storage as well as crop yield chakraborty et al 2008 in pecan carya illinoensis straw mulching increased flowering fruit set fruit retention and yield compared with control mark et al 2014 a 12 year study on water harvesting showed that straw mulching technique reduced soil erosion rates two orders of magnitude lower than in the control bare soil treatment cerdà et al 2017 keesstra et al 2019 found that straw mulching 60 g m 2 was able to delay the time to runoff initiation from 57 to 129 s sediment concentration from 16 7 g l 1 to 3 6 g l 1 and the soil erosion rates from 439 g to 73 g additionally the combinations of micro catchment and mulching can significantly increase soil water storage and improve plant productivity grum et al 2017 li et al 2016 for example fish scale pits with mulching semicircular mini catchment increased soil water storage at soil layer depths of 0 180 cm by 14 2 21 8 when compared with control li et al 2016 when jujube trees were grown under combined micro catchment fish scale pits branches or straw trees leaf transpiration significantly increased by 45 6 53 1 compared with bare land and the evaporation decreased by 42 5 53 5 li et al 2018 furthermore the combined terracing half moon terrace and mulching pruned jujube branches and maize straw enhanced soil water use in deep layers during both normal and drought years and consequently helping jujube trees to tolerate drought gao et al 2020 the combined gravel sand mulching method provided a favorable environment for plant growth than non mulched fields by reducing soil temperature evaporation wind speed water erosion and runoff improving infiltration and enhancing biological activity and soil fertility li 2003 interestingly a field study conducted in northern ethiopia revealed that the combined used of water harvesting and mulching techniques had greater positive effect on runoff and soil moisture compared with water harvesting or mulching methods in that study tied ridges water harvesting reduced runoff by 56 straw mulch by 53 and combined tied ridges and straw mulch by 78 when compared with control grum et al 2017 in addition soil moisture content in the combined tied ridges and straw mulch 22 4 was greater than the control 19 9 therefore they recommended the combined straw mulching and tied ridges as an efficient in situ water harvesting technique for improving on site water availability and consequently protect crops from dry periods nuts including pistachio are high valuable crop and rich source of protein fiber phytosterols antioxidants monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids which are known to be beneficial for human health the daily intake of 44 g pistachios for 12 weeks improved linoleic acid thiamin pyridoxine copper manganese and zinc intake without affecting body weight or composition fantino et al 2020 pistachio is a drought tolerance species able to survive under drought conditions with as little as 100 mm of rainfall goldhamer and beede 2004 however a supplemental irrigation has a positive effect on pistachio growth and productivity in fact greater yield can only be achieved when water supplies are adequate kanber et al 1993 pourmohammadali et al 2019 assessment of water harvesting on plant growth and yield is not new however few studies were on pistachio marino et al 2018 in addition no research we are aware of studied the combined effect of water harvesting and mulching on young pistachio growth dynamic and leaf gas exchange photosynthesis pn transpiration e and stomatal conductance gs we hypothesize that water harvesting mulching can significantly improve soil moisture content in addition this combined effect harvesting mulching has positive and significant effects on shoot morphology and physiology the overall goal of this research was to sustain young pistachio trees in arid and semi arid regions using simple cheap efficient and adaptable water management technique to achieve this goal our objective was to assess the influence of combining in situ water harvesting techniques micro catchment and mulching on soil moisture content plant morphology gas exchange and midday stem water potential ψsmd of young pistachio trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and plant material a two year study was conducted at jordan university of science and technology jordan 35 59 28 32 e 32 29 42 n elevation of 520 m during 2011 and 2012 seasons the study area has a semi arid climate with hot summer and cold winter and annual average rainfall of 150 200 mm the study location at the northeast of the campus slope about 12 was prepared to establish the plantings following a 10m 10m between rows x between plants planting arrangement the 7 year old pistachio pistacia vera cv ashori trees used in the study were grown in clay silty soil with low infiltration rate and soil depth of about 1 m table 1 during the study period trees were sustained on rain fed regime and no supplementary irrigation was applied 2 2 treatments during the experimental period four mulching techniques straw vertical and horizontal gravel and control no mulching and three micro catchment area 36 64 and 100 m2 were evaluated fig 1 for vertical gravel treatment a 10 mm size gravels was placed 50 cm away from the tree trunk forming an arc semi circle shape 25 cm depth and 20 cm wide the horizontal gravel 10 mm size treatment covered an area of 1 m2 below the trunk of the tree with one layer of gravel depth of 2 cm straw treatment was laid out by adding dried straw 5 cm thickness to cover the whole block to minimize the cost of labor straw application purchase cost and the transport of bales we used the minimum thickness that recommended in the literature less thickness were not stable and blown by wind diamond shape micro catchment blocks 36 64 and 100 m2 were structured by covering the block edges with 25 cm height earth bund in this study the thickness of mulching materials laid on micro catchments was different between straw and gravels this is because these two materials are different in their response to moisture heat and future stability however the minimum recommended thickness were selected for each mulching type to reduce the input cost for farmers the trees are planted in the lowest corner of diamond and at the center of semi circle shapes the experimental study was laid out in a complete randomized block design rcbd with 4 replications we used rcbd to minimize the variability within each block and to make sure that treatments mulching techniques micro catchment areas were compared under similar circumstances in fact the experiment was conducted on a sloped area slope about 12 accounting for spatial effects in the field was necessary to control variation in the experiment 2 3 measurements soil water content was calculated using time domain reflectometary tdr system trime pico iph t3 imko ettlingen germany for each experimental unit two tdrs were installed at 25 and 50 cm depth and 20 cm from the tree trunk then values from each soil depth interval were averaged to one value prior to statistical analysis plant morphology plant height and number of leaf per plant were collected at the end of each growing season gas exchange pn e and gs and ψsmd were measured 5 times during the 2012 growing season gas exchange measurements were determined using a handheld photosynthesis system ci 340 cid bio science wa usa gas exchange measurements were conducted between 11 00 am and 1 00 pm from two sun exposed and fully mature leaves midday stem water potential was measured following the procedures of othman et al 2014a a fully expanded leaf selected from the middle of shoot one year old were measured using pressure chamber model 600 pms instruments corvallis or usa runoff volume was determined following the procedure of li et al 2000 runoff volume for micro catchments was determined in 2011 twelve micro catchments 36 64 and100 m2 4 replicates without plants were constructed near the pistachio growing field a 20 l barrel was installed at the corner of each micro catchment plot lowest point of the slope and collected the runoff volume from each plot after the rainfall events the barrel was covered with plastic lid to prevent it from collecting precipitation and to prevent the evaporation of the collected runoff water the runoff volume was measured after each rainstorm the amount of rainfall was measured using standard rain gauge 2 4 graphing and statistical analysis the study was laid out using a randomized complete block design with 4 replications and two factors 4 mulching techniques 3 micro catchment areas the analysis of variance anova and the least significant deference test p 0 05 in sas version 9 4 for windows sas institute cary nc usa were used to identify differences between mulching techniques micro catchment area and their interactions sigmaplot version 14 0 for windows systat software san jose ca usa was used to graph the results 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content soil mulching increased soil moisture content compared with control in both years specifically between february and april 2011 2012 fig 2 however there were no significant differences between mulching treatments horizontal gravels vertical gravels and straw except for straw mulching in april 7 2011 in addition there were no significant differences between mulching treatments horizontal and vertical gravels straw and control from mid april to december 2011 and 2012 interestingly soil water content of 36 m2 micro catchment was consistently and significantly higher than 64 m2 treatment across the study period except in april 7 2011 february 12 and june 15 2012 in addition the 36 m2 soil water content was higher than the 100 m2 treatment in 2011 except in january 20 april 7 and june 5 in 2012 soil moisture content of 36 m2 was higher than 100 m2 micro catchment in march 3 april 4 and october 20 fig 2 3 2 morphology and physiology mulching and micro catchment area significantly affected pistachio plant morphology plant height and number of leaves per plant across the experimental period table 2 fig 3 vertical and horizontal gravel mulching had the highest percentage increase in plant height while vertical gravel treatment had the highest percentage increase in leaf number per tree table 2 the percentage increase in plant morphology plant height and number of leaves per plant for 36 m2 micro catchment was significantly higher than the 64 and 100 m2 treatments the mulching micro catchment interaction for plant morphology was significant across the study period table 2 and fig 3 the interactions results revealed that gravel vertical and horizontal mulching 36 m2 interaction had the highest percentage increase in plant height compared with other treatments fig 3 in addition vertical and horizontal mulching and 36 m2 interaction as well as the horizontal mulching and 64 m2 interaction treatments had the greatest percentage increase in leaf number per tree the response of gas exchange pn gs and e and stem water potential ψsmd to mulching micro catchment and their interaction are given in table 3 while mulching technique had no potential effect on leaf gas exchange variables especially overall means micro catchment area treatments significantly affected pn gs and e across the study period except for e in june 2012 pistachio trees grown in gravel or straw mulching had higher pn and gs than control only in august although 36 and 64 m2 micro catchments were similar for pn and gs in june july and august the overall means of pn and gs for the 36 m2 was higher than 64 m2 treatment table 3 interestingly pn and gs from 36 m2 were consistently and significantly higher than the 100 m2 micro catchment across the study period in this study water harvesting treatments mulching and micro catchment significantly improved ψsmd table 3 for example gravel mulching vertical and horizontal significantly increased ψsmd less negative compared with control and straw mulching in may and overall mean in addition ψsmd values from 36 m2 micro catchment were higher less negative than 64 and 100 m2 micro catchments across the growing season may june july august and overall mean the mulching micro catchment interaction showed that gravel horizontal and vertical and 36 m2 interaction had higher pn than other treatment in may fig 4 in addition mulching horizontal and vertical gravels straw and 36 m2 interaction as well as control and micro catchments 64 and 100 m2 had the highest gs in may in august mulching horizontal and vertical gravels straw and micro catchments 36 and 64 m2 interaction had higher pn compared with control and 64 m2 the mulching micro catchment area results for e and ψsmd were inconsistent or not significant across the study period fig 4 3 3 rainfall runoff volume a separate experiment was designed to determine the total runoff volume from micro catchments plots in the first year 2011 during the experimental period 2011 nine storms were recorded and the total rainfall was 174 mm fig 5 the minimum rainfall record was 2 mm april 7 and the maximum rainfall depth was 40 mm february 6 the runoff volume differed significantly between the micro catchment plots over the experimental period while 100 m2 micro catchment had the highest runoff volume in february 1 march 27 and april 7 the 36 m2 collected more runoff water than the other micro catchments in february 20 november 20 and december 27 fig 5 the total runoff volume for the 36 m2 micro catchment was 53 4 l for 64 m2 was 30 6 l and for 100 m2 was 41 7 l 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content rainfall the main source of water in arid and semi arid regions is limited and highly variable water harvesting can be an applicable approach to assist agriculture and secure yields under those highly variable water availability regions vettera and rieger 2019 in situ rain water harvesting is a promising practice to support sustainable development in arid regions because it improves infiltration and groundwater recharge soil nutrients enrichment as well as biomass production vohland and barry 2009 in fact water harvesting approach has the potential to improve the availability of water for an extended period mandal et al 2020 several water harvesting techniques has been suggested such as mulching gravels straw and plastic and micro macro catchments with different area and shape however the efficiency of those techniques to maintain adequate soil water content for plant is not similar in dry lands hortonian runoff is a scale process that associated with rainfall infiltration and runoff routing chen et al 2016 that soil water content decreased in parallel with increased micro catchment area 36 to 100 m2 is consistent with the results of bagarello et al 2018 and chen et al 2016 in fact scale effect exists on conditions of stationary heterogeneous land surface and results in a decrease of runoff depth as spatial scales increase chen et al 2016 for mulching effect higher soil water content under soil mulching treatments straw or gravels could partially attributed to mulching effect which reduced evaporation from the soil compared with bare soil control fig 2 4 2 pistachio morphology and physiology recent studies has linked gas exchange component pn e and gs to shoot and root growth as well as yield a saf et al 2020 ayad et al 2018 leskovar and othman 2019 marino et al 2018 in this study the combined water harvesting gravel mulching vertical and horizontal and 36 m2 micro catchment were the best candidate to improve the morphology plant height and number of leaves per tree of young pistachio trees tables 2 and 3 our results like those of ojasvi et al 1999 concluded that gravel mulching and shallow conical micro catchments of 1 0 m radius constructed around the trunk significantly increased the jujube height by 40 48 over the control information about the amount of water available in the root zone is essential as a basis for calculating water balances and plant water status landsberg and waring 2017 othman et al 2014b in this study the better morpho physiological responses of pistachio trees in mulching vertical and horizontal 36 m2 micro catchment plots can be due to higher soil moisture content fig 2 soil moisture content is significantly and positively correlated with plant morpho physiology othman et al 2014b landsberg and waring 2017 looked back over 50 years of research into the water relations of trees and concluded that hydraulic redistribution of water in the soil can play a key role in facilitating root growth especially in dry soils pistachio is a drought tolerance species able to survive under drought conditions with as little as 100 mm of rainfall goldhamer and beede 2004 during the study period pistachio trees were grown under rain fed conditions no supplemental irrigation was applied a three year study on pistachio tree suggested that ψsmd of 1 5 mpa is the water deficit threshold as it did not reduce the yield conversely ψsmd of 2 0 mpa resulted in a significant negative effect on gs and pistachio production memmi et al 2016 in pecan the reduction in pn and gs exceeded 50 when ψsmd ranged from 1 5 to 2 0 mpa othman et al 2014b interestingly in our study ψsmd never exceeded more negative 1 2 mpa across the water harvesting treatments and over the study period table 3 fig 4 in fact the ψsmd for the 36 m2 micro catchment never exceeded 1 0 mpa considering the ψsmd values across the experimental period we believe that young pistachio trees can be grown under rain fed regime rainfall 150 200 mm specifically when micro catchment water harvesting mcwh is applied nature based solutions enhance the sustainability of catchment systems by promoting desirable soil and landscape functions keesstra et al 2018b the concentration of nature based solutions on the concept of connectivity making the landscape less connected enabling less rainfall to be transformed into runoff and increasing soil moisture keesstra et al 2018b although water harvesting approach results is remarkable farmer perception for adopting this approach is quite negative especially for using mulching in fact farmers claim for subsidies to adopt mulching approach because the cost of mulch e g straw is higher than traditional tillage practices cerdà et al 2017 a socioeconomic survey on soil mulching showed that the use of straw mulching in olive olea europaea l plantation would cost 174 7 ha 1 which account for 22 5 of the total income of the farmers rodrigo comino et al 2019 overall to convince farmers to adopt water harvesting strategy it needs to be subsidized rodrigo comino et al 2019 4 3 runoff efficiency micro catchment water harvesting consists of a closed diamond square or rectangular basin levees on gently sloping land this technique is simple and cheap in construction and consequently easy to build and adopt oweis and taimeh 1996 the efficiency of the water harvesting system depends on amount of water consume by the crop and the amount of rainfall receive in the catchment area runoff efficiency in fact the overall efficiency of the system can differ significantly by altering the area of the catchment and the root zone capacity oweis and taimeh 1996 in this study the runoff volume of 36 m2 was 75 and 28 higher than those from 64 and 100 m2 respectively fig 5 bagarello et al 2018 assessed the influence of plot scale plot length and area on runoff and sediment concentration in bare ploughed plots ranging from 1 to 48 m2 they found that both runoff and soil loss significantly decreased in the passage from the reference area 1 m2 to the largest one 48 m2 the investigation of plot scale effects on event runoff per unit area qe sediment concentration ce and soil loss per unit area sle revealed that when scale effects were detected the longer plot lengths yielded smaller qe and sle values and larger ce values bagarello and ferro 2017 the slope degree and the minimum rainfall amount for effective water harvesting are controversial malesu et al 2007 found that the successful and sustainable water harvesting system specifically for ponds and pans had a site slope of less than 8 slopes 2 are the best seasonal rainfall above 200 mm and low permeability soil ali et al 2010 assessed the mcwh potential in mediterranean arid environment for three consecutive years during the study period the annual rain was 158 mm in the first year 45 mm in second year and 127 mm in third they found that runoff yield varied between 5 and 187 m3 ha 1 which account for 5 and 85 of the incidental rainfall interestingly the rainfall threshold for runoff development was estimated about 4 mm a water catchment area of 4 5 km2 and a landscape slope of 1 1 5 were associated with runoff volume exceeding 1000 m3 when total rainfall during the day was about 20 mm carter and miller 1991 however two year study investigated the effect of slope degree 8 and 15 and micro catchment area 50 and 70 m2 on the amount of water harvested in tree basin for young olive showed that the 15 slope resulted in greater harvested volume for small storms when compared with 8 but the two were comparable when storms were large interestingly the 70 m2 catchment area resulted in greater volume of harvested water only when storm was higher than 26 mm in this study the slope degree was 12 and the rainfall during the day storm ranged from 2 to 40 mm the number of storms with total rainfall 20 mm during the growing season was 4 storms per year the gas exchange and ψsmd values were within the proper ranges though the trees were under rain fed conditions overall we believe that the construction of mcwh with 12 slope degree is appropriate for growth and development of young pistachio trees specifically when annual rainfall is greater than 150 mm however further studies are needed to evaluate the influence of these combined water harvesting techniques mulching micro catchment on pistachio fruit production and quality 5 conclusions water harvesting can provide a supplementary amount of water for the cultivation of pistachio crop especially during drought periods in this study combined water harvesting techniques mulching micro catchment significantly improved soil water content plant morphology plant height and leaf number per tree and physiology of pistachio trees soil water content from the 36 m2 micro catchment was higher than 64 and 100 m2 mulching and micro catchment interaction revealed that vertical and horizontal mulching and 36 m2 had the highest percentage increase in tree height compared with other treatments higher soil water content in the 36 m2 micro catchment resulted in higher gas exchange pn gs and e and ψsmd consequently trees grown in the 36 m2 micro catchment had better tree morphology plant height and number of leaves per tree than pistachio trees grown in 64 and 100 m2 micro catchment area treatments interestingly the 36 m2 micro catchment collected 75 higher runoff water than 64 m2 and 28 than 100 m2 therefore the 36 m2 is the best micro catchment area in term of runoff efficiency overall the gravel mulching vertical and horizontal and 36 m2 micro catchment is the potential water harvesting

effective alternative to mitigate water scarcity in arid and semi arid regions critchley and siege 1991 oweis and taimeh 1996 water harvesting techniques prolong the availability of water in the root zone by reducing the evaporation from the soil surface and surface runoff and enhances the infiltration vohland and barry 2009 ojasvi et al 1999 found that growing jujube zizyphus mauritiana seedlings with micro catchment conical micro catchments of 1 0 m radius had better chances of establishment in rainfed conditions as compared with conventional plantation technique the adoption of irrigation management strategies specifically water harvesting and deficit irrigation strategies in rainfed regions andhra pradesh india had the potential to improve the productivity by 20 and bring more area under irrigation with an increase of 140 mandal et al 2020 in addition to water harvesting mulching technique improves soil properties soil water storage as well as crop yield chakraborty et al 2008 in pecan carya illinoensis straw mulching increased flowering fruit set fruit retention and yield compared with control mark et al 2014 a 12 year study on water harvesting showed that straw mulching technique reduced soil erosion rates two orders of magnitude lower than in the control bare soil treatment cerdà et al 2017 keesstra et al 2019 found that straw mulching 60 g m 2 was able to delay the time to runoff initiation from 57 to 129 s sediment concentration from 16 7 g l 1 to 3 6 g l 1 and the soil erosion rates from 439 g to 73 g additionally the combinations of micro catchment and mulching can significantly increase soil water storage and improve plant productivity grum et al 2017 li et al 2016 for example fish scale pits with mulching semicircular mini catchment increased soil water storage at soil layer depths of 0 180 cm by 14 2 21 8 when compared with control li et al 2016 when jujube trees were grown under combined micro catchment fish scale pits branches or straw trees leaf transpiration significantly increased by 45 6 53 1 compared with bare land and the evaporation decreased by 42 5 53 5 li et al 2018 furthermore the combined terracing half moon terrace and mulching pruned jujube branches and maize straw enhanced soil water use in deep layers during both normal and drought years and consequently helping jujube trees to tolerate drought gao et al 2020 the combined gravel sand mulching method provided a favorable environment for plant growth than non mulched fields by reducing soil temperature evaporation wind speed water erosion and runoff improving infiltration and enhancing biological activity and soil fertility li 2003 interestingly a field study conducted in northern ethiopia revealed that the combined used of water harvesting and mulching techniques had greater positive effect on runoff and soil moisture compared with water harvesting or mulching methods in that study tied ridges water harvesting reduced runoff by 56 straw mulch by 53 and combined tied ridges and straw mulch by 78 when compared with control grum et al 2017 in addition soil moisture content in the combined tied ridges and straw mulch 22 4 was greater than the control 19 9 therefore they recommended the combined straw mulching and tied ridges as an efficient in situ water harvesting technique for improving on site water availability and consequently protect crops from dry periods nuts including pistachio are high valuable crop and rich source of protein fiber phytosterols antioxidants monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids which are known to be beneficial for human health the daily intake of 44 g pistachios for 12 weeks improved linoleic acid thiamin pyridoxine copper manganese and zinc intake without affecting body weight or composition fantino et al 2020 pistachio is a drought tolerance species able to survive under drought conditions with as little as 100 mm of rainfall goldhamer and beede 2004 however a supplemental irrigation has a positive effect on pistachio growth and productivity in fact greater yield can only be achieved when water supplies are adequate kanber et al 1993 pourmohammadali et al 2019 assessment of water harvesting on plant growth and yield is not new however few studies were on pistachio marino et al 2018 in addition no research we are aware of studied the combined effect of water harvesting and mulching on young pistachio growth dynamic and leaf gas exchange photosynthesis pn transpiration e and stomatal conductance gs we hypothesize that water harvesting mulching can significantly improve soil moisture content in addition this combined effect harvesting mulching has positive and significant effects on shoot morphology and physiology the overall goal of this research was to sustain young pistachio trees in arid and semi arid regions using simple cheap efficient and adaptable water management technique to achieve this goal our objective was to assess the influence of combining in situ water harvesting techniques micro catchment and mulching on soil moisture content plant morphology gas exchange and midday stem water potential ψsmd of young pistachio trees 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and plant material a two year study was conducted at jordan university of science and technology jordan 35 59 28 32 e 32 29 42 n elevation of 520 m during 2011 and 2012 seasons the study area has a semi arid climate with hot summer and cold winter and annual average rainfall of 150 200 mm the study location at the northeast of the campus slope about 12 was prepared to establish the plantings following a 10m 10m between rows x between plants planting arrangement the 7 year old pistachio pistacia vera cv ashori trees used in the study were grown in clay silty soil with low infiltration rate and soil depth of about 1 m table 1 during the study period trees were sustained on rain fed regime and no supplementary irrigation was applied 2 2 treatments during the experimental period four mulching techniques straw vertical and horizontal gravel and control no mulching and three micro catchment area 36 64 and 100 m2 were evaluated fig 1 for vertical gravel treatment a 10 mm size gravels was placed 50 cm away from the tree trunk forming an arc semi circle shape 25 cm depth and 20 cm wide the horizontal gravel 10 mm size treatment covered an area of 1 m2 below the trunk of the tree with one layer of gravel depth of 2 cm straw treatment was laid out by adding dried straw 5 cm thickness to cover the whole block to minimize the cost of labor straw application purchase cost and the transport of bales we used the minimum thickness that recommended in the literature less thickness were not stable and blown by wind diamond shape micro catchment blocks 36 64 and 100 m2 were structured by covering the block edges with 25 cm height earth bund in this study the thickness of mulching materials laid on micro catchments was different between straw and gravels this is because these two materials are different in their response to moisture heat and future stability however the minimum recommended thickness were selected for each mulching type to reduce the input cost for farmers the trees are planted in the lowest corner of diamond and at the center of semi circle shapes the experimental study was laid out in a complete randomized block design rcbd with 4 replications we used rcbd to minimize the variability within each block and to make sure that treatments mulching techniques micro catchment areas were compared under similar circumstances in fact the experiment was conducted on a sloped area slope about 12 accounting for spatial effects in the field was necessary to control variation in the experiment 2 3 measurements soil water content was calculated using time domain reflectometary tdr system trime pico iph t3 imko ettlingen germany for each experimental unit two tdrs were installed at 25 and 50 cm depth and 20 cm from the tree trunk then values from each soil depth interval were averaged to one value prior to statistical analysis plant morphology plant height and number of leaf per plant were collected at the end of each growing season gas exchange pn e and gs and ψsmd were measured 5 times during the 2012 growing season gas exchange measurements were determined using a handheld photosynthesis system ci 340 cid bio science wa usa gas exchange measurements were conducted between 11 00 am and 1 00 pm from two sun exposed and fully mature leaves midday stem water potential was measured following the procedures of othman et al 2014a a fully expanded leaf selected from the middle of shoot one year old were measured using pressure chamber model 600 pms instruments corvallis or usa runoff volume was determined following the procedure of li et al 2000 runoff volume for micro catchments was determined in 2011 twelve micro catchments 36 64 and100 m2 4 replicates without plants were constructed near the pistachio growing field a 20 l barrel was installed at the corner of each micro catchment plot lowest point of the slope and collected the runoff volume from each plot after the rainfall events the barrel was covered with plastic lid to prevent it from collecting precipitation and to prevent the evaporation of the collected runoff water the runoff volume was measured after each rainstorm the amount of rainfall was measured using standard rain gauge 2 4 graphing and statistical analysis the study was laid out using a randomized complete block design with 4 replications and two factors 4 mulching techniques 3 micro catchment areas the analysis of variance anova and the least significant deference test p 0 05 in sas version 9 4 for windows sas institute cary nc usa were used to identify differences between mulching techniques micro catchment area and their interactions sigmaplot version 14 0 for windows systat software san jose ca usa was used to graph the results 3 results 3 1 soil moisture content soil mulching increased soil moisture content compared with control in both years specifically between february and april 2011 2012 fig 2 however there were no significant differences between mulching treatments horizontal gravels vertical gravels and straw except for straw mulching in april 7 2011 in addition there were no significant differences between mulching treatments horizontal and vertical gravels straw and control from mid april to december 2011 and 2012 interestingly soil water content of 36 m2 micro catchment was consistently and significantly higher than 64 m2 treatment across the study period except in april 7 2011 february 12 and june 15 2012 in addition the 36 m2 soil water content was higher than the 100 m2 treatment in 2011 except in january 20 april 7 and june 5 in 2012 soil moisture content of 36 m2 was higher than 100 m2 micro catchment in march 3 april 4 and october 20 fig 2 3 2 morphology and physiology mulching and micro catchment area significantly affected pistachio plant morphology plant height and number of leaves per plant across the experimental period table 2 fig 3 vertical and horizontal gravel mulching had the highest percentage increase in plant height while vertical gravel treatment had the highest percentage increase in leaf number per tree table 2 the percentage increase in plant morphology plant height and number of leaves per plant for 36 m2 micro catchment was significantly higher than the 64 and 100 m2 treatments the mulching micro catchment interaction for plant morphology was significant across the study period table 2 and fig 3 the interactions results revealed that gravel vertical and horizontal mulching 36 m2 interaction had the highest percentage increase in plant height compared with other treatments fig 3 in addition vertical and horizontal mulching and 36 m2 interaction as well as the horizontal mulching and 64 m2 interaction treatments had the greatest percentage increase in leaf number per tree the response of gas exchange pn gs and e and stem water potential ψsmd to mulching micro catchment and their interaction are given in table 3 while mulching technique had no potential effect on leaf gas exchange variables especially overall means micro catchment area treatments significantly affected pn gs and e across the study period except for e in june 2012 pistachio trees grown in gravel or straw mulching had higher pn and gs than control only in august although 36 and 64 m2 micro catchments were similar for pn and gs in june july and august the overall means of pn and gs for the 36 m2 was higher than 64 m2 treatment table 3 interestingly pn and gs from 36 m2 were consistently and significantly higher than the 100 m2 micro catchment across the study period in this study water harvesting treatments mulching and micro catchment significantly improved ψsmd table 3 for example gravel mulching vertical and horizontal significantly increased ψsmd less negative compared with control and straw mulching in may and overall mean in addition ψsmd values from 36 m2 micro catchment were higher less negative than 64 and 100 m2 micro catchments across the growing season may june july august and overall mean the mulching micro catchment interaction showed that gravel horizontal and vertical and 36 m2 interaction had higher pn than other treatment in may fig 4 in addition mulching horizontal and vertical gravels straw and 36 m2 interaction as well as control and micro catchments 64 and 100 m2 had the highest gs in may in august mulching horizontal and vertical gravels straw and micro catchments 36 and 64 m2 interaction had higher pn compared with control and 64 m2 the mulching micro catchment area results for e and ψsmd were inconsistent or not significant across the study period fig 4 3 3 rainfall runoff volume a separate experiment was designed to determine the total runoff volume from micro catchments plots in the first year 2011 during the experimental period 2011 nine storms were recorded and the total rainfall was 174 mm fig 5 the minimum rainfall record was 2 mm april 7 and the maximum rainfall depth was 40 mm february 6 the runoff volume differed significantly between the micro catchment plots over the experimental period while 100 m2 micro catchment had the highest runoff volume in february 1 march 27 and april 7 the 36 m2 collected more runoff water than the other micro catchments in february 20 november 20 and december 27 fig 5 the total runoff volume for the 36 m2 micro catchment was 53 4 l for 64 m2 was 30 6 l and for 100 m2 was 41 7 l 4 discussion 4 1 soil water content rainfall the main source of water in arid and semi arid regions is limited and highly variable water harvesting can be an applicable approach to assist agriculture and secure yields under those highly variable water availability regions vettera and rieger 2019 in situ rain water harvesting is a promising practice to support sustainable development in arid regions because it improves infiltration and groundwater recharge soil nutrients enrichment as well as biomass production vohland and barry 2009 in fact water harvesting approach has the potential to improve the availability of water for an extended period mandal et al 2020 several water harvesting techniques has been suggested such as mulching gravels straw and plastic and micro macro catchments with different area and shape however the efficiency of those techniques to maintain adequate soil water content for plant is not similar in dry lands hortonian runoff is a scale process that associated with rainfall infiltration and runoff routing chen et al 2016 that soil water content decreased in parallel with increased micro catchment area 36 to 100 m2 is consistent with the results of bagarello et al 2018 and chen et al 2016 in fact scale effect exists on conditions of stationary heterogeneous land surface and results in a decrease of runoff depth as spatial scales increase chen et al 2016 for mulching effect higher soil water content under soil mulching treatments straw or gravels could partially attributed to mulching effect which reduced evaporation from the soil compared with bare soil control fig 2 4 2 pistachio morphology and physiology recent studies has linked gas exchange component pn e and gs to shoot and root growth as well as yield a saf et al 2020 ayad et al 2018 leskovar and othman 2019 marino et al 2018 in this study the combined water harvesting gravel mulching vertical and horizontal and 36 m2 micro catchment were the best candidate to improve the morphology plant height and number of leaves per tree of young pistachio trees tables 2 and 3 our results like those of ojasvi et al 1999 concluded that gravel mulching and shallow conical micro catchments of 1 0 m radius constructed around the trunk significantly increased the jujube height by 40 48 over the control information about the amount of water available in the root zone is essential as a basis for calculating water balances and plant water status landsberg and waring 2017 othman et al 2014b in this study the better morpho physiological responses of pistachio trees in mulching vertical and horizontal 36 m2 micro catchment plots can be due to higher soil moisture content fig 2 soil moisture content is significantly and positively correlated with plant morpho physiology othman et al 2014b landsberg and waring 2017 looked back over 50 years of research into the water relations of trees and concluded that hydraulic redistribution of water in the soil can play a key role in facilitating root growth especially in dry soils pistachio is a drought tolerance species able to survive under drought conditions with as little as 100 mm of rainfall goldhamer and beede 2004 during the study period pistachio trees were grown under rain fed conditions no supplemental irrigation was applied a three year study on pistachio tree suggested that ψsmd of 1 5 mpa is the water deficit threshold as it did not reduce the yield conversely ψsmd of 2 0 mpa resulted in a significant negative effect on gs and pistachio production memmi et al 2016 in pecan the reduction in pn and gs exceeded 50 when ψsmd ranged from 1 5 to 2 0 mpa othman et al 2014b interestingly in our study ψsmd never exceeded more negative 1 2 mpa across the water harvesting treatments and over the study period table 3 fig 4 in fact the ψsmd for the 36 m2 micro catchment never exceeded 1 0 mpa considering the ψsmd values across the experimental period we believe that young pistachio trees can be grown under rain fed regime rainfall 150 200 mm specifically when micro catchment water harvesting mcwh is applied nature based solutions enhance the sustainability of catchment systems by promoting desirable soil and landscape functions keesstra et al 2018b the concentration of nature based solutions on the concept of connectivity making the landscape less connected enabling less rainfall to be transformed into runoff and increasing soil moisture keesstra et al 2018b although water harvesting approach results is remarkable farmer perception for adopting this approach is quite negative especially for using mulching in fact farmers claim for subsidies to adopt mulching approach because the cost of mulch e g straw is higher than traditional tillage practices cerdà et al 2017 a socioeconomic survey on soil mulching showed that the use of straw mulching in olive olea europaea l plantation would cost 174 7 ha 1 which account for 22 5 of the total income of the farmers rodrigo comino et al 2019 overall to convince farmers to adopt water harvesting strategy it needs to be subsidized rodrigo comino et al 2019 4 3 runoff efficiency micro catchment water harvesting consists of a closed diamond square or rectangular basin levees on gently sloping land this technique is simple and cheap in construction and consequently easy to build and adopt oweis and taimeh 1996 the efficiency of the water harvesting system depends on amount of water consume by the crop and the amount of rainfall receive in the catchment area runoff efficiency in fact the overall efficiency of the system can differ significantly by altering the area of the catchment and the root zone capacity oweis and taimeh 1996 in this study the runoff volume of 36 m2 was 75 and 28 higher than those from 64 and 100 m2 respectively fig 5 bagarello et al 2018 assessed the influence of plot scale plot length and area on runoff and sediment concentration in bare ploughed plots ranging from 1 to 48 m2 they found that both runoff and soil loss significantly decreased in the passage from the reference area 1 m2 to the largest one 48 m2 the investigation of plot scale effects on event runoff per unit area qe sediment concentration ce and soil loss per unit area sle revealed that when scale effects were detected the longer plot lengths yielded smaller qe and sle values and larger ce values bagarello and ferro 2017 the slope degree and the minimum rainfall amount for effective water harvesting are controversial malesu et al 2007 found that the successful and sustainable water harvesting system specifically for ponds and pans had a site slope of less than 8 slopes 2 are the best seasonal rainfall above 200 mm and low permeability soil ali et al 2010 assessed the mcwh potential in mediterranean arid environment for three consecutive years during the study period the annual rain was 158 mm in the first year 45 mm in second year and 127 mm in third they found that runoff yield varied between 5 and 187 m3 ha 1 which account for 5 and 85 of the incidental rainfall interestingly the rainfall threshold for runoff development was estimated about 4 mm a water catchment area of 4 5 km2 and a landscape slope of 1 1 5 were associated with runoff volume exceeding 1000 m3 when total rainfall during the day was about 20 mm carter and miller 1991 however two year study investigated the effect of slope degree 8 and 15 and micro catchment area 50 and 70 m2 on the amount of water harvested in tree basin for young olive showed that the 15 slope resulted in greater harvested volume for small storms when compared with 8 but the two were comparable when storms were large interestingly the 70 m2 catchment area resulted in greater volume of harvested water only when storm was higher than 26 mm in this study the slope degree was 12 and the rainfall during the day storm ranged from 2 to 40 mm the number of storms with total rainfall 20 mm during the growing season was 4 storms per year the gas exchange and ψsmd values were within the proper ranges though the trees were under rain fed conditions overall we believe that the construction of mcwh with 12 slope degree is appropriate for growth and development of young pistachio trees specifically when annual rainfall is greater than 150 mm however further studies are needed to evaluate the influence of these combined water harvesting techniques mulching micro catchment on pistachio fruit production and quality 5 conclusions water harvesting can provide a supplementary amount of water for the cultivation of pistachio crop especially during drought periods in this study combined water harvesting techniques mulching micro catchment significantly improved soil water content plant morphology plant height and leaf number per tree and physiology of pistachio trees soil water content from the 36 m2 micro catchment was higher than 64 and 100 m2 mulching and micro catchment interaction revealed that vertical and horizontal mulching and 36 m2 had the highest percentage increase in tree height compared with other treatments higher soil water content in the 36 m2 micro catchment resulted in higher gas exchange pn gs and e and ψsmd consequently trees grown in the 36 m2 micro catchment had better tree morphology plant height and number of leaves per tree than pistachio trees grown in 64 and 100 m2 micro catchment area treatments interestingly the 36 m2 micro catchment collected 75 higher runoff water than 64 m2 and 28 than 100 m2 therefore the 36 m2 is the best micro catchment area in term of runoff efficiency overall the gravel mulching vertical and horizontal and 36 m2 micro catchment is the potential water harvesting

increasing soil temperature and moisture gan et al 2013 duan et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2019b 2019c while ridge furrow planting can collect effective or ineffective rainfall liang et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 at the same time strengthening the circulation of soil air by ridges is also a high efficient farming method to increase crop production as a new farming practice ridge furrow planting with plastic film mulching rffm combines the advantages of both which improves wp and increases production by employing ridges mulched with plastic film as the runoff area and furrows

single field trails cannot assess the comprehensive influence of ridge furrow planting and plastic film mulching on regional and larger scales gao et al 2019 meta analysis is a powerful statistical tool to summarize results from numerous single experiments while accounting for variability across experiments hedges et al 1999 and there have been many meta analysis reports in agricultural studies daryanto et al 2016 li et al 2018 ma et al 2018 wang et al 2015a wang et al 2015a found that the effect of ridge furrow mulching was better than flat mulching and the effect of mulching was better under low rainfall 150 mm than under moderate rainfall 150 250 mm and high rainfall 250 mm and put forward that ridge furrow mulching was the most suitable mulching practice compared with conventional film straw or other mulching li et al 2018 reported that the improvements of potato yield and wp of film and straw mulching were higher at moderate air temperatures 15 20 c than those at low and high temperatures and the mean effects of mulching were greater at relatively low or moderate fertilization rates gao et al 2019 recommended that plastic film mulching had the most obvious effect on increasing yield of potato compared with other crops ma et al 2018 indicated that plastic mulching increased soil moisture content and fertilizer residue on the soil surface 0 20 cm but effectively reduced the organic carbon of 0 10 cm soil layer and did not pose impact on the organic carbon of 10 20 cm soil layer yu et al 2018 indicated that the ridge furrow planting and plastic film mulching system had the greatest increase in soil water content soil temperature and grain yield compared with flat cultivation without mulching all those findings imply that soil mulching is beneficial to nutrient absorption crop water productivity and yield increase and film mulching on the ridge is better than that on flat land previous meta analyses have only studied the effects of film mulching or straw mulching on crops under different climatic regions temperature rainfall and nitrogen application rates qin et al 2015 gao et al 2019 wang et al 2015a li et al 2018 yu et al 2018 ma et al 2018 while little attention has been paid to the effect of different farming practices such as ridge furrow planting on crop yield and crop water productivity under various altitudes soil types and seeding methods particularly a comprehensive review on the effects of farming practices on various crops such as wheat maize and potato has been lacking rice wheat maize and potato are the world s major food crops which play a critical role in china s food production however there are very limited field trials on ridge furrow and film mulching techniques in rice so only papers on wheat maize and potato were considered in this study the main objective of this study was thus to comprehensively evaluate the performances of three major farming practices rffm rf and fm in comparison with conventional

treatments rffm rf and fm the logarithm of r improved its statistical behavior in the meta analysis hedges et al 1999 1 r x t x c 2 l n r ln x t x c l n x t l n x c where xt and xc are the means of the concerned variables in ridge furrow and mulching treatments rffm rf and fm and in flat planting with non mulching treatment f respectively for ease of explanation all analysis results in this study were reported as percentage changes of farming practices to the control r 1 100 du et al 2018 since most studies collected in this study did not provide variance an unweighted approach proposed by chen et al 2013 was considered by using meta win 2 1 rosenberg et al 2000 a random effect model was used to assess the impact of rffm rf and fm on crop yield and wp compared with f when the number of observations was less than 20 bootstrapping with 9999 iterations was used to generate bias corrected 95 confidence interval ci of mean effect sizes because confidence limits based on bootstrapping tests were wider than standard confidence limits daryanto et al 2016 differences in the mean effect size among groups were calculated using random effect models borenstein et al 2011 the difference was considered significant if the bootstrap confidence interval did not overlap each other the effect of farming practices was considered significantly different from conventional flat planting p 0 05 if the 95 ci did not reach zero groups of the meta analysis must have at least two valid comparisons the frequency distribution of r was plotted to reflect variability of individual study meanwhile the frequency of the r was also fitted to the gaussian distribution function to test the uniformity of observed data by using origin v8 0 software the general linear model unvariate procedure was performed to determine the effects of each variable on yield and wp of crop using the spss statistical software version 20 0 for windows spss chicago usa explanatory variables considered in this meta analysis included planting region climatic condition altitude soil type and seeding method supplementary appendix b 3 results 3 1 meta data overview our dataset contained 964 observations from 90 studies including 688 treatment data rffm rf and fm and 276 control data f rffm rf and fm had a total of 435 147 and 106 yield comparison observations with 342 73 and 91 w p comparison observations respectively maize potato wheat had a total of 233 230 and 227 production comparison observations and 205 107 and 194 w p comparison observations respectively frequency distributions of effect size of relevant data in all studies were found to have a normal distribution fig 2 indicating that the dataset was subject to uniformity results of the statistical analysis of the effects of crop type planting region rainfall air temperature altitude soil type and seeding method on yield and wp of wheat maize and potato are summarized in table 2 3 2 responses of crop yield evapotranspiration and wp to farming practices compared with the conventional flat planting without film mulching f the three farming practices of rffm rf and fm significantly increased yield and crop water productivity of wheat maize and potato but the effect on the crop evapotranspiration et was not obvious different farming practices significantly increased mean crop yields rffm 33 8 rf 16 6 ffm 27 0 fig 3 a slightly influenced et rffm 1 9 rf 2 4 ffm 1 1 fig 3b and strongly increased wp rffm 35 8 rf 17 5 ffm 27 8 fig 3c overall rffm had the greatest effect on crop yield and wp increases followed by fm and rf except that the yield of wheat under rffm 23 7 was slightly lower than that under fm 26 1 as for crops the three farming practices performed best for potato with regards to yield followed by maize and wheat the three farming practices also performed best on potato in terms of wp with the maximum value of 45 0 under rffm while the minimum value of 12 2 was obtained for maize under rf in addition crop type had significant effect on yield and wp increases p 0 05 under rffm table 2 in terms of crop et fm and rf slightly increased water consumption while rffm slightly reduced water consumption but the effect was not significant 3 3 crop yield and wp as influenced by farming practices in different climatic regions according to similarity of geographic and climatic conditions administrative division and analogous natural farming regions of crops in china zhao et al 2016 xu et al 2017 the study areas of those crops were divided into six planting regions table 1 crop yield were affected by mulching practices as the planting region changed fig 4 a in northeast china there was only one set of data so it was excluded from this meta analysis in general the ridge furrow and mulching effect in northwest china was better than that in other regions followed by central china and finally southwest china as for rffm the highest increase in crop yield was found in northwest china 33 1 followed by north central china 21 3 and the lowest yield increase was obtained in southwest china 7 7 similar trends were observed under rf and fm these results are similar to those of gao s meta analysis on the effect of mulching practices gao et al 2019 under rffm the effect of climatic regions on yield reached a significant level p 0 05 table 2 3 4 crop yield as influenced by farming practices under different geographical conditions altitude and soil type in fact the altitude also affected the effect of farming practices on crop yield fig 4b at high altitudes 1500 m the effect of two mulching practices fm and rffm 41 6 33 1 was significantly higher than that of rf 16 2 p 0 05 fig 4b table 2 at high altitudes the effect of fm and rffm was better than that at low and medium altitudes and reached significant level p 0 05 table 2 however there was no significant difference between low and medium altitudes under rf the effects at high and low altitudes were better than that at medium altitudes but there was no significant difference between high and low altitudes under different soil types the effect of farming practices on yield varied in this meta analysis the cultivated soil layer of the experimental land was subdivided as sandy loam clay silty loam sandy clay loam and loam the impact of different soil types on crop yield under rffm rf and fm is shown in table 3 in general clay was most suitable for fm and rffm to improve crop yield while loam was most unsuitable the effects of soil types on the increases in yield under rffm reached a significant level p 0 05 table 2 under rf sandy clay loam had the best effect followed by sandy loam for all soil types except for silty loam the effect of two mulching practices rf and rffm was significantly better than that of rf and it reached a significant level for sandy clay loam for loam and sandy clay loam the effect of fm 33 0 20 0 was slightly better than that of rffm 28 8 19 1 but it was not significant 3 5 crop yield and wp as influenced by farming practices under different air temperature and precipitation conditions since there were only one pair of yield and wp observations fm and control included in the subgroup of temperature greater than 20 c without replicates this subgroup was removed from the meta analysis the effect of rffm was better than rf and fm in improving yield and wp of crops in different temperature and rainfall zones fig 5 at the same time fm was slightly better than rf the two film mulching practices rffm and fm performed better at low rainfall than at high rainfall vice versa under rf rffm increased crop yield and wp by 33 4 and 36 1 at low rainfall 400 mm higher than those of 26 6 and 35 0 at high rainfall 400 mm respectively fm increased crop yield and wp by 28 9 and 26 7 at low rainfall higher than those of 19 2 and 22 4 at high rainfall respectively however rf increased crop yield and wp by 14 6 and 13 9 when rainfall 400 mm lower than those of 17 6 and 17 1 when rainfall 400 mm under the two mulching practices fm and rffm the effects of temperature on the yield were significant p 0 05 table 2 however the effect of ridge furrow planting practices rffm and rf on wp increased with increasing temperature the mean effect of rffm was 28 6 34 2 and 40 7 at low medium and high air temperatures while the corresponding values of rf were 5 6 13 2 and 23 7 respectively 3 6 crop yield and wp as influenced by seeding method for furrow or bed planting in this study ridge furrow planting was generally divided into furrow planting and bed planting in general the effects of ridge furrow planting pattern were affected by the location of the planting and it was found that the effect size of the planting in the furrow was significantly larger than that of the bed planting fig 6 meanwhile the effect of different planting methods on yield increases reached a very significant level p 0 01 under rffm and the effect of different planting methods on wp increase reached a significant level p 0 05 under rf table 2 on the other hand the effect of ridge furrow planting with film mulching rffm on crop yield and wp was greater than that of ridge furrow planting without film mulching rf 4 discussion 4 1 responses of crop yield evapotranspiration and wp to farming practices in terms of potato yield it was reported that mulched ridge cultivation was more effective than bare ridge cultivation and bare ridge cultivation was better than flat cultivation tian et al 2003 eldoma et al 2016 found that film mulching increased the surface temperature of the soil so as to promote plant growth and the ridges allowed rainwater to flow into the planting belts and furrows increasing the ability to collect rainwater li et al 2004 suggested that excessive rain and water seepage ensured the supply of deep soil moisture at critical growth periods of the crop similar to the conclusions of this meta analysis the three farming practices can increase crop yield and crop water productivity the mean effect of rffm was larger than rf and fm and the effect of fm was larger than that of rf yu et al 2018 also concluded that rffm had better effect on increasing soil temperature maintaining soil moisture and increasing yield than flat planting with film mulching ridge furrow planting with straw mulching and flat planting with straw mulching film mulching causes the evaporated air to condense into water droplets which significantly reduces evaporation from the soil surface li et al 2013 it was also reported that ridge cultivation was able to eliminate or reduce soil crust greatly improve soil physical conditions and field microclimate improve nitrogen use efficiency and reduce crop lodging and the occurrence of some wheat diseases in northern china wang et al 2004 the ridge furrow planting system with plastic mulching has been shown to reduce rainwater losses reduce evaporation and improve soil moisture content zhao et al 2014 ali et al 2018 making full use of limited rainwater will inevitably lead to an increase in crop yields on the other hand it has been reported that ridges covered with plastic film could significantly extend the duration of photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence and produce higher wp and crop yield liao et al 2005 however the meta analysis showed that the differences in seasonal et of crops were not significant which was similar to the study of lian et al 2016 who found that planting patterns had no effect on crop et however some studies have found that rffm reduced et li et al 2019 and some studies have shown that it increased et li et al 2013 the water consumption of crops is determined by the amount of soil evaporation and transpiration of crop leaves it has been reported that evaporation dominates et during the prenatal period whereas transpiration is the main mechanism of water consumption at the later stage of crop growth lian et al 2016 at the early growth stage of crop the canopy is small and the film prevents the heat exchange between the soil and the air reduces the latent heat flux and at the same time reduces the evaporation of water vapor on the soil surface which can thus reduce the evaporation compared with the non film treatment ye et al 2012 on the other hand ridges significantly increase the surface area of the soil thereby increasing evaporation this explains that rf increased the water consumption of crops fig 3b and their mean effect size was slightly greater than zero at the late growth stage of crops all the three practices were better for promoting crop growth compared with f thereby increasing canopy size and transpiration tian et al 2003 liang et al 2018 therefore the water consumption of rffm and fm systems during the whole growing season increased or decreased compared with f depending on the relationship between effect size e of reduced soil evaporation at the early growth stage and the effect value of increased transpiration during the prosperous season t when δt was greater than δe the et of rffm or ffm was higher than that of f and if δt was less than δe the et of rffm or ffm was lower than that of f lian et al 2016 4 2 crop yield and wp as influenced by farming practices in different climatic regions air temperature and rainfall the regional differences in crop yield and wp as influenced by ridge furrow planting and film mulching can be caused by variations in climatic conditions e g accumulated temperature rainfall and solar radiation in northern china especially in the northwest region semi arid regions most of the agricultural cultivation is rain fed agriculture and most of them are single cropping system table 1 zhang et al 2011 crop production in this area is largely affected by seasonal rainfall amount and its distribution and water resources are extremely precious and become a major factor affecting crop growth liu et al 2014 the ridge has the function of collecting rainwater which can enhance the drought resisting time and the film can effectively maintain the soil moisture and make full use of the effective and ineffective rainfall which can alleviate the water shortage in the arid areas li et al 2004 meanwhile the cool climate annual average temperature is lower than 10 c makes the northwest region highly ideal for growing potato cotton and other crops gao et al 2019 furthermore the film can increase the soil surface temperature at the earlier growth stages of crops similarly ridges can increase the temperature of the soil by increasing the curvature of the soil surface thus those two framing practices promote the emergence at relatively low temperatures and accelerate crop growth in northwestern china rffm can significantly improve the water utilization by enhancing water infiltration and inhibiting evaporation and stimulate strong alternation of dry and wet soils to redistribute limited water so as to ensure the growth of maize during water sensitive periods zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 therefore both ridges furrow and film mulching have the great potential to increase crop yield and crop water productivity in northwestern china ridge furrow rainfall harvesting and film mulching technology provide opportunities for increasing crop yields in cool and dry environments by enhancing soil temperature and water availability li and gong 2002 when the water supply is sufficient the positive effect of film mulching and ridge furrow is weaken dong et al 2017 this can possible explain the mean effect of film mulching and ridge furrow planting pattern on crop yield and wp was larger at low rainfall than at high rainfall fig 5a b in southwestern china the impact was not obvious because of the large amount of rainfall and the high annual average air temperature table 1 fig 4a however some studies have also shown that ridges did not significantly affect maize germination growth and development which may be due to that no rain was intercepted by planting belts or furrows under very limited rainfall conditions and the role of the furrow collecting system had not been exerted in general the greater the rainfall amount the greater the runoff amount especially when the rainfall is large the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate the rainwater will run off from the furrow therefore the effect of ridging on increasing production and wp is limited tian et al 2003 the rffm technique seems to be a promising farming practice for promoting the potato emergence enhancing the plant height extending the relative reproductive stages and consequently increasing the dry matter and yield in the seasonal arid rain fed regions in southwest china or in other similar agroecosystems liang et al 2018 liu s two year continuous trial in the northeast china liu et al 2016 found the average soil water storage capacity of rffm treatment increased during the whole observation period of maize compared with the control plastic film mulching and ridge cultivation speeded up the germination and promoted growth of crops by increasing soil temperature but the effect was not evident at high temperatures li and gong 2002 we found that the two film mulching practices fm and rffm had slightly better production effects at low temperatures 10 than at medium high temperatures p 0 05 fig 5a table 2 for rffm high temperatures had better wp than low medium temperatures fig 5b which can be possibly due to that higher accumulated temperature promoted the vegetative growth of plants more dry matter accumulated and wp eventually increased on the other hand some reports indicated that potato yield might be reduced by using light plastic mulch because soil temperature could rise above the optimal level during a period of potato growth baghour et al 2002 proper temperature will not only lead to early emergence but also increase the emergence rate zhao et al 2012 while low soil temperature will prolong the emergence time of crops without mulching gan et al 2013 this can also explain why the effect of rf in production and wp increases at low temperatures was significantly lower than the two mulching effects fm rffm 4 3 crop yield as influenced by farming practices under different geographical conditions altitude and soil type the growth and production of crops require sufficient heat rain and nutrients if the supply is insufficient it will affect their growth and productivity obviously altitude does not directly affect the physiological growth and production process of crops but it indirectly affect them by changing the climatic conditions of light heat water fertilizer and so on chen 2010 as an important topographic factor altitude has a great influence on temperature generally speaking air temperature decreases with the increase of altitude the temperature decreases about 0 6 every 100 m above the sea level and the daily temperature difference also increases gradually which has an impact on the plant growth process pan et al 2009 however we have found that mulching had greater potential to promote the growth and development of crops at lower temperatures this may explain why the two mulching treatments at high altitudes rffm 41 6 fm33 1 were better than the flat planting in increasing yield than at low medium elevations and reached a significant level p 0 05 fig 4b table 2 another study by qi et al 2007 showed that as the altitude continued to increase the temperature difference between day and night increased the film can play a role in increasing temperature and moisture and the content and proportion of photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll in the plant increase which is conducive to enhancing the absorption of light energy in current field production most of the water nutrients affect wheat production through soil and are affected by soil properties to show different effects on yield zhao and song 2008 different soil types have a greater impact on quality traits yield and yield factors of high quality wheat wang et al 2006 studies have shown that the medium loam has both the advantages of sand and clay such as good aeration and permeability relatively stable soil temperature good tillability good crop growth and stamina suitable for wheat growth and development wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 concluded that the order of average yield of rice was in the order of light clay silty loam heavy clay silty clay loam and recommend that the difference in rice yield mainly came from the difference in comprehensive fertility of different soils we found that under rf and rffm the order of effect on production increment followed the order of clay sandy clay loam silty loam loam and reached a very significant level under rffm p 0 01 table 2 table 3 zhang et al 2017 found that due to poor permeability 25 kpa water potential measured at 15 cm soil depth was suitable for controlling water depth in clay increasing yield but causing drought stress in loam and reduced rice yield similar to the results of our two film mulching practices clay soil had the best yield increase and loam soil had the worst yield increase however loam was slightly better than clay under rf which may be due to the poor water permeability of clay compared with other soils it is easy for rainfall to drain after the accumulation on ridges and in furrows however the rainfall loss may not change with the soil texture after mulching on the ridges and the loss of rainfall will affect the water use of plants thus affecting crop yield 4 4 crop yield and wp as influenced by seeding method for furrow planting or bed planting the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system is a new type of plastic film mulching cultivation technology including rain collection zone ridge and planting zone furrow which is furrow planting gan et al 2013 the ridge furrow planting in the furrow creates a three dimensional canopy due to the existence of ridges and furrows and a convenient channel for ventilation and light transmission which is conductive to the accumulation of dry matter it also reduces runoff due to the accumulation of rainfall and inhibits soil ineffective evaporation thereby increasing soil moisture content crop yield and crop water productivity zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2011 found that the soil water storage was greater for furrow planting than that for bed planting during the whole growth period ren et al 2007 reported that ridge tillage and furrow planting effectively improved root length root surface area root volume and root dry matter weight which was conductive to the growth and development of maize under the furrow planting mode the absorption of a large number of elements was higher than that of the flat planting mode which was related to the concentration of fertilizer in the furrow where the distance of nutrient transport was short and the nutrient availability around the rhizosphere of maize was higher dong et al 2019 the plants are planted on the ridges but the rainwater collected is mostly in the furrow it is difficult for the seeding roots to absorb more soil moisture in the ridges with bed planting liang et al 2018 the above discussion can explain why the effect of furrow planting was better than bed planting and the effect of planting method on wp was significant p 0 05 under rf and the effect of planting method on yield was extremely significant p 0 01 under rffm fig 6 table 2 5 conclusions our results showed that ridge furrow planting with film mulching rffm ridge furrow planting without film mulching rf and flat planting with film mulching fm significantly increased crop yield 33 8 16 6 27 0 and wp 35 8 17 5 27 8 compared to flat planting without film mulching however the changes in seasonal crop evapotranspiration of various farming practices were not significant different it can be seen that rffm performed better than fm and rf and fm was better than rf in crop yield and wp increases in addition the effects of various farming practices varied with annual mean air temperature altitudes and soil types in general in terms of increasing crop yield and crop water productivity rffm fm and rf were more suitable for potato especially in northwest china at the same time it is more favorable for ridge mulching at low rainfall and the furrow planting was better than the bed planting the effect of yield increase at high altitudes was better than that at low and mid altitudes under rf and rffm the increase in yield was better for clay soil than that for loam soil in conclusion rffm was recommended as the best farming practice in china especially in northwest china further study is needed to investigate the effect of

increases in crop yields under rffm rf and fm were greater in regions with seasonal rainfall 400 mm than in regions with seasonal rainfall 400 mm rffm rf and fm performed better in northwest china

altitude regions the two film mulching practices fm and rffm attained greater yield increases with regards to the two ridge furrow practices rffm and rf it is better to plant crops in the furrow than on the ridge in short rffm was most effective to improve yield and wp of wheat maize and potato among the farming practices these findings have important implications for choosing appropriate field management practices to improve crop yield and crop water productivity in china keywords farming practices ridge furrow planting film mulching yield crop water productivity meta analysis 1 introduction due to the shortage of water resources and low temperature in spring in many regions of china the key to improving crop productivity is to maximize the preservation and consumption of soil moisture and to improve crop water productivity wp of crops ren et al 2008 shan and yan 2013 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 farming practices such as ridge furrow planting

increasing soil temperature and moisture gan et al 2013 duan et al 2018 zheng et al 2018a 2018b wang et al 2019b 2019c while ridge furrow planting can collect effective or ineffective rainfall liang et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 at the same time strengthening the circulation of soil air by ridges is also a high efficient farming method to increase crop production as a new farming practice ridge furrow planting with plastic film mulching rffm combines the advantages of both which improves wp and increases production by employing ridges mulched with plastic film as the runoff area and furrows

emergence rate liang et al 2018 zhao et al 2012 the ridges improve the micro environment of soils zhang et al 2011 prolong the period of moisture availability ren et al 2016 while the furrows not only

single field trails cannot assess the comprehensive influence of ridge furrow planting and plastic film mulching on regional and larger scales gao et al 2019 meta analysis is a powerful statistical tool to summarize results from numerous single experiments while accounting for variability across experiments hedges et al 1999 and there have been many meta analysis reports in agricultural studies daryanto et al 2016 li et al 2018 ma et al 2018 wang et al 2015a wang et al 2015a found that the effect of ridge furrow mulching was better than flat mulching and the effect of mulching was better under low rainfall 150 mm than under moderate rainfall 150 250 mm and high rainfall 250 mm and put forward that ridge furrow mulching was the most suitable mulching practice compared with conventional film straw or other mulching li et al 2018 reported that the improvements of potato yield and wp of film and straw mulching were higher at moderate air temperatures 15 20 c than those at low and high temperatures and the mean effects of mulching were greater at relatively low or moderate fertilization rates gao et al 2019 recommended that plastic film mulching had the most obvious effect on increasing yield of potato compared with other crops ma et al 2018 indicated that plastic mulching increased soil moisture content and fertilizer residue on the soil surface 0 20 cm but effectively reduced the organic carbon of 0 10 cm soil layer and did not pose impact on the organic carbon of 10 20 cm soil layer yu et al 2018 indicated that the ridge furrow planting and plastic film mulching system had the greatest increase in soil water content soil temperature and grain yield compared with flat cultivation without mulching all those findings imply that soil mulching is beneficial to nutrient absorption crop water productivity and yield increase and film mulching on the ridge is better than that on flat land previous meta analyses have only studied the effects of film mulching or straw mulching on crops under different climatic regions temperature rainfall and nitrogen application rates qin et al 2015 gao et al 2019 wang et al 2015a li et al 2018 yu et al 2018 ma et al 2018 while little attention has been paid to the effect of different farming practices such as ridge furrow planting on crop yield and crop water productivity under various altitudes soil types and seeding methods particularly a comprehensive review on the effects of farming practices on various crops such as wheat maize and potato has been lacking rice wheat maize and potato are the world s major food crops which play a critical role in china s food production however there are very limited field trials on ridge furrow and film mulching techniques in rice so only papers on wheat maize and potato

the concerned variables in ridge furrow and mulching treatments rffm rf and fm and in flat planting with non mulching treatment f respectively for ease of explanation all analysis results in this study were reported as percentage changes of farming practices to the control r 1 100 du et al 2018 since most studies collected in this study did not provide variance an unweighted approach proposed by chen et al 2013 was considered by using meta win 2 1 rosenberg et al 2000 a random effect model was used to assess the impact of rffm rf and fm on crop yield and wp compared with f when the number of observations was less than 20 bootstrapping with 9999 iterations was used to generate bias corrected 95 confidence interval ci of mean effect sizes because confidence limits based on bootstrapping tests were wider than standard confidence limits daryanto et al 2016 differences in the mean effect size among groups were calculated using random effect models borenstein et al 2011 the difference was considered significant if the bootstrap confidence interval did not overlap each other the effect of farming practices was considered significantly different from conventional flat planting p 0 05 if the 95 ci did not reach zero groups of the meta analysis must have at least two valid comparisons the frequency distribution of r was plotted to reflect variability of individual study meanwhile the frequency of the r was also fitted to the gaussian distribution function to test the uniformity of observed data by using origin v8 0 software the general linear model unvariate procedure was performed to determine the effects of each variable on yield and wp of crop using the spss statistical software version 20 0 for windows spss chicago usa explanatory variables considered in this meta analysis included planting region climatic condition altitude soil type and seeding method supplementary appendix b 3 results 3 1 meta data overview our dataset contained 964 observations from 90 studies including 688 treatment data rffm rf and fm and 276 control data f rffm rf and fm had a total of 435 147 and 106 yield comparison observations with 342 73 and 91 w p comparison observations respectively maize potato wheat had a total of 233 230 and 227 production comparison observations and 205 107 and 194 w p comparison observations respectively frequency distributions of effect size of relevant data in all studies were found to have a normal distribution fig 2 indicating that the dataset was subject to uniformity results of the statistical analysis of the effects of crop type planting region rainfall air temperature altitude soil type and seeding method on yield and wp of wheat maize and potato are summarized in table 2 3 2 responses of crop yield evapotranspiration and wp to farming practices compared with the conventional flat planting without film mulching f the three farming practices of rffm rf and fm significantly increased yield and crop water productivity of wheat maize and potato but the effect on the crop evapotranspiration et was not obvious different farming practices significantly increased mean crop yields rffm 33 8 rf 16 6 ffm 27 0 fig 3 a slightly influenced et rffm 1 9 rf 2 4 ffm 1 1 fig 3b and strongly increased wp rffm 35 8 rf 17 5 ffm 27 8 fig 3c overall rffm had the greatest effect on crop yield and wp increases followed by fm and rf except that the yield of wheat under rffm 23 7 was slightly lower than that under fm 26 1 as for crops the three farming practices performed best for potato with regards to yield followed by maize and wheat the three farming practices also performed best on potato in terms of wp with the maximum value of 45 0 under rffm while the minimum value of 12 2 was obtained for maize under rf in addition crop type had significant effect on yield and wp increases p 0 05 under rffm table 2 in terms of crop et fm and rf slightly increased water consumption while rffm slightly reduced water consumption but the effect was not significant 3 3 crop yield and wp as influenced by farming practices in different climatic regions according to similarity of geographic and climatic conditions administrative division and analogous natural farming regions of crops in china zhao et al 2016 xu et al 2017 the study areas of those crops were divided into six planting regions table 1 crop yield were affected by mulching practices as the planting region changed fig 4 a in northeast china there was only one set of data so it was excluded from this meta analysis in general the ridge furrow and mulching effect in northwest china was better than that in other regions followed by central china and finally southwest china as for rffm the highest increase in crop yield was found in northwest china 33 1 followed by north central china 21 3 and the lowest yield increase was obtained in southwest china 7 7 similar trends were observed under rf and fm these results are similar to those of gao s meta analysis on the effect of mulching practices gao et al 2019 under rffm the effect of climatic regions on yield reached a significant level p 0 05 table 2 3 4 crop yield as influenced by farming practices under different geographical conditions altitude and soil type in fact the altitude also affected the effect of farming practices on crop yield fig 4b at high altitudes 1500 m the effect of two mulching practices fm and rffm 41 6 33 1 was significantly higher than that of rf 16 2 p 0 05 fig 4b table 2 at high altitudes the effect of fm and rffm was better than that at low and medium altitudes and reached significant level p 0 05 table 2 however there was no significant difference between low and medium altitudes under rf the effects at high and low altitudes were better than that at medium altitudes but there was no significant difference between high and low altitudes under different soil types the effect of farming practices on yield varied in this meta analysis the cultivated soil layer of the experimental land was subdivided as sandy loam clay silty loam sandy clay loam and loam the impact of different soil types on crop yield under rffm rf and fm is shown in table 3 in general clay was most suitable for fm and rffm to improve crop yield while loam was most unsuitable the effects of soil types on the increases in yield under rffm reached a significant level p 0 05 table 2 under rf sandy clay loam had the best effect followed by sandy loam for all soil types except for silty loam the effect of two mulching practices rf and rffm was significantly better than that of rf and it reached a significant level for sandy clay loam for loam and sandy clay loam the effect of fm 33 0 20 0 was slightly better than that of rffm 28 8 19 1 but it was not significant 3 5 crop yield and wp as influenced by farming practices under different air temperature and precipitation conditions since there were only one pair of yield and wp observations fm and control included in the subgroup of temperature greater than 20 c without replicates this subgroup was removed from the meta analysis the effect of rffm was better than rf and fm in improving yield and wp of crops in different temperature and rainfall zones fig 5 at the same time fm was slightly better than rf the two film mulching practices rffm and fm performed better at low rainfall than at high rainfall vice versa under rf rffm increased crop yield and wp by 33 4 and 36 1 at low rainfall 400 mm higher than those of 26 6 and 35 0 at high rainfall 400 mm respectively fm increased crop yield and wp by 28 9 and 26 7 at low rainfall higher than those of 19 2 and 22 4 at high rainfall respectively however rf increased crop yield and wp by 14 6 and 13 9 when rainfall 400 mm lower than those of 17 6 and 17 1 when rainfall 400 mm under the two mulching practices fm and rffm the effects of temperature on the yield were significant p 0 05 table 2 however the effect of ridge furrow planting practices rffm and rf on wp increased with increasing temperature the mean effect of rffm was 28 6 34 2 and 40 7 at low medium and high air temperatures while the corresponding values of rf were 5 6 13 2 and 23 7 respectively 3 6 crop yield and wp as influenced by seeding method for furrow or bed planting in this study ridge furrow planting was generally divided into furrow planting and bed planting in general the effects of ridge furrow planting pattern were affected by the location of the planting and it was found that the effect size of the planting in the furrow was significantly larger than that of the bed planting fig 6 meanwhile the effect of different planting methods on yield increases reached a very significant level p 0 01 under rffm and the effect of different planting methods on wp increase reached a significant level p 0 05 under rf table 2 on the other hand the effect of ridge furrow planting with film mulching rffm on crop yield and wp was greater than that of ridge furrow planting without film mulching rf 4 discussion 4 1 responses of crop yield evapotranspiration and wp to farming practices in terms of potato yield it was reported that mulched ridge cultivation was more effective than bare ridge cultivation and bare ridge cultivation was better than flat cultivation tian et al 2003 eldoma et al 2016 found that film mulching increased the surface temperature of the soil so as to promote plant growth and the ridges allowed rainwater to flow into the planting belts and furrows increasing the ability to collect rainwater li et al 2004 suggested that excessive rain and water seepage ensured the supply of deep soil moisture at critical growth periods of the crop similar to the conclusions of this meta analysis the three farming practices can increase crop yield and crop water productivity the mean effect of rffm was larger than rf and fm and the effect of fm was larger than that of rf yu et al 2018 also concluded that rffm had better effect on increasing soil temperature maintaining soil moisture and increasing yield than flat planting with film mulching ridge furrow planting with straw mulching and flat planting with straw mulching film mulching causes the evaporated air to condense into water droplets which significantly reduces evaporation from the soil surface li et al 2013 it was also reported that ridge cultivation was able to eliminate or reduce soil crust greatly improve soil physical conditions and field microclimate improve nitrogen use efficiency and reduce crop lodging and the occurrence of some wheat diseases in northern china wang et al 2004 the ridge furrow planting system with plastic mulching has been shown to reduce rainwater losses reduce evaporation and improve soil moisture content zhao et al 2014 ali et al 2018 making full use of limited rainwater will inevitably lead to an increase in crop yields on the other hand it has been reported that ridges covered with plastic film could significantly extend the duration of photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence and produce higher wp and crop yield liao et al 2005 however the meta analysis showed that the differences in seasonal et of crops were not significant which was similar to the study of lian et al 2016 who found that planting patterns had no effect on crop et however some studies have found that rffm reduced et li et al 2019 and some studies have shown that it increased et li et al 2013 the water consumption of crops is determined by the amount of soil evaporation and transpiration of crop leaves it has been reported that evaporation dominates et during the prenatal period whereas transpiration is the main mechanism of water consumption at the later stage of crop growth lian et al 2016 at the early growth stage of crop the canopy is small and the film prevents the heat exchange between the soil and the air reduces the latent heat flux and at the same time reduces the evaporation of water vapor on the soil surface which can thus reduce the evaporation compared with the non film treatment ye et al 2012 on the other hand ridges significantly increase the surface area of the soil thereby increasing evaporation this explains that rf increased the water consumption of crops fig 3b and their mean effect size was slightly greater than zero at the late growth stage of crops all the three practices were better for promoting crop growth compared with f thereby increasing canopy size and transpiration tian et al 2003 liang et al 2018 therefore the water consumption of rffm and fm systems during the whole growing season increased or decreased compared with f depending on the relationship between effect size e of reduced soil evaporation at the early growth stage and the effect value of increased transpiration during the prosperous season t when δt was greater than δe the et of rffm or ffm was higher than that of f and if δt was less than δe the et of rffm or ffm was lower than that of f lian et al 2016 4 2 crop yield and wp as influenced by farming practices in different climatic regions air temperature and rainfall the regional differences in crop yield and wp as influenced by ridge furrow planting and film mulching can be caused by variations in climatic conditions e g accumulated temperature rainfall and solar radiation in northern china especially in the northwest region semi arid regions most of the agricultural cultivation is rain fed agriculture and most of them are single cropping system table 1 zhang et al 2011 crop production in this area is largely affected by seasonal rainfall amount and its distribution and water resources are extremely precious and become a major factor affecting crop growth liu et al 2014 the ridge has the function of collecting rainwater which can enhance the drought resisting time and the film can effectively maintain the soil moisture and make full use of the effective and ineffective rainfall which can alleviate the water shortage in the arid areas li et al 2004 meanwhile the cool climate annual average temperature is lower than 10 c makes the northwest region highly ideal for growing potato cotton and other crops gao et al 2019 furthermore the film can increase the soil surface temperature at the earlier growth stages of crops similarly ridges can increase the temperature of the soil by increasing the curvature of the soil surface thus those two framing practices promote the emergence at relatively low temperatures and accelerate crop growth in northwestern china rffm can significantly improve the water utilization by enhancing water infiltration and inhibiting evaporation and stimulate strong alternation of dry and wet soils to redistribute limited water so as to ensure the growth of maize during water sensitive periods zhang et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 therefore both ridges furrow and film mulching have the great potential to increase crop yield and crop water productivity in northwestern china ridge furrow rainfall harvesting and film mulching technology provide opportunities for increasing crop yields in cool and dry environments by enhancing soil temperature and water availability li and gong 2002 when the water supply is sufficient the positive effect of film mulching and ridge furrow is weaken dong et al 2017 this can possible explain the mean effect of film mulching and ridge furrow planting pattern on crop yield and wp was larger at low rainfall than at high rainfall fig 5a b in southwestern china the impact was not obvious because of the large amount of rainfall and the high annual average air temperature table 1 fig 4a however some studies have also shown that ridges did not significantly affect maize germination growth and development which may be due to that no rain was intercepted by planting belts or furrows under very limited rainfall conditions and the role of the furrow collecting system had not been exerted in general the greater the rainfall amount the greater the runoff amount especially when the rainfall is large the rainfall intensity is greater than the infiltration rate the rainwater will run off from the furrow therefore the effect of ridging on increasing production and wp is limited tian et al 2003 the rffm technique seems to be a promising farming practice for promoting the potato emergence enhancing the plant height extending the relative reproductive stages and consequently increasing the dry matter and yield in the seasonal arid rain fed regions in southwest china or in other similar agroecosystems liang et al 2018 liu s two year continuous trial in the northeast china liu et al 2016 found the average soil water storage capacity of rffm treatment increased during the whole observation period of maize compared with the control plastic film mulching and ridge cultivation speeded up the germination and promoted growth of crops by increasing soil temperature but the effect was not evident at high temperatures li and gong 2002 we found that the two film mulching practices fm and rffm had slightly better production effects at low temperatures 10 than at medium high temperatures p 0 05 fig 5a table 2 for rffm high temperatures had better wp than low medium temperatures fig 5b which can be possibly due to that higher accumulated temperature promoted the vegetative growth of plants more dry matter accumulated and wp eventually increased on the other hand some reports indicated that potato yield might be reduced by using light plastic mulch because soil temperature could rise above the optimal level during a period of potato growth baghour et al 2002 proper temperature will not only lead to early emergence but also increase the emergence rate zhao et al 2012 while low soil temperature will prolong the emergence time of crops without mulching gan et al 2013 this can also explain why the effect of rf in production and wp increases at low temperatures was significantly lower than the two mulching effects fm rffm 4 3 crop yield as influenced by farming practices under different geographical conditions altitude and soil type the growth and production of crops require sufficient heat rain and nutrients if the supply is insufficient it will affect their growth and productivity obviously altitude does not directly affect the physiological growth and production process of crops but it indirectly affect them by changing the climatic conditions of light heat water fertilizer and so on chen 2010 as an important topographic factor altitude has a great influence on temperature generally speaking air temperature decreases with the increase of altitude the temperature decreases about 0 6 every 100 m above the sea level and the daily temperature difference also increases gradually which has an impact on the plant growth process pan et al 2009 however we have found that mulching had greater potential to promote the growth and development of crops at lower temperatures this may explain why the two mulching treatments at high altitudes rffm 41 6 fm33 1 were better than the flat planting in increasing yield than at low medium elevations and reached a significant level p 0 05 fig 4b table 2 another study by qi et al 2007 showed that as the altitude continued to increase the temperature difference between day and night increased the film can play a role in increasing temperature and moisture and the content and proportion of photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll in the plant increase which is conducive to enhancing the absorption of light energy in current field production most of the water nutrients affect wheat production through soil and are affected by soil properties to show different effects on yield zhao and song 2008 different soil types have a greater impact on quality traits yield and yield factors of high quality wheat wang et al 2006 studies have shown that the medium loam has both the advantages of sand and clay such as good aeration and permeability relatively stable soil temperature good tillability good crop growth and stamina suitable for wheat growth and development wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 concluded that the order of average yield of rice was in the order of light clay silty loam heavy clay silty clay loam and recommend that the difference in rice yield mainly came from the difference in comprehensive fertility of different soils we found that under rf and rffm the order of effect on production increment followed the order of clay sandy clay loam silty loam loam and reached a very significant level under rffm p 0 01 table 2 table 3 zhang et al 2017 found that due to poor permeability 25 kpa water potential measured at 15 cm soil depth was suitable for controlling water depth in clay increasing yield but causing drought stress in loam and reduced rice yield similar to the results of our two film mulching practices clay soil had the best yield increase and loam soil had the worst yield increase however loam was slightly better than clay under rf which may be due to the poor water permeability of clay compared with other soils it is easy for rainfall to drain after the accumulation on ridges and in furrows however the rainfall loss may not change with the soil texture after mulching on the ridges and the loss of rainfall will affect the water use of plants thus affecting crop yield 4 4 crop yield and wp as influenced by seeding method for furrow planting or bed planting the ridge furrow rainfall harvesting system is a new type of plastic film mulching cultivation technology including rain collection zone ridge and planting zone furrow which is furrow planting gan et al 2013 the ridge furrow planting in the furrow creates a three dimensional canopy due to the existence of ridges and furrows and a convenient channel for ventilation and light transmission which is conductive to the accumulation of dry matter it also reduces runoff due to the accumulation of rainfall and inhibits soil ineffective evaporation thereby increasing soil moisture content crop yield and crop water productivity zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2011 found that the soil water storage was greater for furrow planting than that for bed planting during the whole growth period ren et al 2007 reported that ridge tillage and furrow planting effectively improved root length root surface area root volume and root dry matter weight which was conductive to the growth and development of maize under the furrow planting mode the absorption of a large number of elements was higher than that of the flat planting mode which was related to the concentration of fertilizer in the furrow where the distance of nutrient transport was short and the nutrient availability around the rhizosphere of maize was higher dong et al 2019 the plants are planted on the ridges but the rainwater collected is mostly in the furrow it is difficult for the seeding roots to absorb more soil moisture in the ridges with bed planting liang et al 2018 the above discussion can explain why the effect of furrow planting was better than bed planting and the effect of planting method on wp was significant p 0 05 under rf and the effect of planting method on yield was extremely significant p 0 01 under rffm fig 6 table 2 5 conclusions our results showed that ridge furrow planting with film mulching rffm ridge furrow planting without film mulching rf and flat planting with film mulching fm significantly increased crop yield 33 8 16 6 27 0 and wp 35 8 17 5 27 8 compared to flat planting without film mulching however the changes in seasonal crop evapotranspiration of various farming practices were not significant different it can be seen that rffm performed better than fm and rf and fm was better than rf in crop yield and wp increases in addition the effects of various farming practices varied with annual mean air temperature altitudes and soil types in general in terms of increasing crop yield and crop water productivity rffm fm and rf were more suitable for potato especially in northwest china at the same time it is more favorable for ridge mulching at low rainfall and the furrow planting was better than the bed planting the effect of yield increase at high altitudes was better than that at low and mid altitudes under rf and rffm the increase in yield was better for clay soil than that for loam soil in conclusion rffm was recommended as the best farming practice in china especially in northwest china further study is needed to investigate the effect of

10393,partial rootzone drying prd is an irrigation technique that usually applies less water than well watered control treatments to only part of the rootzone the irrigated side and alternates the irrigated and non irrigated sides however an incomplete understanding of the effects of its components decreased water application versus frequency of alternating the irrigated side on physiological responses of fruit crops such as papaya is considered to be a constraint for its adoption under semiarid conditions therefore a study was performed to determine effects of prd on soil water dynamics

differ among treatments but resultant differences in plant height and diameter growth rates were found to be significantly and positively related to yield decreasing the irrigation applied at moderate

frequency of every 7 14 days with a 35 reduction in the irrigation depth could become a viable technique to reduce the water footprint of papaya thus increasing the effective use of water under semiarid conditions keywords carica papaya semiarid conditions transpiration photosynthesis water footprint 1 introduction in tropical and subtropical regions with significant agricultural production climate changes may severely affect crop yield ipcc 2014 thus regions with low rainfall such as the semi arid region of northeastern brazil will be extremely vulnerable to global and regional climate changes and may become increasingly more arid in the coming century marengo and bernasconi 2015 indeed between 2012 and 2017 the semi arid region of northeastern brazil was severely affected by the most severe drought in the past few decades drastically reducing water use by agriculture marengo et al 2017 brazil s northeastern states bahia ceará and rio grande do norte are the largest production centers of papaya carica papaya l together producing 49 of all brazilian papaya fruit with an annual average of 628 404 tons ibge 2019 most field crops in brazilian semi arid regions are irrigated with papaya being highly responsive to soil water content and air vapor pressure deficit vpd campostrini and glenn 2007 campostrini et al 2010 2018 both factors decrease stomatal conductance causing stomatal limitations of photosynthesis and limiting plant growth and yield marler et al 1994 campostrini et al 2010 lima et al 2015 in fact water stress induced progressive decrease of photosynthetic rate a with drought intensity and a correlated positively resulting in decreased relative growth rate of papaya seedlings mahouachi et al 2006 overall the authors suggest an aba induced stomatal closure in order to reduce water loss although biochemical limitations could be involved as well in papaya plant reduced stomatal conductance gs in early stages of water stress inhibits transpiration rate e more than it reduces a due to the non linear relationship between a and gs morison et al 2008 lima 2014 regarding the intrinsic a gs and or instantaneous a e water use efficiency these variables are used as determinants to outline the performance of agricultural crops under water stress conditions thus both genotypes and treatments that result in increased intrinsic or instantaneous water use efficiency are almost always considered superior because they reduce the consumed water by assimilated co2 typically the increase in intrinsic or instantaneous water use efficiency is related to stomatal closure and reduced photosynthesis thus greater water use efficiency intrinsic or instantaneous comes at the expense of lower crop yield since both growth and yield are associated with stomatal opening blum 2009 roche 2015 in addition instantaneous water use efficiency measured at leaf scale can be misleading due to microclimate conditions within mini chambers used in portable gas exchange systems ferraz et al 2016 therefore the agronomic water use efficiency i e the water used by the crop in relation to the performance obtained through growth and yield is more appropriate in the context of agricultural production blum 2009 ferraz et al 2016 irrigation strategies such as partial root zone drying prd techniques can help to reduce crop water footprints and maximize water use efficiency wue without compromising photosynthesis and ultimately plant growth and yield jovanovic and stikic 2018 in papaya limited number of studies have evaluated such a strategy marler and discekici 1997 lima et al 2015 manjunath et al 2017 our study using field grown papaya may contribute to this effort through use of the prd technique for increasing agronomic water use efficiency reducing the water footprint and understanding the effects of prd on papaya physiological activity prd irrigates only half of the horizontal root zone during given irrigation event and stimulates stomatal closure in the unwatered zone while maintaining sufficient water supply within the wetted part of the rootzone to sustain normal fruit development loveys et al 2000 el sadek 2014 prolonged drying of part of the root system diminishes the effect of prd on stomata stoll et al 2000 presumably as root sourced abscisic acid aba signaling decreases along with the sap flow from the drying roots dodd et al 2008 to avoid excessive drying of the roots the wet dry sides are alternated to ensure part of the root system is exposed on drying soil to sustain root sourced aba signaling dodd et al 2015 implementing prd can increase water and nutrient use efficiencies and improve the nutritional and health attributes of the different agricultural species and in some cases sustain or even increase their yield jovanovic and stikic 2018 lima et al 2015 showed that while there was evidence of non hydraulic signals inducing stomatal closure in the prd treatments in field and greenhouse studies these effects in field grown of papaya were insufficient to alter dry matter partitioning biomass or yield components since there were no significant differences between prd and regulated deficit irrigation rdi at either a 30 or 50 water deficit however a 50 water deficit in the greenhouse study for the prd treatment was sufficient to significantly reduce biomass and alter the dry matter partitioning compared with the control treatment lima et al 2015 in the field study using prd a 30 water deficit alternation every 7 days with a 30 reduction in irrigation water depth did not significantly reduced vegetative growth or yield components compared with control in addition lima et al 2015 showed that the physiological response of papaya to prd was more affected in greenhouse grown than in field grown papaya in the greenhouse study the roots are limited to the volume of the pot while under field conditions rainfall can increase water availability in the soil and the roots can explore larger volume of soil in addition previous work was done using different amounts of applied water and application intervals in papaya plants and the authors found that the quality of tainung 1 papaya produced by partial root zone drying in semi arid conditions was not affected castricini et al 2019 thus future work related to gas exchange traits should be done to quantify the irrigated side alternation frequencies using the prd as well as studies related to reductions in irrigation water depth iwd in papaya furthermore papaya plants can be considered as suitable for receiving the prd technique because no unique relationship of stomatal conductance with pre dawn xylem potential or relative leaf water content has been reported marler et al 1994 therefore stomatal responses of papaya plants are associated with root sourced aba signaling to greater extent mahouachi et al 2006 in different crops grown with prd under semi arid conditions the frequency of alternation of the irrigated side is considered one of the bottlenecks of knowledge related to this technique therefore understanding how the frequency of prd alternation interacts with decreased irrigation volume to affect growth and leaf gas exchange of carica papaya can inform better management of prd in addition since drought conditions are expected to become more frequent worldwide due to climate change a better understanding of moderate water stress on papaya physiology will be of utmost importance to reduce the water footprint thus our hypothesis is that decreasing the frequency of prd alternation is necessary to change the single leaf exchange thereby enhancing agronomic and single leaf water use efficiency of papaya 2 material and methods 2 1 material growth conditions and

thinned hand weeding occurred within the plant rows and mechanical weeding between rows through a brush cutter coupled to a tractor once the economic damage level was reached pests and diseases were controlled chemically being sprayed with insecticides of the chemical group avermectin and kumulus and fungicides of the chemical group score according to manufacturers recommendations phosporous and micronutrients were used as side dressing application during planting nitrogen and potassium were applied as fertigation every 15 days during the growth and production phases the quantities were based on the soil chemical analysis according to sanches and dantas 1999 the fertigations were applied on the irrigated side of the crop row both sides received the same quantity of fertilizer every month

of the irrigated side with greater applied irrigation amount of water prd7 35 dried the soil least by 43 on average on the non irrigated side fig 5 in contrast in treatments prd21 50 and prd21 35 the lowest frequency of alternation of the irrigated side every 21 days dried the soil the most by 77 and 72 respectively in the available soil water content on the side subjected to drying these values represent reductions of 13 prd7 35 47 prd21 50 and 42 prd21 35 compared with the lower limit 70 of available soil water content bernardo et al 2019 corresponding to the critical moisture or water potential f established for papaya fig 5 available soil water content in the full irrigation treatment varied from 72 to 100 fig 5 a range that is above the lower limit of available water 70 required by papaya for the absence of yield reduction bernardo et al 2019 alternation of the irrigated side every 14 days prd 50 and 35 decreased soil available water on the non irrigated side by about 50 and

the highest a was verified in prd7 35 treatment plants while the lowest value was observed in plants subjected to prd21 50 fig 6b although without an apparent significant treatment effect the variation in soil water status caused by the applied treatments in 1 ha there was an increase of 11 112 kg in yield for every 1 μmol m 2 s 1 of co2 assimilated by papaya plants fig 6b the means of quantum efficiency of photosynthesis a par of papaya subjected to different irrigation treatments were similar p 0 05 fig 6c however there was a positive and significant relationship between fruit

from 8 00 a m to 1 00 p m fig 7a but across treatments this decrease was not significantly p 0 05 related to yield table 3 however the highest yields fi prd7 35 and prd14 35 treatments had a lower reduction of gs at 1 00 p m compared with the values of this variable at 8 00 a m fig 8 a in these treatments fi prd7 35 and prd14 35 the reductions in gs from 8 00 a m to 1 00 p m were 32 29 and 28 while in prd21 50 and osi 35 which had reduced yields the reductions were 50 and 44 respectively different from gs the response of e was the opposite positive and significant p 0 05 table 3 i e the treatments with higher yield had an increase in transpiration and this increase in e from 8 00 a m to 1 00 p m was equal to 46 in fi 29 in prd7 35 and 31 in prd14 35 fig 8b the treatments prd7 50 prd21 50 prd21 35 osi 50 and osi 35 had the smallest increments in e 15 25 and were similar to each other fig 8b however when comparing the e values at each time 8 00 a m and 1 00 p m there were no differences between treatments fig 7c statistical difference was observed only between the times of the day and in the treatments prd7 35 prd21 50 prd21 35 and fi unlike gs e values were higher at 1

treatments prd7 35 prd7 50 and prd21 50 had a significantly higher iwue than the other treatments fig 10a the treatments fi prd21 35 and osi 35 had the highest water footprint considering only the

observed in the treatments prd7 35 and 50 prd14 50 and 35 prd21 50 and osi 50 these treatments when compared with the strategies fi prd21 35 and osi 35 lead to savings of about 28 36 liters of water for each kilogram of fruit produced fig 10b and table 5 in addition the water footprint wfi was negatively and significantly p 0 05 correlated with the intrinsic water use efficiency table 3 that is as iwue increased the volume of water consumed to produce 1 kg of fruit decreased fig 10b 4 discussion 4 1 papaya x soil water availability papaya is one of the fruit crops with earliest production jiménez et al 2014 and the stages of growth flowering and fruit maturation occur simultaneously from the third or fourth month after planting coelho et al 2011 due to this intense development in regions with low levels and irregular distribution of rainfall as is the case of the semiarid region of brazil and also due to the ongoing climate changes it is essential to provide adequate and constant water supply through irrigation to achieve an excellent production potential coelho et al 2011 thus the success of the prd technique for papaya is directly associated with the adoption of a quantity of water applied lower than the evapotranspiration demand of the crop so that it maximizes the agronomic water use efficiency without reducing the quantity and quality of harvested fruits however depending on the climate soil type and crop the reduction in applied water and the frequency of alternation of the irrigated side can negatively affect the soil water availability to plants thus leading to severe water deficit lima et al 2015 in addition in this study with the tainung genotype in a semiarid region of brazil papaya was able to adjust to different irrigation depths as well as the different frequencies of alternation of water application in the root system thus this genotype proved to be a plant with high plasticity related to moderate water stress of the root such plasticity allows prd strategy to be applied under field condition to increase agronomic water use efficiency as well as reducing water footprint 4 2 effect of prd on leaf gas exchange the effects of soil water deficit associated with vpdair on papaya physiological processes depends on the time of day marler and mickelbart 1998 cloudiness and air temperature reis and campostrini 2008 in the present study the treatments prd21 50 osi 35 and prd7 50 led to the greatest reductions in gs from 8 00 a m to 1 00 p m with percentages ranging from 37 to 50 fig 8a on the other hand the largest increase in transpiration rates from 8 00 a m to 1 00 p m occurred in the fi treatment fig 8b in general the percentages of reduction gs and increment e are directly associated with the increase in vpdair from 8 00 a m 1 0 kpa to 1 00 p m 3 2 kpa and soil water availability in each treatment fig 5 although there was a reduction in gs transpiration rates increased at 1 00 p m due to the increase in vpdleaf air which is the driving force for the water vapor to escape through the stomata i e e gs vpdleaf air buckley 2005 the increase in vpdleaf air occurs due to the increase in leaf temperature associated with stomatal closure caused by a high atmospheric water demand increased vpdair and or soil water deficit and also an increase in solar radiation on leaf surface jones 2018 under prd conditions the water deficit on the side subjected to partial root system drying can trigger myriad physiological responses in papaya plants lima et al 2015 2016 the reduction of gs is one of the fastest responses to water deficit schroeder et al 2001 resulting in decreased transpiration lima et al 2015 campostrini et al 2018 however in this experiment under field conditions when compared with fi the treatments with prd did not reduce gs a and e both at 8 00 a m and at 1 00 p m fig 7 this fact can demonstrate that the genotype studied tainung can be considered a near anisohydric genotype with although marler et al 1994 showed that the red lady papaya genotype reduced its stomatal conductance at soil water potential close to 37 kpa without any change in the relative water content this result obtained by marler et al 1994 suggested a near isohydric behavior these authors report that the reduction in gs keeping the relative water content at high values may be related to an adaptation of this species to water limitation the same sensitivity of the stomata due to soil water limitation was reported by lima et al 2015 in the gran golden genotype cultivated in prd under both field and greenhouse conditions although stomata play a critical role in regulating water loss by plants and are required to be responsive to changes related to the soil plant atmosphere system collins et al 2010 apparently prd technique changed the stomatal responses of tainung papaya effectively changing its behavior from isohydric to anisohydric such anisohydric behavior in this present experiment can be observed through the similar gs values between 8 00 a m and 1 00 p m fig 7c as well as through the values of ci and ci ca ratio table 4 in fact in the same species differences in isohydric anisohydric behaviors may be caused by growing conditions to which the plant is subjected such as the speed of substrate dehydration and soil texture more friable can promote greater water absorption capacity through the growth deepening of the root system which could characterize an intrinsic property of the plant hochberg et al 2018 responses of stomata to vpdair are significantly affected by two intrinsically linked factors aba and soil drying davies et al 2002 mahouachi et al 2007 collins et al 2010 brodribb and mcadam 2017 stomatal response of plants to aba changes considerably with varying vpdair or leaf water potential where both hydraulic and chemical signals play a role in stomatal closure tardieu and simonneau 1998 although gs values decreased at 1 00 p m in the treatment prd21 50 fig 7a the stomata of the genotype tainung seem not be affected by the water limitation in the soil in the treatments used combined with high values of vpdair observed at the times when gas exchange was evaluated fig 4 thus overall under the conditions studied the stomata of the tainung genotype showed reduced sensitivity to the water limitations imposed by the applied treatments however even with reduced sensitivity there was an increase in agronomic and intrinsic water use efficiencies figs 9 and 10 table 5 and reduction in water footprint values fig 10 table 5 reduction in stomatal opening causes lower co2 availability in intercellular spaces reducing assimilation at the carboxylation sites of rubisco brodribb et al 2015 however in this study the internal co2 concentration in the mesophyll and the ci ca ratio were not statistically different among treatments table 4 which indeed strengthens the indication of absence of biochemical damage to the processes associated with leaf gas exchange of the studied genotype 4 3 effect of prd on water use although there were no significant differences between the applied treatments in the variables related to gas exchange gs e and a fig 7 and table 4 the variables height growth rate hgr and diameter growth rate dgr had a positive and significant relationship with yield fig 9a and 9b table 3 with the treatments fi and prd7 35 standing out in terms of hgr the prd7 35 treatment received a lower amount of water when compared with fi besides having higher iwue and awue and reduced wf fig 10 these responses demonstrate the efficiency of this treatment in tainung papaya cultivated in the semiarid region of brazil the intrinsic water use efficiency a gs is used as a determinant to delineate the performance of agricultural crops under water stress conditions thus genotypes or treatments that result in increased intrinsic efficiency are almost always considered superior because they reduce the water consumed per co2 assimilated blum 2009 typically the increase in intrinsic water use efficiency comes at the expense of accentuated stomatal closure and moderate reduction in photosynthesis thus higher intrinsic water use efficiency can be nullified by the lower crop yield since growth and yield are associated with stomatal opening blum 2009 roche 2015 therefore the agronomic water use efficiency relationship between growth yield and water transpired by the crop is more appropriate in the context of agricultural production blum 2009 ferraz et al 2016 awueheight mm day 1 l 1 and awue g fruit l 1 decreased as the irrigation depth increased except for the treatment prd7 35 which had a high value fig 9c despite receiving a water depth higher than that of the treatments subjected to 50 reduction table 2 the prd7 35 treatment had an awueheight and awue statistically similar to those of the other treatments with higher values of their means fig 9c this similarity in terms of water use efficiency can be justified by the maintenance of net photosynthetic rate at adequate levels in these plants in the prd7 35 treatment fig 7 the highest frequency of alternation of the irrigated side every 7 days associated with the application of the irrigation depth with 35 iwd reduction possibly contributed to maintaining the relative water content in the leaf pérez pérez et al 2018 within a range in which photosynthetic capacity and quantum yield were not negatively affected campostrini et al 2018 this fact may have contributed to the maintenance of photoassimilate production for support in growth and yield although the net photosynthetic rates did not show significant differences between the different irrigation strategies studied figs 6b and 7 b the possibility of the existence of a cumulative effect that is the sum of the small marginal differences day after day along the experimental period cannot be ruled out this effect may have contributed in some way to the final yield of papaya subjected to different irrigation treatments and to the significant difference between them fig 6b in addition different sensibility to increased vpdair among treatments may have influenced the final yield as well papaya cultivation under available soil water conditions of less than 70 for long periods can negatively affect fruit yield campostrini et al 2018 lima et al 2015 the results presented in this study corroborate this information since the strategies with higher soil water availability fi prd7 35 and prd14 35 fig 5 did not significantly reduce fruit yield fig 6b and still had high values of apparent quantum efficiency of photosynthesis a par fig 6c it is important to highlight that the treatments prd14 35 and osi 35 had very similar photosynthetic rates however the yield of the former was 15 higher than that of osi 35 therefore the alternation of the irrigated side can improve the intrinsic and agronomic water use efficiencies which is probably associated with better performance of the root system li et al 2007 indeed the fixed prd may restrict root system growth on the dry side which could reduce the capacity to absorb nutrients li et al 2007 which may affect yield fig 9a it is important to highlight that despite the reduction of fruit yield in the treatments prd7 50 prd14 50 prd21 50 and 35 and osi 50 and 35 compared with the other three treatments with best yields fi prd7 35 and prd14 35 figs 6b this average yield 67 000 70 000 kg ha 1 is higher than the averages of brazil 39 892 kg ha 1 and the state of bahia 36 009 kg ha 1 based on a survey conducted by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge 2019 besides iwue and awue the water footprint is an important variable associated with water consumption by a crop in a certain place and at a given time nouri et al 2019 higher awue leads to a lower water footprint as can be observed for prd7 35 table 5 however it is important to highlight that there was also a negative and significant relationship p 0 05 between water footprint and iwue fig 10b thus the strategies prd7 35 and prd14 35 are the most indicated to be introduced in irrigated areas of papaya production because they showed yields similar to that of the fi treatment and a reduced water footprint in the same range of treatments with iwd reduction of 50 fig 10b and table 5 considering the ongoing climate changes and consequently the need to effectively increases the awue by crops our findings provide new insights for water management in papaya plants especially in drier regions such as semi arid region of northeastern brazil in this way increasing the irrigation frequency i e between 7 and 14 days and reducing 35 the amount of water applied can increase awue without a yield penalty 5 conclusions the results confirmed the hypothesis that the prd with alternation of the irrigated side in a shorter time interval and with less reduction in the amount of water applied compared with fi i e prd7 35 and prd14 35 both with reduced midday depression in gs 01 00 pm can increase awue without compromising yield and gas exchange which were similar to those found in the fi treatment therefore under the growing conditions of this study and in tainung papaya the prd with irrigated side alternation frequency of every 7 14 days with a 35 reduction in the irrigation depth can be a viable technique to reduce the water footprint i e increase the effective use of water under semi arid conditions such as the brazilian ones declaration of competing interest the authors reported no

10393,partial rootzone drying prd is an irrigation technique that usually applies less water than well watered control treatments to only part of the rootzone the irrigated side and alternates the irrigated and non irrigated sides however an incomplete understanding of the effects of its components decreased water application versus frequency of alternating the irrigated side on physiological responses of fruit crops such as papaya is considered to be a constraint for its adoption under semiarid conditions therefore a study was performed to determine effects of prd on soil water dynamics leaf gas exchange yield water use efficiency and water footprint in field grown papaya yields and physiological measurements were evaluated under control full irrigation fi and restricted 50 and 35 reduction in irrigation water depth iwd irrigation with the irrigated side alternated every 0 7 14 and 21 days a drip irrigation system with three emitters on each side of the plant was used to apply surface drip irrigation as needed to supplement natural rainfall during the study period physiological functions including stomatal conductance gs transpiration e and net photosynthesis a did not differ among treatments but resultant differences in plant height and diameter growth rates were found to be significantly and positively related to yield decreasing the irrigation applied at moderate alternate frequency prd7 35 and prd14 35 increased agronomic water use efficiency of papaya awue without compromising its yield and gas exchange therefore prd strategy with irrigated side alternation frequency of every 7 14 days with a 35 reduction in the irrigation depth could become a viable technique to reduce the water footprint of papaya thus increasing the effective use of water under semiarid conditions keywords carica papaya semiarid conditions transpiration photosynthesis water footprint 1 introduction in tropical and subtropical regions with significant agricultural production climate changes may severely affect crop yield ipcc 2014 thus regions with low rainfall such as the semi arid region of northeastern brazil will be extremely vulnerable to global and regional climate changes and may become increasingly more arid in the coming century marengo and bernasconi 2015 indeed between 2012 and 2017 the semi arid region of northeastern brazil was severely affected by the most severe drought in the past few decades drastically reducing water use by agriculture marengo et al 2017 brazil s northeastern states bahia ceará and rio grande do norte are the largest production centers of papaya carica papaya l together producing 49 of all brazilian papaya fruit with an annual average of 628 404 tons ibge 2019 most field crops in brazilian semi arid regions are irrigated with papaya being highly responsive to soil water content and air vapor pressure deficit vpd campostrini and glenn 2007 campostrini et al 2010 2018 both factors decrease stomatal conductance causing stomatal limitations of photosynthesis and limiting plant growth and yield marler et al 1994 campostrini et al 2010 lima et al 2015 in fact water stress induced progressive decrease of photosynthetic rate a with drought intensity and a correlated positively resulting in decreased relative growth rate of papaya seedlings mahouachi et al 2006 overall the authors suggest an aba induced stomatal closure in order to reduce water loss although biochemical limitations could be involved as well in papaya plant reduced stomatal conductance gs in early stages of water stress inhibits transpiration rate e more than it reduces a due to the non linear relationship between a and gs morison et al 2008 lima 2014 regarding the intrinsic a gs and or instantaneous a e water use efficiency these variables are used as determinants to outline the performance of agricultural crops under water stress conditions thus both genotypes and treatments that result in increased intrinsic or instantaneous water use efficiency are almost always considered superior because they reduce the consumed water by assimilated co2 typically the increase in intrinsic or instantaneous water use efficiency is related to stomatal closure and reduced photosynthesis thus greater water use efficiency intrinsic or instantaneous comes at the expense of lower crop yield since both growth and yield are associated with stomatal opening blum 2009 roche 2015 in addition instantaneous water use efficiency measured at leaf scale can be misleading due to microclimate conditions within mini chambers used in portable gas exchange systems ferraz et al 2016 therefore the agronomic water use efficiency i e the water used by the crop in relation to the performance obtained through growth and yield is more appropriate in the context of agricultural production blum 2009 ferraz et al 2016 irrigation strategies such as partial root zone drying prd techniques can help to reduce crop water footprints and maximize water use efficiency wue without compromising photosynthesis and ultimately plant growth and yield jovanovic and stikic 2018 in papaya limited number of studies have evaluated such a strategy marler and discekici 1997 lima et al 2015 manjunath et al 2017 our study using field grown papaya may contribute to this effort through use of the prd technique for increasing agronomic water use efficiency reducing the water footprint and understanding the effects of prd on papaya physiological activity prd irrigates only half of the horizontal root zone during given irrigation event and stimulates stomatal closure in the unwatered zone while maintaining sufficient water supply within the wetted part of the rootzone to sustain normal fruit development loveys et al 2000 el sadek 2014 prolonged drying of part of the root system diminishes the effect of prd on stomata stoll et al 2000 presumably as root sourced abscisic acid aba signaling decreases along with the sap flow from the drying roots dodd et al 2008 to avoid excessive drying of the roots the wet dry sides are alternated to ensure part of the root system is exposed on drying soil to sustain root sourced aba signaling dodd et al 2015 implementing prd can increase water and nutrient use efficiencies and improve the nutritional and health attributes of the different agricultural species and in some cases sustain or even increase their yield jovanovic and stikic 2018 lima et al 2015 showed that while there was evidence of non hydraulic signals inducing stomatal closure in the prd treatments in field and greenhouse studies these effects in field grown of papaya were insufficient to alter dry matter partitioning biomass or yield components since there were no significant differences between prd and regulated deficit irrigation rdi at either a 30 or 50 water deficit however a 50 water deficit in the greenhouse study for the prd treatment was sufficient to significantly reduce biomass and alter the dry matter partitioning compared with the control treatment lima et al 2015 in the field study using prd a 30 water deficit alternation every 7 days with a 30 reduction in irrigation water depth did not significantly reduced vegetative growth or yield components compared with control in addition lima et al 2015 showed that the physiological response of papaya to prd was more affected in greenhouse grown than in field grown papaya in the greenhouse study the roots are limited to the volume of the pot while under field conditions rainfall can increase water availability in the soil and the roots can explore larger volume of soil in addition previous work was done using different amounts of applied water and application intervals in papaya plants and the authors found that the quality of tainung 1 papaya produced by partial root zone drying in semi arid conditions was not affected castricini et al 2019 thus future work related to gas exchange traits should be done to quantify the irrigated side alternation frequencies using the prd as well as studies related to reductions in irrigation water depth iwd in papaya furthermore papaya plants can be considered as suitable for receiving the prd technique because no unique relationship of stomatal conductance with pre dawn xylem potential or relative leaf water content has been reported marler et al 1994 therefore stomatal responses of papaya plants are associated with root sourced aba signaling to greater extent mahouachi et al 2006 in different crops grown with prd under semi arid conditions the frequency of alternation of the irrigated side is considered one of the bottlenecks of knowledge related to this technique therefore understanding how the frequency of prd alternation interacts with decreased irrigation volume to affect growth and leaf gas exchange of carica papaya can inform better management of prd in addition since drought conditions are expected to become more frequent worldwide due to climate change a better understanding of moderate water stress on papaya physiology will be of utmost importance to reduce the water footprint thus our hypothesis is that decreasing the frequency of prd alternation is necessary to change the single leaf exchange thereby enhancing agronomic and single leaf water use efficiency of papaya 2 material and methods 2 1 material growth conditions and irrigation management the experiment was carried out between january 2016 and may 2017 in the experimental field at the federal institute of education science and technology campus bom jesus da lapa

january 5 2016 three seedlings per hole were transplanted to the field hole spacing 3 8m 2 0m sixty days after transplanting the most vigorous hermaphrodite plant was selected and the other seedlings thinned hand weeding occurred within the plant rows and mechanical weeding between rows through a brush cutter coupled to a tractor once the economic damage level was reached pests and diseases were controlled chemically being sprayed with insecticides of the chemical group avermectin and kumulus and fungicides of the chemical group score according to manufacturers recommendations phosporous and micronutrients were used as side dressing application during planting nitrogen and potassium were applied as fertigation every 15 days during the growth and production phases the quantities were based on the soil chemical analysis according to sanches and dantas 1999 the fertigations were applied on the irrigated side of the crop row both sides received the same quantity of fertilizer every month the soil of the experimental area is latossolo vermelho amarelo oxisol with textural class loam sandy clay embrapa 2013 the soil moisture corresponding to field capacity was 0 290 cm3 cm 3 and the soil moisture corresponding to point at which permanent wilting occurred was 0 185 cm3 cm 3 the experiment was conducted in a randomized block design using nine irrigation strategies and four replicates each plot within the crop row consisted of seven plants with five usable and among the plots one plant was considered as border irrigation strategies were based on 50 and 35 reductions in irrigation water depth iwd and irrigated side alternation frequencies of every 0 7 14 and 21 days zero frequency represents fixed prd where water application took place on only one irrigation side of the crop row all treatments were applied from transplanting thus table 1 except for the only side irrigated osi which had only one lateral line installed all treatments had two lateral lines per crop row a total of six pressure compensating emitters with flow rate of 4 l h 1 working pressure of 100 kpa and they were manufactured by azud cysne were installed in each plant three on each side the lateral line was positioned at a 0 25 m distance from the planting row fig 2 this configuration of the irrigation system allowed an average wetted area of 38 0 concerning the area occupied by each plant 7 6 m2 and distribution uniformity of 94 7 irrigation was applied daily to raise the soil water content to the upper limit of available water i e at field capacity this soil water replacement was based on the crop water evapotranspiration which was obtained as a function of the reference evapotranspiration eto by the modified penman monteith method allen et al 1998 considering the crop

full irrigation and prd 50 strategy as well the two lateral lines remained on during the calculated irrigation time for full irrigation strategy but only one lateral remained on during the irrigation events no matter the crop row side in all other strategies either for prd 50 or for prd 35 prd 35 and 50 the irrigation strategies were differentiated basically by keeping just one lateral line on during the irrigation events and by the change of the irrigated side of a crop row every 7 14 and 21 days this operation was accomplished by using manual valves in the beginning of lateral lines plants were irrigated every day after soil water status and gas exchange evaluations in this work the effective depth of the root system 0 45 m was defined according to coelho et al 2005 electric resistance sensors watermark were installed at depth of 0 25 m at a radial distance of 0 10 m from the emitter and at 0 25 m from plant stem on both of its sides the sensors helped to evaluate soil

of the irrigated side with greater applied irrigation amount of water prd7 35 dried the soil least by 43 on average on the non irrigated side fig 5 in contrast in treatments prd21 50 and prd21 35 the lowest frequency of alternation of the irrigated side every 21 days dried the soil the most by 77 and 72 respectively in the available soil water content on the side subjected to drying these values represent reductions of 13 prd7 35 47 prd21 50 and 42 prd21 35 compared with the lower limit 70 of available soil water content bernardo et al 2019 corresponding to the critical moisture or water potential f established for papaya fig 5 available soil water content in the full irrigation treatment varied from 72 to 100 fig 5 a range that is above the lower limit of available water 70 required by papaya for the absence of yield reduction bernardo et al 2019 alternation of the irrigated side every 14 days prd 50 and 35 decreased soil available water on the non irrigated side by about 50 and

reduction of gs at 1 00 p m compared with the values of this variable at 8 00 a m fig 8 a in these treatments fi prd7 35 and prd14 35 the reductions in gs from 8 00 a m to 1 00 p m were 32 29 and 28 while in prd21 50 and osi 35 which had reduced yields the reductions were 50 and 44 respectively different from gs the response of e was the opposite positive and significant p 0 05 table 3 i e the

prd21 50 prd21 35 osi 50 and osi 35 had the smallest increments in e 15 25 and were similar to each other fig 8b however when comparing the e values at each time 8 00 a m and 1 00 p m there were no differences between treatments fig 7c statistical difference was observed only between the times of the day and in the treatments prd7 35 prd21 50 prd21 35 and fi unlike gs e values were higher at 1

treatments prd7 35 prd7 50 and prd21 50 had a significantly higher iwue than the other treatments fig 10a the treatments fi prd21 35 and osi 35 had the highest water footprint considering only the

observed in the treatments prd7 35 and 50 prd14 50 and 35 prd21 50 and osi 50 these treatments when compared with the strategies fi prd21 35 and osi 35 lead to savings of about 28 36 liters of water for each kilogram of fruit produced fig 10b and table 5 in addition the water footprint wfi was negatively and significantly p 0 05 correlated with the intrinsic water use efficiency table 3 that is as iwue increased the volume of water consumed to produce 1 kg of fruit decreased fig 10b 4 discussion 4 1 papaya x soil water availability papaya is one of the fruit crops with earliest production jiménez et al 2014 and the stages of growth flowering and fruit maturation occur simultaneously from the third or fourth month after planting coelho et al 2011 due to this intense development in regions with low levels and irregular distribution of rainfall as is the case of the semiarid region of brazil and also due to the ongoing climate changes it is essential to provide adequate and constant water supply through irrigation to achieve an excellent production potential coelho et al 2011 thus the success of the prd technique for papaya is directly associated with the adoption of a quantity of water applied lower than the evapotranspiration demand of the crop so that it maximizes the agronomic water use efficiency without reducing the quantity and quality of harvested fruits however depending on the climate soil type and crop the reduction in applied water and the frequency of alternation of the irrigated side can negatively affect the soil water availability to plants thus leading to severe water deficit lima et al 2015 in addition in this study with the tainung genotype in a semiarid region of brazil papaya was able to adjust to different irrigation depths as well as the different frequencies of alternation of water application in the root system thus this genotype proved to be a plant with high plasticity related to moderate water stress of the root such plasticity allows prd strategy to be applied under field condition to increase agronomic water use efficiency as well as reducing water footprint 4 2 effect of prd on leaf gas exchange the effects of soil water deficit associated with vpdair on papaya physiological processes depends on the time of day marler and mickelbart 1998 cloudiness and air temperature reis and campostrini 2008 in the present study the treatments prd21 50 osi 35 and prd7 50 led to the greatest reductions in gs from 8 00 a m to 1 00 p m with percentages ranging from 37 to 50 fig 8a on the other hand the largest increase in transpiration rates from 8 00 a m to 1 00 p m occurred in the fi treatment fig 8b in general the percentages of reduction gs and increment e are directly associated with the increase in vpdair from 8 00 a m 1 0 kpa to 1 00 p m 3 2 kpa and soil water availability in each treatment fig 5 although there was a reduction in gs transpiration rates increased at 1 00 p m due to the increase in vpdleaf air which is the driving force for the water vapor to escape through the stomata i e e gs vpdleaf air buckley 2005 the increase in vpdleaf air occurs due to the increase in leaf temperature associated with stomatal closure caused by a high atmospheric water demand increased vpdair and or soil water deficit and also an increase in solar radiation on leaf surface jones 2018 under prd conditions the water deficit on the side subjected to partial root system drying can trigger myriad physiological responses in papaya plants lima et al 2015 2016 the reduction of gs is one of the fastest responses to water deficit schroeder et al 2001 resulting in decreased transpiration lima et al 2015 campostrini et al 2018 however in this experiment under field conditions when compared with fi the treatments with prd did not reduce gs a and e both at 8 00 a m and at 1 00 p m fig 7 this fact can demonstrate that the genotype studied tainung can be considered a near anisohydric genotype with although marler et al 1994 showed that the red lady papaya genotype reduced its stomatal conductance at soil water potential close to 37 kpa without any change in the relative water content this result obtained by marler et al 1994 suggested a near isohydric behavior these authors report that the reduction in gs keeping the relative water content at high values may be related to an adaptation of this species to water limitation the same sensitivity of the stomata due to soil water limitation was reported by lima et al 2015 in the gran golden genotype cultivated in prd under both field and greenhouse conditions although stomata play a critical role in regulating water loss by plants and are required to be responsive to changes related to the soil plant atmosphere system collins et al 2010 apparently prd technique changed the stomatal responses of tainung papaya effectively changing its behavior from isohydric to anisohydric such anisohydric behavior in this present experiment can be observed through the similar gs values between 8 00 a m and 1 00 p m fig 7c as well as through the values of ci and ci ca ratio table 4 in fact in the same species differences in isohydric anisohydric behaviors may be caused by growing conditions to which the plant is subjected such as the speed of substrate dehydration and soil texture more friable can promote greater water absorption capacity through the growth deepening of the root system which could characterize an intrinsic property of the plant hochberg et al 2018 responses of stomata to vpdair are significantly affected by two intrinsically linked factors aba and soil drying davies et al 2002 mahouachi et al 2007 collins et al 2010 brodribb and mcadam 2017 stomatal response of plants to aba changes considerably with varying vpdair or leaf water potential where both hydraulic and chemical signals play a role in stomatal closure tardieu and simonneau 1998 although gs values decreased at 1 00 p m in the treatment prd21 50 fig 7a the stomata of the genotype tainung seem not be affected by the water limitation in the soil in the treatments used combined with high values of vpdair observed at the times when gas exchange was evaluated fig 4 thus overall under the conditions studied the stomata of the tainung genotype showed reduced sensitivity to the water limitations imposed by the applied treatments however even with reduced sensitivity there was an increase in agronomic and intrinsic water use efficiencies figs 9 and 10 table 5 and reduction in water footprint values fig 10 table 5 reduction in stomatal opening causes lower co2 availability in intercellular spaces reducing assimilation at the carboxylation sites of rubisco brodribb et al 2015 however in this study the internal co2 concentration in the mesophyll and the ci ca ratio were not statistically different among treatments table 4 which indeed strengthens the indication of absence of biochemical damage to the processes associated with leaf gas exchange of the studied genotype 4 3 effect of prd on water use although there were no significant differences between the applied treatments in the variables related to gas exchange gs e and a fig 7 and table 4 the variables height growth rate hgr and diameter growth rate dgr had a positive and significant relationship with yield fig 9a and 9b table 3 with the treatments fi and prd7 35 standing out in terms of hgr the prd7 35 treatment received a lower amount of water when compared with fi besides having higher iwue and awue and reduced wf fig 10 these responses demonstrate the efficiency of this treatment in tainung papaya cultivated in the semiarid region of brazil the intrinsic water use efficiency a gs is used as a determinant to delineate the performance of agricultural crops under water stress conditions thus genotypes or treatments that result in increased intrinsic efficiency are almost always considered superior because they reduce the water consumed per co2 assimilated blum 2009 typically the increase in intrinsic water use efficiency comes at the expense of accentuated stomatal closure and moderate reduction in photosynthesis thus higher intrinsic water use efficiency can be nullified by the lower crop yield since growth and yield are associated with stomatal opening blum 2009 roche 2015 therefore the agronomic water use efficiency relationship between growth yield and water transpired by the crop is more appropriate in the context of agricultural production blum 2009 ferraz et al 2016 awueheight mm day 1 l 1 and awue g fruit l 1 decreased as the irrigation depth increased except for the treatment prd7 35 which had a high value fig 9c despite receiving a water depth higher than that of the treatments subjected to 50 reduction table 2 the prd7 35 treatment had an awueheight and awue statistically similar to those of the other treatments with higher values of their means fig 9c this similarity in terms of water use efficiency can be justified by the maintenance of net photosynthetic rate at adequate levels in these plants in the prd7 35 treatment fig 7 the highest frequency of alternation of the irrigated side every 7 days associated with the application of the irrigation depth with 35 iwd reduction possibly contributed to maintaining the relative water content in the leaf pérez pérez et al 2018 within a range in which photosynthetic capacity and quantum yield were not negatively affected campostrini et al 2018 this fact may have contributed to the maintenance of photoassimilate production for support in growth and yield although the net photosynthetic rates did not show significant differences between the different irrigation strategies studied figs 6b and 7 b the possibility of the existence of a cumulative effect that is the sum of the small marginal differences day after day along the experimental period cannot be ruled out this effect may have contributed in some way to the final yield of papaya subjected to different irrigation treatments and to the significant difference between them fig 6b in addition different sensibility to increased vpdair among treatments may have influenced the final yield as well papaya cultivation under available soil water conditions of less than 70 for long periods can negatively affect fruit yield campostrini et al 2018 lima et al 2015 the results presented in this study corroborate this information since the strategies with higher soil water availability fi prd7 35 and prd14 35 fig 5 did not significantly reduce fruit yield fig 6b and still had high values of apparent quantum efficiency of photosynthesis a par fig 6c it is important to highlight that the treatments prd14 35 and osi 35 had very similar photosynthetic rates however the yield of the former was 15 higher than that of osi 35 therefore the alternation of the irrigated side can improve the intrinsic and agronomic water use efficiencies which is probably associated with better performance of the root system li et al 2007 indeed the fixed prd may restrict root system growth on the dry side which could reduce the capacity to absorb nutrients li et al 2007 which may affect yield fig 9a it is important to highlight that despite the reduction of fruit yield in the treatments prd7 50 prd14 50 prd21 50 and 35 and osi 50 and 35 compared with the other three treatments with best yields fi prd7 35 and prd14 35 figs 6b this average yield 67 000 70 000 kg ha 1 is higher than the averages of brazil 39 892 kg ha 1 and the state of bahia 36 009 kg ha 1 based on a survey conducted by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge 2019 besides iwue and awue the water footprint is an important variable associated with water consumption by a crop in a certain place and at a given time nouri et al 2019 higher awue leads to a lower water footprint as can be observed for prd7 35 table 5 however it is important to highlight that there was also a negative and significant relationship p 0 05 between water footprint and iwue fig 10b thus the strategies prd7 35 and prd14 35 are the most indicated to be introduced in irrigated areas of papaya production because they showed yields similar to that of the fi treatment and a reduced water footprint in the same range of treatments with iwd reduction of 50 fig 10b and table 5 considering the ongoing climate changes and consequently the need to effectively increases the awue by crops our findings provide new insights for water management in papaya plants especially in drier regions such as semi arid region of northeastern brazil in this way increasing the irrigation frequency i e between 7 and 14 days and reducing 35 the amount of water applied can increase awue without a yield penalty 5 conclusions the results confirmed the hypothesis that the prd with alternation of the irrigated side in a shorter time interval and with less reduction in the amount of water applied compared with fi i e prd7 35 and prd14 35 both with reduced midday depression in gs 01 00 pm can increase awue without compromising yield and gas exchange which were similar to those found in the fi treatment therefore under the growing conditions of this study and in tainung papaya the prd with irrigated side alternation frequency of every 7 14 days with a 35 reduction in the irrigation depth can be a viable technique to reduce the water footprint i e increase the effective use of water under semi arid conditions such as the brazilian ones declaration of competing interest the authors reported no

2010 mohammadian et al 2001 showed that the effect of drought stress on sucrose yield depended on soil physical properties climatic conditions stored soil moisture plant nutrition conditions after water stress elimination and water stress duration the major limitation to world sugar beet production is water stress so that enhanced drought tolerance in cultivars might lead to enhancements in yield area under cultivation and crop productivity breeding specifically for drought tolerance however is time consuming and expensive these considerations motivated the present study to explore a complementary approach based on exogenous application of proline proline an amino acid plays a highly beneficial role in reducing stress for plants exposed to various stressful conditions hayat et al 2012 gholami zali and ehsanzadeh 2018 ghaffari et al 2019a the proline concentrations of cells tissues and plant organs are regulated by the interplay of biosynthesis and degradation as well as intercellular transport processes špoljarević et al 2011 it is well established that proline protects plants against stress by functioning as a cellular osmotic regulator between the cytoplasm and vacuole and by detoxifying free radicals and buffering of cellular redox potential as well as stabilizing the mitochondrial electron transport complex ii membranes and proteins and enzymes such as rubisco thus protecting membrane integrity and stabilizing antioxidant enzymes hayat et al 2012 sorkheh et al 2012 therefore exogenous proline applications could upregulate the proline leading to enhanced drought tolerance in crops ashraf and foolad 2007 the exogenous application of proline at seedling and vegetative stages of maize zea mays l reportedly led to increased growth under drought stress ali et al 2007 it was also found not only to promote the uptake of k ca p and n but also to increase growth in maize ali et al 2007 and increased antioxidant enzymes activity in sugar beet leaves ghaffari et al 2019a pre sowing seed soaking of wheat triticum aestivum l in proline was also found to alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress resulting in enhanced growth and yield kamran et al 2009 from a different perspective while some studies have claimed that water stress causes changes in the production of secondary metabolites in plants alinian et al 2016 the others have shown its positive effects on their biosynthesis jaafar et al 2012 improvement of white sugar yield under environment stresses and the projected water scarcity and associated osmotic stress in the face of global warming has been the focus of study and debate in recent decades moustakas et al 2011 in this regard certain levels of drought stress might induce an increase in the sucrose content of sugar beet thus the purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of proline application on sugar beet yield and quality under different irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant

fertilizer were added at the rate 250 and 100 kg ha 1 respectively before sowing at both locations nitrogen fertilizer was applied at the rate of 250 and 200 kg ha 1 of ureas 46 n in three stages 1 3 simultaneously by planting and the rest 2 3 during the growing of product at shahrekord and shalamzar locations respectively seeds were sown at both locations in late may the plot size was 4 m 3 m and the plant spacing was 20 cm the final plant density was 100 000 plants ha 1 this was consistent across all plots 2 2 irrigation treatment irrigation treatments were based on the plant s calculated

allowable depletion mad percentage of water at the root development depth at the time of irrigation θ m a d theta probe was used to measure soil water content two days after irrigation and continued up to one day prior to the next irrigation all the plants were grown under full irrigation 100 iwr until the water stress was initiated each experimental plot was irrigated until it reached its respective mad threshold value which was calculated using eq 1 was reached allen et al 1998 1 θ m a d θ f c θ f c θ p w p m a d where θ f c and θ p w p are the volumetric soil water content at field

m θ s o i l represents soil available water content in plant rhizosphere θ f c θ p w p a is the plot area and v is irrigation volume according to irrigation treatments the irrigation volumes obtained were pumped with pipe and to measure the amount of water entering each plot an irrigation meter was applied 2 3 proline content leaf and root proline contents were measured by the method of bates et al 1973 shoots and roots were washed with distilled water then samples 0 2 g were homogenized in 10 ml of 3 sulfosalicylic acids and filtered through filter paper whatman filter paper no 1 then 2 ml of the supernatant were made to react with 2 ml of acid ninhydrin and 2 ml of glacial acetic acid in a test tube for 1 h at 100 c and the reaction was terminated by placing the tube on an ice bath the reaction mixtures were extracted using 4 ml of toluene and vortexing 15 20 s the chromophore containing toluene was measured at 520 nm by a spectrophotometer model u 1800 hitachi high technologies corporation tokyo japan for absorbance at room temperature with using toluene as blank proline concentrations of leaves and roots were determined using a standard curve 2 4 yield and root quality shoots were removed at the maturity stage i e 160 days after sowing at both locations bgs 49 and roots were taken out from the soil using a harvesting machine ten roots represented samples from the four middle rows were chosen to determine root yield ry g m 2 root diameter and length the washed roots were transferred to the sugar technology laboratory of isfahan iran where their quality traits

was conducted at locations using the sas statistical software version 9 1 sas institute cary nc finally treatment means were compared using the least significant difference lsd tests p 0 05 3 results 3 1 root morphological traits and proline content the morphological traits of sugar beet root were not affected by the interaction between irrigation regime proline and irrigation regime proline location but leaf and root proline content were significantly affected by location irrigation regime proline application and interaction of irrigation regime proline table 1 the mean of root length in shalamzar as opposed to its diameter was significantly higher than shahrekord but the root diameter was affected more than its length by irrigation regime so root diameter was reduced by 42 under ss compared to ww conditions while this reduction was observed as 22 in the root length table 1 in spite of the negative impacts of applied stress foliar application of proline had positive effects on morphological traits the root length was 4 and 8 longer at 5 and 10 mm of proline levels than the control respectively this increase in root diameter was 7 and 16 compared to the control respectively table 1 comparison of the study locations showed an increase in proline content of leaf and root in shalamzar compared to shahrekord table 1 proline application 5 and 10 mm under ww condition did not statistically change the leaf and root proline content however 12 and 29 increase in leaf and root proline content were observed respectively table 2 under ms only the level of 10 mm of proline was significant compared to non application and leaf and root proline content increased by 61 and 345 compared to the control respectively significantly highest leaf and roots proline contents were recorded under ss and the application of 10 mm proline table 2 thus the percentage of change in root proline content was more than that in leaf 3 2 effective traits to sap the α n content was significantly affected by interaction of irrigation regime proline application but k and mc were significantly affected by location irrigation regime and proline application table 1 the na content and alc did not change significantly with proline application and interaction of treatments table 3 on the other hand changes in sc and wsc were significant under all treatments and their interactions except interaction of location irrigation regime proline application table 1 and only the effect of location and irrigation regime was significant on cse table 3 the mean of α n k na and mc of sugar beet root in shahrekord were significantly higher than shalamzar and only alc was higher in shalamzar tables 1 and 3 increasing water stress severity reduced k 6 and 18 under ms and ss respectively and mc 8 under ss and alc 27 and 42 under ms and ss respectively compared to ww condition and however the opposite was true for na and α n content in fact the content of na increased by 35 under ms and 60 under ss compared to ww conditions table 3 proline application both levels did not play a significant role under ww condition but the highest α n content was obtained under ss and both proline levels table 2 the sap purity sc wsc and cse of the samples belonging to shalamzar was significantly higher than shahrekord tables 1 and 3 coefficient of sugar extraction also increased with increasing stress severity however no difference was observed between applied stress levels table 3 the reaction of sc and wsc to interaction of irrigation regime proline application was similar from the obtained results application of proline both levels was less important than non application of it under ww and ss than ms conditions the results showed that the highest sc and wsc were recorded under ms and the application of 10 mm proline table 2 3 3 sugar beet yield root yield sy and wsy was affected by irrigation regime and proline application the interaction of irrigation regime proline application had a significant effect on ry table 1 white sugar yield harvested from shalamzar was higher than shahrekord while no significant difference was found between both locations in ry and sy table 1 the highest sy was obtained under ms 2 higher than the control and ss reduced sy by 21 compared to the control table 1 similarly the highest wsy was under ms 5 increases than the control and the lowest wsy was under ss 19 reduction than the control proline application significantly increased sy and wsy after foliar application of 5 mm proline sy and wsy were improved by 8 and 6 respectively this increase with 10 mm of proline was 18 and 15 respectively table 1 the results showed that the highest ry was produced under ww condition with application and non application of proline and ms with 10 mm of proline however it was found that at each level of stress proline application especially 10 mm decreased the negative impacts of stress on yield and prevented a severe reduction in yield in proline treated plants table 2 4 discussion 4 1 root morphological traits and proline content the air relative moisture fig 1 and soil organic matter were higher in shalamzar than shahrekord during the growing season this may lead to induction of cell division and cell enlargement and finally increasing the growth parameters and root dimensions amin et al 2013 the beneficial effects of organic matter might be explained by the presence of the growth promoting substance such as amino acids vitamins gibberellins and auxins that they are formed as organic matter decays amin et al 2013 thereby the root length in shalamzar was longer than shahrekord table 1 root system is the main organ responsible for plant water uptake especially under drought stress ober and sharp 2007 root length could represent a more functional trait for plant adaptation to drought prone environments and under drought stressful condition increase the ability of the root system to maintain water levels and make osmotic adjustment chen et al 2005 also el darder et al 2017 who reported that decreasing the amount of irrigation water from 100 to 80 and 60 of iwr under drip irrigation significantly decreased mean root weight by 8and 26 it was also found that wsy and root diameter expressed positive correlation under ss compared to ms or ww conditions and the correlation varied in order of the ss r2 0 61 ms r2 0 37 ww r2 0 02 as shown in fig 2 a that is why the increase in root diameter did not bring higher wsy under ww condition the coefficient of sugar extraction was lower for the control which might account for higher mc and lower wsy table 3 the researchers stated that the proline foliar application was effective in improving water stress tolerance especially in sugar beet ghaffari et al 2019a in this study foliar application of proline 5 and 10 mm increased proline content in leaves of sugar beet that was related to the role of proline in energy production in electron transfer chain and atp synthesis gholami zali and ehsanzadeh 2018 proline application has a beneficial role in reducing harmful effects of stress other studies on proline production and degradation in intracellular organelles of higher plants indicated that the pathways of proline biosynthesis occur in the cytosol or chloroplasts and the site of synthesized proline degradation is in mitochondria szabados and savouré 2010 ashraf and foolad 2007 as the stress occurs the mechanism of proline degradation is activated preventing excess proline accumulation in the cell and causing toxicity but this mechanism after controlling excess proline levels induces proline synthesis cycle and production of nad p h these processes in the cell finally lead to more osmoregulation of proline treated plants due to the higher levels of n compounds and their soluble proteins ferreira de freitas et al 2018 however all plant species have not the ability of produce enough amount of this amino acid to reduce the negative effects of environmental stresses therefore external application of this amino acid maybe would increase plant tolerance enhancement of plant metabolism and resistance to environmental stresses as a result of proline application has been attributed to the involvement of this compound in nitrogen uptake and nitrate metabolism gholami zali and ehsanzadeh 2018 the results of our study showed that the root reaction to increased proline amino acid content was greater than the leaf response about 3 times it is likely that the proline synthesis cycle was more active in the roots than the leaves a positive and strong relationship was observed between wsy and changes in leaf proline content r2 0 93 under ww fig 2b although this relationship was not significant under ms and ss conditions fig 2b under ss condition was notable that is why the higher proline level under drought stress is related to osmotic potential regulation in sugar beet so this increases ry and ultimately leads to higher sy 4 2 effective traits to sap regarding the positive relationship between alc with na and k content and the negative relationship with α n content in sap eq 5 the decrease in α n content in sap improved the alc which was evident under ww condition and all proline levels table 3 in fact the highest alc and the lowest α n content were observed under ww treatment it has already been well established that the alc an index for determining the deposition of impurities in sugar sap during the filtration is directly related to the transparency of sugar sap poel et al 1998 it has been claimed that k na and α n content are impurities in extracted root sap which are negatively related to the amount of extractable sugar last et al 1983 in addition the relative proportions of crystallizable sugar and sugar in molasses have been found to be the most important factors affecting the industrial value of sugar beet crystallization of sucrose from molasses is inhibited by α n k and na content baradaran firouzabadi et al 2011 in the present study na and α n content were observed to increase but k content to decrease under drought stress showing that sugar beet quality affected by drought stress sadeghian et al 2004 reported that drought had a remarkable effect on the concentration of α n in the storage root but had a little effect on k and na contents also k had the highest variation in sugar beet germplasm under stress conditions as compared to other impurities increasing α n content under stress was reported to be due to the formation of n compounds that regulate osmotic pressure e g proline and betaine in the leaf and then transfer it to the root clover et al 1999 cooke and scott 1993 there was not significant relationship berween α n content changes and alc under ss table 4 while the dependency of the change of mentioned traits increased significantly with decreasing stress severity under ms and ww with a slope of 0 3 and 0 5 respectively fig 2c the results showed that when the root was affected by stress the alc reduced due to a higher increase in α n content than na and k content in the sap the content of α n increased by 43 compared to the control table 2 but not for na and k content tables 1 and 3 maybe one of the reasons for higher wsc in shalamzar than shahrekord was the lower mc in shalamzar because increasing mc might reduce the quality of sap purity on the other hand mc increased with increasing of α n k and na content as molasses components eq 4 also the greatest effect of proline application on increasing sc and wsc of sugar beet root occurred under ms agreeing with the results of ben ahmed et al 2011 on olive root in fact the accumulation of osmolytes such as proline is done after inducing water shortage and increase in ion accumulation this process facilitates the uptake of water by the tissues followed by an increase in the concentration of soluble sugars with the aim of improving the function of nutrient transfer in phloem ben ahmed et al 2011 such a mechanism may be involved in our study table 2 finally while brown et al 1987 reported about reduced sc under early season water stress dunham 1988 observed no marked effects due to drought stress while increased sc under ss would be due to the depletion of water through roots and the smaller size of roots ober et al 2004 actually under conditions of water scarcity cell size was lower than the control that is why the cells were not expanded to normal size that points at problems with sucrose accumulation as the vacuole takes the major part of the cell so the physical structure for sucrose storage of sugar beet the number of cambium rings and cells were not clearly reduced through the insufficient water supply hoffmann 2010 4 3 sugar beet yield our results indicated no effect of location on ry maybe of root diameter effect on ry while wsy was different under both drought and ww conditions due to wsc effect on wsy at two locations which agrees with hesadi et al 2015 so higher wsc at shalamzar led to an increase in wsy at that location compared to shahrekord table 1 under ms and ww conditions proline treatment had no significant change in ry but it was found that ry was strongly dependent on soil moisture changes and it was reduced under decreasing available water some researchers believe that maximum ry obtained under ww condition yonts 2011 al jbawi and abbas 2013 and water stress led to significant declines in ry sy and wsy of sugar beet mahmoodi et al 2008 kiziloglu et al 2006 topak et al 2011 foroozesh et al 2012 chołuj et al 2014 they also illustrated that the rate of co2 assimilation and the activity of photosystem ii in leaves of sugar beet are inhibited as a result of water stress therefore the assimilate supply probably will be reduced under drought the results of our study followed these reports experimenting with maize ali et al 2007 reported increased growth following exogenous application of proline under drought stress kamran et al 2009 also reported improved effects of drought with enhanced growth and yield in wheat by proline those effects were likely due to the increase in k ca p and n uptakes as a result of proline treatment ali et al 2007 there was a positive and significant relationship between wsc and wsy under ww r2 0 94 and ms r2 0 96 conditions while the correlation was not significant under ss r2 49 condition table 4 and fig 2d in addition under ss the trend of changing ry and wsy was positive and correlated r2 90 but no significant relationship was observed under ms and ww conditions table 4 and fig 2e actually wsy was multiplying ry and wsc the sugar content increased under stress conditions but should be careful about this maybe the whole of product sugar decreases because of a decrease in ry according to the report of mehrandish et al 2012 decrease in relative water content and close the stomata were the first effects of drought stress that disturb the photosynthetic system and prevent synthesis of materials that result in the decrease of yield however the decrease in wsy accompanying high water deficit might have been due to the decrease in ry 5 conclusion drought stress decreased the measured traits except na α n sugar and white sugar content of sugar beet root whereas proline application increased morphological traits yield and quality of sugar beet despite the high wsc under drought stress treatment reduction of ry could not compensate the low wsy as compared to the control in conclusion it can be said that ry has a greater impact on wsy than wsc applications of 10 mm proline up regulated the biochemical characteristics and thereby increased drought tolerance in sugar beet and maintained ry financial support this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors ethical standards not

yield area under cultivation and crop productivity breeding specifically for drought tolerance however is time consuming and expensive these considerations motivated the present study to explore a complementary approach based on exogenous application of proline proline an amino acid plays a highly beneficial role in reducing stress for plants exposed to various stressful conditions hayat et al 2012 gholami zali and ehsanzadeh 2018 ghaffari et al 2019a the proline concentrations of cells tissues and plant organs are regulated by the interplay of biosynthesis and degradation as well as intercellular transport processes špoljarević et al 2011 it is well established that proline protects plants against stress by functioning as a cellular osmotic regulator between the cytoplasm and vacuole and by detoxifying free radicals and buffering of cellular redox potential as well as stabilizing the mitochondrial electron transport complex ii membranes and proteins and enzymes such as rubisco thus protecting membrane integrity and stabilizing antioxidant enzymes hayat et al 2012 sorkheh et al 2012 therefore exogenous proline applications could upregulate the proline leading to enhanced drought tolerance in crops ashraf and foolad 2007 the exogenous application of proline at seedling and vegetative stages of maize zea mays l reportedly led to increased growth under drought stress ali et al 2007 it was also found not only to promote the uptake of k ca p and n but also to increase growth in maize ali et al 2007 and increased antioxidant enzymes activity in sugar beet leaves ghaffari et al 2019a pre sowing seed soaking of wheat triticum aestivum l in proline was also found to alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress resulting in enhanced growth and yield kamran et al 2009 from a different perspective while some studies have claimed that water stress causes changes in the production of secondary metabolites in plants alinian et al 2016 the others have shown its positive effects on their biosynthesis jaafar et al 2012 improvement of white sugar yield under environment stresses and the projected water scarcity and associated osmotic stress in the face of global warming has been the focus of study and debate in recent decades moustakas et al 2011 in this regard certain levels of drought stress might induce an increase in the sucrose content of sugar beet thus the purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of proline application on sugar beet yield and quality under different irrigation regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and treatments this experiment was conducted in 2015 at the agricultural research station of shahrekord university 50 51 n 32 19 e and 2050 m a s l and at a private farm in shalamzar 50 82 n

shahrekord and shalamzar experimental locations respectively and climatic conditions of the experimental farms are presented in fig 1 phosphorus triple superphosphate and potassium potassium sulfate fertilizer were added at the rate 250 and 100 kg ha 1 respectively before sowing at both locations nitrogen fertilizer was applied at the rate of 250 and 200 kg ha 1 of ureas 46 n in three stages 1 3 simultaneously by planting and the rest 2 3 during the growing of product at shahrekord and shalamzar locations respectively seeds were sown at both locations in late may the plot size was 4 m 3 m and the plant spacing was 20 cm the final plant density was 100 000 plants ha 1 this was consistent across all plots 2 2 irrigation treatment irrigation treatments were based on the plant s calculated

allowable depletion mad percentage of water at the root development depth at the time of irrigation θ m a d theta probe was used to measure soil water content two days after irrigation and continued up to one day prior to the next irrigation all the plants were grown under full irrigation 100 iwr until the water stress was initiated each experimental plot was irrigated until it reached its respective mad threshold value which was calculated using eq 1 was reached allen et al 1998 1 θ m a d θ f c θ f c θ p w p m a d where θ f c and θ p w p are the volumetric soil water content at field

al 1973 shoots and roots were washed with distilled water then samples 0 2 g were homogenized in 10 ml of 3 sulfosalicylic acids and filtered through filter paper whatman filter paper no 1 then 2 ml of the supernatant were made to react with 2 ml of acid ninhydrin and 2 ml of glacial acetic acid in a test tube for 1 h at 100 c and the reaction was terminated by placing the tube on an ice bath the reaction mixtures were extracted using 4 ml of toluene and vortexing 15 20 s the chromophore containing toluene was measured at 520 nm by a spectrophotometer model u 1800 hitachi high technologies corporation tokyo japan for absorbance at room temperature with using toluene as blank proline concentrations of leaves and roots were determined using a standard curve 2 4 yield and root quality shoots were removed at the maturity stage i e 160 days after sowing at both locations bgs 49 and roots were taken out from the soil using a harvesting machine ten roots represented samples from the four middle rows were chosen to determine root yield ry g m 2 root diameter and length the washed roots were transferred to the sugar technology laboratory of isfahan iran where their quality traits

was conducted at locations using the sas statistical software version 9 1 sas institute cary nc finally treatment means were compared using the least significant difference lsd tests p 0 05 3 results 3 1 root morphological traits and proline content the morphological traits of sugar beet root were not affected by the interaction between irrigation regime proline and irrigation regime proline location but leaf and root proline content were significantly affected by location irrigation regime proline application and interaction of irrigation regime proline table 1 the mean of root length in shalamzar as opposed to its diameter was significantly higher than shahrekord but the root diameter was affected more than its length by irrigation regime so root diameter was reduced by 42 under ss compared to ww conditions while this reduction was observed as 22 in the root length table 1 in spite of the negative impacts of applied stress foliar application of proline had positive effects on morphological traits the root length was 4 and 8 longer at 5 and 10 mm of proline levels than the control respectively this increase in root diameter was 7 and 16 compared to the control respectively table 1 comparison of the study locations showed an increase in proline content of leaf and root in shalamzar compared to shahrekord table 1 proline application 5 and 10 mm under ww condition did not statistically change the leaf and root proline content however 12 and 29 increase in leaf and root proline content were observed respectively table 2 under ms only the level of 10 mm of proline was significant compared to non application and leaf and root proline content increased by 61 and 345 compared to the control respectively significantly highest leaf and roots proline contents were recorded under ss and the application of 10 mm proline table 2 thus the percentage of change in root proline content was more than that in leaf 3 2 effective traits to sap the α n content was significantly affected by interaction of irrigation regime proline application but k and mc were significantly affected by location irrigation regime and proline application table 1 the na content and alc did not change significantly with proline application and interaction of treatments table 3 on the other hand changes in sc and wsc were significant under all treatments and their interactions except interaction of location irrigation regime proline application table 1 and only the effect of location and irrigation regime was significant on cse table 3 the mean of α n k na and mc of sugar beet root in shahrekord were significantly higher than shalamzar and only alc was higher in shalamzar tables 1 and 3 increasing water stress severity reduced k 6 and 18 under ms and ss respectively and mc 8 under ss and alc 27 and 42 under ms and ss respectively compared to ww condition and however the opposite was true for na and α n content in fact the content of na increased by 35 under ms and 60 under ss compared to ww conditions table 3 proline application both levels did not play a significant role under ww condition but the highest α n content was obtained under ss and both proline levels table 2 the sap purity sc wsc and cse of the samples belonging to shalamzar was significantly higher than shahrekord tables 1 and 3 coefficient of sugar extraction also increased with increasing stress severity however no difference was observed between applied stress levels table 3 the reaction of sc and wsc to interaction of irrigation regime proline application was similar from the obtained results application of proline both levels was less important than non application of it under ww and ss than ms conditions the results showed that the highest sc and wsc were recorded under ms and the application of 10 mm proline table 2 3 3 sugar beet yield root yield sy and wsy was affected by irrigation regime and proline application the interaction of irrigation regime proline application had a significant effect on ry table 1 white sugar yield harvested from shalamzar was higher than shahrekord while no significant difference was found between both locations in ry and sy table 1 the highest sy was obtained under ms 2 higher than the control and ss reduced sy by 21 compared to the control table 1 similarly the highest wsy was under ms 5 increases than the control and the lowest wsy was under ss 19 reduction than the control proline application significantly increased sy and wsy after foliar application of 5 mm proline sy and wsy were improved by 8 and 6 respectively this increase with 10 mm of proline was 18 and 15 respectively table 1 the results showed that the highest ry was produced under ww condition with application and non application of proline and ms with 10 mm of proline however it was found that at each level of stress proline application especially 10 mm decreased the negative impacts of stress on yield and prevented a severe reduction in yield in proline treated plants table 2 4 discussion 4 1 root morphological traits and proline content the air relative moisture fig 1 and soil organic matter were higher in shalamzar than shahrekord during the growing season this may lead to induction of cell division and cell enlargement and finally increasing the growth parameters and root dimensions amin et al 2013 the beneficial effects of organic matter might be explained by the presence of the growth promoting substance such as amino acids vitamins gibberellins and auxins that they are formed as organic matter decays amin et al 2013 thereby the root length in shalamzar was longer than shahrekord table 1 root system is the main organ responsible for plant water uptake especially under drought stress ober and sharp 2007 root length could represent a more functional trait for plant adaptation to drought prone environments and under drought stressful condition increase the ability of the root system to maintain water levels and make osmotic adjustment chen et al 2005 also el darder et al 2017 who reported that decreasing the amount of irrigation water from 100 to 80 and 60 of iwr under drip irrigation significantly decreased mean root weight by 8and 26 it was also found that wsy and root diameter expressed positive correlation under ss compared to ms or ww conditions and the correlation varied in order of the ss r2 0 61 ms r2 0 37 ww r2 0 02 as shown in fig 2 a that is why the increase in root diameter did not bring higher wsy under ww condition the coefficient of sugar extraction was lower for the control which might account for higher mc and lower wsy table 3 the researchers stated that the proline foliar application was effective in improving water stress tolerance especially in sugar beet ghaffari et al 2019a in this study foliar application of proline 5 and 10 mm increased proline content in leaves of sugar beet that was related to the role of proline in energy production in electron transfer chain and atp synthesis gholami zali and ehsanzadeh 2018 proline application has a beneficial role in reducing harmful effects of stress other studies on proline production and degradation in intracellular organelles of higher plants indicated that the pathways of proline biosynthesis occur in the cytosol or chloroplasts and the site of synthesized proline degradation is in mitochondria szabados and savouré 2010 ashraf and foolad 2007 as the stress occurs the mechanism of proline degradation is activated preventing excess proline accumulation in the cell and causing toxicity but this mechanism after controlling excess proline levels induces proline synthesis cycle and production of nad p h these processes in the cell finally lead to more osmoregulation of proline treated plants due to the higher levels of n compounds and their soluble proteins ferreira de freitas et al 2018 however all plant species have not the ability of produce enough amount of this amino acid to reduce the negative effects of environmental stresses therefore external application of this amino acid maybe would increase plant tolerance enhancement of plant metabolism and resistance to environmental stresses as a result of proline application has been attributed to the involvement of this compound in nitrogen uptake and nitrate metabolism gholami zali and ehsanzadeh 2018 the results of our study showed that the root reaction to increased proline amino acid content was greater than the leaf response about 3 times it is likely that the proline synthesis cycle was more active in the roots than the leaves a positive and strong relationship was observed between wsy and changes in leaf proline content r2 0 93 under ww fig 2b although this relationship was not significant under ms and ss conditions fig 2b under ss condition was notable that is why the higher proline level under drought stress is related to osmotic potential regulation in sugar beet so this increases ry and ultimately leads to higher sy 4 2 effective traits to sap regarding the positive relationship between alc with na and k content and the negative relationship with α n content in sap eq 5 the decrease in α n content in sap improved the alc which was evident under ww condition and all proline levels table 3 in fact the highest alc and the lowest α n content were observed under ww treatment it has already been well established that the alc an index for determining the deposition of impurities in sugar sap during the filtration is directly related to the transparency of sugar sap poel et al 1998 it has been claimed that k na and α n content are impurities in extracted root sap which are negatively related to the amount of extractable sugar last et al 1983 in addition the relative proportions of crystallizable sugar and sugar in molasses have been found to be the most important factors affecting the industrial value of sugar beet crystallization of sucrose from molasses is inhibited by α n k and na content baradaran firouzabadi et al 2011 in the present study na and α n content were observed to increase but k content to decrease under drought stress showing that sugar beet quality affected by drought stress sadeghian et al 2004 reported that drought had a remarkable effect on the concentration of α n in the storage root but had a little effect on k and na contents also k had the highest variation in sugar beet germplasm under stress conditions as compared to other impurities increasing α n content under stress was reported to be due to the formation of n compounds that regulate osmotic pressure e g proline and betaine in the leaf and then transfer it to the root clover et al 1999 cooke and scott 1993 there was not significant relationship berween α n content changes and alc under ss table 4 while the dependency of the change of mentioned traits increased significantly with decreasing stress severity under ms and ww with a slope of 0 3 and 0 5 respectively fig 2c the results showed that when the root was affected by stress the alc reduced due to a higher increase in α n content than na and k content in the sap the content of α n increased by 43 compared to the control table 2 but not for na and k content tables 1 and 3 maybe one of the reasons for higher wsc in shalamzar than shahrekord was the lower mc in shalamzar because increasing mc might reduce the quality of sap purity on the other hand mc increased with increasing of α n k and na content as molasses components eq 4 also the greatest effect of proline application on increasing sc and wsc of sugar beet root occurred under ms agreeing with the results of ben ahmed et al 2011 on olive root in fact the accumulation of osmolytes such as proline is done after inducing water shortage and increase in ion accumulation this process facilitates the uptake of water by the tissues followed by an increase in the concentration of soluble sugars with the aim of improving the function of nutrient transfer in phloem ben ahmed et al 2011 such a mechanism may be involved in our study table 2 finally while brown et al 1987 reported about reduced sc under early season water stress dunham 1988 observed no marked effects due to drought stress while increased sc under ss would be due to the depletion of water through roots and the smaller size of roots ober et al 2004 actually under conditions of water scarcity cell size was lower than the control that is why the cells were not expanded to normal size that points at problems with sucrose accumulation as the vacuole takes the major part of the cell so the physical structure for sucrose storage of sugar beet the number of cambium rings and cells were not clearly reduced through the insufficient water supply hoffmann 2010 4 3 sugar beet yield our results indicated no effect of location on ry maybe of root diameter effect on ry while wsy was different under both drought and ww conditions due to wsc effect on wsy at two locations which agrees with hesadi et al 2015 so higher wsc at shalamzar led to an increase in wsy at that location compared to shahrekord table 1 under ms and ww conditions proline treatment had no significant change in ry but it was found that ry was strongly dependent on soil moisture changes and it was reduced under decreasing available water some researchers believe that maximum ry obtained under ww condition yonts 2011 al jbawi and abbas 2013 and water stress led to significant declines in ry sy and wsy of sugar beet mahmoodi et al 2008 kiziloglu et al 2006 topak et al 2011 foroozesh et al 2012 chołuj et al 2014 they also illustrated that the rate of co2 assimilation and the activity of photosystem ii in leaves of sugar beet are inhibited as a result of water stress therefore the assimilate supply probably will be reduced under drought the results of our study followed these reports experimenting with maize ali et al 2007 reported increased growth following exogenous application of proline under drought stress kamran et al 2009 also reported improved effects of drought with enhanced growth and yield in wheat by proline those effects were likely due to the increase in k ca p and n uptakes as a result of proline treatment ali et al 2007 there was a positive and significant relationship between wsc and wsy under ww r2 0 94 and ms r2 0 96 conditions while the correlation was not significant under ss r2 49 condition table 4 and fig 2d in addition under ss the trend of changing ry and wsy was positive and correlated r2 90 but no significant relationship was observed under ms and ww conditions table 4 and fig 2e actually wsy was multiplying ry and wsc the sugar content increased under stress conditions but should be careful about this maybe the whole of product sugar decreases because of a decrease in ry according to the report of mehrandish et al 2012 decrease in relative water content and close the stomata were the first effects of drought stress that disturb the photosynthetic system and prevent synthesis of materials that result in the decrease of yield however the decrease in wsy accompanying high water deficit might have been due to the decrease in ry 5 conclusion drought stress decreased the measured traits except na α n sugar and white sugar content of sugar beet root whereas proline application increased morphological traits yield and quality of sugar beet despite the high wsc under drought stress treatment reduction of ry could not compensate the low wsy as compared to the control in conclusion it can be said that ry has a greater impact on wsy than wsc applications of 10 mm proline up regulated the biochemical characteristics and thereby increased drought tolerance in sugar beet and maintained ry financial support this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors ethical standards not
