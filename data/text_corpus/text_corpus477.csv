2385,the partial contributing area pca is a conceptual parameter proposed to approximately quantify the effective surface runoff region which is directly resulting from the excess rainfall previous studies further applied the ratio of pca which can determine the separation between the surface and subsurface flow regions to introduce the subsurface flow mechanism in a geomorphology based iuh model the temporal distribution of the simulated hydrograph was found to be sensitive to the ratio of pca especially for the stage of flow recession therefore this study focuses on devising a method to estimate the dynamic pca depending on the initial streamflow antecedent precipitation and current infiltration rate in which the soil type is considered an artificial neural network model called long short term memory lstm is established to provide adequate values of pca by considering the aforementioned factors associated with the hydrological conditions a geomorphology based iuh model is subsequently implemented to demonstrate the importance of using the proposed methodology to seek a reliable pca by comparing simulated hydrographs with observed discharges the proposed methodology could be a promising way to avoid the assumption of constant pca or the complex process of deriving time varying pca additionally the results of this study showed that it can significantly ameliorate the performance in terms of relative error of simulated hydrograph as well as the overall similarity compared to the flow records of floods keywords partial contributing area geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh surface flow subsurface flow long short term memory lstm neural network data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the derivation of synthetic and dimensionless unit hydrographs which are based on empirical relationships to estimate parameters usually relies on the availability of a large amount of hydrologic data and this kind of method may be incapable of simulating ungauged and partially gauged watersheds gupta et al 1980 kumar et al 2007 the development of the geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph model giuh proposed by rodriguez iturbe and valdes 1979 is remarkable progress in the field of computational hydrology they advocated the integration of geomorphologic parameters of a basin and the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh to estimate the hydrologic response to surface runoff gupta et al 1980 kirshen and bras 1983 a variety of hydrologic responses that occur in nature were attempted to be interpreted by the underlying unity of the geomorphologic structure existing in a watershed rodriguez iturbe and valdes 1979 with the significant advance in techniques for processing digital elevation data and easier access to high resolution topographic datasets the extraction of all kinds of geomorphologic parameters has become more convenient and has no longer been a limitation in applying the giuh model lee 1998 hladik and alber 2012 bhuyian et al 2015 huang and lee 2016 therefore a great deal of attention has been directed toward the research subject associated with the application of geomorphologic characteristics to perform runoff simulations chang and lee 2008 grabs et al 2009 lee and yen 1997 considering the lack of hydrologic records the giuh reveals its superiority in model mechanism to determine unit hydrographs by conceptualizing the stream network characteristics of a watershed according to horton s geomorphologic laws and applying the assumption of probability density function for deriving travel time rodriguez iturbe and valdes 1979 kumar 2014 so far the applicability of giuh is still widely promoted and the follow up extension subjects are continuously discussed yen and lee 1997 chang and lee 2008 moussa 2008 andrieu et al 2021 the hydrologic response of the giuh was further suggested to be adjusted by considering the topological properties hydraulic characteristics of flows and the spatial distribution of effective rainfall moussa 2008 the influence of rainfall spatial distribution was taken into account to identify the giuh specific to each flood event by analyzing observational precipitation data in advance andrieu et al 2021 the concept of partial contributing area pca was proposed to approximately delineate the saturated region having a high groundwater table within a watershed on which surface runoff generates immediately after receiving precipitation to introduce the subsurface flow mechanism in a geomorphology based iuh model lee and chang 2005 proposed an interesting issue utilizing the ratio of pca to separate the watershed area into the surface and subsurface runoff zones in their method kinematic wave approximation was adopted to estimate the probability distributions of travel time for surface runoff and channel flow in saturated areas darcy s law was used to calculate the travel time of subsurface flow in hillside fields an obvious improvement in simulated results was found especially for the recession limb of the hydrograph by additionally devising the subsurface flow process however another problem arose when attempting to assign the occupancy of pca within the watershed chang and lee 2008 advocated applying a topographic index threshold to determine the constant extent of pca they indicated that a large ratio of pca would result in a sharp instantaneous unit hydrograph due to the rapid movement of runoff across the land surface to adequately assess the pca ratio lee and huang 2013 adopted a current precipitation index cpi together with an antecedent precipitation index to capture the continuous change of water content in the soil layer however in this method the complicated procedures in seeking the empirical relationships between the antecedent precipitation condition current precipitation amount initial infiltration rate and the magnitude of pca are required to be conducted in advance by using assumed function types in a nutshell the process of deriving the pca ratio is indirect this study aims at proposing a convenient method to effectively estimate the temporal variation of the pca ratio which can be adopted in the giuh model to allow the combination of surface and subsurface flow mechanisms the novelty of this research is to apply a dynamic neural network algorithm to establish a direct relationship between a variety of hydrologic conditions and the time varying pca without referencing any other empirical formulation beforehand the influential factors considered in the neural network model contain the observed streamflow at the beginning of a rainstorm antecedent precipitation and the infiltration rate which includes soil characteristics in this way the original process to determine the extent of pca can be simplified but the consideration of all kinds of physical elements will not be neglected 2 methodology two types of models separately for implementing runoff simulation and deriving the pca are built and analyzed in this study the pca determined method is the focus of this study to ameliorate the consideration of infiltration and soil moisture the giuh model is then utilized to assess the simulation results in which the proposed method of determining pca is embedded 2 1 geomorphology based runoff model based on the concept of instantaneous unit hydrograph the discharge produced by a rainfall runoff process can be expressed as a linear system as follows 1 q t 0 t p e τ u p e t τ d τ where p e τ is the effective precipitation intensity at the time step τ u p e t τ is the instantaneous unit hydrograph depending on the time varying effective precipitation intensity as shown in fig 1 by assuming that a watershed has a dendritic stream network with ω order and its entire drainage area can be separated into the unsaturated subsurface flow region in upper slopes and saturated surface flow region near streams the iuh at a designated location can be calculated by lee and chang 2005 2 u t u sur t u sub t w w sur d x suri t d x ci t d x cj t d x ω t w sur p w sur w w sub d x subi t d x ci t d x cj t d x ω t w sub p w sub where u sur t and u sub t represent the iuhs respectively for surface flow and subsurface flow x suri denotes the ith order surface flow region x subi denotes the ith order subsurface flow region x ci denotes the ith order channel d x ci t denotes the probability density function of travel time in the state of ith channel order w sur and w sub respectively denote the spaces of surface and subsurface flow paths and they can be given by 3 w sur x suri x ci x cj x c ω 4 w sub x subi x ci x cj x c ω p denotes the probability of a raindrop following a specific flow path p w sur and p w sub can be derived by 5 p w sur r pca t r are a i p x suri x ci p x ci x cj p x ck x c ω 6 p w sub 1 r pca t r are a i p x subi x ci p x ci x cj p x ck x c ω where r pca t denotes the ratio of pca equaling the proportion of the surface flow region to the total drainage area r areai denotes the ratio of the ith order subwatershed area to the total watershed area p x ci x cj denotes the transitional probability of channel flow moving from an ith order stream to a jth order stream in applying the giuh model the estimation of travel time in each runoff state is required to calculate the probability density function mentioned in eq 2 based on the assumption of the kinematic wave simplification the runoff travel time for the ith order area of surface flow can be given by henderson and wooding 1964 7 t x suri n sur l suri s suri p e m 1 1 m where n sur denotes the surface roughness coefficient l suri and s suri denote the mean length and slope of the ith order surface flow region respectively m is equal to 5 3 which is derived from manning s equation based on darcy s law the runoff travel time for the ith order area of subsurface flow can be expressed as henderson and wooding 1964 8 t x subi η l subi k u s subi where η denotes the soil porosity k u denotes the hydraulic conductivity of upper soil l subi and s subi denote the mean length and slope of the ith order subsurface flow region respectively in this study the mean length of the ith order surface flow region is assumed as lee and chang 2005 9 l suri r pca t l subi 2 2 infiltration calculation green and ampt 1911 applied darcy s law to establish a simple model for simulating water infiltration into a homogeneous soil with uniform initial moisture content mein and larson 1973 extended the green and ampt model to estimate the time when surface ponding begins under steady rainfall conditions chu 1978 further revised the green and ampt model to account for unsteady rainfall skaggs and khaheel 1982 advocated including a water balance equation at the soil surface to compute excess rainfall the potential infiltration rate can be computed by 10 f t k s k s ψ f θ s θ i f c where k s denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm h ψ f denotes the suction head at the wetting front cm θ s denotes the saturated moisture content θ i denotes the initial moisture content f c denotes the cumulative infiltration depth cm it should be noted that the infiltration capacity presented in eq 10 is only for the permeable area the actual infiltration velocity is determined by 11 f i t min f i o where i o denotes the observed rainfall intensity cm h the cumulative infiltration depth is then calculated by solving the ordinary differential equation as follows 12 d f c dt f i t this method is featured by the assumption of a sharp wetting front that forms when surface water penetrates a relatively dry soil layer it should be noted that the physical mechanism of this infiltration method mainly depends on the soil texture and the state of soil moisture content to compensate for the assumption and limitation of the homogeneous soil by using the green ampt method the spatial distribution of the soil type data was collected and applied as the reference to assign various values of saturated hydraulic conductivity and suction head of each grid computing element in space moreover the antecedent rainfall condition measured at each rain gauge station was applied to determine the spatial distribution of initial soil moisture in other words the initial soil moisture of each grid was assigned according to the antecedent rainfall at the nearest station nevertheless it should be noted that limited by the structure of the giuh based model the effective rainfall must be assumed as spatially uniform therefore the effective rainfall conditions of all grids derived by the green ampt method within a subwatershed of a designated location need an average treatment before executing the giuh based runoff model in other words even though soil characteristics and properties can be differently assigned in every grid to calculate the respective effective rainfall by the green ampt model only a single and representative pattern of hyetograph utilizing the average treatment for a study area is allowed to be assigned in the giuh based model 2 3 estimation of dynamic partial contributing area the objective of this study is to develop a new methodology for determining the time varying pca in the following sub sections the influential factors considered in the model are first explained based on the physic and hydrology knowledge the neural network algorithm adopted in this study is subsequently provided the procedure of training the machine learning model is also elaborated at the end of this section 2 3 1 influential factors the environmental features given to the neural network model to predict the value of pca are concerned in this study the antecedent and current precipitation have been confirmed to be highly related to the magnitude of pca hughes 1984 lee and huang 2013 however the previous methods of deriving pca according to the rainfall condition are indirect and the exponential function is required to be adopted as the basic assumption on the other hand the current moisture content in the soil layer is also an important index to denote the pca therefore the infiltration rate which is associated with the soil characteristics as illustrated in eq 10 is taken into account as well summarizing the above descriptions as shown in fig 2 the influential factors considered as the model inputs are the precipitation pattern pe which accommodates effective rainfall data over a specific period tp before the current time as well as the current rainfall intensity and the current infiltration rate fi to effectively track the state of the groundwater table before the storm event the initial discharge of streamflow qini measured at a designated location is additionally adopted as one of the features to determine the variation of pca it should be noted that the ratio of pca rpca representing the proportion of pca in the entire watershed area is designed as the single output of the proposed neural network model in previous studies improvements to the conventional giuh model focus on the calculation of concentration time or the ratio of the partial contributing area these are all characteristic parameters with a conceptual assumption used to modify the conventional giuh model the purpose of this study is to introduce the concept of time varying pca depending on the hydrological conditions which can be considered in the semi distributed giuh model according to the previous studies hughes 1984 beschta 1998 lee and huang 2013 the antecedent precipitation current infiltration rate and the initial streamflow applied in this research have been denoted to significantly affect the pca of a watershed and these factors are considered easy to be collected therefore to simplify the data required by using the proposed method merely these kinds of information were applied to establish the pca prediction model by using the artificial intelligence algorithm it should be noted that any type of giuh model belongs to the semi distributed structure which indicates that this kind of model can only yield simulated hydrographs at several designated locations rather than simulating the detailed transportation of runoff grid by grid within the watershed therefore limited by the model mechanism the spatial grid based distribution of surface topography soil or land cover is unable to be fully reflected on the hydrograph of a designated outlet 2 3 2 neural network method long short term memory lstm is one of the artificial recurrent neural network rnn architectures which has feedback connections to process not only single data points but also entire sequences of data since lags of unknown duration in a time series can be taken into account lstm networks are well suited to processing and making predictions based on time series data as shown in fig 3 a typical lstm unit is composed of a cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the cell is designed to remember values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates are used to regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell the compact forms of equations for the forward pass of an lstm cell are 13 i t σ w i x t r i c t 1 b i 14 f t σ w f x t r f c t 1 b f 15 o t σ w o x t r o c t 1 b o 16 c t tanh w c x t r c c t 1 b c 17 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 18 h t o t tanh c t where x t represents input vector to the lstm unit namely the features considered in this study i t represents input gate s activation vector f t represents forget gate s activation vector o t represents output gate s activation vector c t represents cell state vector c t represents cell input activation vector h t represents hidden state vector also known as output vector of the lstm unit σ denotes sigmoid function denotes the hadamard product element wise multiplication of vectors the matrices w and r are weight matrices of the input and recurrent connections and b represents vector parameters of bias all these matrices need to be learned during training after updating the hidden state h t the predicted ratio of pca at time step t can be derived by 19 r pca t h t r pca is a fraction between 0 and 1 which needs to be assigned in the giuh model as shown in eqs 5 and 6 2 3 3 training procedure as shown in the flowchart in fig 4 the preparatory work of this method is to calibrate the optimal set of all parameters required for the conventional kw giuh model which initially assumes that the pca is a constant subsequently the related data that need to be collected before the training work are the precipitation pattern pe during the period from time step t tp to current time step t the infiltration rate fi at present time step t and the initial streamflow discharge qini in this study a data classification method called k means clustering according to the distribution of qini before the model training is suggested to accelerate the seeking process of the optimal function as shown by the flow chart each batch of sequence data is trained iteratively until the maximum allowable error is satisfied the calculation of the lstm networks is followed by the execution of the giuh model to quantify the error between the simulated hydrograph and measured discharges as well as to determine the optimal value of rpca with this in mind the loss function applied to assess the accuracy of the machine learning based regression model is as follows 20 loss 1 n t 1 n q t r pca q t 2 where q t is the observed discharge at time step t which is adopted as the target value for the model training q t is the simulated discharge yielded by the giuh model and it can be deemed as a function of r pca n is the total number of data points in the time series assigned to train the model it should be noted that although the pca was proposed based on a physical interpretation it is merely a conceptual parameter depending on the rainfall and soil condition and designed to adjust the hydrological response hydrograph shape especially during the recession period of the flood lee and chang 2005 the distribution of pca is difficult to be verified through measurements in reality since the spatial distribution of geomorphological properties cannot be completely taken into account the time varying pca introduced in this study is to re evaluate and enhance the overall performance of the giuh model to achieve this goal as shown in fig 4 a dynamic pca prediction model based on the ai technique needs to be embedded in the structure of runoff routing to train the lstm model completely the target optimal value of r pca at every time step needs to be estimated indirectly by evaluating the relative error between the flow record q t and the simulated discharge q t yielded by the giuh model on the other hand it should be clarified that the concept of partial contributing area pca was originally proposed by betson 1964 and its definition is the saturated surface flow area solely and directly resulting from effective rainfall in which the infiltration rate has been deducted lee and chang 2005 therefore the proposed giuh model integrated with the consideration of the dynamic pca is only based on the mechanism of infiltration excess overland flow 2 4 mechanism of considering surface topography soil texture land cover and the subsurface system 2 4 1 surface topography based on the mechanism of the giuh model lee and chang 2005 the topographic data digital elevation data is utilized to extract geomorphological properties such as the length and slope of the ith order overland flow area these are significant parameters to estimate the runoff travel times which are subsequently used to estimate the probability of a raindrop following a specific flow path the giuh based model applies this concept of evaluating overall transitional probabilities of all possible flow paths within a study area to generate the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh 2 4 2 soil texture and land cover the soil type of the overland flow area corresponding to each stream order is considered by assigning the hydraulic conductivity as shown in eq 8 to estimate the runoff travel time for the ith order area of subsurface flow the land cover type of the overland flow area corresponding to each stream order is considered by assigning the surface roughness coefficient as shown in eq 7 to estimate the runoff travel time for the ith order area of surface flow 2 4 3 subsurface flow and surface flow system in this study the runoff travel time for the subsurface flow region is calculated based on darcy s law and the equation form shown in eq 8 was derived by henderson and wooding 1964 the runoff travel time for the surface flow region is then calculated based on kinematic wave simplification and the equation form shown in eq 7 it should be noted that these two equations of runoff travel time are key points to reflect the influence of geomorphological factors on the simulated hydrograph by determining the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh the main contribution of this study is to effectively offer the dynamic prediction of rpca which denotes the range separation between the surface and subsurface flow regions in order to adjust the hydrograph shape for enhancing simulated accuracy 3 study area and model setups the applicability of the pca determined model connected with the giuh model was examined by a study case of the da an river basin located in north western taiwan as shown in fig 5 the mainstream of this river basin originates from the xueshan mountain and flows westward to the taiwan strait the total drainage area of the da an river basin is about 758 km2 and the length of the mainstream is about 96 km the main species of land cover in this watershed are forests shrubs and cultivated fields in this study the land cover was considered to determine the range of surface roughness coefficient according to the reference table suggested by chow 1959 the surface roughness coefficient was then applied in eq 7 to calculate the runoff travel time for the surface flow of the ith order area based on the mechanism of the giuh model which is divided into subsurface flow and surface flow regions lee and chang 2005 as shown in eq 2 the runoff travel time respectively for the surface flow and the subsurface flow as shown in eqs 7 and 8 are significant hydraulic parameters to adjust the distribution of the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh according to the information provided by the water resources department ministry of economic affairs in taiwan there are 12 rain gauges and 6 flow gauges installed in this watershed the average annual rainfall of this watershed measured by these rain gauges is about 2400 mm the precipitation observed in this watershed is distributed unevenly in time and space because of the influence of the southwest monsoon and the frequent occurrence of typhoons during the rainy season from june to september as shown in fig 6 three sub watersheds in which the flow records at the outlet are available are selected as the example areas applied with the proposed models there are obvious differences in the geomorphological conditions among the three areas such as the characteristic shape slope stream network distribution and drainage area to manifest the applicability of the proposed methodology the drainage areas of a b and c sub watersheds are 414 5 43 6 and 57 9 km2 respectively the highest order of stream number ω identified for the a b and c sub watersheds are 3 2 and 2 respectively as for the estimation of infiltration rate by using the greem and ampt method a reference table revealing the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and the suction head at the wetting front ψ f based on soil texture suggested by todd and mays 2004 was adopted in this study since the predominant soil types in the da an river basin are sandy loam loam and silty loam the range of k s was assigned between 3 4 mm h and 10 9 mm h the range of ψ f was assigned between 61 mm and 110 mm as for the training work of the lstm model for predicting the time varying ratio of pca a total of 72 rainstorm events in which 18 events were adopted as testing data were collected for cross validation the flood events chosen in this study occurred between 1983 and 2017 the accumulated precipitation amount of each selected rainfall event is between 172 mm and 2328 mm the range of flood peaks among these chosen storm events at the outlet of the sub watershed a is between 372 m3 s and 2853 m3 s 4 results and discussion the purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of applying the proposed pca determined method in the giuh model therefore in the following content the merit of designing the pca parameter to add the subsurface flow mechanism in the giuh model is first elaborated the importance of adjusting the pca parameter to be time varied is subsequently indicated 4 1 effect of considering the partial contributing area pca in this section three rainfall events were displayed to show the performance of simulation between the two types of giuh models in which one merely considers the surface flow routing and the other one additionally takes into account the subsurface flow mechanism by applying a constant pca the reason to present these three flood events for illustration is to reveal the overall applicability of the pca based giuh model by adopting significantly different optimal ratios of pca rpca they are respectively equal to 0 72 0 36 and 0 55 for the three floods as shown in fig 7 the upper side of each chart shows the rainfall hyetograph of a storm event giuh surface only rpca 1 denotes the hydrograph generated by the giuh model without designating the subsurface flow area so the value of rpca equals 1 giuh subsurface added constant rpca denotes the hydrograph generated by the giuh model in which surface flow and subsurface flow areas simultaneously exist by assigning a constant value of rpca less than 1 these simulation results show that compared to the model which ignores the subsurface flow mechanism the model with the consideration of pca can significantly adjust the overall distribution of hydrograph to be more closed to the observed discharges the decay of discharge during the stage of flood recession can be more accurately described by including the subsurface flow mechanism therefore the significance of applying the concept of pca to account for the subsurface flow routing in the giuh model can be demonstrated however as shown by the simulation results in fig 7 there is still significant room for improvement in specifying a proper value of rpca 4 2 performance of applying the proposed time varying pca as mentioned in the previous content the lstm neural network algorithm is applied to provide the prediction of rpca at every time step and then integrated with the giuh model the pearson correlation coefficient denoted as pc between the precipitation data and the optimal rpca for the training set is shown in fig 8 several related studies have provided guidelines for the interpretation of the correlation coefficient normally a correlation of 0 3 can be regarded as very low so it can be recognized as a negligible correlation although such a criterion is in some ways arbitrary bowley 1928 cohen 1988 in this study if the absolute value of pc is greater than 0 3 it is recognized that there is a non negligible correlation between the two data series therefore the antecedent effective rainfall intensities respectively within 9 5 and 4 h were assigned as model inputs for the a b and c sub watersheds on the other hand the value of pc between the time series of infiltration rate fi and the optimal rpca was 0 53 such a result reveals that these two time varying features are highly related to the temporal change of pca in this study a total of 18 testing events were analyzed after finishing the training of the lstm ann based model to show the importance of applying the proposed time varying pca determined method three of the 18 rainfall events that can generate the most significant variation of pca during the flood were provided for explanation as shown in fig 9 these three chosen floods separately at each outlet of the three selected sub watersheds and their corresponding rainfall hyetographs are displayed constant rpca denotes the hydrograph generated by the giuh model in which a constant value of rpca is adopted time varying rpca denotes the hydrograph generated by the giuh model in which the time varying rpca is given by applying the lstm prediction model these simulation results show that the proposed giuh model connected with the prediction of the optimal rpca depending on the hydrological conditions and the soil characteristics can effectively modify the hydrograph shape overall an example that shows the spatial variation of the pca in sub watershed a during a storm event can be seen in fig 10 in which the surface flow region expands with the increase in rainfall intensity and shrinks with the decrease in rainfall intensity to completely quantify and compare the simulated performance between the two previous giuh based models and the proposed modification integrated with the time varying pca determined method three metrics including the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the relative error of simulated hydrograph compared to the observed data req and the relative error of simulated peak discharge compared to the observed flood peak rep were applied with the records of streamflow for further evaluation nse is a normalized statistic used to assess the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance of the measured data nash and sutcliffe 1970 therefore it can identify how well the plot of simulated versus observed data fits the diagonal of a 45 degree angle nse can be computed by 21 nse 1 t 1 n f q t q t 2 t 1 n f q t q 2 where q is the mean of observed discharges for a flood event and n f is the total number of observations for a flood event the metrics of req and rep can be respectively calculated by 22 r e q t 1 n f q t q t q t n f 23 r e p q p q p q p where q p is the simulated peak discharge during a flood event and q p is the observed flow peak during a flood event table 1 shows the analysis results of 18 testing rainstorm events by separately using these three metrics nse req and rep from the analysis results of nse and req it can be found that the performance of the giuh based runoff model can be improved by introducing the constant pca in the conventional model and the overall performance can be further ameliorated by adopting the proposed time varying pca determined method to replace the constant pca the values of nse for these 18 events can reach between 0 853 and 0 933 and the magnitudes of req for these 18 events can be reduced to a range between 0 087 and 0 162 as for the result of rep the proposed modified giuh based model also shows a better performance than the previous two versions which separately apply the concept of whole surface flow area and the constant pca however this aspect of improvement is not as significant as the results of nse and req it should be noted that the proposed methodology is developed to enhance the overall simulation performance including both flood rise and fall periods rather than merely improving the prediction of flood peak as shown in table 2 the mean relative error between the simulated discharges and observed discharges for the 18 testing events can be reduced from 0 361 to 0 143 maximum among the three selected sub watersheds if the constant value of rpca can be replaced by the time varying rpca in the giuh model by using the proposed method to emphasize the importance of using the proposed pca determined method the comparison charts between the observed flow records and simulated discharges respectively yielded by the giuh model assigned with constant rpca and that assigned with time varying rpca are also provided in fig 11 as shown by the analysis results at the outlets of the three sub watersheds the proposed method was found to produce superior performance than the model assigned with constant rpca because the proposed method reveals the more concentrated distribution of data points surrounding the 45 degree diagonal line as shown in table 2 the lowest coefficient of determination denoted as r2 among the three sub watersheds by applying the proposed pca determined method is 0 943 which is significantly larger than the r2 for the simulation case adopting the constant rpca in which the r2 is equal to 0 851 therefore the proposed pca determined method is highly suggested to be combined with the giuh model to further ameliorate the accuracy of streamflow prediction by thoroughly considering the hydrological and soil characteristics of the study site to effectively estimate the resultant hydrograph at several locations of interest the semi distributed giuh model is usually chosen to avoid using numerical algorithms therefore the runoff computation cannot be performed grid by grid in the giuh model it should be clarified that only the mechanism of infiltration excess overland flow can be considered in the proposed giuh model in reality the two mechanisms of infiltration excess overland flow and saturation excess overland flow may simultaneously occur in the same subwatershed this spatially heterogeneous infiltration situation is unable to be specially regarded in any model based on the concept of iuh nevertheless the mass conservation between the excess rainfall and the observed hydrograph has been checked for the simulation cases displayed in this study therefore this indicates that the overland flow was dominated by the input of excess rainfall moreover the accumulative volume of each simulated hydrograph performed by the proposed giuh model was also close to the accumulative volume of flow records of each corresponding event the main issue of this study is to accurately transform excess rainfall into the resultant hydrograph although the spatial variation of the subsurface flow region cannot be exactly delineated in the giuh based model the dynamic prediction of rpca can be an alternative to adjusting the hydrograph shape by assigning the rpca darcy s law can be utilized to reflect the longer runoff travel time in the subsurface flow region than that in the surface flow region of a study watershed it should be noted that the subsurface flow considered in the revised giuh model also results from the input of excess rainfall lee and chang 2005 5 conclusions the importance to integrate the surface runoff routing with the subsurface flow mechanism in the giuh model has been pointed out in previous studies so the partial contributing area pca plays a key role to separate the whole watershed into the surface and subsurface flow zones nevertheless the methodology to determine the pca is still difficult because the realistic range of pca is hard to be demonstrated and it involves many hydrologic factors the objective of this study is to establish a concise approach for determining the time varying pca which depends on the antecedent precipitation condition the soil moisture content as well as the discharge of streamflow at the beginning of a rainstorm at observed sites to understand the complex relationship between the aforementioned factors and the value of pca at every time step a dynamic neural network called long short term memory lstm was adopted to estimate the temporal change of pca during the runoff simulation the discharge records were considered as benchmarks for feedback on the neural networks and the loss between simulation results of the giuh model and observed discharges were adopted to adjust the value of pca via the training process of the lstm model the time varying pca was found to have significant efficacy to modify the hydrograph shape and therefore reducing the mean relative error between records and simulated discharges from 0 361 to 0 143 for the 18 testing storm events analyzed in this study such a result indicates that the proposed improved giuh model in which a pca determined method is embedded can adequately simulate streamflow especially for the situation in which the initial soil water content is lower credit authorship contribution statement pin chun huang

2385,the partial contributing area pca is a conceptual parameter proposed to approximately quantify the effective surface runoff region which is directly resulting from the excess rainfall previous studies further applied the ratio of pca which can determine the separation between the surface and subsurface flow regions to introduce the subsurface flow mechanism in a geomorphology based iuh

this kind of method may be incapable of simulating ungauged and partially gauged watersheds gupta et al 1980 kumar et al 2007 the development of the geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph model giuh proposed by rodriguez iturbe and valdes 1979 is remarkable progress in the field of computational hydrology they advocated the integration of geomorphologic parameters of a basin and the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh to estimate the hydrologic response to surface runoff gupta et al 1980 kirshen and bras 1983 a variety of hydrologic responses that occur in nature were attempted to be interpreted by the underlying unity of the geomorphologic structure existing in a watershed rodriguez iturbe and valdes 1979 with the significant advance in techniques for processing digital elevation data and easier access to high resolution topographic datasets the extraction of all kinds of geomorphologic parameters has become more convenient and has no longer been a limitation in applying the giuh model lee 1998 hladik and alber 2012 bhuyian et al 2015 huang and lee 2016 therefore a great deal of attention has been directed toward the research subject associated with the application of geomorphologic characteristics to perform runoff simulations chang and lee 2008 grabs et al 2009 lee and yen 1997 considering the lack of hydrologic records the giuh reveals its superiority in model mechanism to determine unit hydrographs by conceptualizing the stream network characteristics of a watershed according to horton s geomorphologic laws and applying the assumption of probability density function for deriving travel time rodriguez iturbe and valdes 1979 kumar 2014 so far the applicability of giuh is still widely promoted and the follow up extension subjects are continuously discussed yen and lee 1997 chang and lee 2008 moussa 2008 andrieu et al 2021 the hydrologic response of the giuh was further suggested to be adjusted by considering the topological properties hydraulic characteristics of flows and the spatial distribution of effective rainfall moussa 2008 the influence of rainfall spatial distribution was taken into account to identify the giuh specific to each flood event by analyzing observational precipitation data in advance andrieu et al 2021 the concept of partial contributing area pca was proposed to approximately delineate the saturated region having a high groundwater table within a watershed on which surface runoff generates immediately after receiving precipitation to introduce the subsurface flow mechanism in a geomorphology based iuh model lee and chang 2005 proposed an interesting issue utilizing the ratio of pca to separate the watershed area into the surface and subsurface runoff zones in their method kinematic wave approximation was adopted to estimate the probability distributions of travel time for surface runoff and channel flow in saturated areas darcy s law was used to calculate the travel time of subsurface flow in hillside fields an obvious improvement in simulated results was found especially for the recession limb of the hydrograph by additionally devising the subsurface flow process however another problem arose when attempting to assign the occupancy of pca within the watershed chang and lee 2008 advocated applying a topographic index threshold to determine the constant extent of pca they indicated that a large ratio of pca would result in a sharp instantaneous unit hydrograph due to the rapid movement of runoff across the land surface to adequately assess the pca ratio lee and huang 2013 adopted a current precipitation index cpi together with an antecedent precipitation index to capture the continuous change of water content in the soil layer however in this method the complicated procedures in seeking the empirical relationships between the antecedent precipitation condition current precipitation amount initial infiltration rate and the magnitude of pca are required to be conducted in advance by using assumed function types in a nutshell the process of deriving the pca ratio is indirect this study aims at proposing a convenient method to effectively estimate the temporal variation of the pca ratio which can be adopted in the giuh model to allow the combination of surface and subsurface flow mechanisms the novelty of this research is to apply a dynamic neural network algorithm to establish a direct relationship between a variety of hydrologic conditions and the time varying pca without referencing any other empirical formulation beforehand the influential factors considered in the neural network model contain the observed streamflow at the beginning of a rainstorm antecedent precipitation and the infiltration rate which includes soil characteristics in this way the original process to determine the extent of pca can be simplified but the consideration of all kinds of physical elements will not be neglected 2 methodology two types of models separately for implementing runoff simulation and deriving the pca are built and analyzed in this study the pca determined method is the focus of this study to ameliorate the consideration of infiltration and soil moisture the giuh model is then utilized to assess the simulation results in which the proposed method of determining pca is embedded 2 1 geomorphology based runoff model based on the concept of instantaneous unit hydrograph the discharge produced by a rainfall runoff process can be expressed as a linear system as follows 1 q t 0 t p e τ u p e t τ d τ where p e τ is the effective precipitation intensity at the time step τ u p e t τ is the instantaneous unit hydrograph depending on the time varying effective precipitation intensity as shown in fig 1 by assuming that a watershed has a dendritic stream network with ω order and its entire drainage area can be separated into the unsaturated subsurface flow region in upper slopes and saturated surface flow region near streams the iuh at a designated location can be calculated by lee and chang 2005 2 u t u sur t u sub t w w sur d x suri t d x ci t d x cj t d x ω t w sur p w sur w w sub d x subi t d x ci t d x

subsurface flow region x ci denotes the ith order channel d x ci t denotes the probability density function of travel time in the state of ith channel order w sur and w sub respectively denote the spaces of surface and subsurface flow paths and they can be given by 3 w sur x suri x ci x cj x c ω 4 w sub x subi x ci x cj x c ω p denotes the probability of a raindrop following a specific flow

the ratio of pca equaling the proportion of the surface flow region to the total drainage area r areai denotes the ratio of the ith order subwatershed area to the total watershed area p x ci x cj denotes the transitional probability of channel flow moving from an ith order stream to a jth order stream in applying the giuh model the estimation of travel time in each runoff state is required to calculate the probability density function mentioned in eq 2 based on the assumption of the kinematic wave simplification the runoff travel time for the ith order area of surface flow can be given by henderson and wooding 1964 7 t x suri n sur l suri s suri p e m 1 1 m where n sur denotes the surface roughness coefficient l suri and s suri denote the mean length and slope of the ith order surface flow region respectively m is equal to 5 3 which is derived from manning s equation based on darcy s law the runoff travel time for the ith order area of subsurface flow can be expressed as henderson and wooding 1964 8 t x subi η l subi k u s subi where η denotes the soil porosity k u denotes the hydraulic conductivity of upper soil l subi and s subi denote the mean length and slope of the ith order subsurface flow region respectively in this study the mean length of the ith order surface flow region is assumed as lee and chang 2005 9 l suri r pca t l subi 2 2 infiltration calculation green and ampt 1911 applied darcy s law to establish a simple model for simulating water infiltration into a homogeneous soil with uniform initial moisture content mein and larson 1973 extended the green and ampt model to estimate the time when surface ponding begins under steady rainfall conditions chu 1978 further revised the green and ampt model to account for unsteady rainfall skaggs and khaheel 1982 advocated including a water balance equation at the soil surface to compute excess rainfall the potential infiltration rate can be computed by 10 f t k s k s ψ f θ s θ i f c where k s denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm h ψ f denotes the suction head at the wetting front cm θ s denotes the saturated moisture content θ i denotes the initial moisture content f c denotes the cumulative infiltration depth cm it should be noted that the infiltration capacity presented in eq 10 is only for the permeable area the actual infiltration velocity is determined by 11 f i t min f i o where i o denotes the observed rainfall intensity cm h the cumulative infiltration depth is then calculated by solving the ordinary differential equation as follows 12 d f c dt f i t this method is featured by the assumption of a sharp wetting front that forms when surface water penetrates a relatively dry soil layer it should be noted that the physical mechanism of this infiltration method mainly depends on the soil texture and the state of soil moisture content to compensate for the assumption and limitation of the homogeneous soil by using the green ampt method the spatial distribution of the soil type data was collected and applied as the reference to assign various values of saturated hydraulic conductivity and suction head of each grid computing element in space moreover the antecedent rainfall condition measured at each rain gauge station was applied to determine the spatial distribution of initial soil moisture in other words the initial soil moisture of each grid was assigned according to the antecedent rainfall at the nearest station nevertheless it should be noted that limited by the structure of the giuh based model the effective rainfall must be assumed as spatially uniform therefore the effective rainfall conditions of all grids derived by the green ampt method within a subwatershed of a designated location need an average treatment before executing the giuh based runoff model in other words even though soil characteristics and properties can be differently assigned in every grid to calculate the respective effective rainfall by the green ampt model only a single and representative pattern of hyetograph utilizing the average treatment for a study area is allowed to be assigned in the giuh based model 2 3 estimation of dynamic partial contributing area the objective of this study is to develop a new methodology for determining the time varying pca in the following sub sections the influential factors considered in the model are first explained based on the physic and hydrology knowledge the neural network algorithm adopted in this study is subsequently provided the procedure of training the machine learning model is also elaborated at the end of this section 2 3 1 influential factors the environmental features given to the neural network model to predict the value of pca are concerned in this study the antecedent and current precipitation have been confirmed to be highly related to the magnitude of pca hughes 1984 lee and huang 2013 however the previous methods of deriving pca according to the rainfall condition are indirect and the exponential function is required to be adopted as the basic assumption on the other hand the current moisture content in the soil layer is also an important index to denote the pca therefore the infiltration rate which is associated with the soil characteristics as illustrated in eq 10 is taken into account as well summarizing the above descriptions as shown in fig 2 the influential factors considered as the model inputs are the precipitation pattern pe which accommodates effective rainfall data over a specific period tp before the current time as well as the current rainfall intensity and the current infiltration rate fi to effectively track the state of the groundwater table before the storm event the initial discharge of streamflow qini measured at a designated location is additionally adopted as one of the features to determine the variation of pca it should be noted that the ratio of pca rpca representing the proportion of pca in the entire watershed area is designed as the single output of the proposed neural network model in previous studies improvements to the conventional giuh model focus on the calculation of concentration time or the ratio of the partial contributing area these are all characteristic parameters with a conceptual assumption used to modify the conventional giuh model the purpose of this study is to introduce the concept of time varying pca depending on the hydrological conditions which can be considered in the semi distributed giuh model according to the previous studies hughes 1984 beschta 1998 lee and huang 2013 the antecedent precipitation current infiltration rate and the initial streamflow applied in this research have been denoted to significantly affect the pca of a watershed and these factors are considered easy to be collected therefore to simplify the data required by using the proposed method merely these kinds of information were applied to establish the pca prediction model by using the artificial intelligence algorithm it should be noted that any type of giuh model belongs to the semi distributed structure which indicates that this kind of model can only yield simulated hydrographs at several designated locations rather than simulating the detailed transportation of runoff grid by grid within the watershed therefore limited by the model mechanism the spatial grid based distribution of surface topography soil or land cover is unable to be fully reflected on the hydrograph of a designated outlet 2 3 2 neural network method long short term memory lstm is one of the artificial recurrent neural network rnn architectures which has feedback connections to process not only single data points but also entire sequences of data since lags of unknown duration in a time series can be taken into account lstm networks are well suited to processing and making predictions based on time series data as shown in fig 3 a typical lstm unit is composed of a cell an input gate an output gate and a forget gate the cell is designed to remember values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates are used to regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell the compact forms of equations for the forward pass of an lstm cell are 13 i t σ w i x t r i c t 1 b i 14 f t σ w f x t r f c t 1 b f 15 o t σ w o x t r o c t 1 b o 16 c t tanh w c x t r c c t 1 b c 17 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 18 h t o t tanh c t where x t represents input vector to the lstm unit namely the features considered in this study i t represents input gate s activation vector f t represents forget gate s activation vector o t represents output gate s activation vector c t represents cell state vector c t represents cell input activation vector h t represents hidden state vector also known as output vector of the lstm unit σ denotes sigmoid function denotes the hadamard product element wise multiplication of vectors the matrices w and r are weight matrices of the input and recurrent connections and b represents vector parameters of bias all these matrices need to be learned during training after updating the hidden state h t the predicted ratio of pca at time step t can be derived by 19 r pca t h t r pca is a fraction between 0 and 1 which needs to be assigned in the giuh model as shown in eqs 5 and 6 2 3 3 training procedure as shown in the flowchart in fig 4 the preparatory work of this method is to calibrate the optimal set of all parameters required for the conventional kw giuh model which initially assumes that the pca is a constant subsequently the related data that need to be collected before the training work are the precipitation pattern pe during the period from time step t tp to current time step t the infiltration rate fi at present time step t and the initial streamflow discharge qini in this study a data classification method called k means clustering according to the distribution of qini before the model training is suggested to accelerate the seeking process of the optimal function as shown by the flow chart each batch of sequence data is trained iteratively until the maximum allowable error is satisfied the calculation of the lstm networks is followed by the execution of the giuh model to quantify the error between the simulated hydrograph and measured discharges as well as to determine the optimal value of rpca with this in mind the loss function applied to assess the accuracy of the machine learning based regression model is as follows 20 loss 1 n t 1 n q t r pca q t 2 where q t is the observed discharge at time step t which is adopted as the target value for the model training q t is the simulated discharge yielded by the giuh model and it can be deemed as a function of r pca n is the total number of data points in the time series assigned to train the model it should be noted that although the pca was proposed based on a physical interpretation it is merely a conceptual parameter depending on the rainfall and soil condition and designed to adjust the hydrological response hydrograph shape especially during the recession period of the flood lee and chang 2005 the distribution of pca is difficult to be verified through measurements in reality since the spatial distribution of geomorphological properties cannot be completely taken into account the time varying pca introduced in this study is to re evaluate and enhance the overall performance of the giuh model to achieve this goal as shown in fig 4 a dynamic pca prediction model based on the ai technique needs to be embedded in the structure of runoff routing to train the lstm model completely the target optimal value of r pca at every time step needs to be estimated indirectly by evaluating the relative error between the flow record q t and the simulated discharge q t yielded by the giuh model on the other hand it should be clarified that the concept of partial contributing area pca was originally proposed by betson 1964 and its definition is the saturated surface flow area solely and directly resulting from effective rainfall in which the infiltration rate has been deducted lee and chang 2005 therefore the proposed giuh model integrated with the consideration of the dynamic pca is only based on the mechanism of infiltration excess overland flow 2 4 mechanism of considering surface topography soil texture land cover and the subsurface system 2 4 1 surface topography based on the mechanism of the giuh model lee and chang 2005 the topographic data digital elevation data is utilized to extract geomorphological properties such as the length and slope of the ith order overland flow area these are significant parameters to estimate the runoff travel times which are subsequently used to estimate the probability of a raindrop following a specific flow path the giuh based model applies this concept of evaluating overall transitional probabilities of all possible flow paths within a study area to generate the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh 2 4 2 soil texture and land cover the soil type of the overland flow area corresponding to each stream order is considered by assigning the hydraulic conductivity as shown in eq 8 to estimate the runoff travel time for the ith order area of subsurface flow the land cover type of the overland flow area corresponding to each stream order is considered by assigning the surface roughness coefficient as shown in eq 7 to estimate the runoff travel time for the ith order area of surface flow 2 4 3 subsurface flow and surface flow system in this study the runoff travel time for the subsurface flow region is calculated based on darcy s law and the equation form shown in eq 8 was derived by henderson and wooding 1964 the runoff travel time for the surface flow region is then calculated based on kinematic wave simplification and the equation form shown in eq 7 it should be noted that these two equations of runoff travel time are key points to reflect the influence of geomorphological factors on the simulated hydrograph by determining the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh the main contribution of this study is to effectively offer the dynamic prediction of rpca which denotes the range separation between the surface and subsurface flow regions in order to adjust the hydrograph shape for enhancing simulated accuracy 3 study area and model setups the applicability of the pca determined model connected with the giuh model was examined by a study case of the da an river basin located in north western taiwan as shown in fig 5 the mainstream of this river basin originates from the xueshan mountain and flows westward to the taiwan strait the total drainage area of the da an river basin is about 758 km2 and the length of the mainstream is about 96 km the main species of land cover in this watershed are forests shrubs and cultivated fields in this study the land cover was considered to determine the range of surface roughness coefficient according to the reference table suggested by chow 1959 the surface roughness coefficient was then applied in eq 7 to calculate the runoff travel time for the surface flow of the ith order area based on the mechanism of the giuh model which is divided into subsurface flow and surface flow regions lee and chang 2005 as shown in eq 2 the runoff travel time respectively for the surface flow and the subsurface flow as shown in eqs 7 and 8 are significant hydraulic parameters to adjust the distribution of the instantaneous unit hydrograph iuh according to the information provided by the water resources department ministry of economic affairs in taiwan there are 12 rain gauges and 6 flow gauges installed in this watershed the average annual rainfall of this watershed measured by these rain gauges is about 2400 mm the precipitation observed in this watershed is distributed unevenly in time and space because of the influence of the southwest monsoon and the frequent occurrence of typhoons during the rainy season from june to september as shown in fig 6 three sub watersheds in which the flow records at the outlet are available are selected as the example areas applied with the proposed models there are obvious differences in the geomorphological conditions among the three areas such as the characteristic shape slope stream network distribution and drainage area to manifest the applicability of the proposed methodology the drainage areas of a b and c sub watersheds are 414 5 43 6 and 57 9 km2 respectively the highest order of stream number ω identified for the a b and c sub watersheds are 3 2 and 2 respectively as for the estimation of infiltration rate by using the greem and ampt method a reference table revealing the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and the suction head at the wetting front ψ f based on soil texture suggested by todd and mays 2004 was adopted in this study since the predominant soil types in the da an river basin are sandy loam loam and silty loam the range of k s was assigned between 3 4 mm h and 10 9 mm h the range of ψ f was assigned between 61 mm and 110 mm as for the training work of the lstm model for predicting the time varying ratio of pca a total of 72 rainstorm events in which 18 events were adopted as testing data were collected for cross validation the flood events chosen in this study occurred between 1983 and 2017 the accumulated precipitation amount of each selected rainfall event is between 172 mm and 2328 mm the range of flood peaks among these chosen storm events at the outlet of the sub watershed a is between 372 m3 s and 2853 m3 s 4 results and discussion the purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of applying the proposed pca determined method in the giuh model therefore in the following content the merit of designing the pca parameter to add the subsurface flow mechanism in the giuh model is first elaborated the importance of adjusting the pca parameter to be time varied is subsequently indicated 4 1 effect of considering the partial contributing area pca in this section three rainfall events were displayed to show the performance of simulation between the two types of giuh models in which one merely considers the surface flow routing and the other one additionally takes into account the subsurface flow mechanism by applying a constant pca the reason to present these three flood events for illustration is to reveal the overall applicability of the pca based giuh model by adopting significantly different optimal ratios of pca rpca they are respectively equal to 0 72 0 36 and 0 55 for the three floods as shown in fig 7 the upper side of each chart shows the rainfall hyetograph of a storm event giuh surface only rpca 1 denotes the hydrograph generated by the giuh model without designating the subsurface flow area so the value of rpca equals 1 giuh subsurface added constant rpca denotes the hydrograph generated by the giuh model in which surface flow and subsurface flow areas simultaneously exist by assigning a constant value of rpca less than 1 these simulation results show that compared to the model which ignores the subsurface flow mechanism the model with the consideration of pca can significantly adjust the overall distribution of hydrograph to be more closed to the observed discharges the decay of discharge during the stage of flood recession can be more accurately described by including the subsurface flow mechanism therefore the significance of applying the concept of pca to account for the subsurface flow routing in the giuh model can be demonstrated however as shown by the simulation results in fig 7 there is still significant room for improvement in specifying a proper value of rpca 4 2 performance of applying the proposed time varying pca as mentioned in the previous content the lstm neural network algorithm is applied to provide the prediction of rpca at every time step and then integrated with the giuh model the pearson correlation coefficient denoted as pc between the precipitation data and the optimal rpca for the training set is shown in fig 8 several related studies have provided guidelines for the interpretation of the correlation coefficient normally a correlation of 0 3 can be regarded as very low so it can be recognized as a negligible correlation although such a criterion is in some ways arbitrary bowley 1928 cohen 1988 in this study if the absolute value of pc is greater than 0 3 it is recognized that there is a non negligible correlation between the two data series therefore the antecedent effective rainfall intensities respectively within 9 5 and 4 h were assigned as model inputs for the a b and c sub watersheds on the other hand the value of pc between the time series of infiltration rate fi and the optimal rpca was 0 53 such a result reveals that these two time varying features are highly related to the temporal change of pca in this study a total of 18 testing events were analyzed after finishing the training of the lstm ann based model to show the importance of applying the proposed time varying pca determined method three of the 18 rainfall events that can generate the most significant variation of pca during the flood were provided for explanation as shown in fig 9 these three chosen floods separately at each outlet of the three selected sub watersheds and their corresponding rainfall hyetographs are displayed constant rpca denotes the hydrograph generated by the giuh model in which a constant value of rpca is adopted time varying rpca denotes the hydrograph generated by the giuh model in which the time varying rpca is given by applying the lstm prediction model these simulation results show that the proposed giuh model connected with the prediction of the optimal rpca depending on the hydrological conditions and the soil characteristics can effectively modify the hydrograph shape overall an example that shows the spatial variation of the pca in sub watershed a during a storm event can be seen in fig 10 in which the surface flow region expands with the increase in rainfall intensity and shrinks with the decrease in rainfall intensity to completely quantify and compare the simulated performance between the two previous giuh based models and the proposed modification integrated with the time varying pca determined method three metrics including the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse the relative error of simulated hydrograph compared to the observed data req and the relative error of simulated peak discharge compared to the observed flood peak rep were applied with the records of streamflow for further evaluation nse is a normalized statistic used to assess the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the variance of the measured data nash and sutcliffe 1970 therefore it can identify how well the plot of simulated versus observed data fits the diagonal of a 45 degree angle nse can be computed by 21 nse 1 t 1 n f q t q t 2 t 1 n f q t q 2 where q is the mean of observed discharges for a flood event and n f is the total number of observations for a flood event the metrics of req and rep can be respectively calculated by 22 r e q t 1 n f q t q t q t n f 23 r e p q p q p q p where q p is the simulated peak discharge during a flood event and q p is the observed flow peak during a flood event table 1 shows the analysis results of 18 testing rainstorm events by separately using these three metrics nse req and rep from the analysis results of nse and req it can be found that the performance of the giuh based runoff model can be improved by introducing the constant pca in the conventional model and the overall performance can be further ameliorated by adopting the proposed time varying pca determined method to replace the constant pca the values of nse for these 18 events can reach between 0 853 and 0 933 and the magnitudes of req for these 18 events can be reduced to a range between 0 087 and 0 162 as for the result of rep the proposed modified giuh based model also shows a better performance than the previous two versions which separately apply the concept of whole surface flow area and the constant pca however this aspect of improvement is not as significant as the results of nse and req it should be noted that the proposed methodology is developed to enhance the overall simulation performance including both flood rise and fall periods rather than merely improving the prediction of flood peak as shown in table 2 the mean relative error between the simulated discharges and observed discharges for the 18 testing events can be reduced from 0 361 to 0 143 maximum among the three selected sub watersheds if the constant value of rpca can be replaced by the time varying rpca in the giuh model by using the proposed method to emphasize the importance of using the proposed pca determined method the comparison charts between the observed flow records and simulated discharges respectively yielded by the giuh model assigned with constant rpca and that assigned with time varying rpca are also provided in fig 11 as shown by the analysis results at the outlets of the three sub watersheds the proposed method was found to produce superior performance than the model assigned with constant rpca because the proposed method reveals the more concentrated distribution of data points surrounding the 45 degree diagonal line as shown in table 2 the lowest coefficient of determination denoted as r2 among the three sub watersheds by applying the proposed pca determined method is 0 943 which is significantly larger than the r2 for the simulation case adopting the constant rpca in which the r2 is equal to 0 851 therefore the proposed pca determined method is highly suggested to be combined with the giuh model to further ameliorate the accuracy of streamflow prediction by thoroughly considering the hydrological and soil characteristics of the study site to effectively estimate the resultant hydrograph at several locations of interest the semi distributed giuh model is usually chosen to avoid using numerical algorithms therefore the runoff computation cannot be performed grid by grid in the giuh model it should be clarified that only the mechanism of infiltration excess overland flow can be considered in the proposed giuh model in reality the two mechanisms of infiltration excess overland flow and saturation excess overland flow may simultaneously occur in the same subwatershed this spatially heterogeneous infiltration situation is unable to be specially regarded in any model based on the concept of iuh nevertheless the mass conservation between the excess rainfall and the observed hydrograph has been checked for the simulation cases displayed in this study therefore this indicates that the overland flow was dominated by the input of excess rainfall moreover the accumulative volume of each simulated hydrograph performed by the proposed giuh model was also close to the accumulative volume of flow records of each corresponding event the main issue of this study is to accurately transform excess rainfall into the resultant hydrograph although the spatial variation of the subsurface flow region cannot be exactly delineated in the giuh based model the dynamic prediction of rpca can be an alternative to adjusting the hydrograph shape by assigning the rpca darcy s law can be utilized to reflect the longer runoff travel time in the subsurface flow region than that in the surface flow region of a study watershed it should be noted that the subsurface flow considered in the revised giuh model also results from the input of excess rainfall lee and chang 2005 5 conclusions the importance to integrate the surface runoff routing with the subsurface flow mechanism in the giuh model has been pointed out in previous studies so the partial contributing area pca plays a key role to separate the whole watershed into the surface and subsurface flow zones nevertheless the methodology to determine the pca is still difficult because the realistic range of pca is hard to be demonstrated and it involves many hydrologic factors the objective of this study is to establish a concise approach for determining the time varying pca which depends on the antecedent precipitation condition the soil moisture content as well as the discharge of streamflow at the beginning of a rainstorm at observed sites to understand the complex relationship between the aforementioned factors and the value of pca at every time step a dynamic neural network called long short term memory lstm was adopted to estimate the temporal change of pca during the runoff simulation the discharge records were considered as benchmarks for feedback on the neural networks and the loss between simulation results of the giuh model and observed discharges were adopted to adjust the value of pca via the training process of the lstm model the time varying pca was found to have significant efficacy to modify the hydrograph shape and therefore reducing the mean relative error between records and simulated discharges from 0 361 to 0 143 for the 18 testing storm events analyzed in this study such a result indicates that the proposed improved giuh model in which a pca determined method is embedded can adequately simulate streamflow especially for the situation in which the initial soil water content is lower credit authorship contribution statement pin chun huang

2386,wetlands have been singled out as a potential nature based solution for improving the resilience and reducing the risks of hydrometeorological extremes however whether and to what extent wetlands can affect hydrological droughts is not well understood to fill this gap we proposed a general framework to discern the effect of wetlands on i the characteristics duration severity development and recovery processes of hydrological droughts and ii the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts first hydrological modeling was conducted with a spatially explicit model integrated with wetland modules then the run theory and pooling method were selected to recognize hydrological drought events and identify their characteristics further the pearson correlation coefficient temporal shift method and cross wavelet transform were used to explore the propagation processes finally the characteristics and propagation processes were compared to quantify wetland mitigation services on hydrological droughts to validate the proposed framework two river basins from china and canada the gan river bain and the nelson river bain with distinct land cover were chosen to perform hydrological modeling and quantify wetland effects the results indicate that wetlands mainly contribute to alleviating hydrological droughts by decelerating the development process accelerating the recovery shortening the duration and reducing the severity of the hydrological drought events however the effects are variable as they may have weak impacts and even worsen drought conditions wetlands can extend drought propagation time and weaken the transition of meteorological to hydrological droughts the likelihood of hydrological drought formation due to meteorological decreased by 19 and 18 respectively for the gan river bain and nelson river bain thanks to the mitigation services of wetlands these findings highlight the drought mitigation roles of wetlands and the proposed modelling framework has the potential to be useful in beneficial in assisting basin management on drought risks in the context of climate change mitigation keywords wetlands mitigation

and singh 2010 naumann et al 2021 due to global warming drought frequency and severity have increased in recent decades and these characteristics are projected to continue and be further exacerbated by anthropogenic activities diffenbaugh et al 2015 gampe et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 different droughts have been catalogued e g agricultural meteorological and hydrological droughts and they have their own characteristics and indices hydrological droughts are defined by a shortage of surface e g river streamflow reservoir and lake storage and subsurface e g groundwater water resources that is below normal conditions over a given period dai 2011 mishra and singh 2010 they are closely linked to basin hydrological processes and with respect to other types of droughts they severely affect eco and socio economic systems including agricultural activities andreadis et al 2005 gampe et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 therefore it is essential to strengthen drought monitoring advance our understanding of the propagation processes and implement effective countermeasures to prevent and mitigate associated disasters to this end recent studies have examined ways of mitigating droughts including the development of nature based solutions nbs which are receiving increased attention e g large scale wetland restoration chausson et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 nika et al 2020 sudmeier rieux et al 2021 walz et al 2021 to improve basin or regional resilience and thus reduce their risks wetlands are characterized by specific topographic and soil conditions such as high soil porosity and substantial water holding capacity smakhtin 2001 making them capable of storing and maintaining abundant water strongly regulating hydrological processes acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo and findlay 2016 this endows wetlands with the potential to be used as a nature based solutions for improving the resilience of a river basin to drought risks ruangpan et al 2020 thorslund et al 2017 previous research efforts have assessed and discussed the effects of wetlands on hydrological droughts and specifically on baseflow or low flow support services most studies assessed these support services using comparative methods where wetland scenarios with and without wetlands drained and undrained wetlands varying proportions of wetlands etc were simulated e g bullock and acreman 2003 evenson et al 2015 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b wu et al 2020c wu et al 2020d they found that wetlands or increases in wetland areas can increase low flows considerably wharton 1970 panu 1988 bullock and acreman 2003 evenson et al 2015 kadykalo and findlay 2016 indicating a possible mitigation function of wetlands on droughts however wetland loss and drainage can also increase minimum summer low flows and dry period flow volume to some extent bulavko and drozd 1975 johansson and seuna 1994 lee et al 2018 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b wu et al 2020c wu et al 2020d demonstrating that wetlands may sometimes worsen droughts in addition some studies found that wetlands may have negligible effects on baseflow shantz and price 2006 therefore these inconsistent findings necessitate additional research to clarify whether and to what extent wetlands can mitigate or intensify hydrological droughts furthermore although baseflow can be used as a proxy to characterize hydrological droughts of a basin it cannot fully portray the specific characteristics of droughts such as duration severity and more importantly propagation patterns e g development and recovery processes these specific drought characteristics are important as they can serve as guides when developing drought mitigation policies and ultimately asses their effectiveness van loon 2015 thereby there persists a knowledge gap on how to quantify wetland regulation services on hydrological droughts and thus addressing this question is important for advancing our scientific understanding of basin scale effects and mitigation of droughts recently the evolution mechanisms of different types of droughts have become an important part of drought monitoring prediction and mitigation many studies have analyzed the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts and shown that there exist strong relationships between these two types of droughts guo et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 however the propagation process can vary because of the difference in regional catchment characteristics land use cover change and reservoir regulation wu et al 2018a wu et al 2018b ding et al 2021 and needs to be further investigated for example ding et al 2021 investigated the propagation relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts among different climate types in mainland china and found that landform is the major factor impacting the propagation process zhou et al 2021 identified different propagation times between these two types of droughts across five subregions of the pearl river basin and revealed that land cover types could greatly affect the drought propagation time therefore the lifecycle of drought propagation processes can be understood more systematically from the perspective of their potential governing factors such as hydrological regulation services of wetlands because wetlands are often abundant across many landscapes their water storage and cycling represent characteristics that could further our understanding of the drought propagation processes within a basin brunner et al 2021 golden et al 2021 walz et al 2021 furthermore the regulation services of wetlands as several studies have demonstrated can modify rainfall runoff processes i e meteorological hydrological drought propagation processes governing the water transport mechanisms at the basin scale bullock and acreman 2003 acreman and holden 2013 lee et al 2018 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b however the effects of wetlands on the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts remain unclear this lack of consensus hinders our ability to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of drought hazards therefore it would be meaningful to figure out how the propagation processes can change under the influence of wetland hydrological regulation services and thus guide our effort to set targets for wetland conservation and implementation of effective adaptation plans thus improving basin resilience to hydrological droughts in this study we hypothesize that wetlands can largely affect a river basin s resilience to hydrological drought events to test the hypothesis we propose a general framework to answer whether and to what extent wetlands can affect hydrological droughts and underlying propagation processes of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts at the basin scale specifically we perform two tasks i quantifying wetland effects on hydrological droughts characteristics duration severity development and recovery processes ii assessing changes in the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts given wetland regulation services the findings of this study can provide new insights to mitigate droughts given the hydrological regulation services of wetlands 2 methodology in this study we selected a distributed hydrological modelling platform including wetland hydrology modules i e isolated and riparian wetlands modules to simulate basin hydrological processes we first used the monthly precipitation basin average and simulated streamflow hydrological stations to calculate the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 respectively we then applied the run theory yevjevich 1967 and pooling method guo et al 2020 to recognize and characterize drought duration severity and propagation time meteorological and hydrological droughts further we explored the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts using the pearson correlation coefficient temporal shift method and cross wavelet transforms finally we compared the multiple characteristics and the relationship under with and without wetland scenarios to discern whether and to what extent wetlands can affect hydrological droughts and modify the propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts at the basin scale the methodological framework proposed in this study is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 distributed hydrological modeling platform coupling with wetland hydrological modules we used the physitel hydrotel modeling platform to simulate stream flows this platform has been used to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological functions of wetlands by fossey et al 2016 blanchette et al 2019 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b wu et al 2021 blanchette et al 2022 and wu et al 2022 physitel is a geographic information system used to pre process hydrological modeling data noël et al 2014 rousseau et al 2011 using a digital elevation model a vectorized hydrographic network and raster based land cover and soil type maps physitel divides the basin into relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhus the rhhus were defined as hillslopes using the algorithm proposed by noël et al 2014 in addition physitel distinguishes wetlands from other land cover types and then classifies both isolated and riparian wetlands based on the percentage of pixels adjacent to the hydrographic network fossey et al 2015 it subsequently generates data pertaining to isolated and riparian wetlands and their contributing areas ca the physitel platform uses the concept of a hydrologically equivalent wetland hew proposed by wang et al 2008 to integrate isolated wetlands iws and riparian wetlands rws at the rhhu scale the concept assumes that the characteristics e g ca and wetland surface area of a hew i e rws or rws are considered to be the most important the ca and wetland surface area characteristics represent the characteristics of each wetland type within a rhhu there are several conditions for this concept i each rhhu can only have one isolated and or riparian hew ii a hew must be fully integrated within a rhhu iii a numerical hew must be within a rhhu iv iws are the numerical coupling of hew parameters and v rws are numerical and spatial belonging to a specific river segment coupling of hew parameters based on this the maximum wetland area and the area of wetland ca for each wetland type iws or rws within the rhhu can be calculated the maximum wetland area is calculated from the pixel cells in the raster map containing wetlands and the wetland ca area is obtained from the flow direction accumulation matrix the surface area and wetland drainage area liu et al 2008 were determined automatically by physitel after processing the physiographic datasets physitel can directly export the database as part of the input data to hydrotel the data can also be used for other hydrological models it should be noted that the typically large rhhus contain large wetland complexes composing of various wetland categories such as bogs fens marshes and forested peatlands fossey et al 2015 hydrotel is a physically based semi distributed hydrological model turcotte et al 2007 bouda et al 2012 bouda et al 2014 that requires aside from the data processed by physitel meteorological data e g daily temperature and precipitation and daily flows for calibration purposes as input in hydrotel the simulation of hydrological processes is divided into seven sub models interpolation of meteorological data accumulation and melt of the snow fortin et al 2006 potential evapotranspiration vertical water balance wetlands water balance overland routing and channel routing for the schematic flow diagram of various components including wetlands modules of the hydrotel model please see supplement for the simulated hydrological processes and available algorithms for simulation please see table s1 hydrotel couples the hydrological processes associated with both iws and rws at the rhhu scale and calculates the wetland water balance with respect to the surface area of the hew ca and rhhu specifically hydrotel model simulate runoff generation and routing scheme i between isolated wetland ca without wetlands iws and lowlands downstream areas of wetland outflow and ii between riverine wetland ca rws and lowlands for iws the hydrogeological processes are integrated in the vertical water budget bv3c at the rhhu scale for rws the water balance is partially integrated in bv3c of the rhhu and directly connected to the associated river segment via the kinematic wave equation these representations provide a modelling approach that can simulate water balances at the wetland scale while considering their interactions with the surrounding environment ca area and hydrological connectivity fossey et al 2015 the equation of water balance model for iws module is defined as follows 1 v i w s 2 v i w s 1 v fin v out v pre v ev v seep where v iws2 and v iws1 are volumes of water stored in the isolated hew at the end and at the beginning of the computational time step respectively m3 v fin is the volume of inflows to the hew m3 v pre is the volume of precipitation falling on the hew m3 v ev is the evaporation from the hew m3 estimated as a fraction of the evaporation at rhhu scale wang et al 2008 v seep is the water defined as lost to a deep aquifer m3 and based on the saturated hydraulic conductivity v evap is calculated as 2 v evap 10 η e p s a where e is an evaporation coefficient with a value of 0 6 e p is the potential evapotranspiration for a given day mm and sa is the surface area of wetland ha the riparian wetland module is partially integrated in the bv3c of a rhhu and is directly connected to the relevant river segment through the kinematic wave equation the water balance of the riparian wetland at each time period can be expressed as follows 3 v r w s 2 v r w s 1 v fin v ex v pre v ev v seep where v rws2 and v rws1 are volumes of water stored in the riparian hew at the end and at the beginning of the computational time step respectively m3 v ex is the volume of surface and or lateral waters exchanged i e added or withdrawn between the hew and the river segment m3 for a detailed description of the specific calculation process of the parameters in the above equation please refer to fossey et al 2015 2 2 hydrological drought recognition and assessment precipitation governs the water balance of a region especially at the basin scale river flow is a fundamental indicator of abundance or deficit of water resources in this study the spi and sri were employed to indicate meteorological drought and hydrological drought respectively because the spi has been recommended by the world meteorological organization as the indicator to track the meteorological drought hayes et al 2011 and sri can describe hydrological processes relating to the climate impacts on the seasonal fluctuations in runoff mishra and singh 2010 previous studies demonstrated that the gamma function fitted better than any other distributions of precipitation at multi timescales e g 1 12 months han et al 2019 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b ding et al 2021 while the log normal function provided preferable fitting for flow shukla and wood 2008 shin et al 2016 wu et al 2017 therefore the gamma distribution and log normal distribution were chosen to fit the probability density function of monthly precipitation basin average and simulated streamflow hydrological stations respectively they were then transformed into a standard normal distribution for values of spi and sri values using an equal probability transformation mckee et al 1993 wu et al 2017 the detailed calculation procedures can be found in shukla and wood 2008 and vicente serrano et al 2012 the run theory and pooling method were used to identify and characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts fig 2 based on the run theory a drought is considered to have occurred if the spi and sri values are consistently below a specific threshold level for a certain period yevjevich 1967 however due to the multiple timescales these drought events include duration deviation such as excessive short duration and low severity especially a lot of overlapped information guo et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 therefore the pooling method developed by guo et al 2020 was used to i exclude short and mild droughts and ii merge adjacent drought events in this study following guo et al 2020 we first eliminated drought events occurring within a 3 months interval then the droughts with duration and intensity below certain thresholds were excluded the thresholds refer to two pre defined critical ratios representing the percentiles of the average values of drought duration r d and drought severity r s for the specific processes of pooling and excluding the reader can refer to the studies of guo et al 2020 and tu et al 2018 the drought duration d drought severity s and propagation speeds were used for delineating the characteristics of the event d is the number of drought months spanning from the start to the end of the event s refers to the accumulated deficit values throughout the drought duration previous studies have shown that drought propagation includes the development and recovery periods based on the location of the maximum absolute value of a drought index during the duration of the event pi time period bonsal et al 2011 thomas et al 2014 to further characterize a drought the events were divided by two sub periods i e the development d d and recovery d r periods fig 2 correspondingly the severity and duration during the two sub periods d d and d r s d and s r were also calculated simultaneously the development and recovery speeds were used to identify the specific drought propagation characteristics following wu et al 2018 and wu et al 2020 the development speed ds is defined as the rate of change of the drought index during the development period while the recovery speed rs refers to the drought termination rate during the recovery period parry et al 2016a parry et al 2016b wu et al 2018a wu et al 2018b the ds and rs of a drought event are obtained as follows 4 ds δ t v d d δ t d i 1 2 n 5 rs δ t v r d δ t r i 1 2 n where δtvdd and δtvrd are the total variation of the drought index in the development and recovery periods respectively δt d and δt r are the total time intervals for the development and recovery periods respectively 2 3 quantification of the effects of wetlands on hydrological droughts the multiple characteristics of hydrological droughts were extracted section 2 2 using sri values calculated from monthly flows under the with and without of wetlands i e wetland scenarios with wi and without wo wetlands respectively for each drought event we calculated the relative change of drought characteristics to determine the effects of wetlands on hydrological droughts the computational processes can be given by the following formula 6 wdi d i wi d i wo d i wo 100 where wdi is the wetland impact index expressed as a percentage of reduction or increase in drought characteristic indicators di wi and di wo are drought characteristic indicators i e d s d d d r s d s r ds and rs obtained from simulated streamflow time series for the with wi and without wo wetlands scenarios respectively a negative value for wdi denotes those wetlands provide drought alleviation services while conversely a positive value for wdi refers to drought alleviation disservices i e drought augmentation in this study we extracted multiple characteristics of sri to detect whether there is variability in the attenuation or amplification wetland effects for different timescales n n month spi sri1 sri3 sri6 and sri12 also anova and fisher s least significant difference lsd tests were used to detect whether there were significant differences in drought characteristics between the wetland scenarios 2 4 assessment of the effect of wetlands on the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts we assessed the effect of wetlands on the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts in three ways i the drought propagation time dpt ii response periodicities rp and iii transition characteristics see detailed description below after determining dpt rp and transition characteristics for each wetland scenario the effects were quantified using formula 5 section 2 3 2 4 1 identification of drought propagation time the pearson correlation coefficient pcc has been widely used to investigate the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts barker et al 2016 the maximum pcc between spin n month spi and sri1 is often selected to represent the most suitable drought propagation time dpt guo et al 2020 ding et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 the pearson correlation coefficient pcc is defined as 7 pcc i 1 n φ i φ w i w i 1 n φ i φ 2 i 1 n w i w 2 where φ i and w i denote two time series i 1 2 n the pearson correlation coefficient has a value between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates total positive linear correlation 0 indicates no linear correlation and 1 indicates total negative linear correlation a significant correlation between the two sets of data is indicated when p 0 05 and a very significant correlation is indicated when p 0 01 p of 0 05 indicates that the relationship between the two sets of data is not significant however determination of dpr based on correlation coefficient method have some uncertainties first this method is based on two assumptions first that the meteorological drought is the driver of hydrological drought and that the propagation time is the hydrological index time scale that is highest correlated this means that the applicability of the method is limited in regions where land surface hydrological processes are more strongly affected second for analyses that show propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought previous studies only include correlations where the meteorological index contains more time than the hydrological indices xu et al 2019 guo et al 2020 ding et al 2021 further previous studies found a non linear relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought rather than the linear relationship reflected by pcc zhou et al 2021 shi et al 2022 therefore such a method may not be a true reflection of the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought especially when considering the existence of several comparably high correlation coefficients to resolve this problem ho et al 2021 developed a temporal shift method for propagation time calculation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought based on run theory in this framework the dpt were calculated between the peak times which represents the time when extreme values occur during a meteorological drought t meteo peak or hydrological drought event t hydro peak specifically for a meteorological drought event and the corresponding hydrological drought event the propagation time is calculated as follows 8 dpt t hydro p e a k t meteo p e a k this dpt reflects the response time of maximum hydrological drought to maximum meteorological drought if the peak in the hydrologic index occurs before the spi i e the shift is negative it is considered a lead time whereas if it occurs in the hydrological index first i e the shift is positive it is considered a lag time the time corresponding to the maximum absolute value of each drought event was used as the extreme time in this study we first analyzed the influence of wetlands on the relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought based on the pcc then the influence of wetlands on the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought was quantified by temporal shift method 2 4 2 determination of drought response periodicities in this study cross wavelet transforms cwt were used to determine the periodic characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts in each subregion while cross wavelet transform was used to highlight their resonance frequencies and phase shifts in the time frequency domain the cross wavelet analysis developed by torrence and compo 1998 was used to determine response periodicities between matched meteorological and hydrological droughts cross wavelet analysis is an effective tool for exploring the correlations between two correlated time series hudgins et al 1993 grinsted et al 2004 and can preferably detect the linkages between two time series in time frequency domain torrence and compo 1998 previous studies have employed cross wavelet analysis to ascertain the phase shift between meteorological drought and hydrological drought huang et al 2017 ding et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 in this study the spin with the most suitable dpt section 2 3 1 and sri1 time series were processed by continuous wavelet transform cwt to identify the drps the cross wavelet power w xy for two time series x n and y n for example spi1 and sri1 can be obtained as follows 9 w xy w x w y where stands for their complex conjugation accordingly the complex argument arg w xy is regarded as the local relative phase between x n and y n in both time and frequency fields the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of two time series x n and y n with their background power spectra p k x and p k y is expressed as follows torrence and compo 1998 10 d w n s s w n y s φ x φ y p z v p v p k x p k y where zv p is the confidence level associated with the probability p of a probability distribution function which is defined by the square root of the product of two χ 2 distributions grinsted et al 2004 2 4 3 determination of drought transition characteristics in general most meteorological drought events can trigger hydrological droughts however due to multiple factors e g land covers reservoir within a watershed the transition from one to the other may be suppressed sattar et al 2019 proposed a drought transition rate to portray the sensitivity of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts the rate is calculated by dividing the number of hydrological drought events by the number of meteorological droughts during a recording period guo et al 2020 proposed to use the transition rate from meteorological drought to hydrological drought t r and the sensitivity of hydrological drought to meteorological drought sh m to describe transition characteristics 11 t r m mete h y d r o m hydro 12 s h m m mete h y d r o m meteo where mhydro represents the number of hydrological droughts while mmete hydro and mmeteo represent the number of meteorological droughts triggering hydrological drought and the total number of meteorological droughts respectively for tr a higher rate means that the relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought is more sensitive for s h m a higher value indicates a higher probability of transition from meteorological drought to hydrological drought given this we used for this study tr and sh m to delineate drought transition characteristics from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 3 case study and hydrological model performance 3 1 case study two distinct basins one located in southeastern canada and the other in northeastern china with abundant wetlands fig 3 were chosen to demonstrate the performance of the presented methodology the first basin the nelson river basin thereafter called nrb where wetlands cover approximately 10 6 of the basin area basin area is 74 km2 and is a sub basin of the st charles river basin quebec southeastern canada the nrb has as humid continental climate with annual total precipitation and runoff ranging from 657 3 to 1597 7 mm and from 2 7 to 6 9 107 m3 during 1969 2016 respectively human activities have strongly disturbed the landscape pattern in the nrb showing an interspersed distribution of land for human activities urban and agriculture and forest blanchette et al 2019 blanchette et al 2022 the second basin the gan river basin thereafter called grb is located in the upper nenjiang river basin where wetlands cover approximately 16 5 of the basin area basin area is 18 714 km3 these wetlands are near pristine and dominated by riparian wetlands distributed mainly along the river channels of the main streams and tributaries the grb belongs to a mid temperate continental monsoon climate with long cold winters and extensive snow cover the characteristic of mean annual precipitation and runoff variability are great ranging from 129 8 to 752 3 mm and from 14 3 to 37 4 108 m3 for the 1961 2016 period respectively wu et al 2020 all areas are mainly covered by pristine wetlands and forest except for the most downstream areas where agricultural land exists therefore the two basins have distinct sizes runoff volumes precipitation patterns and land cover for the nrb the observed daily streamflow covering the 2006 2016 period was gathered from hydrological station numbered 050915 fig 3a ministry of the environment and the fight against climate change 2021 for the grb the daily streamflow records spanning 1961 2018 were collected from the liujiatun stations fig 3b governed by the hydrology bureau of the songliao water resource commission 3 2 hydrological model performance the calibrated hydrotel model for the nrb and grb were used to estimate streamflow under scenarios depicting the presence and absence of wetlands in each of the river basin respectively we conducted the simulation based on the hydrological models already constructed by our previous works wu et al 2020 and blanchette et al 2022 calibrated the nrb and grb respectively and showed that the simulated flows both exceeded the acceptable performance criteria described by gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2015 specifically the nselog oudin et al 2006 pbias yapo et al 1996 rmse singh et al 2005 and kge kling et al 2012 for the nrb were 0 72 7 9 0 92 m3 s and 0 83 respectively while the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 correlation efficiency gupta et al 2009 pbias and kge for the grb were 0 63 0 81 4 6 and 0 78 respectively in addition the calibrated model can well portray the daily variations of streamflow especially it can simulate the low flow processes well at the outlet of the two basins fig s2 these calibration results demonstrated that simulated streamflows in the nrb and grb were well suited for these two basins under different climate conditions in physitel the digital elevation model land use land cover types hydrographic network and soil maps were used to delineate spatial modeling units e g sub watersheds and rhhus and to determine model parameters e g soil hydrology and wetlands modules for the nrg and nrb hydrotel requires meteorological data including daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures and daily streamflow records for calibration purpose the meteorological and hydrological data fig 3 and fig s3 land use types including wetlands dem soil map and river network and specific setup for model calibration and validation in the nrb and grb are described in wu et al 2020 and blanchette et al 2022 it should be noted out that we calibrated hydrotel model with the presence of wetland and ran simulation for both wetland and without wetland scenarios then the drought characteristic indices from the two scenarios were extracted and compared in order to quantify the drought regulation function of wetlands section 2 3 the without wetland scenarios are dealt in this study as follows when the wetland modules are turned off wetland area are not removed but they are treated as the land cover of saturated soils such a saturated soil is fixed and does not participate in hydrological processes such as water yielding and runoff routing and thus their explicit storage properties are not accounted for in the modeling this is a basic assumption of this study and is also used as a conventional method for evaluating the hydrological regulation function of wetlands such as swat liu et al 2008 wang et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 mike 11 ahmed 2016 and hydrotel fossey et al 2016 fossey and rousseau 2016 for the purpose of the study the calibrated hydrotel models were used to simulate daily streamflows in the nrb and grb spanning 1970 2018 using calibrated hydrotel model the simulated streamflows and basin averaged precipitation data for the same period were used to calculate sri and spi respectively the spi and sri indices were chosen because existing studies have demonstrated their better applicability in both northeast china li et al 2016 ma et al 2016 and southeast canada anctil et al 2002 bonsal et al 2013 finally we identified and extracted hydrological drought and meteorological drought characteristic indices from the sri and spi series section 2 2 4 results 4 1 wetland effects on hydrological drought characteristics to discern the effect of wetlands on the characteristics of hydrological droughts events for the nrb and grb were used to compare drought duration d and severity s under the with and without of wetland scenarios respectively as shown in fig 4 wetlands have an obvious effect on d of some drought events in the nrb and grb the average value of wdi wetland impact index are 7 62 and 9 5 for nrb and grb respectively indicating an overall reduction effect on d specifically in the nrb and grb wetlands cause a reduction in d for 7 and 6 drought events respectively accounting for 29 and 25 of the total number of drought events however it is clear that wetlands have no effect on d for some drought events in few cases wetlands even prolong d for 1 and 2 drought events for the nrb and grb respectively for s wetlands also play a major role in the reduction effect the average values of wdi severity for the two basins are 2 82 and 4 38 for the nrb and grb respectively in nrb and grb wetlands play a reducing s role in 15 out of 24 and 13 out of 22 drought events respectively however in some of the drought events wetlands exhibit a relatively weak role in reducing s that is the wdi severity number is close to 0 that being mentioned it is also clear that can wetlands contribute to exacerbating s for some drought events in nrb and grb there are 9 and 8 drought events in which wetlands play an exacerbating role respectively even in some drought events wetlands can act as an exacerbating role on s up to 10 35 and 10 50 for the two basins thus wetlands play an overall key role in reducing the duration and severity of hydrological drought events to further reveal how wetlands affect hydrological droughts pairs of corresponding hydrological drought events that are longer than or equal to 7 months were chosen to detect changes in the severity and duration during the development d and recovery r periods for both scenarios furthermore the maximum absolute value of a drought index pi the development speed and recovery speed were extracted from such paired hydrological drought events to delineate specific drought propagation characteristics under the two periods fig 5 shows the severity s d s r duration d d d r development speed ds recovery speed rs and pi during the development and recovery periods for the nrb and grb for both scenarios respectively as displayed in fig 5a and 5b for both the grb and nrb the specific characteristics of drought events differ between the developmental and recovery periods in addition d d d r ds rs and pi overall show clear differences between the two scenarios indicating that wetlands can modify duration propagation and extremes of hydrological drought events furthermore as shown in fig 5c and 5d for the nrb and grb the average values of wetland impact of d d d r s d s r ds rs pi are 4 83 and 0 59 2 04 and 7 14 12 71 and 4 02 5 25 and 6 91 9 12 and 22 28 4 42 and 26 16 4 01 and 0 74 respectively indicating that wetlands overall reduced d d d r s d s r ds and pi and increased rs in addition wetland effects on severity and duration differ in the degree strong or weak and behaviors attenuation and amplification effects during the development and recovery periods more particularly for some hydrological drought events wetlands increase d d s d s r ds and pi and decrease rs however the mitigation effect of wetlands on drought is overall stronger than their amplification effects therefore wetlands mainly contribute to mitigate the development speed and to augment the recovery speed reducing duration and alleviating drought severity both during the associated periods of hydrological droughts 4 2 wetland effects on the propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought 4 2 1 wetland effects on drought relationship and propagation time the pearson correlation coefficient between spin and sri1 was used to investigate the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts in the nrb and grb for the with and without of wetland scenarios fig 6 it can be observed that meteorological drought showed extraordinarily strong correlation with hydrological drought for the two basins the pearson related efficiencies of nrb and grb were 0 80 to 0 83 and 0 80 to 0 81 respectively and both reached significant level p 0 05 compared to the without wetland scenarios the pearson correlation efficiencies between spin and sri1 are relatively low for the with wetland scenarios indicating that wetlands diminished the response relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in addition the maximum pearson correlation efficiencies are 0 82 and 0 83 for the grb for the with and without wetland scenarios respectively for the nrb the maximum pearson correlation efficiencies are 0 814 and 0 813 respectively these results indicate that wetlands can reduce the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts to further investigate wetland effects on the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts the specific propagation times from meteorological drought to hydrological drought dpt were quantified using the temporal shift method based on four pairs of meteorological hydrological drought series the pairwise serious with the largest correlation coefficient i e spi1 sri1wo spi2 sri1wi for the nrb spi3 sri1wo spi5 sri1wi for the grb it can be observed that the dpt for drought events was generally shorter both in the nrb and grb with wetland scenario compared to the without wetland scenario fig 7 the median values for the nrb grb basins with and without wetland scenarios were 1 and 0 months 2 and 1 month respectively second in a small number of drought events hydrological droughts occurred earlier than meteorological droughts especially the longer the advance in the without wetland scenario simultaneously hydrological droughts lagged behind meteorological droughts for longer periods for the majority of events under the presence of wetlands the longest dpt for the nrb grb were 5 and 4 months 7 and 4 months for the with and without wetland scenarios respectively therefore wetlands can extend the propagation time from hydrological drought to meteorological drought in the nrb and grb 4 2 2 wetland effects on drought response periodicities to reveal how wetlands affect the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought cross wavelet transform was used to analyze four pairs of meteorological hydrological drought series and to highlight their resonance frequencies and phase shifts in the time frequency domain as shown in fig 8 a the phase arrows mostly point right indicating that meteorological drought and hydrological drought have a primarily positive correlation for the nrb for the with wetland scenarios specifically the positive correlation mainly occurred at the time scale of 10 20 months in 1974 1976 10 25 months in 1981 1988 6 16 months in 2005 2010 25 32 months in 2001 2005 and 30 52 months in 1989 1997 for these periods most of the phase angle amplitudes are 10 indicating that spi1 and sri1wo are basically in the same phase for the relatively short time scales nearly 1 4 years periodic spi1 and sri1wo have no statistically positive relationships however most phase angle amplitudes are larger for the nrb for the with and without of wetland scenarios compared with the wetland absence scenario fig 8b moreover phase arrows show stronger negative correlation between spi1 and sri1wi at the 95 significant level clearly the number of significant regions and the size of the spanning regions are reduced for the same time scales indicating a relatively weak periodic response relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought for the nrb for the with wetland scenario for the grb spi1 sri1wo showed no statistically positive relationship for the 1 4 years periods excluding a significant positive correlation at the time scale of 3 8 months in 1974 1978 for the with wetland scenario fig 8c similarly for the with wetland scenario there is no significant correlation between spi3 and sri1wo in that scale during 1979 2019 fig 8d the significant correlation between both spi1 sri1wo and spi5 sri1wi is mainly highlighted for the 8 12 months scale however the phase angle amplitudes and periodic length display a distinct difference specifically the response periodicities of spi1 sri1wo show more significant regions for the without wetland scenario than that for the with wetland scenario i e spi5 sriwi furthermore although their time scales and time span are approximate the phase angle amplitudes mainly indicate positive and negative correlation responses between meteorological drought and hydrological drought for the without and with wetland scenarios respectively these results indicate that wetlands affect the response between meteorological drought and hydrological drought by attenuating their periodic response and diminishing their correlation in the nrb and grb 4 2 3 wetland effects on drought transition characteristics to discern wetland effects on drought transition characteristics tr and s h m were calculated table 1 lists the drought transition characteristics for the nrb and grb and shows that the majority of meteorological drought events triggered hydrological droughts the occurrence rate of meteorological drought events triggering hydrological drought are 51 and 70 for the nrb 51 and 69 for the grb under the with without wetland scenarios respectively which indicate that mhydro occurs more frequently for the without wetland scenario than that for the with wetland scenario in addition meteorological drought was more sensitive to hydrological drought for the with wetland scenario compared with the without wetland scenario the tr for the with and without wetlands scenarios are 0 73 and 0 85 for the nrb 0 71 and 0 84 for the grb respectively furthermore sh m are 0 51and 0 71 for the nrb 0 51 and 0 69 for the grb respectively therefore wetlands diminish the sensitivity of hydrological drought to meteorological drought and decreased the transition rate from meteorological drought to hydrological drought for the nrb and grb to further detail how wetland affects the transition from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts we selected four hydrological events that are longer than or equal to 20 months the monthly precipitation flows spi1 and sri1 during four selected drought events for the nrb and grb for the with and without wetland scenarios are shown in fig 9 during a drought event there is a difference in flow curves between with and without wetland scenarios under the same precipitation conditions particularly during the extreme low flow period the flow for the with wetland scenario is slightly higher compared to that of the without wetland scenario the average flow for events 4 16 3 and 5 are 1 23 and 1 2 m3 s 1 2 and 1 1 m3 s 61 7 and 61 6 m3 s 100 2 and 96 6 m3 s for the with and without wetland scenarios respectively showing a low flow support from wetlands similarly under the same meteorological drought scenario the severity of events 4 and 16 for the with and without wetland scenarios are 0 78 and 0 79 0 99 and 1 08 in the nrb respectively for the grb the severity of events 3 and 5 for the grb are 0 72 and 0 76 0 10 and 0 16 for the with and without wetland scenarios respectively therefore wetlands provide more low flows during extreme drought periods thus suppressing the transition of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts 5 discussion 5 1 wetland based solutions to mitigate hydrological droughts many studies have been conducted on factors that can affect hydrological drought including among others climate systems e g jiang et al 2019 konapala and mishra 2020 land use land cover types van loon and laaha 2015 and dam construction wu et al 2018 to our knowledge no study exists specifically examining wetland effects on hydrological drought and the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts previous studies have shown that wetlands are can be considered as a nature based solutions in addressing social economic and eco environmental challenges thus bestowing a great value to human well being kadykalo and findlay 2016 lane et al 2018 thorslund et al 2017 in this study we mainly focused on wetland benefits to drought mitigation the findings from our modeling study on a river basin in canada and a river basin in china demonstrate that wetlands can greatly enhance the resilience of a river basin to hydrological droughts a very important finding is that the probability of hydrological drought formation due to meteorological drought was largely reduced under the effect of wetlands wetlands also decreased the severity of hydrological drought for the same meteorological drought level fig 7 given that there will be an increase in frequency and intensity of meteorological droughts under future climate change chen and yuan 2021 cook et al 2020 if the wetland drought mitigation function is strong enough the basin resilience to hydrological droughts will be significantly improved previous studies have demonstrated that implementation of wetland restoration and protection projects can enhance their mitigation services on hydrological extremes gómez baggethun et al 2019 javaheri and babbar sebens 2014 martinez martinez et al 2014 zedler and kercher 2005 given this hydrological droughts may not occur or could at least diminish in severity even though meteorological droughts are frequent in response to the enhancement of wetland functions therefore conservation of existing wetlands and reconstruction of lost wetlands can efficiently provide a nature based solutions to mitigate hydrological droughts within a basin wetlands increase recovery speed and decreased severity during the drought recovery periods for the nrb and grb indicating that wetlands contributed to the recovery of hydrological drought as illustrated in fig 5 the reduction effect of wetlands on rs could reach 42 and 49 and the promotional effect on rs could be up to 146 and 15 83 respectively demonstrating that wetlands can largely contribute to promote drought recovery in a basin in a recent study conducted on the millennium drought in southeastern australia peterson et al 2021 showed that watersheds may not recover from prolonged droughts however our finding shows that it is potentially possible to use the hydrologic benefits of wetlands to enhance the resilience of watershed drought recovery this has been evidenced by studies demonstrating the supporting function of wetlands on baseflow and low flow e g bullock and acreman 2003 evenson et al 2015 wu et al 2020 5 2 divergent effects of wetlands on hydrological droughts we also found that wetlands could intensify hydrological droughts to some extent as shown in figs 5 and 6 namely i amplify severity and prolonged duration ii accelerate development speed and diminish recovery speed of hydrological droughts for the nrb and grb these reverse effects might be attributed to water loss from wetlands during drought periods because large amounts of direct evaporation from standing or flowing water in wetlands during the summer season can lead to less water release and infiltration into river channel smakhtin 2001 in a review on the role of wetlands in the hydrological cycle bullock and acreman 2003 reported that 47 out of 71 studies showed that wetlands reduce low flows during dry periods as a result of increased evaporation compared to other land types further wetlands may have negligible effects on hydrological droughts as depicted in figs 4 and 5 especially on d d and pi for the grb and d r and s r for the nrb this partially confirms what previous studies have reported shantz and price 2006 kadykalo and findlay 2016 nika et al 2020 wu et al 2020 that is the hydrological services of wetlands are limited under certain conditions these demonstrate that wetland effects on hydrological droughts are variable that sometimes they may worsen drought conditions this is partly because the hydrological function of wetlands is governed by various factors including internal driving factors soil properties vegetation characteristics and initial hydrological conditions and external factors basin characteristics rainfall patterns climate change and anthropogenic activities fossey et al 2016 wu and zhang 2021 åhlén et al 2022 blanchette et al 2022 as a recent study conducted by lockwood et al 2022 who monitored channel storage wetland storage and rainfall at two contrasting pond sites in the tone and parrett headwaters somerset southwest england and found that wetland function largely dependent on hydrological conditions and wetland structure in addition changes in some or one of these internal and external factors can alter the degree strong or weak and behaviors alleviating and worsening effects of wetland services evenson et al 2018 ameli and creed 2019 acreman et al 2021 cui et al 2021 thus altering their effects on hydrological droughts these results suggest that we should pay attention to variability of wetlands hydrologic functions among wetlands and basins in particular the differences in their surface areas hydrological conditions topography typologies and climates in addition due to historical agricultural reclamation existing wetlands have undergone some degradation that is lower coverage weakened hydrological connectivity with river channels and landscape fragmentation meng et al 2019 chen et al 2021 wu et al 2021 which can weaken wetland effects on hydrological droughts for example climate change can modify the spatiotemporal inundation pattern of depressional wetlands londe et al 2022 thereby affecting their subsequent hydrological service functions i e attenuation or amplification significantly or not further the hydrological regulation services of wetlands will be less efficient and divergent under different future climate conditions wu et al 2022 however effective measures such as recovery and restoration of lost wetlands can still contribute to the achievement of wetland based solutions to mitigate drought because studies have evidenced that such measures can enhance their mitigation services i e the effectiveness of their nbs functions zhang and song 2014 thorslund et al 2017 evenson et al 2018 for example diking wetlands to buffer against drought is a common management adaptation to upstream hydrologic change particularly in deltaic wetlands in lower reaches of rivers haig et al 1998 downard and endter wada 2013 5 3 implication limitations and recommendations for future research this study proposed a novel methodology for measuring wetland mitigation services on hydrological droughts to implement the methodological framework we investigated whether and to what extent wetlands can affect hydrological droughts and the propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought at the basin scale by choosing two distinct basins in china and canada that both have larger area of wetlands we found that wetlands play an overall role in reducing the duration alleviating severity mitigating development speed and accelerating recovery speed of hydrological droughts also wetlands diminish drought propagation time and weaken the transition of meteorological to hydrological drought the novel framework could provide additional insights regarding the hydrologic significance of wetlands in improving basin resilience to droughts under climate change and improve our understanding on the consequences of alternative landscape management strategies while the framework developed in this study successfully describes wetland mitigation function on hydrological droughts there are several assumptions and limitations that future work should consider in conducting the scenario simulations for the without wetland scenario wetland coverage areas were not removed but they were considered as land cover with saturated soils and therefore their explicit storage characteristics and dynamics were not considered fossey et al 2015 wu et al 2020c in fact under extreme drought conditions it is possible for some wetlands to dry out completely min et al 2010 golden et al 2016 in addition the wetland hydrology boundary is fixed when conducting simulation of wetland water balance in hydrotel model which fails to account for the actual dynamic influences of wetlands i e their filling and spilling processes and the dynamic variations in their contributing areas zeng et al 2020 specifically under extreme drought conditions the wetlands will gradually shrink and split into multiple smaller patches werner et al 2013 forming new wetland hydrological boundaries and fill spill thresholds the fixed hydrological boundary in hydrotel will lead to an overestimation on the recharge effect of wetlands on the surrounding landscapes conversely under extreme flooding scenarios multiple wetlands will be hydrologically connected and combined to form a larger wetland with greater water storage capacity causing an enhanced regulating role of wetlands in watershed water cycle the hydrotel modeling framework can lead an underestimation on water interaction between wetlands and surrounding landscapes further we investigated drought propagation based on simulated streamflows with and without wetlands rather than observed streamflows which can cause additional uncertainty therefore a potential limitation or bias of our work to mention is that our modeling framework may potentially be overestimating or underestimating the role of wetlands in regulating hydrological droughts while it was outside the scope of this effort we suggest that future work could explore the influence of simulation framework of wetland hydrological processes wetland soil saturation or not dynamic variations in wetland contributing areas and inundation area on their mitigate function under extreme hydrological conditions i e extreme droughts and floods further this study investigated the regulating effect of wetlands on hydrological droughts based on spi which neglects the effect of evapotranspiration from vegetation and water bodies on the water balance of wetlands e g the water interaction between riparian wetlands and surrounding landscapes moreover the estimated evapotranspiration based on the fixed coefficient i e 0 6 may differ from the actual evapotranspiration of the wetland the next step is to i conduct field observations of wetland evapotranspiration and improve existing methods for calculating evapotranspiration and ii to develop a comprehensive drought index that considers meteorological hydrological and ecological parameters from the perspective of wetland water balance so as to explore the mechanism of wetland mitigation service on hydrological drought while we select two basins with distinct landscapes for this study the results of the two basins cannot fully represent the effect of wetlands on hydrological droughts for all wetland landscape types because the hydrological regulation functions of watershed wetlands depend on various factors such as geomorphic features initial hydrological conditions vegetation characteristics soil properties surrounding land types connectivity with other water bodies anthropogenic activities etc ameli and creed 2019 åhlén et al 2022 wu and zhang 2021 such factors can alter drought regulation behaviors of wetlands e g attenuation and amplification effects within a river basin for example wu et al 2021 found that river damming can impair hydrological regulation functions of wetlands thus largely weakening the supporting effect of wetlands on baseflow further fossey et al 2016 lee et al 2018 and wu et al 2020c demonstrated that riparian wetlands and geographically isolated wetlands can contribute incoordinate role in controlling basin hydrological processes for future studies it is important to consider not only the variable attenuation efficiency but also the internal driving factors affecting the hydrological function of wetlands we investigated wetland effect on monthly hydrological drought without consideration of short term drought events that span several days the short term drought events can also occur frequently and can lead to severe economic losses and ecological disasters in the basin under the influence of extreme climatic condition and anthropogenic activities tallaksen and van lanen 2004 fleig et al 2011 in addition strong anthropogenic activities such as agricultural irrigation reservoir operation and water transfer projects can largely alter basin hydrological processes and propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought wu et al 2018 chiang et al 2021 holden et al 2022 but are not considered in this study however unlike many studies that centered on low flow or baseflow the present study based on a monthly scale also advanced our understanding of wetland impacts on hydrological droughts as a next step we will try to further discern how wetland impacts on basin water balance processes during drought with consideration of anthropogenic activities especially focusing on how wetlands can modify the multi scale i e daily monthly seasonal and annual scales evolution mechanism of different types of droughts 6 conclusion this study investigated the effect of wetlands on hydrological droughts and the propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought at the river basin scale we developed a novel framework for discerning how drought propagation characteristics can be achieved by considering the wetland effects we highlighted wetland mitigation functions on hydrological droughts and found that wetlands contribute to reducing the duration alleviating severity mitigating development speed and accelerating recovery speed of hydrological droughts further wetlands can weak the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts extend its propagation time and weaken their transition based on the findings we conclude that wetlands exert significant impacts on alleviation of basin hydrological drought risks therefore wetlands are an important nbs for enhancing a river basin s resilience to hydrological drought risks and wetland conservation and restoration ought to be important management measures with these new insights our framework advances knowledge on the hydrological significance of wetlands and thereby supports wetland protection and restoration

2386,wetlands have been singled out as a potential nature based solution for improving the resilience and reducing the risks of hydrometeorological extremes however whether and to what extent wetlands can affect hydrological droughts is not well understood to fill this gap we proposed a general framework to discern the effect of wetlands on i the characteristics duration severity development and recovery processes of hydrological droughts and ii the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts first hydrological modeling was conducted with a spatially explicit model integrated with wetland modules then the run theory and pooling method were selected to recognize hydrological drought events and identify their characteristics further the pearson correlation coefficient temporal shift method and cross wavelet transform were used to explore the propagation processes finally the characteristics and propagation processes were compared to quantify wetland mitigation services on hydrological droughts to validate the proposed framework two river basins from china and canada the gan river bain and the nelson river bain with distinct land cover were chosen to perform hydrological modeling and quantify wetland effects the results indicate that wetlands mainly contribute to alleviating hydrological droughts by decelerating the development process accelerating the recovery shortening the duration and reducing the severity of the hydrological drought events however the effects are variable as they may have weak impacts and even worsen drought conditions wetlands can extend drought propagation time and weaken the transition of meteorological to hydrological droughts the likelihood of hydrological drought formation due to meteorological decreased by 19 and 18 respectively for the gan river bain and nelson river bain thanks to the mitigation services of wetlands these findings highlight the drought mitigation roles of wetlands and the proposed modelling framework has the potential to be useful in beneficial in assisting basin management on drought risks in the context of climate change mitigation keywords wetlands mitigation

and singh 2010 naumann et al 2021 due to global warming drought frequency and severity have increased in recent decades and these characteristics are projected to continue and be further exacerbated by anthropogenic activities diffenbaugh et al 2015 gampe et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 different droughts have been catalogued e g agricultural meteorological and hydrological droughts and they have their own characteristics and indices hydrological droughts are defined by a shortage of surface e g river streamflow reservoir and lake storage and subsurface e g groundwater water resources that is below normal conditions over a given period dai 2011 mishra and singh 2010 they are closely linked to basin hydrological processes and with respect to other types of droughts they severely affect eco and socio economic systems including agricultural activities andreadis et al 2005 gampe et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 therefore it is essential to strengthen drought monitoring advance our understanding of the propagation processes and implement effective countermeasures to prevent and mitigate associated disasters to this end recent studies have examined ways of mitigating droughts including the development of nature based solutions nbs which are receiving increased attention e g large scale wetland restoration chausson et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 nika et al 2020 sudmeier rieux et al 2021 walz et al 2021 to improve basin or regional resilience and thus reduce their risks wetlands are characterized by specific topographic and soil conditions such as high soil porosity and substantial water holding capacity smakhtin 2001 making them capable of storing and maintaining abundant water strongly regulating hydrological processes acreman and holden 2013 kadykalo and findlay 2016 this endows wetlands with the potential to be used as a nature based solutions for improving the resilience of a river basin to drought risks ruangpan et al 2020 thorslund et al 2017 previous research efforts have assessed and discussed the effects of wetlands on hydrological droughts and specifically on baseflow or low flow support services most studies assessed these support services using comparative methods where wetland scenarios with and without wetlands drained and undrained wetlands varying proportions of wetlands etc were simulated e g bullock and acreman 2003 evenson et al 2015 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b wu et al 2020c wu et al 2020d they found that wetlands or increases in wetland areas can increase low flows considerably wharton 1970 panu 1988 bullock and acreman 2003 evenson et al 2015 kadykalo and findlay 2016 indicating a possible mitigation function of wetlands on droughts however wetland loss and drainage can also increase minimum summer low flows and dry period flow volume to some extent bulavko and drozd 1975 johansson and seuna 1994 lee et al 2018 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b wu et al 2020c wu et al 2020d demonstrating that wetlands may sometimes worsen droughts in addition some studies found that wetlands may have negligible effects on baseflow shantz and price 2006 therefore these inconsistent findings necessitate additional research to clarify whether and to what extent wetlands can mitigate or intensify hydrological droughts furthermore although baseflow can be used as a proxy to characterize hydrological droughts of a basin it cannot fully portray the specific characteristics of droughts such as duration severity and more importantly propagation patterns e g development and recovery processes these specific drought characteristics are important as they can serve as guides when developing drought mitigation policies and ultimately asses their effectiveness van loon 2015 thereby there persists a knowledge gap on how to quantify wetland regulation services on hydrological droughts and thus addressing this question is important for advancing our scientific understanding of basin scale effects and mitigation of droughts recently the evolution mechanisms of different types of droughts have become an important part of drought monitoring prediction and mitigation many studies have analyzed the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts and shown that there exist strong relationships between these two types of droughts guo et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 however the propagation process can vary because of the difference in regional catchment characteristics land use cover change and reservoir regulation wu et al 2018a wu et al 2018b ding et al 2021 and needs to be further investigated for example ding et al 2021 investigated the propagation relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts among different climate types in mainland china and found that landform is the major factor impacting the propagation process zhou et al 2021 identified different propagation times between these two types of droughts across five subregions of the pearl river basin and revealed that land cover types could greatly affect the drought propagation time therefore the lifecycle of drought propagation processes can be understood more systematically from the perspective of their potential governing factors such as hydrological regulation services of wetlands because wetlands are often abundant across many landscapes their water storage and cycling represent characteristics that could further our understanding of the drought propagation processes within a basin brunner et al 2021 golden et al 2021 walz et al 2021 furthermore the regulation services of wetlands as several studies have demonstrated can modify rainfall runoff processes i e meteorological hydrological drought propagation processes governing the water transport mechanisms at the basin scale bullock and acreman 2003 acreman and holden 2013 lee et al 2018 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b however the effects of wetlands on the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts remain unclear this lack of consensus hinders our ability to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of drought hazards therefore it would be meaningful to figure out how the propagation processes can change under the influence of wetland hydrological regulation services and thus guide our effort to set targets for wetland conservation and implementation of effective adaptation plans thus improving basin resilience to hydrological droughts in this study we hypothesize that wetlands can largely affect a river basin s resilience to hydrological drought events to test the hypothesis we propose a general framework to answer whether and to what extent wetlands can affect hydrological droughts and underlying propagation processes of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts at the basin scale specifically we perform two tasks i quantifying wetland effects on hydrological droughts characteristics duration severity development and recovery processes ii assessing changes in the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts given wetland regulation services the findings of this study can provide new insights to mitigate droughts given the hydrological regulation services of wetlands 2 methodology in this study we selected a distributed hydrological modelling platform including wetland hydrology modules i e isolated and riparian wetlands modules to simulate basin hydrological processes we first used the monthly precipitation basin average and simulated streamflow hydrological stations to calculate the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and the standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 respectively we then applied the run theory yevjevich 1967 and pooling method guo et al 2020 to recognize and characterize drought duration severity and propagation time meteorological and hydrological droughts further we explored the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts using the pearson correlation coefficient temporal shift method and cross wavelet transforms finally we compared the multiple characteristics and the relationship under with and without wetland scenarios to discern whether and to what extent wetlands can affect hydrological droughts and modify the propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts at the basin scale the methodological framework proposed in this study is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 distributed hydrological modeling platform coupling with wetland hydrological modules we used the physitel hydrotel modeling platform to simulate stream flows this platform has been used to quantitatively evaluate the hydrological functions of wetlands by fossey et al 2016 blanchette et al 2019 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b wu et al 2021 blanchette et al 2022 and wu et al 2022 physitel is a geographic information system used to pre process hydrological modeling data noël et al 2014 rousseau et al 2011 using a digital elevation model a vectorized hydrographic network and raster based land cover and soil type maps physitel divides the basin into relatively homogeneous hydrological units rhhus the rhhus were defined as hillslopes using the algorithm proposed by noël et al 2014 in addition physitel distinguishes wetlands from other land cover types and then classifies both isolated and riparian wetlands based on the percentage of pixels adjacent to the hydrographic network fossey et al 2015 it subsequently generates data pertaining to isolated and riparian wetlands and their contributing areas ca the physitel platform uses the concept of a hydrologically equivalent wetland hew proposed by wang et al 2008 to integrate isolated wetlands iws and riparian wetlands rws at the rhhu scale the concept assumes that the characteristics e g ca and wetland surface area of a hew i e rws or rws are considered to be the most important the ca and wetland surface area characteristics represent the characteristics of each wetland type within a rhhu there are several conditions for this concept i each rhhu can only have one isolated and or riparian hew ii a hew must be fully integrated within a rhhu iii a numerical hew must be within a rhhu iv iws are the numerical coupling of hew parameters and v rws are numerical and spatial belonging to a specific river segment coupling of hew parameters based on this the maximum wetland area and the area of wetland ca for each wetland type iws or rws within the rhhu can be calculated the maximum wetland area is calculated from the pixel cells in the raster map containing wetlands and the wetland ca area is obtained from the flow direction accumulation matrix the surface area and wetland drainage area liu et al 2008 were determined automatically by physitel after processing the physiographic datasets physitel can directly export the database as part of the input data to hydrotel the data can also be used for other hydrological models it should be noted that the typically large rhhus contain large wetland complexes composing of various wetland categories such as bogs fens marshes and forested peatlands fossey et al 2015 hydrotel is a physically based semi distributed hydrological model turcotte et al 2007 bouda et al 2012 bouda et al 2014 that requires aside from the data processed by physitel meteorological data e g daily temperature and precipitation and daily flows for calibration purposes as input in hydrotel the simulation of hydrological processes is divided into seven sub models interpolation of meteorological data accumulation and melt of the snow fortin et al 2006 potential evapotranspiration vertical water balance wetlands water balance overland routing and channel routing for the schematic flow diagram of various components including wetlands modules of the hydrotel model please see supplement for the simulated hydrological processes and available algorithms for simulation please see table s1 hydrotel couples the hydrological processes associated with both iws and rws at the rhhu scale and calculates the wetland water balance with respect to the surface area of the hew ca and rhhu specifically hydrotel model simulate runoff generation and routing scheme i between isolated wetland ca without wetlands iws and lowlands downstream areas of wetland outflow and ii between riverine wetland ca rws and lowlands for iws the hydrogeological processes are integrated in the vertical water budget bv3c at the rhhu scale for rws the water balance is partially integrated in bv3c of the rhhu and directly connected to the associated river segment via the kinematic wave equation these representations provide a modelling approach that can simulate water balances at the wetland scale while considering their interactions with the surrounding environment ca area and hydrological connectivity fossey et al 2015 the equation of water balance model for iws module is defined as follows 1 v i w s 2 v i w s 1 v fin v out v pre v ev v seep where v iws2 and v iws1 are volumes of water stored in the isolated hew at the end and at the beginning of the computational time step respectively m3 v fin is the volume of inflows to the hew m3 v pre is the volume of precipitation falling on the hew m3 v ev is the evaporation from the hew m3 estimated as a fraction of the evaporation at rhhu scale wang et al 2008 v seep is the water defined as lost to a deep aquifer m3 and based on the saturated hydraulic conductivity v evap is calculated as 2 v evap 10 η e p s a where e is an evaporation coefficient with a value of 0 6 e p is the potential evapotranspiration for a given day mm and sa is the surface area of wetland ha the riparian wetland module is partially integrated in the bv3c of a rhhu and is directly connected to the relevant river segment through the kinematic wave equation the water balance of the riparian wetland at each time period can be expressed as follows 3 v r w s 2 v r w s 1 v fin v ex v pre v ev v seep where v rws2 and v rws1 are volumes of water stored in the riparian hew at the end and at the beginning of the computational time step respectively m3 v ex is the volume of surface and or lateral waters exchanged i e added or withdrawn between the hew and the river segment m3 for a detailed description of the specific calculation process of the parameters in the above equation please refer to fossey et al 2015 2 2 hydrological drought recognition and assessment precipitation governs the water balance of a region especially at the basin scale river flow is a fundamental indicator of abundance or deficit of water resources in this study the spi and sri were employed to indicate meteorological drought and hydrological drought respectively because the spi has been recommended by the world meteorological organization as the indicator to track the meteorological drought hayes et al 2011 and sri can describe hydrological processes relating to the climate impacts on the seasonal fluctuations in runoff mishra and singh 2010 previous studies demonstrated that the gamma function fitted better than any other distributions of precipitation at multi timescales e g 1 12 months han et al 2019 chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b ding et al 2021 while the log normal function provided preferable fitting for flow shukla and wood 2008 shin et al 2016 wu et al 2017 therefore the gamma distribution and log normal distribution were chosen to fit the probability density function of monthly precipitation basin average and simulated streamflow hydrological stations respectively they were then transformed into a standard normal distribution for values of spi and sri values using an equal probability transformation mckee et al 1993 wu et al 2017 the detailed calculation procedures can be found in shukla and wood 2008 and vicente serrano et al 2012 the run theory and pooling method were used to identify and characterize meteorological and hydrological droughts fig 2 based on the run theory a drought is considered to have occurred if the spi and sri values are consistently below a specific threshold level for a certain period yevjevich 1967 however due to the multiple timescales these drought events include duration deviation such as excessive short duration and low severity especially a lot of overlapped information guo et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 therefore the pooling method developed by guo et al 2020 was used to i exclude short and mild droughts and ii merge adjacent drought events in this study following guo et al 2020 we first eliminated drought events occurring within a 3 months interval then the droughts with duration and intensity below certain thresholds were excluded the thresholds refer to two pre defined critical ratios representing the percentiles of the average values of drought duration r d and drought severity r s for the specific processes of pooling and excluding the reader can refer to the studies of guo et al 2020 and tu et al 2018 the drought duration d drought severity s and propagation speeds were used for delineating the characteristics of the event d is the number of drought months spanning from the start to the end of the event s refers to the accumulated deficit values throughout the drought duration previous studies have shown that drought propagation includes the development and recovery periods based on the location of the maximum absolute value of a drought index during the duration of the event pi time period bonsal et al 2011 thomas et al 2014 to further characterize a drought the events were divided by two sub periods i e the development d d and recovery d r periods fig 2 correspondingly the severity and duration during the two sub periods d d and d r s d and s r were also calculated simultaneously the development and recovery speeds were used to identify the specific drought propagation characteristics following wu et al 2018 and wu et al 2020 the development speed ds is defined as the rate of change of the drought index during the development period while the recovery speed rs refers to the drought termination rate during the recovery period parry et al 2016a parry et al 2016b wu et al 2018a wu et al 2018b the ds and rs of a drought event are obtained as follows 4 ds δ t v d d δ t d i 1 2 n 5 rs δ t v r d δ t r i 1 2 n where δtvdd and δtvrd are the total variation of the drought index in the development and recovery periods respectively δt d and δt r are the total time intervals for the development and recovery periods respectively 2 3 quantification of the effects of wetlands on hydrological droughts the multiple characteristics of hydrological droughts were extracted section 2 2 using sri values calculated from monthly flows under the with and without of wetlands i e wetland scenarios with wi and without wo wetlands respectively for each drought event we calculated the relative change of drought characteristics to determine the effects of wetlands on hydrological droughts the computational processes can be given by the following formula 6 wdi d i wi d i wo d i wo 100 where wdi is the wetland impact index expressed as a percentage of reduction or increase in drought characteristic indicators di wi and di wo are drought characteristic indicators i e d s d d d r s d s r ds and rs obtained from simulated streamflow time series for the with wi and without wo wetlands scenarios respectively a negative value for wdi denotes those wetlands provide drought alleviation services while conversely a positive value for wdi refers to drought alleviation disservices i e drought augmentation in this study we extracted multiple characteristics of sri to detect whether there is variability in the attenuation or amplification wetland effects for different timescales n n month spi sri1 sri3 sri6 and sri12 also anova and fisher s least significant difference lsd tests were used to detect whether there were significant differences in drought characteristics between the wetland scenarios 2 4 assessment of the effect of wetlands on the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts we assessed the effect of wetlands on the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts in three ways i the drought propagation time dpt ii response periodicities rp and iii transition characteristics see detailed description below after determining dpt rp and transition characteristics for each wetland scenario the effects were quantified using formula 5 section 2 3 2 4 1 identification of drought propagation time the pearson correlation coefficient pcc has been widely used to investigate the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts barker et al 2016 the maximum pcc between spin n month spi and sri1 is often selected to represent the most suitable drought propagation time dpt guo et al 2020 ding et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 the pearson correlation coefficient pcc is defined as 7 pcc i 1 n φ i φ w i w i 1 n φ i φ 2 i 1 n w i w 2 where φ i and w i denote two time series i 1 2 n the pearson correlation coefficient has a value between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates total positive linear correlation 0 indicates no linear correlation and 1 indicates total negative linear correlation a significant correlation between the two sets of data is indicated when p 0 05 and a very significant correlation is indicated when p 0 01 p of 0 05 indicates that the relationship between the two sets of data is not significant however determination of dpr based on correlation coefficient method have some uncertainties first this method is based on two assumptions first that the meteorological drought is the driver of hydrological drought and that the propagation time is the hydrological index time scale that is highest correlated this means that the applicability of the method is limited in regions where land surface hydrological processes are more strongly affected second for analyses that show propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought previous studies only include correlations where the meteorological index contains more time than the hydrological indices xu et al 2019 guo et al 2020 ding et al 2021 further previous studies found a non linear relationship between meteorological and hydrological drought rather than the linear relationship reflected by pcc zhou et al 2021 shi et al 2022 therefore such a method may not be a true reflection of the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought especially when considering the existence of several comparably high correlation coefficients to resolve this problem ho et al 2021 developed a temporal shift method for propagation time calculation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought based on run theory in this framework the dpt were calculated between the peak times which represents the time when extreme values occur during a meteorological drought t meteo peak or hydrological drought event t hydro peak specifically for a meteorological drought event and the corresponding hydrological drought event the propagation time is calculated as follows 8 dpt t hydro p e a k t meteo p e a k this dpt reflects the response time of maximum hydrological drought to maximum meteorological drought if the peak in the hydrologic index occurs before the spi i e the shift is negative it is considered a lead time whereas if it occurs in the hydrological index first i e the shift is positive it is considered a lag time the time corresponding to the maximum absolute value of each drought event was used as the extreme time in this study we first analyzed the influence of wetlands on the relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought based on the pcc then the influence of wetlands on the propagation time from meteorological drought to hydrological drought was quantified by temporal shift method 2 4 2 determination of drought response periodicities in this study cross wavelet transforms cwt were used to determine the periodic characteristics of meteorological and hydrological droughts in each subregion while cross wavelet transform was used to highlight their resonance frequencies and phase shifts in the time frequency domain the cross wavelet analysis developed by torrence and compo 1998 was used to determine response periodicities between matched meteorological and hydrological droughts cross wavelet analysis is an effective tool for exploring the correlations between two correlated time series hudgins et al 1993 grinsted et al 2004 and can preferably detect the linkages between two time series in time frequency domain torrence and compo 1998 previous studies have employed cross wavelet analysis to ascertain the phase shift between meteorological drought and hydrological drought huang et al 2017 ding et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 in this study the spin with the most suitable dpt section 2 3 1 and sri1 time series were processed by continuous wavelet transform cwt to identify the drps the cross wavelet power w xy for two time series x n and y n for example spi1 and sri1 can be obtained as follows 9 w xy w x w y where stands for their complex conjugation accordingly the complex argument arg w xy is regarded as the local relative phase between x n and y n in both time and frequency fields the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of two time series x n and y n with their background power spectra p k x and p k y is expressed as follows torrence and compo 1998 10 d w n s s w n y s φ x φ y p z v p v p k x p k y where zv p is the confidence level associated with the probability p of a probability distribution function which is defined by the square root of the product of two χ 2 distributions grinsted et al 2004 2 4 3 determination of drought transition characteristics in general most meteorological drought events can trigger hydrological droughts however due to multiple factors e g land covers reservoir within a watershed the transition from one to the other may be suppressed sattar et al 2019 proposed a drought transition rate to portray the sensitivity of drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts the rate is calculated by dividing the number of hydrological drought events by the number of meteorological droughts during a recording period guo et al 2020 proposed to use the transition rate from meteorological drought to hydrological drought t r and the sensitivity of hydrological drought to meteorological drought sh m to describe transition characteristics 11 t r m mete h y d r o m hydro 12 s h m m mete h y d r o m meteo where mhydro represents the number of hydrological droughts while mmete hydro and mmeteo represent the number of meteorological droughts triggering hydrological drought and the total number of meteorological droughts respectively for tr a higher rate means that the relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought is more sensitive for s h m a higher value indicates a higher probability of transition from meteorological drought to hydrological drought given this we used for this study tr and sh m to delineate drought transition characteristics from meteorological drought to hydrological drought 3 case study and hydrological model performance 3 1 case study two distinct basins one located in southeastern canada and the other in northeastern china with abundant wetlands fig 3 were chosen to demonstrate the performance of the presented methodology the first basin the nelson river basin thereafter called nrb where wetlands cover approximately 10 6 of the basin area basin area is 74 km2 and is a sub basin of the st charles river basin quebec southeastern canada the nrb has as humid continental climate with annual total precipitation and runoff ranging from 657 3 to 1597 7 mm and from 2 7 to 6 9 107 m3 during 1969 2016 respectively human activities have strongly disturbed the landscape pattern in the nrb showing an interspersed distribution of land for human activities urban and agriculture and forest blanchette et al 2019 blanchette et al 2022 the second basin the gan river basin thereafter called grb is located in the upper nenjiang river basin where wetlands cover approximately 16 5 of the basin area basin area is 18 714 km3 these wetlands are near pristine and dominated by riparian wetlands distributed mainly along the river channels of the main streams and tributaries the grb belongs to a mid temperate continental monsoon climate with long cold winters and extensive snow cover the characteristic of mean annual precipitation and runoff variability are great ranging from 129 8 to 752 3 mm and from 14 3 to 37 4 108 m3 for the 1961 2016 period respectively wu et al 2020 all areas are mainly covered by pristine wetlands and forest except for the most downstream areas where agricultural land exists therefore the two basins have distinct sizes runoff volumes precipitation patterns and land cover for the nrb the observed daily streamflow covering the 2006 2016 period was gathered from hydrological station numbered 050915 fig 3a ministry of the environment and the fight against climate change 2021 for the grb the daily streamflow records spanning 1961 2018 were collected from the liujiatun stations fig 3b governed by the hydrology bureau of the songliao water resource commission 3 2 hydrological model performance the calibrated hydrotel model for the nrb and grb were used to estimate streamflow under scenarios depicting the presence and absence of wetlands in each of the river basin respectively we conducted the simulation based on the hydrological models already constructed by our previous works wu et al 2020 and blanchette et al 2022 calibrated the nrb and grb respectively and showed that the simulated flows both exceeded the acceptable performance criteria described by gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 and moriasi et al 2015 specifically the nselog oudin et al 2006 pbias yapo et al 1996 rmse singh et al 2005 and kge kling et al 2012 for the nrb were 0 72 7 9 0 92 m3 s and 0 83 respectively while the nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 correlation efficiency gupta et al 2009 pbias and kge for the grb were 0 63 0 81 4 6 and 0 78 respectively in addition the calibrated model can well portray the daily variations of streamflow especially it can simulate the low flow processes well at the outlet of the two basins fig s2 these calibration results demonstrated that simulated streamflows in the nrb and grb were well suited for these two basins under different climate conditions in physitel the digital elevation model land use land cover types hydrographic network and soil maps were used to delineate spatial modeling units e g sub watersheds and rhhus and to determine model parameters e g soil hydrology and wetlands modules for the nrg and nrb hydrotel requires meteorological data including daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures and daily streamflow records for calibration purpose the meteorological and hydrological data fig 3 and fig s3 land use types including wetlands dem soil map and river network and specific setup for model calibration and validation in the nrb and grb are described in wu et al 2020 and blanchette et al 2022 it should be noted out that we calibrated hydrotel model with the presence of wetland and ran simulation for both wetland and without wetland scenarios then the drought characteristic indices from the two scenarios were extracted and compared in order to quantify the drought regulation function of wetlands section 2 3 the without wetland scenarios are dealt in this study as follows when the wetland modules are turned off wetland area are not removed but they are treated as the land cover of saturated soils such a saturated soil is fixed and does not participate in hydrological processes such as water yielding and runoff routing and thus their explicit storage properties are not accounted for in the modeling this is a basic assumption of this study and is also used as a conventional method for evaluating the hydrological regulation function of wetlands such as swat liu et al 2008 wang et al 2008 evenson et al 2015 mike 11 ahmed 2016 and hydrotel fossey et al 2016 fossey and rousseau 2016 for the purpose of the study the calibrated hydrotel models were used to simulate daily streamflows in the nrb and grb spanning 1970 2018 using calibrated hydrotel model the simulated streamflows and basin averaged precipitation data for the same period were used to calculate sri and spi respectively the spi and sri indices were chosen because existing studies have demonstrated their better applicability in both northeast china li et al 2016 ma et al 2016 and southeast canada anctil et al 2002 bonsal et al 2013 finally we identified and extracted hydrological drought and meteorological drought characteristic indices from the sri and spi series section 2 2 4 results 4 1 wetland effects on hydrological drought characteristics to discern the effect of wetlands on the characteristics of hydrological droughts events for the nrb and grb were used to compare drought duration d and severity s under the with and without of wetland scenarios respectively as shown in fig 4 wetlands have an obvious effect on d of some drought events in the nrb and grb the average value of wdi wetland impact index are 7 62 and 9 5 for nrb and grb respectively indicating an overall reduction effect on d specifically in the nrb and grb wetlands cause a reduction in d for 7 and 6 drought events respectively accounting for 29 and 25 of the total number of drought events however it is clear that wetlands have no effect on d for some drought events in few cases wetlands even prolong d for 1 and 2 drought events for the nrb and grb respectively for s wetlands also play a major role in the reduction effect the average values of wdi severity for the two basins are 2 82 and 4 38 for the nrb and grb respectively in nrb and grb wetlands play a reducing s role in 15 out of 24 and 13 out of 22 drought events respectively however in some of the drought events wetlands exhibit a relatively weak role in reducing s that is the wdi severity number is close to 0 that being mentioned it is also clear that can wetlands contribute to exacerbating s for some drought events in nrb and grb there are 9 and 8 drought events in which wetlands play an exacerbating role respectively even in some drought events wetlands can act as an exacerbating role on s up to 10 35 and 10 50 for the two basins thus wetlands play an overall key role in reducing the duration and severity of hydrological drought events to further reveal how wetlands affect hydrological droughts pairs of corresponding hydrological drought events that are longer than or equal to 7 months were chosen to detect changes in the severity and duration during the development d and recovery r periods for both scenarios furthermore the maximum absolute value of a drought index pi the development speed and recovery speed were extracted from such paired hydrological drought events to delineate specific drought propagation characteristics under the two periods fig 5 shows the severity s d s r duration d d d r development speed ds recovery speed rs and pi during the development and recovery periods for the nrb and grb for both scenarios respectively as displayed in fig 5a and 5b for both the grb and nrb the specific characteristics of drought events differ between the developmental and recovery periods in addition d d d r ds rs and pi overall show clear differences between the two scenarios indicating that wetlands can modify duration propagation and extremes of hydrological drought events furthermore as shown in fig 5c and 5d for the nrb and grb the average values of wetland impact of d d d r s d s r ds rs pi are 4 83 and 0 59 2 04 and 7 14 12 71 and 4 02 5 25 and 6 91 9 12 and 22 28 4 42 and 26 16 4 01 and 0 74 respectively indicating that wetlands overall reduced d d d r s d s r ds and pi and increased rs in addition wetland effects on severity and duration differ in the degree strong or weak and behaviors attenuation and amplification effects during the development and recovery periods more particularly for some hydrological drought events wetlands increase d d s d s r ds and pi and decrease rs however the mitigation effect of wetlands on drought is overall stronger than their amplification effects therefore wetlands mainly contribute to mitigate the development speed and to augment the recovery speed reducing duration and alleviating drought severity both during the associated periods of hydrological droughts 4 2 wetland effects on the propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought 4 2 1 wetland effects on drought relationship and propagation time the pearson correlation coefficient between spin and sri1 was used to investigate the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts in the nrb and grb for the with and without of wetland scenarios fig 6 it can be observed that meteorological drought showed extraordinarily strong correlation with hydrological drought for the two basins the pearson related efficiencies of nrb and grb were 0 80 to 0 83 and 0 80 to 0 81 respectively and both reached significant level p 0 05 compared to the without wetland scenarios the pearson correlation efficiencies between spin and sri1 are relatively low for the with wetland scenarios indicating that wetlands diminished the response relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought in addition the maximum pearson correlation efficiencies are 0 82 and 0 83 for the grb for the with and without wetland scenarios respectively for the nrb the maximum pearson correlation efficiencies are 0 814 and 0 813 respectively these results indicate that wetlands can reduce the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts to further investigate wetland effects on the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts the specific propagation times from meteorological drought to hydrological drought dpt were quantified using the temporal shift method based on four pairs of meteorological hydrological drought series the pairwise serious with the largest correlation coefficient i e spi1 sri1wo spi2 sri1wi for the nrb spi3 sri1wo spi5 sri1wi for the grb it can be observed that the dpt for drought events was generally shorter both in the nrb and grb with wetland scenario compared to the without wetland scenario fig 7 the median values for the nrb grb basins with and without wetland scenarios were 1 and 0 months 2 and 1 month respectively second in a small number of drought events hydrological droughts occurred earlier than meteorological droughts especially the longer the advance in the without wetland scenario simultaneously hydrological droughts lagged behind meteorological droughts for longer periods for the majority of events under the presence of wetlands the longest dpt for the nrb grb were 5 and 4 months 7 and 4 months for the with and without wetland scenarios respectively therefore wetlands can extend the propagation time from hydrological drought to meteorological drought in the nrb and grb 4 2 2 wetland effects on drought response periodicities to reveal how wetlands affect the propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought cross wavelet transform was used to analyze four pairs of meteorological hydrological drought series and to highlight their resonance frequencies and phase shifts in the time frequency domain as shown in fig 8 a the phase arrows mostly point right indicating that meteorological drought and hydrological drought have a primarily positive correlation for the nrb for the with wetland scenarios specifically the positive correlation mainly occurred at the time scale of 10 20 months in 1974 1976 10 25 months in 1981 1988 6 16 months in 2005 2010 25 32 months in 2001 2005 and 30 52 months in 1989 1997 for these periods most of the phase angle amplitudes are 10 indicating that spi1 and sri1wo are basically in the same phase for the relatively short time scales nearly 1 4 years periodic spi1 and sri1wo have no statistically positive relationships however most phase angle amplitudes are larger for the nrb for the with and without of wetland scenarios compared with the wetland absence scenario fig 8b moreover phase arrows show stronger negative correlation between spi1 and sri1wi at the 95 significant level clearly the number of significant regions and the size of the spanning regions are reduced for the same time scales indicating a relatively weak periodic response relationship between meteorological drought and hydrological drought for the nrb for the with wetland scenario for the grb spi1 sri1wo showed no statistically positive relationship for the 1 4 years periods excluding a significant positive correlation at the time scale of 3 8 months in 1974 1978 for the with wetland scenario fig 8c similarly for the with wetland scenario there is no significant correlation between spi3 and sri1wo in that scale during 1979 2019 fig 8d the significant correlation between both spi1 sri1wo and spi5 sri1wi is mainly highlighted for the 8 12 months scale however the phase angle amplitudes and periodic length display a distinct difference specifically the response periodicities of spi1 sri1wo show more significant regions for the without wetland scenario than that for the with wetland scenario i e spi5 sriwi furthermore although their time scales and time span are approximate the phase angle amplitudes mainly indicate positive and negative correlation responses between meteorological drought and hydrological drought for the without and with wetland scenarios respectively these results indicate that wetlands affect the response between meteorological drought and hydrological drought by attenuating their periodic response and diminishing their correlation in the nrb and grb 4 2 3 wetland effects on drought transition characteristics to discern wetland effects on drought transition characteristics tr and s h m were calculated table 1 lists the drought transition characteristics for the nrb and grb and shows that the majority of meteorological drought events triggered hydrological droughts the occurrence rate of meteorological drought events triggering hydrological drought are 51 and 70 for the nrb 51 and 69 for the grb under the with without wetland scenarios respectively which indicate that mhydro occurs more frequently for the without wetland scenario than that for the with wetland scenario in addition meteorological drought was more sensitive to hydrological drought for the with wetland scenario compared with the without wetland scenario the tr for the with and without wetlands scenarios are 0 73 and 0 85 for the nrb 0 71 and 0 84 for the grb respectively furthermore sh m are 0 51and 0 71 for the nrb 0 51 and 0 69 for the grb respectively therefore wetlands diminish the sensitivity of hydrological drought to meteorological drought and decreased the transition rate from meteorological drought to hydrological drought for the nrb and grb to further detail how wetland affects the transition from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts we selected four hydrological events that are longer than or equal to 20 months the monthly precipitation flows spi1 and sri1 during four selected drought events for the nrb and grb for the with and without wetland scenarios are shown in fig 9 during a drought event there is a difference in flow curves between with and without wetland scenarios under the same precipitation conditions particularly during the extreme low flow period the flow for the with wetland scenario is slightly higher compared to that of the without wetland scenario the average flow for events 4 16 3 and 5 are 1 23 and 1 2 m3 s 1 2 and 1 1 m3 s 61 7 and 61 6 m3 s 100 2 and 96 6 m3 s for the with and without wetland scenarios respectively showing a low flow support from wetlands similarly under the same meteorological drought scenario the severity of events 4 and 16 for the with and without wetland scenarios are 0 78 and 0 79 0 99 and 1 08 in the nrb respectively for the grb the severity of events 3 and 5 for the grb are 0 72 and 0 76 0 10 and 0 16 for the with and without wetland scenarios respectively therefore wetlands provide more low flows during extreme drought periods thus suppressing the transition of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts 5 discussion 5 1 wetland based solutions to mitigate hydrological droughts many studies have been conducted on factors that can affect hydrological drought including among others climate systems e g jiang et al 2019 konapala and mishra 2020 land use land cover types van loon and laaha 2015 and dam construction wu et al 2018 to our knowledge no study exists specifically examining wetland effects on hydrological drought and the propagation of meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts previous studies have shown that wetlands are can be considered as a nature based solutions in addressing social economic and eco environmental challenges thus bestowing a great value to human well being kadykalo and findlay 2016 lane et al 2018 thorslund et al 2017 in this study we mainly focused on wetland benefits to drought mitigation the findings from our modeling study on a river basin in canada and a river basin in china demonstrate that wetlands can greatly enhance the resilience of a river basin to hydrological droughts a very important finding is that the probability of hydrological drought formation due to meteorological drought was largely reduced under the effect of wetlands wetlands also decreased the severity of hydrological drought for the same meteorological drought level fig 7 given that there will be an increase in frequency and intensity of meteorological droughts under future climate change chen and yuan 2021 cook et al 2020 if the wetland drought mitigation function is strong enough the basin resilience to hydrological droughts will be significantly improved previous studies have demonstrated that implementation of wetland restoration and protection projects can enhance their mitigation services on hydrological extremes gómez baggethun et al 2019 javaheri and babbar sebens 2014 martinez martinez et al 2014 zedler and kercher 2005 given this hydrological droughts may not occur or could at least diminish in severity even though meteorological droughts are frequent in response to the enhancement of wetland functions therefore conservation of existing wetlands and reconstruction of lost wetlands can efficiently provide a nature based solutions to mitigate hydrological droughts within a basin wetlands increase recovery speed and decreased severity during the drought recovery periods for the nrb and grb indicating that wetlands contributed to the recovery of hydrological drought as illustrated in fig 5 the reduction effect of wetlands on rs could reach 42 and 49 and the promotional effect on rs could be up to 146 and 15 83 respectively demonstrating that wetlands can largely contribute to promote drought recovery in a basin in a recent study conducted on the millennium drought in southeastern australia peterson et al 2021 showed that watersheds may not recover from prolonged droughts however our finding shows that it is potentially possible to use the hydrologic benefits of wetlands to enhance the resilience of watershed drought recovery this has been evidenced by studies demonstrating the supporting function of wetlands on baseflow and low flow e g bullock and acreman 2003 evenson et al 2015 wu et al 2020 5 2 divergent effects of wetlands on hydrological droughts we also found that wetlands could intensify hydrological droughts to some extent as shown in figs 5 and 6 namely i amplify severity and prolonged duration ii accelerate development speed and diminish recovery speed of hydrological droughts for the nrb and grb these reverse effects might be attributed to water loss from wetlands during drought periods because large amounts of direct evaporation from standing or flowing water in wetlands during the summer season can lead to less water release and infiltration into river channel smakhtin 2001 in a review on the role of wetlands in the hydrological cycle bullock and acreman 2003 reported that 47 out of 71 studies showed that wetlands reduce low flows during dry periods as a result of increased evaporation compared to other land types further wetlands may have negligible effects on hydrological droughts as depicted in figs 4 and 5 especially on d d and pi for the grb and d r and s r for the nrb this partially confirms what previous studies have reported shantz and price 2006 kadykalo and findlay 2016 nika et al 2020 wu et al 2020 that is the hydrological services of wetlands are limited under certain conditions these demonstrate that wetland effects on hydrological droughts are variable that sometimes they may worsen drought conditions this is partly because the hydrological function of wetlands is governed by various factors including internal driving factors soil properties vegetation characteristics and initial hydrological conditions and external factors basin characteristics rainfall patterns climate change and anthropogenic activities fossey et al 2016 wu and zhang 2021 åhlén et al 2022 blanchette et al 2022 as a recent study conducted by lockwood et al 2022 who monitored channel storage wetland storage and rainfall at two contrasting pond sites in the tone and parrett headwaters somerset southwest england and found that wetland function largely dependent on hydrological conditions and wetland structure in addition changes in some or one of these internal and external factors can alter the degree strong or weak and behaviors alleviating and worsening effects of wetland services evenson et al 2018 ameli and creed 2019 acreman et al 2021 cui et al 2021 thus altering their effects on hydrological droughts these results suggest that we should pay attention to variability of wetlands hydrologic functions among wetlands and basins in particular the differences in their surface areas hydrological conditions topography typologies and climates in addition due to historical agricultural reclamation existing wetlands have undergone some degradation that is lower coverage weakened hydrological connectivity with river channels and landscape fragmentation meng et al 2019 chen et al 2021 wu et al 2021 which can weaken wetland effects on hydrological droughts for example climate change can modify the spatiotemporal inundation pattern of depressional wetlands londe et al 2022 thereby affecting their subsequent hydrological service functions i e attenuation or amplification significantly or not further the hydrological regulation services of wetlands will be less efficient and divergent under different future climate conditions wu et al 2022 however effective measures such as recovery and restoration of lost wetlands can still contribute to the achievement of wetland based solutions to mitigate drought because studies have evidenced that such measures can enhance their mitigation services i e the effectiveness of their nbs functions zhang and song 2014 thorslund et al 2017 evenson et al 2018 for example diking wetlands to buffer against drought is a common management adaptation to upstream hydrologic change particularly in deltaic wetlands in lower reaches of rivers haig et al 1998 downard and endter wada 2013 5 3 implication limitations and recommendations for future research this study proposed a novel methodology for measuring wetland mitigation services on hydrological droughts to implement the methodological framework we investigated whether and to what extent wetlands can affect hydrological droughts and the propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought at the basin scale by choosing two distinct basins in china and canada that both have larger area of wetlands we found that wetlands play an overall role in reducing the duration alleviating severity mitigating development speed and accelerating recovery speed of hydrological droughts also wetlands diminish drought propagation time and weaken the transition of meteorological to hydrological drought the novel framework could provide additional insights regarding the hydrologic significance of wetlands in improving basin resilience to droughts under climate change and improve our understanding on the consequences of alternative landscape management strategies while the framework developed in this study successfully describes wetland mitigation function on hydrological droughts there are several assumptions and limitations that future work should consider in conducting the scenario simulations for the without wetland scenario wetland coverage areas were not removed but they were considered as land cover with saturated soils and therefore their explicit storage characteristics and dynamics were not considered fossey et al 2015 wu et al 2020c in fact under extreme drought conditions it is possible for some wetlands to dry out completely min et al 2010 golden et al 2016 in addition the wetland hydrology boundary is fixed when conducting simulation of wetland water balance in hydrotel model which fails to account for the actual dynamic influences of wetlands i e their filling and spilling processes and the dynamic variations in their contributing areas zeng et al 2020 specifically under extreme drought conditions the wetlands will gradually shrink and split into multiple smaller patches werner et al 2013 forming new wetland hydrological boundaries and fill spill thresholds the fixed hydrological boundary in hydrotel will lead to an overestimation on the recharge effect of wetlands on the surrounding landscapes conversely under extreme flooding scenarios multiple wetlands will be hydrologically connected and combined to form a larger wetland with greater water storage capacity causing an enhanced regulating role of wetlands in watershed water cycle the hydrotel modeling framework can lead an underestimation on water interaction between wetlands and surrounding landscapes further we investigated drought propagation based on simulated streamflows with and without wetlands rather than observed streamflows which can cause additional uncertainty therefore a potential limitation or bias of our work to mention is that our modeling framework may potentially be overestimating or underestimating the role of wetlands in regulating hydrological droughts while it was outside the scope of this effort we suggest that future work could explore the influence of simulation framework of wetland hydrological processes wetland soil saturation or not dynamic variations in wetland contributing areas and inundation area on their mitigate function under extreme hydrological conditions i e extreme droughts and floods further this study investigated the regulating effect of wetlands on hydrological droughts based on spi which neglects the effect of evapotranspiration from vegetation and water bodies on the water balance of wetlands e g the water interaction between riparian wetlands and surrounding landscapes moreover the estimated evapotranspiration based on the fixed coefficient i e 0 6 may differ from the actual evapotranspiration of the wetland the next step is to i conduct field observations of wetland evapotranspiration and improve existing methods for calculating evapotranspiration and ii to develop a comprehensive drought index that considers meteorological hydrological and ecological parameters from the perspective of wetland water balance so as to explore the mechanism of wetland mitigation service on hydrological drought while we select two basins with distinct landscapes for this study the results of the two basins cannot fully represent the effect of wetlands on hydrological droughts for all wetland landscape types because the hydrological regulation functions of watershed wetlands depend on various factors such as geomorphic features initial hydrological conditions vegetation characteristics soil properties surrounding land types connectivity with other water bodies anthropogenic activities etc ameli and creed 2019 åhlén et al 2022 wu and zhang 2021 such factors can alter drought regulation behaviors of wetlands e g attenuation and amplification effects within a river basin for example wu et al 2021 found that river damming can impair hydrological regulation functions of wetlands thus largely weakening the supporting effect of wetlands on baseflow further fossey et al 2016 lee et al 2018 and wu et al 2020c demonstrated that riparian wetlands and geographically isolated wetlands can contribute incoordinate role in controlling basin hydrological processes for future studies it is important to consider not only the variable attenuation efficiency but also the internal driving factors affecting the hydrological function of wetlands we investigated wetland effect on monthly hydrological drought without consideration of short term drought events that span several days the short term drought events can also occur frequently and can lead to severe economic losses and ecological disasters in the basin under the influence of extreme climatic condition and anthropogenic activities tallaksen and van lanen 2004 fleig et al 2011 in addition strong anthropogenic activities such as agricultural irrigation reservoir operation and water transfer projects can largely alter basin hydrological processes and propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought wu et al 2018 chiang et al 2021 holden et al 2022 but are not considered in this study however unlike many studies that centered on low flow or baseflow the present study based on a monthly scale also advanced our understanding of wetland impacts on hydrological droughts as a next step we will try to further discern how wetland impacts on basin water balance processes during drought with consideration of anthropogenic activities especially focusing on how wetlands can modify the multi scale i e daily monthly seasonal and annual scales evolution mechanism of different types of droughts 6 conclusion this study investigated the effect of wetlands on hydrological droughts and the propagation of meteorological drought to hydrological drought at the river basin scale we developed a novel framework for discerning how drought propagation characteristics can be achieved by considering the wetland effects we highlighted wetland mitigation functions on hydrological droughts and found that wetlands contribute to reducing the duration alleviating severity mitigating development speed and accelerating recovery speed of hydrological droughts further wetlands can weak the relationship between meteorological droughts and hydrological droughts extend its propagation time and weaken their transition based on the findings we conclude that wetlands exert significant impacts on alleviation of basin hydrological drought risks therefore wetlands are an important nbs for enhancing a river basin s resilience to hydrological drought risks and wetland conservation and restoration ought to be important management measures with these new insights our framework advances knowledge on the hydrological significance of wetlands and thereby supports wetland protection and restoration

2387,arid and semiarid areas are extremely sensitive to climate change the atmospheric boundary layer in these areas acts as a major factor of matter exchange and energy transport for the land atmosphere interactions in this study two turbulent transfer parameterization schemes respectively with surface energy closure and unclosure based on the lanzhou university semi arid climate observatory and laboratory sacol station are coupled into a regional climate model regcm4 5 referred to as exp balance and exp imbalance to explore the effects of the surface energy closure degree on the east asian summer monsoon simulations the results show that the surface soil temperature simulated by exp balance is lower than that simulated by exp imbalance because energy transferred from the underlying surface increases so that the energy retained in the underlying surface decreases in exp balance which weakens sensible heat transport and decreases the surface air temperature in the case of exp balance this is because the net radiation absorbed by the underlying surface for exp balance is in agreement with exp imbalance while the soil temperature simulated by exp balance is lower than that of exp imbalance compared with exp imbalance exp balance can contribute to increasing the atmospheric energy and more upward air flow begins to diverge as the anticyclonic circulation strengthens in the middle and upper tropospheres over the arid and semiarid regions consequently the subtropical high moving to the northward is hindered the rain belt stays in the south china for a long time and the precipitation in northeast china is reduced but in the south of the yangtze river it is enhanced in the case of exp balance keywords arid and semiarid areas surface energy balance closure degree

2012 china has the largest population in the world while the arid and semiarid areas make up the majority of the land area in china and even in east asia and the globe piao et al 2010 huang et al 2019 with an increase of 33 during 1994 2008 arid and semiarid areas have increased rapidly in recent years in china huang et al 2019 some special land surface processes over the arid and semiarid areas not only influence regional atmospheric circulation and climate but also affect the monsoon circulation throughout east asia lu and zuo 2021 with the characteristics of low nutrition content low vegetation coverage and low water conservation capacity in the soil the arid and semiarid areas in china are pretty sensitive to local regional and even global climate changes ma and fu 2006 2007 fu and ma 2008 huang et al 2016a 2016b burns et al 2018 huang et al 2019 decharme et al 2019 danabasoglu et al 2020 because the ecological environment is extremely fragile these regions are also vulnerable to drought and degradation reed et al 2012 huang et al 2013 huang et al 2019 the arid and semiarid areas are rich in sunshine with intensive light and heat which are helpful for vegetation growth however high potential evaporation means that water is rapidly lost from the soil water shortage and low soil water content are the main suppressing factors for plant growth and ecological systems zhang and shangguan 2002 lu et al 2021 soil water content is almost reliant on received rainfall since precipitation is pretty low and unevenly distributed both spatially and temporally it is difficult to conserve the soil water content in arid and semiarid areas guan et al 2009 the intensity of regional climate change over the arid and semiarid areas can be significantly amplified by land atmosphere interactions therefore the land atmosphere interactions over arid and semiarid areas are identified as a hot research spot or challenging issue at present such interactions control the energy balance influence water and heat transfer between the land and the atmosphere and affect carbon cycle processes in the atmospheric boundary layer apparently the land atmosphere interactions over the arid and semiarid areas of china play an important role in climate change wu et al 2009 ghimire et al 2016 huang et al 2017a b fox et al 2018 lu and zuo 2018 kennedy et al 2019 seo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the source sink of matter and energy for the atmospheric environment are in the atmospheric boundary layer the surface layer serves as a major region of the exchange of turbulent flux vapor and co2 between the land and the atmosphere their exchange properties exert non negligible impacts on atmospheric motion and surface environmental conditions and thus the study of these issues serves as the dominant aspect of land surface processes the law of energy conservation is the first thermodynamic law and a universal law therefore the exchanges of energy and matter in the land atmosphere interactions must follow the conservation law without exception however not until the late 1980s did many experiments show the energy balance to be unclosed with the energy balance closure ebc accounting for approximately 70 80 tsvang et al 1991 wilson et al 2002 li et al 2005 therefore searching for causes of energy balance unclosure ebu of observed energy is one of the important issues of exploring energy balance in their energy balance experiment oncley et al 2007 performed a detailed study of the ebc effect of the principal components of surface energy equilibrium arriving at the conclusion that the advection between the canopy top and flux measuring height is likely to have an impact on ebu panin et al 1998 indicated that the ebu bears a relation to a complicated underlying surface because a heterogeneous surface would generate an even larger time scale eddy than those measured by the eddy covariance method implying that the low frequency component of the turbulence spectra would affect the production of different ebc degree foken et al 2006 wilson et al 2002 proposed that the heat storage term is underestimated greatly for morning ebcs based on data over a range of china fluxnet points in addition the related causes are addressed in different aspects by foken et al 2006 and cava et al 2008 among others gentine et al 2012 and li and wang 2020 suggested that the correction based on the depth soil properties and soil water content on the ground heat flux can improve the degree of the surface ebc from eddy covariance system currently ebc is an exceedingly prominent problem in land atmosphere interactions studies causes of the ebu are not entirely understood and the explanations are imperfect so far many surface layer observations have shown that the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes was lower than the available energy when using the eddy covariance method it means the observed energy was unclosed the unclosed degree was usually 20 and even more in particular cases theoretically the available energy of the underlying surface is equal to the energy lost but there is a large deviation in the actual observations zuo et al 2010 in addition regional and global climate models are developed based on the energy balance between the atmosphere and the land surface and the parameterization scheme of the boundary layer in land surface models is often obtained from the similarity theory by using the observed turbulent heat fluxes thus the temperature pressure and so on are balanced and matched to achieve the numerical closure process xiao et al 2010 lawrence et al 2019 as a consequence the ebc degree is bound to affect local regional and even global climate simulations yang et al 2012 have illustrated that the near surface layer energy closure degree has important influences on land surface process simulations by the tblshaw two big leaf simultaneous heat and water model over arid and semiarid regions in this study we investigate the impacts of the ebc over arid and semiarid areas of china on the east asian regional climate this study is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the regcm regional climate model version 4 5 regcm4 5 energy balance closure unclosure turbulent transfer parameterization schemes and simulation experimental design in section 3 we analyze the simulated mean precipitation surface soil and 2 m temperatures as well as large scale circulations furthermore we explore the physical processes from the perspective of the energy closure degree that greatly affects the simulation performance of the east asian summer monsoon by regcm4 5 with different turbulent transfer parameterization schemes over the arid and semiarid areas in section 4 we summarize the main results and discussion 2 experiment station and data the lanzhou university semi arid climate observatory and laboratory sacol station 35 57 46 n 104 08 13 e elevation 1965 8 m is situated at the arid and semiarid areas of the loess plateau in china located about 48 km away from the downtown area of lanzhou city near the southern bank of the yellow river in gansu province huang et al 2008 guan et al 2009 wang et al 2010 the position of sacol station is shown in fig 1 a it is one of the reference sites of the international coordinated energy and water cycle observations project ceop the surface is mostly covered by short grass with protophyta fig 1b which is usually less than 15 cm tall and covers less than 80 of the surface in summer and autumn wang et al 2010 the land atmosphere interactions are intense in this period this study applies observations obtained by the sacol station of summer june july august from 2007 to 2009 the sacol station is located on a nearly north south mesa with a fetch length of about 120 m in the most common wind direction the mesa has a limited width of approximately 200 m from the east to the west and is about 600 m in length from the north to the south there is a large v shaped valley to the west of the site and a small valley one to the east the sacol site was established in 2005 and started continuous observations in may 2006 the site with its surroundings suffered little or no human activities so it can represent a primary regime of landform and vegetation in an arid and semiarid climate of the loess plateau huang et al 2008 xiao et al 2012 observational data from sacol are widely used now many studies have demonstrated that sacol observational data are of high quality and play a crucial role in investigating land atmosphere interactions and even predicting climate change over the arid and semiarid regions of the loess plateau in northwest china guan et al 2009 wang et al 2010 huang et al 2013 2016a 2017a b lu et al 2022 huang et al 2019 other specified information about the sacol station and instruments can be found in wang et al 2010 3 model and method 3 1 description of regcm4 5 regcm4 5 is one of the state of the art regional climate models developed by the abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics ictp in italy to simulate the local climate situation in the 1980s giorgi et al 2012 after decades of development the regcm4 5 has been updated to the fourth generation and widely used in geophysics qian et al 1999 myoung and seok 2015 regcm4 5 is one of the supplements to the low resolution global dynamic system models whose resolution can be up to 10 km compared with the global climate model regcm4 5 not only has the advantages of higher simulation resolution and faster calculation speed but also highlights research on typical regions liu and ding 2004 dan et al 2011 previous studies have demonstrated that regcm4 5 can well capture the long term climate characteristics precipitation distribution and atmospheric circulation caused by local and regional forcing in east asia jű and wang 2006 feng and fu 2007 gao et al 2012 2017 it is one of the main tools for the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change to assess climate change and forecast now tang et al 2004 liu et al 2006 3 2 development of turbulent transfer parameterization scheme 3 2 1 surface energy closure degree there are usually four methods to characterize the energy closure degree for the near surface energy balance wilson et al 2002 in this study we adopt the ordinary least squares ols method to explore the surface energy balance which can be expressed as the following equation yang et al 2012 1 le h a r n g 0 b where l 2 501 106 is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 h and e are the sensible heat flux w m 2 and water vapor flux kg m 2 s 1 respectively rn and g0 are the surface net radiation flux and ground heat flux respectively w m 2 a is the linear regression coefficient between the turbulent flux le h and the available energy flux r n g 0 which actually represents the surface energy closure degree and b is a constant standing for the offset of linear fitting for example when a 1 and b 0 the surface energy is completely closed for the soil heat flux the plates were set separately at a 5 cm and 10 cm depth underground with no device for direct measurement of ground heat flux the ground heat flux is an important component of surface energy balance to remove the effect of soil heat storage the analysis of surface energy balance and ebc features was performed not by directly utilizing the underground soil heat flux values but the ground heat flux there are a range of ground heat flux schemes fuchs 1987 and here briefly introduced is the method we used in this study that thermal diffusion equation and correction tdec approach yang and wang 2008 the expression for 1 d soil thermal diffusion equation is in the form 2 ρ s c s t t g z 3 g λ s t z where t is the time s z is the soil depth m t is the soil temperature k ρs is the soil density kg m 3 cs is the soil heat capacity j kg 1 k 1 λs is the soil thermal conductivity w k 1 m 1 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 after after integration we have 4 g z g z ref s t g z ref z ref z ρ s c s t z t d z in which g zref represents the soil heat flux in a given reference layer given the temperature profile t zi the discrete form of the integral expression is 5 g z t g z ref t 1 t z ref z ρ s c s z i t t t z i t t ρ s c s z i t t z i t z wherein ρscs z t cv z t 2 1 106 1 θsat 4 19 106 θ z t j m 3 k 1 with θsat denoting the soil porosity m3 m 3 and θ is the water content in a unit volume of soil m3 m 3 sellers et al 1996 the tdec approaches are described as follows the tdec scheme is utilized for gaining a reliable temperature profile to make accurate calculation of heat flux therefore yang and wang 2008 developed a new simple method to estimate soil heat flux from soil temperature and moisture observations thereby making a reliable temperature profile from limited observations by use of linear interpolation or cubic splines the discrete form of eq 2 about the new linear interpolation method can be represented by a tridiagonal system eqs 6a c for the 1st layer 6a t 1 t sfc for the ith layer 6b a i t i t t b i t i 1 t t c i t i 1 t t d i where a i 1 2 ρ s c s i z i 1 z i λ s i 1 t z i 1 λ s i t z i b i λ s i t z i c i λ s i 1 t z i 1 d i 1 2 ρ s c s i z i 1 z i t i t for the nth layer 6c t n t bot in which tsfc and tbot represent temperature at surface and bottom level respectively as the boundary conditions of the equation solving eqs 6a c led to a profile of soil temperature ttde there was deviation δt of the ttde from tobs the temperature δt correction procedure was as follows ① from δtk tk obs tk tde we had δtk where subscript k denoted the node k 6 in sacol station tk obs is the measurements and tk tde is the calculations from the soil thermal diffusion equation ② δtk at node k was linearly interpolated onto all other nodes i to have the difference δti ③ a final soil temperature profile was acquired from ti ti tde δti for each node if the bottom level was deep enough the heat flux with respect to the surface thermal condition was ignored that is we set g z ref 0 and in that case integration was performed using eq 5 from bottom to surface layer resulting in layered and ground heat flux cava et al 2008 indicate that the surface energy closure degree can be divided into the short term energy closure degree and global energy closure degree to quantitatively analyze the performance characteristics of surface energy non closure at different time scales the half hour average energy closure degree is defined as the short term energy closure degree and the average energy closure degree within a period of time is called the global energy closure degree fig 2 presents the hourly mean change of the short term energy closure degree in a day and summer mean global energy closure degree from 2007 to 2009 at the sacol station the short term energy closure degree in the daytime is higher than that at night in these areas with the highest energy closure degree of 0 79 and the lowest of 0 3 and the energy un closure is more significant fig 2a meanwhile the mean global energy closure degree in summer from 2007 to 2009 is approximately 0 79 and the energy is also not closed fig 2b this demonstrates that the measured turbulent flux le h is relatively smaller than the available energy flux r n g 0 based on the sacol observations by using the eddy correlation method in these regions 3 2 2 correction of turbulent flux according to the principle of near surface energy balance the residual energy caused by unclosed energy is distributed to the atmosphere based on the observed bowen ratio maayar et al 2008 therefore the corrected turbulent heat flux can be obtained to keep the bowen ratio unchanged which can be described as the following equations 7 β h l e 8 r es r n g 0 h l e 9 h c h β 1 β r es 10 l e c l e 1 1 β r es where β is the bowen ratio res is the residual energy flux w m 2 ec is the modified water vapor flux kg m 2 s 1 hc and lec are the modified sensible and latent heat flux respectively w m 2 fig 3 shows comparisons of the observed and modified turbulent fluxes it is obvious that the modified sensible heat flux is 14 higher than the observed sensible heat flux while the latent heat flux is 5 higher than the observed latent heat flux by using the sacol data it should be stated that the modified sensible heat flux sen and latent heat flux lat represent unrealistic condition near the value of 0 compared to the measured values 3 2 3 turbulent transfer parameterization scheme the near surface turbulent flux parameterization scheme adopts the bulk transfer coefficient method zuo and hu 1992 in accordance with gradient transport theory the turbulence flux can be expressed as follows 11 τ ρ c d u u s 2 12 h ρ c p c h u u s θ s θ 13 e ρ c e u u s q s q where τ is the momentum flux kg m 1 s 1 ρ is the air density kg m 3 cp 1 00464 103 is the specific heat capacity of air j kg 1 k 1 cd ch and ce are the bulk transfer coefficients of the momentum flux sensible heat flux and water vapor flux respectively u θ and q are the wind speed m s 1 potential temperature k and specific humidity kg kg 1 of air at the reference height respectively us θs and qs are the wind speed m s 1 potential temperature k and specific humidity kg kg 1 of the near surface respectively in general the near surface wind is treated as the motionless so that we assume us 0 hence the bulk transfer coefficient of the sensible heat flux and water vapor flux can be written as follows 14 c d τ ρ u 2 15 c h h ρ u θ s θ 16 c e e ρ u q s q in addition ch can be parameterized as a function based on the monin obukhove similarity theory zuo and hu 1992 dickinson et al 1993 this theory states that when scaled appropriately the dimensionless mean wind speed mean potential temperature and mean specific humidity profile gradients depend on unique functions of the atmosphere stability z l zeng et al 1998 as 17 kz u u z ϕ m z l 18 kz θ θ z ϕ h z l 19 kz q q z ϕ w z l where z 10 is the reference height m l is the monin obukhov length scale m that accounts for buoyancy effects resulting from vertical density gradients u θ and q are the wind speed friction velocity m s 1 temperature k and moisture kg kg 1 scales respectively φm z l φh z l and φw z l are the universal similarity functions respectively and k 0 4 is the von karman constant the flux has nothing to do with the height in the near surface thus the differential eqs 11 13 can be integrated formally as follows 20 u u k ln z z 0 m ψ m z l 21 θ θ s θ k ln z z 0 h ψ h z l 22 q q s q k ln z z 0 w ψ w z l where z0m and z0h are the surface aerodynamic and thermodynamic roughness lengths m respectively z0w is the roughness length m for water vapor in general z0m is a constant for the fixed regions in a period of time which is equal to 1 7 10 1 m in this study and z0h z0w z0m exp α u z0m v 0 45 zeng and dickinson 1998 the quantity is the roughness reynolds number re with the kinematic viscosity of air v 1 5 10 5m2 s 1 and α 0 13 the modified universal similarity functions ψm z l ψh z l and ψw z l are separately defined as 23 ψ m z l z 0 m z 1 ϕ m z l z d z 24 ψ h z l z 0 h z 1 ϕ h z l z d z 25 ψ w z l z 0 w z 1 ϕ w z l z d z meanwhile the momentum flux sensible heat flux and water vapor flux scales can be described as 26 τ ρ u 2 27 h ρ c p u θ 28 e ρ c p u q then we plug eqs 17 28 into the eqs 11 13 which can be estimated as 29 c d k 2 ln z z 0 m ψ m z l 2 c dn 1 ψ m z l ln z z 0 m 2 30 c h k 2 ln z z 0 m ψ m z l ln z z 0 h ψ h z l c hn 1 ψ m z l ln z z 0 m 1 ψ h z l ln z z 0 h 31 c e k 2 ln z z 0 m ψ m z l ln z z 0 w ψ h z l c en 1 ψ m z l ln z z 0 m 1 ψ h z l ln z z 0 w where cdn chn and cen are the bulk transfer coefficients of the momentum flux sensible heat flux and water vapor flux under neutral condition respectively on neutral condition φm z l φh z l φw z l 1 ψm z l ψh z l ψw z l 0 therefore 32 c dn k 2 ln z z 0 m 2 33 c hn c en k 2 ln z z 0 m ln z z 0 h k 2 ln z z 0 m ln z z 0 w eqs 32 and 33 indicate that the bulk transfer coefficients are functions related to the height roughness length and atmosphere stability which are simply expressed as follows 34 c d c d z z 0 m z l 35 c h c e c h z z 0 h z l c e z z 0 w z l the bulk richardson number rib is usually used to represent the atmosphere stability since atmosphere stability z l is difficult to evaluate in land surface process parameterizations the rib is defined as 36 r ib g z θ θ s t u 2 where g is the acceleration of gravity m s 1 and t is the absolute mean temperature between the surface and the reference height k the bulk transfer coefficients can be expressed as functions 37 and 38 with the roughness lengths and bulk richardson number rib as long as the heights are known 37 c d c d r ib c dn 38 c h c e c h r ib c hn c e r ib c en in this study the bulk transfer coefficient and bulk richardson number can be estimated by using the observed and modified sensible heat flux eventually the empirical relationships between ch and rib for stable rib 0 and unstable rib 0 conditions can be calculated by the following equations 39 c h c hn 1 3 4 r ib r ib 0 c hn 1 10 2 c hn r ib 1 2 r ib 0 40 c h c hn 1 4 1 r ib r ib 0 c hn 1 12 5 c hn r ib 1 2 r ib 0 where ch is the observed bulk transfer coefficient of the sensible heat flux chn is the observed bulk transfer coefficient on neutral condition c h is the modified bulk transfer coefficient of the sensible heat flux and c hn is the modified bulk transfer coefficient under neutral condition fig 4 displays the relationship between the observed ch and modified c h bulk transfer coefficient of the sensible heat flux with the bulk richardson number rib at sacol site on unstable and stable condition respectively it is noteworthy that there is c hn 1 29chn on neutral condition by fitting the observational data 3 3 simulation experiment design the simulation experiments cover 26 years from 1986 to 2011 over the east asian region the model integration starts on april 1st and ends on september 1st of the same year approximately covering the whole summer the first two months april may

the sensible and latent heat transport however the above mentioned unclosure and closure turbulent transfer parameterization schemes are suitable for desert sparse grassland and bare soil underlying surfaces because the sacol station is only typical and significant to represent the land atmosphere interactions over the arid and semi arid regions in northwest china zuo and hu 1992 wang et al 2010 zuo et al 2010 xiao et al 2010 yang et al 2012 thus it is suitable to couple the newly built ebc and ebu parameterization schemes into the calculations of soil parameters rather than the calculations of vegetation parameters in the model grid unit in summer the vegetation of the underlying surface was gradually dense with the time goes by which can affect the energy balance simulation process of the soil underlying surface fig 5 presents the default and the modified land cover vegetation classes over the model simulation domain the underlying surface of the arid regions are all set as the desert no vegetation cover in this study fig 5b to investigate the impacts of the energy closure degree over arid and semiarid areas of china on the east asian regional climate respectively under closed and non closed conditions consequently two simulation experiments have been conducted one experiment with the unclosed turbulent transfer parameterization scheme hereafter refer to as exp imbalance considered which can be simply described as eqs 39 12 and 13 the other experiment with the closed turbulent transfer parameterization scheme hereafter refer to as exp balance considered which can be simply described as eqs 40 12 and 13 under these circumstances all the physics process parametrization schemes except for the turbulent transfer parameterization scheme are identical in the two experiments therefore different parameterizations of turbulent transfer are the only factors contributing to differences between these simulations 4 results 4 1 precipitation precipitation is one of the most important components of the water cycle and its changes can substantially affect sustainable economic and societal developments gillett et al 2004 peng et al 2018 fig 6 presents the summer total precipitation for the simulation period 1986 2011 over china which shows that the spatial distribution of total precipitation is in closer agreement with each other between the two experiments the intensity of overall rainfall is in a state of regional gradient the precipitation in the arid area of northwest china is scarce the middle east is increasing and the south is the largest as shown in fig 6 c the difference in summer total precipitation between the exp imbalance and exp balance simulations is mostly concentrated in monsoon areas such as the northeast east and south china the difference of summer accumulated precipitation between the two experiments is not obvious in the arid and arid regions of northwest china since precipitation is scarce throughout year however the precipitation simulated by exp balance is smaller than simulated by exp imbalance in northeast china while the opposite is true in east and south china the spatial patterns of precipitation in every month vary in the same region because of the influence of the rain belt fig 7 shows the difference of summer mean precipitation between the exp balance and exp imbalance simulations exp balance minus exp imbalance in june july and august in general the rain belt gradually moves northward from the coastal areas of the south china to the yangtze river basin in july therefore the effects of the simulated results on precipitation are mainly concentrated in south china and the yangtze huaihe river basin meanwhile the simulated precipitation of exp balance is greater than that of exp imbalance in june over south china fig 7a fig 7 b demonstrates that the rain belt moves northward continuously to reach the yellow river basin and then reaches north and northeast china at the end of this month however the yangtze huaihe river basin is controlled by the subtropical high it is apparent that the summer mean precipitation simulated by exp balance is smaller than simulated by exp imbalance in july over the yangtze huaihe river basin especially over the northeast china fig 7b which indicates that the closed turbulent transfer parameterization scheme promotes the control of subtropical high pressure in the yangtze huaihe river basin and restrains the process of the rain belt migration to the northeast as shown in fig 7 c the rain belt is relatively stable and the simulated summer mean precipitation of exp balance is smaller than that of exp imbalance in august over the yangtze huaihe river basin and is mainly controlled by the subtropical high in short numerical simulations reveal that the closed turbulent transfer parameterization scheme can facilitate rainfall and weaken the subtropical high of the yangtze river basin of china 4 2 temperature the differences of the simulated summer mean surface soil temperature between exp balance and exp imbalance in june july and august respectively over the east asian region are given in fig 8 it is clear that the summer mean surface soil temperature simulated by exp balance is obviously lower than that of exp imbalance at three months especially in july and approximately 2 2 lower in some areas maybe that because the ground heat flux is underestimated in the exp balance as fig 2 mentioned the current modification makes sensible heat flux and latent heat flux overestimated which indicated that the ground heat flux is underestimated meanwhile numerical results imply that the turbulence transport of the underlying surface simulated by exp balance is enhanced which can accelerate the energy exchanges from the ground to the atmosphere so that the surface soil temperature decreases as shown in fig 9 the summer mean 2 m temperature of exp balance simulation is also lower than that of exp imbalance in different months with large areas of the summer mean 2 m temperature difference in june and the discrepancies in july and august are concentrated in eastern mongolia the above numerical analysis indicates that the energy transfer process from the soil to the near surface is weakened due to the decrease in the soil surface temperature thus reducing the 2 m temperature 4 3 large scale circulation fig 10 displays the summer mean geopotential height of exp imbalance simulation results at different pressure levels h850 and h500 respectively which shows that the h850 in the northeast region is about 1400 m in the northwest region is 1430 m and in the yangtze river basin is up to 1450 m the regions with low pressure are mostly concentrated in the northeast and the sichuan basin of china as shown in from fig 10 b the 500 hpa pressure in the north is significantly lower than that in the south over the east asian region the reason is mainly the advancement of the subtropical high leading to the transfer of warm and wet air over the sea to the land surface moreover the summer monsoon over the indian ocean reaches the central and eastern regions of china through the south china sea and then extends all the way from south to northeast of china at 850 hpa fig 11 a at 500 hpa the northern areas of the simulation domain are dominated by the westerly wind fig 11b the south asia high over the indian ocean extends to the tibetan plateau and the western pacific subtropical high also occurs fig 10b therefore the westerly wind over the south china sea turns southerly due to the simultaneous effects of both high pressures fig 11b overall the simulation results can substantially reflect the atmospheric circulation for the east asian summer monsoon the change in surface turbulent transport can directly influence the physical parameters of the atmosphere circulation the summer mean geopotential height and wind at 850 hpa between exp balance and exp imbalance simulations in every month of summer respectively over the east asian region are shown in fig 12 it is obvious that the exp balance results produce an anticyclonic circulation north of the model simulation domain and cyclonic circulation in the south the anticyclone and cyclone are all weak but have a wide range in june fig 12a in july their intensity is greater and yet the anticyclone is chiefly located in northern and northeastern china the cyclone spreads to the east china sea and the south china sea fig 12b in august the intensity of the anticyclonic and cyclonic air flows was still relatively enhances but the influence range of the anticyclone was reduced fig 12c by and large the summer monsoon from southwest to northeast china is weakened because of this stronger anticyclone in the north which retards the process of northward movement of the subtropical high so that the confluence of cold and warm airflow over the northeast region is decreased while the transfer of water vapor over the south region is relatively more intensive moreover the summer monsoon is enhanced from the indian ocean to the south china sea and from the south china sea to the south of china due to the cyclone south of the simulation domain which significantly improves the convergence of the water vapor of south of the yangtze river accordingly the interactions between the anticyclone and the cyclone facilitate moist transfer south of the yangtze river overall at 500 hpa the differences between the exp balance and exp imbalance simulations are primarily in the northern arid region particularly for the h500 and with greater intensity and influence ranges than that of 850 hpa fig 13 as can be seen from the simulations the summer mean geopotential height simulated by exp balance is lower than simulated by exp imbalance in three months over the southern area of the simulation domain the northward movement of the subtropical high is hindered as a consequence of the effects of the anticyclone over the arid region in june the anticyclone covers most areas of the arid region whereas the difference for the h500 is in northeast and eastern mongolia of china the monsoon from southwest to northeast simulated by exp balance is weakened while the monsoon from the indian ocean to the south china sea and from the south china sea to the south of the yangtze river is strengthened to some extent fig 13a in july the anticyclone in the northern region is significantly strengthened and the northeast monsoon and westerly are all obviously weakened fig 13b in august the h500 in the south and northeast regions decreases fig 13c indicating that the the northward movement of the subtropical high is further inhibited meanwhile the uv500 simulated by exp balance enhances the monsoon from the indian ocean to the south china sea and the water vapor transport from the south china sea to the southeast coast of china as a consequence the possibility of summer precipitation in south china is increased from the perspective of large scale circulation accordingly the progress of the summer rain belt is altered because the rise of the geopotential height over the arid region and the anticyclonic circulation weaken the movement of the subtropical high inland fig 14 displays the differences of summer mean geopotential height and atmosphere temperature simulations between two experiments in the 45 n vertical profile of three months respectively over the east asian region as shown in fig 14 the geopotential height simulated by exp balance is higher than that of exp imbalance in most areas especially in the areas between 700 hpa and 150 hpa at 200 hpa the differences in the annual mean geopotential height simulations between two experiments reach the maximum indicating that the variation in the underlying surface parameters has an impact on the upper atmosphere in june the differences in geopotential height simulated by the two experiments are great in the areas of 70 e 100 e fig 14a in july the discrepancy in geopotential height is mostly transferred to the areas of 100 e 120 e fig 14b in august the the differences in geopotential height remain in the areas of 70 e 100 e fig 14c at the same time regardless of july or august the atmospheric temperature simulations of exp balance experiment in the areas between 500 hpa and 200 hpa increase which demonstrates that the energy transfer from the surface to the atmosphere simulated by exp balance is enhanced and then diffuses to the upper and middle atmospheres the difference in summer mean zonal wind simulations between exp balance and exp imbalance experiments in the 110 e vertical profile at three months respectively over the east asian region are presented in fig 15 in terms of the exp balance experiment the summer mean zonal wind in the regions of 30 n 50 n tends to shift westward with the strongest trend in july in the regions of 0 n 15 n wind tends to shift eastward which increases gradually from june to august water vapor in the areas of 0 n 15 n is transported from the south china sea to the north in summer forming the summer monsoon in china rain belt migration can be affected by water vapor transportation shifting when the eastward migration of the wind trend is strengthened the exp balance experiment intensifies the easterly airflow in the areas of 50 n 60 n and then can affect the downwind zone fig 15 shows that the maximum difference in wind is in the areas between 200 hpa and 300 hpa in the vertical direction which implies that the change in surface turbulence transport plays a significant role in the upper and middle tropospheres fig 16 is the same as fig 15 but for summer mean meridional wind in the 45 n vertical profile in june the mean southerly wind simulated by the exp balance experiment is amplified in the areas of 100 e 120 e and the northerly wind is also strengthened in the areas of 130 e 140 e in most regions thus producing anticyclonic circulation fig 16a in july the mean southerly wind simulation of exp balance is reinforced in the regions from 100 e to 110 e and the northerly wind is strengthened in the areas from 120 e to 130 e likewise forming a stronger anticyclone fig 16b a stronger anticyclone is generated in august while the intensifying south and north winds simulated by exp balance are in the regions of 70 e 80 e and 100 e 130 e fig 16c respectively from june to august anticyclonic airflow gradually rises and the influence of the low level atmosphere gradually increases 5 conclusion and discussion the energy closure degree of the underlying surface in arid and semiarid areas is always a hot spot of the land surface process which is closely related to the heat and water transfer process in land atmosphere interactions and has substantial effects on the occurrence and development of convectional weather processes and regional climate change the atmospheric circulation in east asia changes indirectly because the energy closure degree in the arid and semiarid areas can have significant impacts on the near surface energy balance hence our study introduces two turbulent transport parameterization schemes with energy closure and unclosure into the regional climate model regcm4 5 referred to as exp balance and exp imbalance to investigate the influence of the surface energy closure degree over the arid and semiarid areas of china on the simulation of the east asian summer monsoon the results suggest that the surface soil temperature simulated by exp balance is lower than simulated by exp imbalance because the energy transferred from the underlying surface increases so that the energy retained in the underlying surface decreases in exp balance which weakens sensible heat transport and decreases the surface air temperature in the case of exp balance this is because the net radiation absorbed by the underlying surface for exp balance is in agreement with exp imbalance while the soil temperature simulated by exp balance is lower than that of exp imbalance compared with exp imbalance exp balance can contribute to an increase in atmospheric energy more excessive energy diffuses to different layers and more upward air flow begins to diverge with the anticyclonic circulation strengthened in the middle and upper tropospheres over arid and semiarid regions consequently the subtropical high moving to the northward is hindered the rain belt stays in south china for a long time and the precipitation in northeast china is reduced while it is enhanced in the south of the yangtze river in the case of exp balance on the whole the two comparison numerical experiments by using the ebc and ebu turbulence parameterization schemes in the arid and semiarid areas demonstrate that the energy closure degree can affect the physical properties of the underlying surface and then influence the summer climate evolution in east asia with the whole atmospheric disturbance and circulation altered indirectly by and large the energy closure degree of the underlying surface not only plays an important role in the land atmosphere interactions but also has apparent effects on the east asian summer monsoon many surface layer observations have shown that the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes is lower than the available energy when using the eddy covariance method it means the observed energy was unclosed the unclosed degree was usually 20 and even more in particular cases the regional and global climate models are developed based on the concept of energy balance between the atmosphere and land surface and the parameterization scheme of the boundary layer in the regional and global climate models are often developed from the observed turbulent heat fluxes thus energy closure degree is bound to affect the land surface models and further influence the regional and global climate models in this study the residual part of the energy from its imbalance is distributed into the turbulent heat flux through the bowen ratio so as to modify the direct measurement and make energy closed and the two turbulent boundary layer parameterization schemes are developed as energy closure and unclosure from the observed and modified turbulent heat fluxes with any physical and bio chemical properties of soil that are kept unchanged the model obviously overestimated soil temperature for taking using of the energy unclosure turbulent boundary layer parameterization schemes which implies that the energy closure degree plays a crucial role in developing the regional and global climate models this study provides confidence to deepen the matter exchange and energy transport of land atmosphere interactions and is of positive significance to improving land surface process parameterization schemes and models however the modified specific coefficients about the turbulent heat flux parameterizations from a single site may not be valid for other regions in the simulation with various land covers either the bowen ratio or the energy closure degree will change spatially and perhaps temporally at decadal scale due to land cover change and global climate change nevertheless there are many uncertainties of parameterization schemes in regcm4 5 such as various physical parameterization schemes so that the simulation results can be different at the same time the results with the same parameterization schemes but the simulation resolutions can also vary this study only chose one combination including a series of widely used parameterization schemes since the computing resources were limited much more work still need to be done more field observations should be collected to further develop and validate the turbulent flux parameterization schemes and some optimization methods such as artificial neural networks and satellite remote sensing information should be employed for selecting appropriate parameters in the atmospheric boundary layer credit authorship contribution statement sha lu conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology software validation

2387,arid and semiarid areas are extremely sensitive to climate change the atmospheric boundary layer in these areas acts as a major factor of matter exchange and energy transport for the land atmosphere interactions in this study two turbulent transfer parameterization schemes respectively with surface energy closure and unclosure based on the lanzhou university semi arid climate observatory and laboratory sacol station are coupled into a regional climate model regcm4 5 referred to as exp balance and exp imbalance to explore the effects of the surface energy closure degree on the east asian summer monsoon simulations the results show that the surface soil temperature simulated by exp balance is lower than that simulated by exp imbalance because energy transferred from the underlying surface increases so that the energy retained in the underlying surface decreases in exp balance which weakens sensible heat transport and decreases the surface air temperature in the case of exp balance this is because the net radiation absorbed by the underlying surface for exp balance is in agreement with exp imbalance while the soil temperature simulated by exp balance is lower than that of exp imbalance compared with exp imbalance exp balance can contribute to increasing the atmospheric energy and more upward air flow begins to diverge as the anticyclonic circulation strengthens in the middle and upper tropospheres over the arid and semiarid regions consequently the subtropical high moving to the northward is hindered the rain belt stays in the south china for a long time and the precipitation in northeast china is reduced but in the south of the yangtze river it is enhanced in the case of exp balance keywords arid and semiarid areas surface energy balance closure degree

2012 china has the largest population in the world while the arid and semiarid areas make up the majority of the land area in china and even in east asia and the globe piao et al 2010 huang et al 2019 with an increase of 33 during 1994 2008 arid and semiarid areas have increased rapidly in recent years in china huang et al 2019 some special land surface processes over the arid and semiarid areas not only influence regional atmospheric circulation and climate but also affect the monsoon circulation throughout east asia lu and zuo 2021 with the characteristics of low nutrition content low vegetation coverage and low water conservation capacity in the soil the arid and semiarid areas in china are pretty sensitive to local regional and even global climate changes ma and fu 2006 2007 fu and ma 2008 huang et al 2016a 2016b burns et al 2018 huang et al 2019 decharme et al 2019 danabasoglu et al 2020 because the ecological environment is extremely fragile these regions are also vulnerable to drought and degradation reed et al 2012 huang et al 2013 huang et al 2019 the arid and semiarid areas are rich in sunshine with intensive light and heat which are helpful for vegetation growth however high potential evaporation means that water is rapidly lost from the soil water shortage and low soil water content are the main suppressing factors for plant growth and ecological systems zhang and shangguan 2002 lu et al 2021 soil water content is almost reliant on received rainfall since precipitation is pretty low and unevenly distributed both spatially and temporally it is difficult to conserve the soil water content in arid and semiarid areas guan et al 2009 the intensity of regional climate change over the arid and semiarid areas can be significantly amplified by land atmosphere interactions therefore the land atmosphere interactions over arid and semiarid areas are identified as a hot research spot or challenging issue at present such interactions control the energy balance influence water and heat transfer between the land and the atmosphere and affect carbon cycle processes in the atmospheric boundary layer apparently the land atmosphere interactions over the arid and semiarid areas of china play an important role in climate change wu et al 2009 ghimire et al 2016 huang et al 2017a b fox et al 2018 lu and zuo 2018 kennedy et al 2019 seo et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the source sink of matter and energy for the atmospheric environment are in the atmospheric boundary layer the surface layer serves as a major region of the exchange of turbulent flux vapor and co2 between the land and the atmosphere their exchange properties exert non negligible impacts on atmospheric motion and surface environmental conditions and thus the study of these issues serves as the dominant aspect of land surface processes the law of energy conservation is the first thermodynamic law and a universal law therefore the exchanges of energy and matter in the land atmosphere interactions must follow the conservation law without exception however not until the late 1980s did many experiments show the energy balance to be unclosed with the energy balance closure ebc accounting for approximately 70 80 tsvang et al 1991 wilson et al 2002 li et al 2005 therefore searching for causes of energy balance unclosure ebu of observed energy is one of the important issues of exploring energy balance in their energy balance experiment oncley et al 2007 performed a detailed study of the ebc effect of the principal components of surface energy equilibrium arriving at the conclusion that the advection between the canopy top and flux measuring height is likely to have an impact on ebu panin et al 1998 indicated that the ebu bears a relation to a complicated underlying surface because a heterogeneous surface would generate an even larger time scale eddy than those measured by the eddy covariance method implying that the low frequency component of the turbulence spectra would affect the production of different ebc degree foken et al 2006 wilson et al 2002 proposed that the heat storage term is underestimated greatly for morning ebcs based on data over a range of china fluxnet points in addition the related causes are addressed in different aspects by foken et al 2006 and cava et al 2008 among others gentine et al 2012 and li and wang 2020 suggested that the correction based on the depth soil properties and soil water content on the ground heat flux can improve the degree of the surface ebc from eddy covariance system currently ebc is an exceedingly prominent problem in land atmosphere interactions studies causes of the ebu are not entirely understood and the explanations are imperfect so far many surface layer observations have shown that the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes was lower than the available energy when using the eddy covariance method it means the observed energy was unclosed the unclosed degree was usually 20 and even more in particular cases theoretically the available energy of the underlying surface is equal to the energy lost but there is a large deviation in the actual observations zuo et al 2010 in addition regional and global climate models are developed based on the energy balance between the atmosphere and the land surface and the parameterization scheme of the boundary layer in land surface models is often obtained from the similarity theory by using the observed turbulent heat fluxes thus the temperature pressure and so on are balanced and matched to achieve the numerical closure process xiao et al 2010 lawrence et al 2019 as a consequence the ebc degree is bound to affect local regional and even global climate simulations yang et al 2012 have illustrated that the near surface layer energy closure degree has important influences on land surface process simulations by the tblshaw two big leaf simultaneous heat and water model over arid and semiarid regions in this study we investigate the impacts of the ebc over arid and semiarid areas of china on the east asian regional climate this study is organized as follows in section 2 we briefly introduce the regcm regional climate model version 4 5 regcm4 5 energy balance closure unclosure turbulent transfer parameterization schemes and simulation experimental design in section 3 we analyze the simulated mean precipitation surface soil and 2 m temperatures as well as large scale circulations furthermore we explore the physical processes from the perspective of the energy closure degree that greatly affects the simulation performance of the east asian summer monsoon by regcm4 5 with different turbulent transfer parameterization schemes over the arid and semiarid areas in section 4 we summarize the main results and discussion 2 experiment station and data the lanzhou university semi arid climate observatory and laboratory sacol station 35 57 46 n 104 08 13 e elevation 1965 8 m is situated at the arid and semiarid areas of the loess plateau in china located about 48 km away from the downtown area of lanzhou city near the southern bank of the yellow river in gansu province huang et al 2008 guan et al 2009 wang et al 2010 the position of sacol station is shown in fig 1 a it is one of the reference sites of the international coordinated energy and water cycle observations project ceop the surface is mostly covered by short grass with protophyta fig 1b which is usually less than 15 cm tall and covers less than 80 of the surface in summer and autumn wang et al 2010 the land atmosphere interactions are intense in this period this study applies observations obtained by the sacol station of summer june july august from 2007 to 2009 the sacol station is located on a nearly north south mesa with a fetch length of about 120 m in the most common wind direction the mesa has a limited width of approximately 200 m from the east to the west and is about 600 m in length from the north to the south there is a large v shaped valley to the west of the site and a small valley one to the east the sacol site was established in 2005 and started continuous observations in may 2006 the site with its surroundings suffered little or no human activities so it can represent a primary regime of landform and vegetation in an arid and semiarid climate of the loess plateau huang et al 2008 xiao et al 2012 observational data from sacol are widely used now many studies have demonstrated that sacol observational data are of high quality and play a crucial role in investigating land atmosphere interactions and even predicting climate change over the arid and semiarid regions of the loess plateau in northwest china guan et al 2009 wang et al 2010 huang et al 2013 2016a 2017a b lu et al 2022 huang et al 2019 other specified information about the sacol station and instruments can be found in wang et al 2010 3 model and method 3 1 description of regcm4 5 regcm4 5 is one of the state of the art regional climate models developed by the abdus salam international centre for theoretical physics ictp in italy to simulate the local climate situation in the 1980s giorgi et al 2012 after decades of development the regcm4 5 has been updated to the fourth generation and widely used in geophysics qian et al 1999 myoung and seok 2015 regcm4 5 is one of the supplements to the low resolution global dynamic system models whose resolution can be up to 10 km compared with the global climate model regcm4 5 not only has the advantages of higher simulation resolution and faster calculation speed but also highlights research on typical regions liu and ding 2004 dan et al 2011 previous studies have demonstrated that regcm4 5 can well capture the long term climate characteristics precipitation distribution and atmospheric circulation caused by local and regional forcing in east asia jű and wang 2006 feng and fu 2007 gao et al 2012 2017 it is one of the main tools for the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change to assess climate change and forecast now tang et al 2004 liu et al 2006 3 2 development of turbulent transfer parameterization scheme 3 2 1 surface energy closure degree there are usually four methods to characterize the energy closure degree for the near surface energy balance wilson et al 2002 in this study we adopt the ordinary least squares ols method to explore the surface energy balance which can be expressed as the following equation yang et al 2012 1 le h a r n g 0 b where l 2 501 106 is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 h and e are the sensible heat flux w m 2 and water vapor flux kg m 2 s 1 respectively rn and g0 are the surface net radiation flux and ground heat flux respectively w m 2 a is the linear regression coefficient between the turbulent flux le h and the available energy flux r n g 0 which actually represents the surface energy closure degree and b is a constant standing for the offset of linear fitting for example when a 1 and b 0 the surface energy is completely closed for the soil heat flux the plates were set separately at a 5 cm and 10 cm depth underground with no device for direct measurement of ground heat flux the ground heat flux is an important component of surface energy balance to remove the effect of soil heat storage the analysis of surface energy balance and ebc features was performed not by directly utilizing the underground soil heat flux values but the ground heat flux there are a range of ground heat flux schemes fuchs 1987 and here briefly introduced is the method we used in this study that thermal diffusion equation and correction tdec approach yang and wang 2008 the expression for 1 d soil thermal diffusion equation is in the form 2 ρ s c s t t g z 3 g λ s t z where t is the time s z is the soil depth m t is the soil temperature k ρs is the soil density kg m 3 cs is the soil heat capacity j kg 1 k 1 λs is the soil thermal conductivity w k 1 m 1 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 after after integration we have 4 g z g z ref s t g z ref z ref z ρ s c s t z t d z in which g zref represents the soil heat flux in a given reference layer given the temperature profile t zi the discrete form of the integral expression is 5 g z t g z ref t 1 t z ref z ρ s c s z i t t t z i t t ρ s c s z i t t z i t z wherein ρscs z t cv z t 2 1 106 1 θsat 4 19 106 θ z t j m 3 k 1 with θsat denoting the soil porosity m3 m 3 and θ is the water content in a unit volume of soil m3 m 3 sellers et al 1996 the tdec approaches are described as follows the tdec scheme is utilized for gaining a reliable temperature profile to make accurate calculation of heat flux therefore yang and wang 2008 developed a new simple method to estimate soil heat flux from soil temperature and moisture observations thereby making a reliable temperature profile from limited observations by use of linear interpolation or cubic splines the discrete form of eq 2 about the new linear interpolation method can be represented by a tridiagonal system eqs 6a c for the 1st layer 6a t 1 t sfc for the ith layer 6b a i t i t t b i t i 1 t t c i t i 1 t t d i where a i 1 2 ρ s c s i z i 1 z

level respectively as the boundary conditions of the equation solving eqs 6a c led to a profile of soil temperature ttde there was deviation δt of the ttde from tobs the temperature δt correction procedure was as follows ① from δtk tk obs tk tde we had δtk where subscript k denoted the node k 6 in sacol station tk obs is the measurements and tk tde is the calculations from the soil thermal diffusion equation ② δtk at node k was linearly interpolated onto all other nodes i to have the difference δti ③ a final soil temperature profile was acquired from ti ti tde δti for each node if the bottom level was deep enough the heat flux with respect to the surface thermal condition was ignored that is we set g z ref 0 and in that case integration was performed using eq 5 from bottom to surface layer resulting in layered and ground heat flux cava et al 2008 indicate that the surface energy closure degree can be divided into the short term energy closure degree and global energy closure degree to quantitatively analyze the performance characteristics of surface energy non closure at different time scales the half hour average energy closure degree is defined as the short term energy closure degree and the average energy closure degree within a period of time is called the global energy closure degree fig 2 presents the hourly mean change of the short term energy closure degree in a day and summer mean global energy closure degree from 2007 to 2009 at the sacol station the short term energy closure degree in the daytime is higher than that at night in these areas with the highest energy closure degree of 0 79 and the lowest of 0 3 and the energy un closure is more significant fig 2a meanwhile the mean global energy closure degree in summer from 2007 to 2009 is approximately 0 79 and the energy is also not closed fig 2b this demonstrates that the measured turbulent flux le h is relatively smaller than the available energy flux r n g 0 based on the sacol observations by using the eddy correlation method in these regions 3 2 2 correction of turbulent flux according to the principle of near surface energy balance the residual energy caused by unclosed energy is distributed to the atmosphere based on the observed bowen ratio maayar et al 2008 therefore the corrected turbulent heat flux can be obtained to keep the bowen ratio unchanged which can be described as the following equations 7 β h l e 8 r es r n g 0 h l e 9 h c h β 1 β r es 10 l e c l e 1 1 β r es where β is the bowen ratio res is the residual energy flux w m 2 ec is the modified water vapor flux kg m 2 s 1 hc and lec are the modified sensible and latent heat flux respectively w m 2 fig 3 shows comparisons of the observed and modified turbulent fluxes it is obvious that the modified sensible heat flux is 14 higher than the observed sensible heat flux while the latent heat flux is 5 higher than the observed latent heat flux by using the sacol data it should be stated that the modified sensible heat flux sen and latent heat flux lat represent unrealistic condition near the value of 0 compared to the measured values 3 2 3 turbulent transfer parameterization scheme the near surface turbulent flux parameterization scheme adopts the bulk transfer coefficient method zuo and hu 1992 in accordance with gradient transport theory the turbulence flux can be expressed as follows 11 τ ρ c d u u s 2 12 h ρ c p c h u u s θ s θ 13 e ρ c e u u s q s q where τ is the momentum flux kg m 1 s 1 ρ is the air density kg m 3 cp 1 00464 103 is the specific heat capacity of air j kg 1 k 1 cd ch and ce are the bulk transfer coefficients of the momentum flux sensible heat flux and water vapor flux respectively u θ and q are the wind speed m s 1 potential temperature k and specific humidity kg kg 1 of air at the reference height respectively us θs and qs are the wind speed m s 1 potential temperature k and specific humidity kg kg 1 of the near surface respectively in general the near surface wind is treated as the motionless so that we assume us 0 hence the bulk transfer coefficient of the sensible heat flux and water vapor flux can be written as follows 14 c d τ ρ u 2 15 c h h ρ u θ s θ 16 c e e ρ u q s q in addition ch can be parameterized as a function based on the monin obukhove similarity theory zuo and hu 1992 dickinson et al 1993 this theory states that when scaled appropriately the dimensionless mean wind speed mean potential temperature and mean specific humidity profile gradients depend on unique functions of the atmosphere stability z l zeng et al 1998 as 17

gradients u θ and q are the wind speed friction velocity m s 1 temperature k and moisture kg kg 1 scales respectively φm z l φh z l and φw z l are the universal similarity functions respectively and k 0 4 is the von karman constant the flux has nothing to do with the height in the near surface thus the differential eqs 11 13 can be integrated formally as follows 20 u u k ln z z 0 m ψ m z l 21 θ θ s θ k ln z z 0 h ψ h z l 22 q q s q k ln z z 0 w ψ w z l where z0m and z0h are the surface aerodynamic and thermodynamic roughness lengths m respectively z0w is the roughness length m for water vapor in general z0m is a constant for the fixed regions in a period of time which is equal to 1 7 10 1 m in this study and z0h z0w z0m exp α u z0m v 0 45 zeng and dickinson 1998 the quantity is the roughness reynolds number re with the kinematic viscosity of air v 1 5 10 5m2 s 1 and α 0 13 the modified universal similarity functions ψm z l ψh z l and ψw z l are separately defined as 23 ψ m z l z 0 m z 1 ϕ m z l z d z 24 ψ h z l z 0 h z 1 ϕ h z l z d z 25 ψ w z l z 0 w z 1 ϕ w z l z d z meanwhile the momentum flux sensible heat flux and water vapor flux scales can be described as 26 τ ρ u 2 27 h ρ c p u θ 28 e ρ c p u q then we plug eqs 17 28 into the eqs 11 13 which can be estimated as 29 c d k 2 ln z z 0 m ψ m z l 2 c dn 1 ψ m z l ln z z 0 m 2 30 c h k 2 ln z z 0 m ψ m z l ln z z 0 h ψ h z l c hn 1

stability z l is difficult to evaluate in land surface process parameterizations the rib is defined as 36 r ib g z θ θ s t u 2 where g is the acceleration of gravity m s 1 and t is the absolute mean temperature between the surface and the reference height k the bulk transfer coefficients can be expressed as functions 37 and 38 with the roughness lengths and bulk richardson number rib as long as the heights are known 37 c d c d r ib c dn 38 c h c e c h r ib c hn c e r ib c en in this study the bulk transfer coefficient and bulk richardson number can be estimated by using the observed and

bulk transfer coefficient on neutral condition c h is the modified bulk transfer coefficient of the sensible heat flux and c hn is the modified bulk transfer coefficient under neutral condition fig 4 displays the relationship between the observed ch and modified c h bulk transfer coefficient of the sensible heat flux with the bulk richardson number rib at sacol site on unstable and stable condition respectively it is noteworthy that there is c hn 1 29chn on neutral condition by fitting the observational data 3 3 simulation experiment design the simulation experiments cover 26 years from 1986 to 2011 over the east asian region the model integration starts on april 1st and ends on september 1st of the same year approximately covering the whole summer the first two months april may of the same year are taken as the spin up period and three month simulations june july august are used for analysis in east asia the spatial resolution is set to 10 km the domain of the model is centered at 32 n and 98 e covering the whole east asian monsoon area with 7800 km west east 7200 km south north there are 18 levels in the vertical direction from the surface to 10 hpa which is widely used since it is suitable for long term climate simulations the national centers for environmental prediction department of energy ncep doe atmospheric model inter comparison project amip ii reanalysis reanalysis 2 nnrp2 data derived from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa are ingested by the regcm4 5 model with a resolution of 0 1 latitude by 0 1 longitude and at 6

temperature pressure geopotential height precipitation specific humidity soil temperature soil moisture evapotranspiration surface runoff snow water equivalent sensible heat flux longwave and shortwave radiation flux cloud fraction solar heating rate etc the model lateral boundary adopts the exponential relaxation method with 12 grid points in the buffer zone important physics options include the regcm4 5 national center for atmospheric research ncar community climate model ccm3 0 spectral band shortwave and longwave radiation schemes kiehl et al 1996 the biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme bats dickinson et al 1993 2006 the holtslag planetary boundary layer scheme holtslag et al 1990 and the grell convective parameterization scheme grell 1993 grell et al 1994 in regcm4 5 the vegetation and soil parameters of each grid cell are derived from the fractional coverage of soil texture types and land use categories which are both adopted by the different dynamic processes of the sensible and latent heat transport however the above mentioned unclosure and closure turbulent transfer parameterization schemes are suitable for desert sparse grassland and bare soil underlying surfaces because the sacol station is only typical and significant to represent the land atmosphere interactions over the arid and semi arid regions in northwest china zuo and hu 1992 wang et al 2010 zuo et al 2010 xiao et al 2010 yang et al 2012 thus it is suitable to couple the newly built ebc and ebu parameterization schemes into the calculations of soil parameters rather than the calculations of vegetation parameters in the model grid unit in summer the vegetation of the underlying surface was gradually dense with the time goes by which can affect the energy balance simulation process of the soil underlying surface fig 5 presents the default and the modified land cover vegetation classes over the model simulation domain the underlying surface of the arid regions are all set as the desert no vegetation cover in this study fig 5b to investigate the impacts of the energy closure degree over arid and semiarid areas of china on the east asian regional climate respectively under closed and non closed conditions consequently two simulation experiments have been conducted one experiment with the unclosed turbulent transfer parameterization scheme hereafter refer to as exp imbalance considered which can be simply described as eqs 39 12 and 13 the other experiment with the closed turbulent transfer parameterization scheme hereafter refer to as exp balance considered which can be simply described as eqs 40 12 and 13 under these circumstances all the physics process parametrization schemes except for the turbulent transfer parameterization scheme are identical in the two experiments therefore different parameterizations of turbulent transfer are the only factors contributing to differences between these simulations 4 results 4 1 precipitation precipitation is one of the most important components of the water cycle and its changes can substantially affect sustainable economic and societal developments gillett et al 2004 peng et al 2018 fig 6 presents the summer total precipitation for the simulation period 1986 2011 over china which shows that the spatial distribution of total precipitation is in closer agreement with each other between the two experiments the intensity of overall rainfall is in a state of regional gradient the precipitation in the arid area of northwest china is scarce the middle east is increasing and the south is the largest as shown in fig 6 c the difference in summer total precipitation between the exp imbalance and exp balance simulations is mostly concentrated in monsoon areas such as the northeast east and south china the difference of summer accumulated precipitation between the two experiments is not obvious in the arid and arid regions of northwest china since precipitation is scarce throughout year however the precipitation simulated by exp balance is smaller than simulated by exp imbalance in northeast china while the opposite is true in east and south china the spatial patterns of precipitation in every month vary in the same region because of the influence of the rain belt fig 7 shows the difference of summer mean precipitation between the exp balance and exp imbalance simulations exp balance minus exp imbalance in june july and august in general the rain belt gradually moves northward from the coastal areas of the south china to the yangtze river basin in july therefore the effects of the simulated results on precipitation are mainly concentrated in south china and the yangtze huaihe river basin meanwhile the simulated precipitation of exp balance is greater than that of exp imbalance in june over south china fig 7a fig 7 b demonstrates that the rain belt moves northward continuously to reach the yellow river basin and then reaches north and northeast china at the end of this month however the yangtze huaihe river basin is controlled by the subtropical high it is apparent that the summer mean precipitation simulated by exp balance is smaller than simulated by exp imbalance in july over the yangtze huaihe river basin especially over the northeast china fig 7b which indicates that the closed turbulent transfer parameterization scheme promotes the control of subtropical high pressure in the yangtze huaihe river basin and restrains the process of the rain belt migration to the northeast as shown in fig 7 c the rain belt is relatively stable and the simulated summer mean precipitation of exp balance is smaller than that of exp imbalance in august over the yangtze huaihe river basin and is mainly controlled by the subtropical high in short numerical simulations reveal that the closed turbulent transfer parameterization scheme can facilitate rainfall and weaken the subtropical high of the yangtze river basin of china 4 2 temperature the differences of the simulated summer mean surface soil temperature between exp balance and exp imbalance in june july and august respectively over the east asian region are given in fig 8 it is clear that the summer mean surface soil temperature simulated by exp balance is obviously lower than that of exp imbalance at three months especially in july and approximately 2 2 lower in some areas maybe that because the ground heat flux is underestimated in the exp balance as fig 2 mentioned the current modification makes sensible heat flux and latent heat flux overestimated which indicated that the ground heat flux is underestimated meanwhile numerical results imply that the turbulence transport of the underlying surface simulated by exp balance is enhanced which can accelerate the energy exchanges from the ground to the atmosphere so that the surface soil temperature decreases as shown in fig 9 the summer mean 2 m temperature of exp balance simulation is also lower than that of exp imbalance in different months with large areas of the summer mean 2 m temperature difference in june and the discrepancies in july and august are concentrated in eastern mongolia the above numerical analysis indicates that the energy transfer process from the soil to the near surface is weakened due to the decrease in the soil surface temperature thus reducing the 2 m temperature 4 3 large scale circulation fig 10 displays the summer mean geopotential height of exp imbalance simulation results at different pressure levels h850 and h500 respectively which shows that the h850 in the northeast region is about 1400 m in the northwest region is 1430 m and in the yangtze river basin is up to 1450 m the regions with low pressure are mostly concentrated in the northeast and the sichuan basin of china as shown in from fig 10 b the 500 hpa pressure in the north is significantly lower than that in the south over the east asian region the reason is mainly the advancement of the subtropical high leading to the transfer of warm and wet air over the sea to the land surface moreover the summer monsoon over the indian ocean reaches the central and eastern regions of china through the south china sea and then extends all the way from south to northeast of china at 850 hpa fig 11 a at 500 hpa the northern areas of the simulation domain are dominated by the westerly wind fig 11b the south asia high over the indian ocean extends to the tibetan plateau and the western pacific subtropical high also occurs fig 10b therefore the westerly wind over the south china sea turns southerly due to the simultaneous effects of both high pressures fig 11b overall the simulation results can substantially reflect the atmospheric circulation for the east asian summer monsoon the change in surface turbulent transport can directly influence the physical parameters of the atmosphere circulation the summer mean geopotential height and wind at 850 hpa between exp balance and exp imbalance simulations in every month of summer respectively over the east asian region are shown in fig 12 it is obvious that the exp balance results produce an anticyclonic circulation north of the model simulation domain and cyclonic circulation in the south the anticyclone and cyclone are all weak but have a wide range in june fig 12a in july their intensity is greater and yet the anticyclone is chiefly located in northern and northeastern china the cyclone spreads to the east china sea and the south china sea fig 12b in august the intensity of the anticyclonic and cyclonic air flows was still relatively enhances but the influence range of the anticyclone was reduced fig 12c by and large the summer monsoon from southwest to northeast china is weakened because of this stronger anticyclone in the north which retards the process of northward movement of the subtropical high so that the confluence of cold and warm airflow over the northeast region is decreased while the transfer of water vapor over the south region is relatively more intensive moreover the summer monsoon is enhanced from the indian ocean to the south china sea and from the south china sea to the south of china due to the cyclone south of the simulation domain which significantly improves the convergence of the water vapor of south of the yangtze river accordingly the interactions between the anticyclone and the cyclone facilitate moist transfer south of the yangtze river overall at 500 hpa the differences between the exp balance and exp imbalance simulations are primarily in the northern arid region particularly for the h500 and with greater intensity and influence ranges than that of 850 hpa fig 13 as can be seen from the simulations the summer mean geopotential height simulated by exp balance is lower than simulated by exp imbalance in three months over the southern area of the simulation domain the northward movement of the subtropical high is hindered as a consequence of the effects of the anticyclone over the arid region in june the anticyclone covers most areas of the arid region whereas the difference for the h500 is in northeast and eastern mongolia of china the monsoon from southwest to northeast simulated by exp balance is weakened while the monsoon from the indian ocean to the south china sea and from the south china sea to the south of the yangtze river is strengthened to some extent fig 13a in july the anticyclone in the northern region is significantly strengthened and the northeast monsoon and westerly are all obviously weakened fig 13b in august the h500 in the south and northeast regions decreases fig 13c indicating that the the northward movement of the subtropical high is further inhibited meanwhile the uv500 simulated by exp balance enhances the monsoon from the indian ocean to the south china sea and the water vapor transport from the south china sea to the southeast coast of china as a consequence the possibility of summer precipitation in south china is increased from the perspective of large scale circulation accordingly the progress of the summer rain belt is altered because the rise of the geopotential height over the arid region and the anticyclonic circulation weaken the movement of the subtropical high inland fig 14 displays the differences of summer mean geopotential height and atmosphere temperature simulations between two experiments in the 45 n vertical profile of three months respectively over the east asian region as shown in fig 14 the geopotential height simulated by exp balance is higher than that of exp imbalance in most areas especially in the areas between 700 hpa and 150 hpa at 200 hpa the differences in the annual mean geopotential height simulations between two experiments reach the maximum indicating that the variation in the underlying surface parameters has an impact on the upper atmosphere in june the differences in geopotential height simulated by the two experiments are great in the areas of 70 e 100 e fig 14a in july the discrepancy in geopotential height is mostly transferred to the areas of 100 e 120 e fig 14b in august the the differences in geopotential height remain in the areas of 70 e 100 e fig 14c at the same time regardless of july or august the atmospheric temperature simulations of exp balance experiment in the areas between 500 hpa and 200 hpa increase which demonstrates that the energy transfer from the surface to the atmosphere simulated by exp balance is enhanced and then diffuses to the upper and middle atmospheres the difference in summer mean zonal wind simulations between exp balance and exp imbalance experiments in the 110 e vertical profile at three months respectively over the east asian region are presented in fig 15 in terms of the exp balance experiment the summer mean zonal wind in the regions of 30 n 50 n tends to shift westward with the strongest trend in july in the regions of 0 n 15 n wind tends to shift eastward which increases gradually from june to august water vapor in the areas of 0 n 15 n is transported from the south china sea to the north in summer forming the summer monsoon in china rain belt migration can be affected by water vapor transportation shifting when the eastward migration of the wind trend is strengthened the exp balance experiment intensifies the easterly airflow in the areas of 50 n 60 n and then can affect the downwind zone fig 15 shows that the maximum difference in wind is in the areas between 200 hpa and 300 hpa in the vertical direction which implies that the change in surface turbulence transport plays a significant role in the upper and middle tropospheres fig 16 is the same as fig 15 but for summer mean meridional wind in the 45 n vertical profile in june the mean southerly wind simulated by the exp balance experiment is amplified in the areas of 100 e 120 e and the northerly wind is also strengthened in the areas of 130 e 140 e in most regions thus producing anticyclonic circulation fig 16a in july the mean southerly wind simulation of exp balance is reinforced in the regions from 100 e to 110 e and the northerly wind is strengthened in the areas from 120 e to 130 e likewise forming a stronger anticyclone fig 16b a stronger anticyclone is generated in august while the intensifying south and north winds simulated by exp balance are in the regions of 70 e 80 e and 100 e 130 e fig 16c respectively from june to august anticyclonic airflow gradually rises and the influence of the low level atmosphere gradually increases 5 conclusion and discussion the energy closure degree of the underlying surface in arid and semiarid areas is always a hot spot of the land surface process which is closely related to the heat and water transfer process in land atmosphere interactions and has substantial effects on the occurrence and development of convectional weather processes and regional climate change the atmospheric circulation in east asia changes indirectly because the energy closure degree in the arid and semiarid areas can have significant impacts on the near surface energy balance hence our study introduces two turbulent transport parameterization schemes with energy closure and unclosure into the regional climate model regcm4 5 referred to as exp balance and exp imbalance to investigate the influence of the surface energy closure degree over the arid and semiarid areas of china on the simulation of the east asian summer monsoon the results suggest that the surface soil temperature simulated by exp balance is lower than simulated by exp imbalance because the energy transferred from the underlying surface increases so that the energy retained in the underlying surface decreases in exp balance which weakens sensible heat transport and decreases the surface air temperature in the case of exp balance this is because the net radiation absorbed by the underlying surface for exp balance is in agreement with exp imbalance while the soil temperature simulated by exp balance is lower than that of exp imbalance compared with exp imbalance exp balance can contribute to an increase in atmospheric energy more excessive energy diffuses to different layers and more upward air flow begins to diverge with the anticyclonic circulation strengthened in the middle and upper tropospheres over arid and semiarid regions consequently the subtropical high moving to the northward is hindered the rain belt stays in south china for a long time and the precipitation in northeast china is reduced while it is enhanced in the south of the yangtze river in the case of exp balance on the whole the two comparison numerical experiments by using the ebc and ebu turbulence parameterization schemes in the arid and semiarid areas demonstrate that the energy closure degree can affect the physical properties of the underlying surface and then influence the summer climate evolution in east asia with the whole atmospheric disturbance and circulation altered indirectly by and large the energy closure degree of the underlying surface not only plays an important role in the land atmosphere interactions but also has apparent effects on the east asian summer monsoon many surface layer observations have shown that the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes is lower than the available energy when using the eddy covariance method it means the observed energy was unclosed the unclosed degree was usually 20 and even more in particular cases the regional and global climate models are developed based on the concept of energy balance between the atmosphere and land surface and the parameterization scheme of the boundary layer in the regional and global climate models are often developed from the observed turbulent heat fluxes thus energy closure degree is bound to affect the land surface models and further influence the regional and global climate models in this study the residual part of the energy from its imbalance is distributed into the turbulent heat flux through the bowen ratio so as to modify the direct measurement and make energy closed and the two turbulent boundary layer parameterization schemes are developed as energy closure and unclosure from the observed and modified turbulent heat fluxes with any physical and bio chemical properties of soil that are kept unchanged the model obviously overestimated soil temperature for taking using of the energy unclosure turbulent boundary layer parameterization schemes which implies that the energy closure degree plays a crucial role in developing the regional and global climate models this study provides confidence to deepen the matter exchange and energy transport of land atmosphere interactions and is of positive significance to improving land surface process parameterization schemes and models however the modified specific coefficients about the turbulent heat flux parameterizations from a single site may not be valid for other regions in the simulation with various land covers either the bowen ratio or the energy closure degree will change spatially and perhaps temporally at decadal scale due to land cover change and global climate change nevertheless there are many uncertainties of parameterization schemes in regcm4 5 such as various physical parameterization schemes so that the simulation results can be different at the same time the results with the same parameterization schemes but the simulation resolutions can also vary this study only chose one combination including a series of widely used parameterization schemes since the computing resources were limited much more work still need to be done more field observations should be collected to further develop and validate the turbulent flux parameterization schemes and some optimization methods such as artificial neural networks and satellite remote sensing information should be employed for selecting appropriate parameters in the atmospheric boundary layer credit authorship contribution statement sha lu conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology software validation

2388,in this study the water intake module and the confluence module were added to the community land model version 4 5 clm 4 5 forming the community land model dualistic water cycle clm dwc model land surface hydrological model it solved the problem that the influence of human activities was not considered in the existing hydrological coupling simulation process which so as to the inaccuracy of the simulation process the clm dwc model was driven by the average results of five global climate models gcms ensemble to form the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model to predict the

the three gorges reservoir area coupled model prediction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors the global climate is constantly changing and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent worldwide ning et al 2019 these have direct or indirect impacts on agricultural production energy production forest vegetation urban construction water resources and the environment liu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 water resources are one of the resources most affected by climate change which is closely related to the frequent occurrence of extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods climate change leads to spatial and temporal variation of water cycle factors such as evaporation and precipitation in the hydrological system and the extremes of these factors resulting in spatial and temporal redistribution of water resources wang et al 2019 therefore it is important to study the impact of climate change on water resources for the safe and effective management and development of measures to cope with climate changes future climate changes are unpredictable and scenarios that meet scientific assumptions are needed to describe future climate change conditions representative climate scenarios rcps were provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc rcps represented alternate path of carbon dioxide emissions as well as the resulting atmospheric concentration in the 21st century and were commonly used as input parameters for climate change prediction models under the influence of human activities moss et al 2010 rcps include a high emission scenario 8 5 w m 2 rcp8 5 two medium emission scenarios 4 5 w m 2 rcp4 5 and 6 0 w m 2 rcp6 0 and a low emission scenario 2 6 w m 2 rcp2 6 different rcps reflect different socio economic and technological development scenarios at present the main method to study the impact of future climate change on water resources is to use hydrological models driven by meteorological data to simulate and analyze the trends of water resources under future climate change global climate model gcm prediction results such as precipitation temperature etc were selected as meteorological data under scenarios with specific greenhouse gas emissions or radiative forcing trajectories lu et al 2018 schnorbus and cannon 2014 liu and mizzi 2020 used the swat deep ifso model to assess the impact of land use and climate change on runoff generation and water resources under different scenarios the results showed that the average annual runoff could be expected to show an increasing trend and that the region might experience periods of severe floods and droughts leading to a reduction of water resources based on the land use scenario in the study area ghumman et al 2020 used precipitation and air temperature results from three gcms to drive the hec hms hydrological model to simulate surface runoff the results indicated that surface runoff in the study area astore had increased by 2070 and could be expected to decline in the distant future li et al 2022 adopted daily precipitation data from the bcc csm2 mr model to drive the hec hms hydrological model to predict the response of runoff to future climate change in a typical watershed of changbai mountains the results revealed that the basin outflow would increase in the next 30 years during the rainy season june september but it could be lower than historical measured values the future flow peak would occur mostly in august and september surface water is divided into dynamic water and static water dynamic water generally refers to river runoff which is the main water source for human development and utilization static water such as lakes and reservoirs are water bodies that store and regulate runoff and renew slowly many scholars usually use river runoff to express surface water resources whereas neglect static surface water body such as lakes and reservoirs groundwater is also an important part of water resources and is one of the important water sources for agricultural irrigation industry mining and urbanism the community land model clm is the land component of the community earth system model cesm it mainly adopted in the land atmosphere interactions or the water balance studies at continental to global scales it is also used in hydrological simulations e g runoff the clm has been upgraded from version 2 to version 5 and its simulation accuracy of runoff evapotranspiration as well as total water storage continues to improve lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2013 lawrence et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 used clm4 5 driven by the atmospheric forcing dataset cruncep to simulate the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil moisture across the tibetan plateau from 1981 to 2016 the results showed that clm4 5 could well reproduce the spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture in the tibetan plateau liu et al 2016 evaluated the performance of clm4 5 to simulate the hydrologic fluxes wang et al 2019 used clm4 5 to simulate and analyze the spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration between 1993 and 2013 liu et al 2017 demonstrated that clm4 5 was superior colm2005 and colm2014 in runoff simulating however clm4 5 still has major shortcomings in the production confluence mechanism compared with distributed hydrological models furthermore the influence of human activities such as artificial water withdrawal and reservoir storage on hydrological processes is not considered the three gorges project is the world s largest hydraulic project and the hydropower project with the most comprehensive benefits it is a strategic reservoir of freshwater resources in china and an important ecological barrier in the yangtze river basin yrb but it is also one of the main ecologically vulnerable areas in the yrb since the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir area tgra in 2003 the water level has increased significantly and the expansion of the underlying waters has caused changes of the local climate in the tgra it causes the spatial and temporal redistribution of water resources and has a direct impact on precipitation evaporation runoff etc cui et al 2021 li et al 2021 ma et al 2018 in recent years many scholars have carried out studies on the impact of climate change on water resources in the tgra indicating that climate elements are closely related to runoff changes qin et al 2020 yan et al 2021 with the aggravation of global warming the water cycle in the tgra intensifies making it necessary to study future climate change trends on the overall water resources in the tgra in this study the effects of climate change and human activities were considered comprehensively and the water intake module and the confluence module were added to the clm4 5 land surface model then the community land model dualistic water cycle clm dwc model land surface hydrological model was formed the coupled model clm dwc was driven by the averaging values of five gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m ensemble which further formed the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model the spatial and temporal variation trends of runoff surface water and groundwater in the tgra from 2021 to 2050 under future scenarios were predicted 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the tgra is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river 28 56 n 31 44 n 106 16 e 111 28 e and its terrain is mainly composed of mountains hills and plains area controlled by river basin is about 58000 km2 and the basin water system consists of the main stream and 21 first level tributaries of the yrb of which the total length of the main stream of the yrb in the reservoir section is 660 km the tgra belongs to subtropical monsoon climate influenced by the east asian monsoon south asian monsoon and the topography of tibetan plateau the climate and hydrological characteristics have obvious seasonal changes qin et al 2020 affected by the entire basin the tgra has high evaporation resulting in more precipitation and significantly more and longer duration of autumn rains the average annual precipitation is about 1125 3 mm of which the precipitation from may to september in the flood season accounts for about 80 of the annual precipitation leading to multiple rainstorms and floods the average annual air temperature in the reservoir area is about 16 8 the annual runoff is approximately 400 billion m3 and the proportion of precipitation and runoff in the dry season is relatively small the main meteorological elements in the reservoir area are shown in table 1 the study divided the tgra into the reservoir head reservoir belly and reservoir tail according to the county boundaries of the tgra the specific distribution is shown in fig 1 2 2 data this study includes hydrological data and meteorological data the clm dwc model was calibrated and validated using the observed monthly runoff data of pingshan zhutuo and cuntan hydrological stations from 1971 to 2001 the surface water and groundwater data in the water resources bulletin of yangtze river basin and southwest rivers and runoff data in the hydrological yearbook of yangtze river basin were interpolated into the clm dwc model using the bilinear method and the results were used as a baseline period to predict future trend of water resources in the tgra meteorological data includes future forecast data and historical observation data the future projection data was provided by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip for the five ipcc fifth climate change assessment global climate models gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m output which was interpolated using the bilinear method and revised based on statistical deviations of the probability distribution detailed attribute information for the study using climate model scenario data is shown in table 2 to verify the accuracy of future climate change data the cn05 1 meteorological observation dataset developed by the china meteorological administration cma was used as observation data for comparison in order to meet the needs of high resolution climate model validation observation data from 2416 meteorological stations of the cma are interpolated using the distance level approximation method to form a gridded observation dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 wu and gao 2013 the observation period is 1961 2015 and the observation elements include precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity this dataset has high accuracy and is now widely used in the validation of various climate models shi et al 2018 observation data from 1961 to 2000 were used as comparative observation data for the five climate model simulations since the spatial resolution of the observation data and the climate model simulation data do not agree the observation data were interpolated to a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 in conducting the study to facilitate direct comparison between the two 2 3 description of clm dwc model simulation of regional climate land hydrology can assess the impact of climate change and human activities on water resources security and maintain sustainable economic development ning et al 2019 in atmospheric hydrological simulations the land surface model is the common interface between hydrological and atmospheric processes therefore accurate simulation of large scale terrestrial water is essential for studying atmospheric processes and climate change the clm series of the land surface models developed by national center for atmospheric research ncar adopts a multi level sub grid scheme of grid land unit soil column vegetation functional type to reflect the spatial differences within the grid units which has a better simulation effect in terms of soil moisture and energy flux oleson et al 2013 at the same time clm is the land surface sub model of the cesm which can be well coupled with other sub models such as the atmospheric model so it has become the most widely used land surface model at present the latest version of clm series land surface model is clm 5 0 compared with clm 4 5 clm 5 0 has not changed much in water balance study and hydrological simulation in addition clm 5 0 has only been simulated offline and the coupling with other modules under different computing platforms and resolutions has not been rigorously verified by scientific climate considering the stability of the model this study still uses clm4 5 as the basis for land surface hydrological simulation and model coupling the clm4 5 model uses a grid as the basic computational unit for simulation calculation and the model is expressed as a three layer nested sub grid hierarchy the model divides each grid into several land units each land unit may have several soil columns and each soil column may have several vegetation types the model divides each grid into several land units and there may be several soil columns in each land unit and there may be several vegetation types in each soil column the first layer is land units including vegetation lakes glaciers cities and crops the purpose of setting this layer is mainly to reflect the spatial inhomogeneity within the grid the second layer is the soil column which defines the state variables and fluxes of water and energy in soil and snow the soil column can be divided into a maximum of 15 layers including the fixed 10 layers of soil layer and up to 5 layers of snow layer with the division of the snow layer depends on the snow depth the third layer is the vegetation functional type mainly to reflect the differences of biogeophysical and biogeochemical characteristics between different vegetation functional types a total of 16 vegetation functional types including bare soil are classified in this layer and all fluxes in and out of the surface and vegetation state variables are also defined the clm4 5 model is the land surface component model of the cesm 1 2 0 and its operation depends on the overall framework of the cesm in the framework of the cesm in addition to the land surface model there is the coupler and component models such as the confluence model and the atmospheric model in this study the water intake module and the confluence module were added which ran in parallel with the land surface process model and updated the operational data in real time to realize the land surface hydrological coupling land surface process model for calculating each elemental process layer by layer based on the atmospheric forcing data to obtain the yield flow data of the soil hydrological process the water intake module for determining the water intake scheme based on the received yield flow data and updating the yield flow data for transmission to the confluence module and returning the updated yield flow data to the land surface process model through the coupler for the remaining land surface process calculation the confluence module for determining the confluence scheme based on the updated yield flow data the coupler was the link between the component models which can transfer the model input and output data among the component models and also perform scale conversion to control the operation of the whole earth system model the specific operation process is referred to wang et al 2020 since the coupled model has the characteristics of both land surface model and binary water cycle model it was named community land model dualistic water cycle clm dwc model this system and method can solve the problem that the influence of human activities was not taken into account in the existing hydrological coupling simulation process and reduced the uncertainty of the simulation process the problem of accurately reflecting the actual variation law and characteristics of each element of land surface moisture the influence of uncertainty in hydrological prediction has become increasingly prominent and scholars have carried out relevant research fan et al 2022a fan et al 2022b considering that the clm dwc model is influenced by the topography climatic conditions upstream and downstream hydrological connections and other factors around the tgra in order to reduce the uncertainty caused by the scope boundary the whole yrb was taken as the research scope for modeling the parameters required for model confluence include calculating the upstream cumulative confluence area of the grid manning s roughness coefficient as well as the slope width depth and length of the channel etc among them the upstream cumulative confluence area was calculated using the multi flow direction method and other channel parameters were estimated by referring to relevant empirical equations getirana et al 2012 quinn et al 2010 wu et al 2012 2 4 climate model climate model is the main uncertainty when evaluating the impact of climate change on hydrological process followed by greenhouse gas emission scenarios and the uncertainty of hydrological model is relatively small carvajal et al 2017 chen et al 2017 su et al 2017 the working group on coupled modelling wgcm of the world climate research programme wcrp released dozens of climate model scenario data https cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 in this study gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m were selected to simulate the precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity in the tgra in order to eliminate the uncertainty between the simulation results of different climate models as much as possible the averaging values of multi model ensemble avme were used as the atmospheric driving for the subsequent clm dwc model land surface hydrology simulations bayesian model averaging method bma is a statistical method used for multi model ensemble forecasting which uses a bayesian formulation to obtain the posterior distribution of a given mode by combining the prior distribution of each mode sequence with a likelihood function so as to obtain its weights and then the avme is obtained by weighted averaging raftery et al 2005 assuming that q is the element of the model simulation f f 1 f 2 f 3 f t is the set of t model simulations and a is the measured element the bayesian probability forecast can be expressed as follows 1 p q a i 1 t p f i a p i q f i a where i is the model sequence t is the number of models p f i a is the posterior probability of the ith model simulation element fi when the measured element is a namely the bayesian weight which indicates the degree of matching between the model simulation values and the actual observation values the larger the weight the closer the sv of the model is to the measured value p i q f i a is the posterior distribution of the measured elements a and the svs q when the model simulation is fi assuming that the simulated and measured values of each model obey a normal distribution the bayesian mean can be obtained by a weighted average of the svs of each model as follows 2 e q a i 1 t p f i a e g q f i σ i 2 i 1 t w i f i where e is the bayesian average g is a normal distribution with mean f and variance σ 2 w is the weight expectation maximization algorithm em was used to estimate bayesian weight this method assumes that each model sequence obeys normal distribution and calculates the probability distribution parameters of the simulated variables by introducing latent variables the algorithm mainly performs cyclic calculation through two steps the first is to calculate the expected value in this step the latent variable is the hypothetical estimated value of the bayesian model s average distribution parameters the expected value is then maximized which the average distribution parameters of bayesian model are the current estimate of the latent variable these two steps are alternately iterative until the preset computational accuracy threshold is met with θ w i σ i 2 i 1 2 3

calculation steps are as follows 1 initialize the parameters first let the number of iterations is zero iter 0 then the weights and variances can be expressed as follows 4 w i 0 1 t 5 σ i 2 0 i 1 t t

simulation effect of each model on each element in the whole reservoir area and taylor diagram was used to evaluate the performance of each climate model on the spatial climate distribution the box plot can reflect the center position and distribution range of a set or multiple sets of continuous quantitative data distribution benjamini 1988 taylor diagram is a visual graph proposed by taylor for examining simulation performance of the model it can compare the normalized standard deviation nsd correlation coefficient root mean square error etc between one or more model datasets and one or more reference datasets which can reflect the comprehensive performance of the prediction model and is widely used in the field of climate and meteorology the specific calculation process can be referred to taylor et al taylor 2001 2 5 scenario setting for future water resources change trend the clm dwc model was driven by the averaging results of five gcms ensemble to form the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model among four future scenarios rcp8 5 causes the largest temperature increase high emission scenario followed by rcp6 0 as well as rcp4 5 medium emission scenarios and rcp2 6 has the lowest effect on global warming low emission scenario since both rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 are climate scenarios under government intervention rcp4 5 is used in this study to represent the medium emission scenario in order to reveal the impact of future climate change on water resources in the tgra four groups of scenarios were designed to conduct the comparative analysis and the scenario design is shown in table 3 taking the historical scenario as a comparison the simulation baseline period was set as 1981 2010 and the simulation results reflected the change trend of water resources in the tgra during these 30 years for comparison scenarios 2 3 and 4 set 2021 2050 as the future period and the simulation scenarios are selected as rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively representing three climate change emission scenarios of low medium and high considering that the total water consumption in the yrb has stabilized at about 200 billion m3 since 2010 the water consumption under all three future climate change scenarios was set to the constant value in 2010 in order to ensure a stable initial state of the model in the future period the multi model ensemble mean meteorological driving data for 2021 2030 under each climate scenario were simulated in five times in a cycle so that the initial conditions of the model under each scenario could reach a relatively stable state then the state of the three groups of models at the end of the warm up period was saved as the initial state of each simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the monthly runoff data from actual hydrological stations three major control hydrological stations in the tgra pingshan zhutuo and cuntan were used for validation with the period 1971 1991 set as the calibration period and the period 1991 2001 as the validation period to evaluate the simulation performance of the clm dwc model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the relative error re were chosen as evaluation indexes nse is used to reflect the matching degree between simulated runoff and observed runoff and the closer to 1 the better simulation performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 re is used to reflect the average deviation between simulated runoff and measured runoff with smaller values indicating better simulation gupta et al 1999 the formulas are shown as follows 11 re i 1 n si m i o b s i i 1 n ob s i 100 12 nse 1 0 i 1 n si m i o b s i 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 where i is the time series of hydrological elements n is the length of the sequence sim is the simulated value sv and obs is the observed value ov fig 2 fig 2 presents comparison of simulated and measured runoff processes at main control stations in the tgra the figure indicated that the coupled model can well simulate the runoff process at the three hydrological stations of pingshan zhutuo and cuntan and the peak line time was consistent but the minimum and maximum values of flow were underestimated table 4 lists the simulation results of monthly runoff process in the clm dwc model the re of pingshan zhutuo and cuntan were 1 41 6 67 2 88 respectively during calibration period and 1 14 7 88 4 41 respectively during the validation period the nse values of three hydrological stations were higher than 0 90 during calibration period and validation period simulation performance of the model was good when nse 0 50 and biasre 10 moriasi et al 2007 meng et al 2018 robert et al 2008 therefore the clm dwc model had good simulation performance in simulating the runoff process in the tgra 3 2 performance evaluation of averaging results of multi model ensemble based on the observation data of the tgra from 1961 to 2000 five climate models were selected to simulate precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity in order to verify the simulation effect of each model on each element in whole reservoir area the avme of the five climate models were obtained using the bma and the em was used to obtain the weight of each meteorological element simulated by five models through several iterations fig 3 draws the box plot of the weight of each element in each model in the box plot a line in the middle of the box represents the median line of the data the top and bottom of the box are the upper and lower quartiles of the data respectively the height of the box reflects the spatial variability of each element to some extent and the top and bottom edges represent the maximum and minimum values of the data the weights of the five climate models were equally divided into 0 20 and 0 20 is used as the baseline for precipitation the lower quartile of hadgem2 es lay above 0 20 and had the lowest box height indicating the least data fluctuation and the best simulation followed by noresm1 m while about 75 of the grid weights of gfdl esm2m and ipsl cm5a lr were lower than 0 20 and the simulation effect was poor for air temperature the grid weights of both hadgem2 es and noresm1 m were higher than 0 20 indicating that these two models could well reflect the spatial distribution of air temperature in the basin the box height of noresm1 m was lower than that of hadgem2 es indicating that the spatial difference of air temperature simulation of noresm1 m was less than that of hadgem2 es for wind speed the simulation effect of miroc esm was the worst and had a significantly low value with large spatial local differences and the weights of the other four models were all above 0 20 for relative humidity overall simulation of hadgem2 es miroc esm and noresm1 m were better among them the fluctuation and spatial difference of miroc esm and noresm1 m were small and the overall weight of hadgem2 es was larger but the spatial difference was also large combining the weight distribution of each meteorological element the model hadgem2 es performs better which is consistent with the previous studies mcsweeney and jones 2016 wang et al 2018 the avme of each element were obtained based on the weight of meteorological elements simulated by eq 10 according to each model calculated results the simulation performance of each model and the avme were evaluated using taylor diagrams fig 4 is the taylor diagram of monthly average meteorological elements of five climate models and multi model ensemble average in this figure each point represents the evaluation result of a model the distance of each point from the origin is the nsd between the sv and the ov of the model the closer the nsd is to 1 the closer the sv is to the ov draw a ray from the origin to each point and the intersection of the ray with the circumference of the circle is the correlation coefficient between the svs and ovs of the model the closer the point is to the horizontal axis the more similar the svs are to the ovs the distance of each point from the horizontal axis reference point ref represents the root mean square error of the svs and ovs the closer the point is to the ref point the smaller the dispersion degree of the sv is the taylor diagram can intuitively portray the relative amplitude correlation and deviation between the sv and ov the closer the simulation point is to the ref point the higher the simulation accuracy is from the figs a and b it can be seen that the results of the five models and their avme were almost consistent the nsd of precipitation was about 0 8 and the nsd of air temperature was close to 1 from the correlation coefficients the correlation coefficients were above 0 85 for air temperature and 0 6 for precipitation indicating that the five models could well capture the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation and air temperature with better air temperature simulation in fig c the correlation coefficients of all five models were above 0 7 but from the nsd index there were still large deviations between the simulated and measured values and the simulation error is large point 6 in the figure was the simulation average result of multi mode ensemble which can be seen that it had a large improvement on the three models indicating that avme can improve the simulation accuracy of climate models on relative humidity as can be seen from fig d the average results of the five models and their multi model ensemble were highly similar but overall the correlation coefficient was very low which could not reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of wind speed meanwhile the nsd and root mean square error results shown that there were still large errors between the simulated and measured values which indicated that the avme did not significantly improve the wind speed simulation results the reason was that the weights of the five models were relatively close to each other and most of the points fluctuated around 0 2 which could be visually confirmed in fig 3 therefore the avme was very close to the value of each model due to the simulation of wind speed by these five models was inherently poor it led to poor avme in summary the avme were the best for air temperature the second best for precipitation relative humidity ranking behind and the worst for wind speed because the spatial distribution of precipitation and air temperature under the five models was more consistent and the simulation effect was well so the avme were also great the simulation of relative humidity in hadgem2 es was the best and the weight is high and the avme of relative humidity could improve the simulation accuracy to a certain extent however the simulation of wind speed by all five models was poor and the difference among their respective weights was not large the avme could not effectively improve the simulation accuracy of wind speed which will have a certain impact on the simulation of water resources change trends in future scenarios 3 3 change trend of water resources under future scenarios in this study the water intake module and the confluence module were added to the clm4 5 to form the coupled model clm dwc land surface hydrological model it was driven by the avme to further form the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model the temporal and spatial variation trends of runoff surface water and groundwater were predicted in the tgra from 2021 to 2050 under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 3 3 1 change trend of runoff depth under future scenarios surface runoff is dynamic water on the land surface which is a part of surface water and usually flows into rivers and the sea in this study the variation trends of runoff depth under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were analyzed fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution of multi year average runoff depth in the tgra and its changes compared with the baseline period under three scenarios among them the runoff depth in all three scenarios presented the spatial distribution characteristics of high at belly of the reservoir low at head and tail of the reservoir which was well consistent with the baseline period moreover compared with the baseline period the runoff depth in the three scenarios had increased obviously in chongqing city at the tail of the reservoir and the left bank at the head of the reservoir in contrast the runoff depth elsewhere provided a decreasing regular among which the runoff depth on the right bank of the reservoir head had a significant decrease fig 6 shows the monthly averages runoff depth variation in multi year under the three scenarios compared to the baseline period in general runoff depth increased the most under the rcp4 5 with an annual average increase of 20 8 mm for the whole reservoir area runoff depth under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 showed a decreasing trend which decreased by 5 1 mm and 32 8 mm respectively and their monthly runoff depth changes remained basically consistent the combined three scenarios showed a significant decrease in runoff depth during the summer and fall june november between 2020 and 2050 with a decrease in the concentration of intra year distribution therefore the flood disasters in the tgra would be reduced which is conducive to the stability of the ecological environment of the basin and the optimal allocation of hydropower resources and the deviation and uncertainty of hydrological risk prediction can be reduced huang and fan 2021 fig 7 shows the inter annual variation of multi year average runoff depth for the baseline period and future period the annual average runoff depth in the baseline period was 549 1 mm and would decrease slowly in the next 30 years with a trend of 36 2 mm 10 year additionally the runoff depth under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 increased with the trend of 0 8 mm 10 year and 27 mm 10 year respectively under the rcp4 5 runoff depth increased rapidly at the beginning reached the maximum in 2032 and then began to decrease the annual distribution of runoff depth tends to be average but the inter annual variation showed an increasing trend precipitation and evaporation of climatic factors directly affect the formation and change of runoff the amount of rainfall as well as its spatial and temporal distribution determined the runoff and the larger the rainfall and the higher intensity the greater the runoff under certain surface conditions lu et al 2019 hu et al 2010 nevertheless evaporation is negatively correlated with runoff water storage water retention as well as soil conservation are influenced by vegetation especially forest vegetation which cuts the peak flood flow and increases the dry water flow so that the intra annual distribution of runoff tends to be even 3 3 2 change trend of surface water under future scenarios surface water is a general term for dynamic and static water on the land surface which contains surface runoff in this study surface water refers to the static water such as lakes and reservoirs precipitation is the main supplementary source of surface water and it has a complementary relationship with groundwater the water quantity and quality of surface water are greatly affected by the geological conditions climate human activities and other factors flowing through the region the spatial distribution of multi year average surface water in the tgra and its changes compared with the baseline period under the three scenarios are shown in fig 8 and it expressed that the spatial distribution of surface water in the three scenarios had good consistency with the baseline period and also had a good correspondence with the runoff depth meanwhile compared with the baseline period the surface water in the chongqing area and the left bank of the head of the reservoir had increased significantly and its increase was larger in the rcp4 5 than in the other two scenarios conversely the surface water in the other area showed different degrees of decrease compared with the baseline period among which the surface water on the right bank of the reservoir had a significant decrease fig 9 shows the changes of average monthly surface water compare to the baseline period in three scenarios the annual distribution of surface water in the three scenarios was basically consistent with the runoff depth and it increased except for july october fig 10 is the inter annual variation sequence of the average surface water in the baseline period and the future period the average annual surface water in the baseline period was 386 6 mm with a trend of 31 9 mm 10 years for the next 30 years under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the surface water increased by 0 7 mm 10 years and 23 mm 10 years respectively but under rcp4 5 the surface water increased rapidly at first reaching the highest level in 2032 and then began to decrease climate change including precipitation evaporation and temperature is closely related to the change of surface water climate factors also interact with each other lyu and fan 2021 the amount and days of precipitation after impoundment in the tgra indicated an increasing trend while the temperature and evaporation shown a weak downward trend zhang et al 2019 these factors have a great impact on the future trend of surface water which may be the reason for the increase of annual distribution and inter annual variation of surface water in the future accordingly predicting the impact of climate change on surface water resources can provide information for water resources planning and management development and utilization benefit tapping and ecological environment protection 3 3 3 change trend of groundwater under future scenarios climate change not only significantly affect the spatial distribution of water level of surface water but also potentially affect those of the groundwater leith and whitfield 1998 zektser and loaiciga 1993 compared to the baseline period the spatial distribution of groundwater in the tgra under three scenarios and its changes are shown in fig 11 the spatial distribution of groundwater under all three scenarios was in good consistent with the baseline period compared with the baseline period groundwater had an increase of 5 10 mm on the left bank of the head of the reservoir and a decrease of 60 90 mm on the right bank groundwater in the other areas had a decrease of 0 30 mm because the response time of groundwater to climate change is longer the future change of groundwater is about two orders of magnitude less than runoff depth and surface water fig 12 shows the monthly average groundwater change in multi year compared to the baseline period under three scenarios overall groundwater increased slightly in spring and decreased in other seasons under the three scenarios with an average decrease of 1 6 mm and it decreased the most in the rcp8 5 reaching 1 84 mm fig 13 illustrates the sequence of inter annual variation of average groundwater in multi year between the baseline period and the future period the annual average groundwater in the baseline period was 162 5 mm which decreases insignificantly with a trend of 1 7 mm 10 year over the next 30 years except to rcp8 5 scenario rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 showed a decreasing trend of 0 2 mm 10 years and 5 mm 10 years respectively subsurface aquifers are known to respond more slowly to climate fluctuations than surface water when aquifers have high capacity they can act as more resilient buffers during droughts bovolo et al 2009 climate change alters groundwater recharge to the aquifer leading to changes in groundwater levels of non pressurized aquifers therefore determining changes in groundwater recharge is key to estimating the effects of climate change on groundwater increased temperature and decreased precipitation can also trigger groundwater withdrawal from aquifers as the climate warms and surface temperatures rise the demand for groundwater by surface plants increases meanwhile the development of urbanization has led to changes in the types of land use and the increase of concrete land has a greater impact on surface water infiltration these may be the reasons for the decrease of groundwater 4 conclusions the water intake module and the confluence module had been added to the clm4 5 land surface model formed the clm dwc model land surface hydrological model which took into account the influence of human activities on water resources the coupled model clm dwc was driven by the avme to formed the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model the change trend of water resources of the tgra in the future was predicted from three levels of runoff surface water and groundwater the simulated scenarios for each element of the five climate models were the best for air temperature the second best for precipitation relative humidity ranking behind and the worst for wind speed using the avme to drive the coupled model clm dwc would reduce the uncertainty of the simulation results spatially the runoff depth surface water and groundwater under the three future scenarios showed the high at the belly part of the reservoir and low at the head and tail of the reservoir which were all in well consistent with the baseline period under the three future scenarios runoff depth increases by 20 8 mm under the rcp4 5 compared to the baseline period while runoff depth tended to decrease under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 by 5 1 mm and 32 8 mm respectively the average increase in surface water for the future period 2021 2050 was 3 44 and the average decrease in groundwater is 11 72 from the perspective of inter annual variation the surface water increased significantly with a trend of 23 mm 10 years under rcp8 5 and the groundwater in rcp4 5 decreased significantly with a trend of 5 mm 10 years from the perspective of annual distribution both surface water and groundwater tended to average out over the year in general the distribution of water resources tended to average during the year and the inter annual variation presented an increasing trend indicated the frequency of drought and flood events increase significantly which can be effectively controlled through reservoir water dispatching and other means groundwater presented a declining trend in the future period as a source of domestic water industrial water and agricultural irrigation more attention should be paid to groundwater resources in the future land use type is an important influencing factor on the spatial distribution of water

2388,in this study the water intake module and the confluence module were added to the community land model version 4 5 clm 4 5 forming the community land model dualistic water cycle clm dwc model land surface hydrological model it solved the problem that the influence of human activities was not considered in the existing hydrological coupling simulation process which so as to the inaccuracy of the simulation process the clm dwc model was driven by the average results of five global climate models gcms ensemble to form the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model to predict the temporal and spatial variation trends of water resources in the three gorges reservoir area tgra from 2021 to 2050 under representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in the future scenarios in terms of spatial distribution the runoff surface water and groundwater all indicated the high at the belly of the reservoir and low at the head and tail of the reservoir which were in good consistency with the baseline period in terms of intra annual distribution and inter annual variability runoff depth increases by 20 8 mm at rcp4 5 compared with the baseline period and it tended to decrease under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 at the same time under the three scenarios the average increase of surface water was 3 44 groundwater decreases by an average of 11 72 accurately predicting the change trend of water resources in the tgra under climate change has great significance for future water resources management and planning in the reservoir area keywords water resources climate change the three gorges reservoir area coupled model prediction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors the global climate is constantly changing and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent worldwide ning et al 2019 these have direct or indirect impacts on agricultural production energy production forest vegetation urban construction water resources and the environment liu et al 2016 wang et al 2017 water resources are one of the resources most affected by climate change which is closely related to the frequent occurrence of extreme hydrological events such as droughts and floods climate change leads to spatial and temporal variation of water cycle factors such as evaporation and precipitation in the hydrological system and the extremes of these factors resulting in spatial and temporal redistribution of water resources wang et al 2019 therefore it is important to study the impact of climate change on water resources for the safe and effective management and development of measures to cope with climate changes future climate changes are unpredictable and scenarios that meet scientific assumptions are needed to describe future climate change conditions representative climate scenarios rcps were provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc rcps represented alternate path of carbon dioxide emissions as well as the resulting atmospheric concentration in the 21st century and were commonly used as input parameters for climate change prediction models under the influence of human activities moss et al 2010 rcps include a high emission scenario 8 5 w m 2 rcp8 5 two medium emission scenarios 4 5 w m 2 rcp4 5 and 6 0 w m 2 rcp6 0 and a low emission scenario 2 6 w m 2 rcp2 6 different rcps reflect different socio economic and technological development scenarios at present the main method to study the impact of future climate change on water resources is to use hydrological models driven by meteorological data to simulate and analyze the trends of water resources under future climate change global climate model gcm prediction results such as precipitation temperature etc were selected as meteorological data under scenarios with specific greenhouse gas emissions or radiative forcing trajectories lu et al 2018 schnorbus and cannon 2014 liu and mizzi 2020 used the swat deep ifso model to assess the impact of land use and climate change on runoff generation and water resources under different scenarios the results showed that the average annual runoff could be expected to show an increasing trend and that the region might experience periods of severe floods and droughts leading to a reduction of water resources based on the land use scenario in the study area ghumman et al 2020 used precipitation and air temperature results from three gcms to drive the hec hms hydrological model to simulate surface runoff the results indicated that surface runoff in the study area astore had increased by 2070 and could be expected to decline in the distant future li et al 2022 adopted daily precipitation data from the bcc csm2 mr model to drive the hec hms hydrological model to predict the response of runoff to future climate change in a typical watershed of changbai mountains the results revealed that the basin outflow would increase in the next 30 years during the rainy season june september but it could be lower than historical measured values the future flow peak would occur mostly in august and september surface water is divided into dynamic water and static water dynamic water generally refers to river runoff which is the main water source for human development and utilization static water such as lakes and reservoirs are water bodies that store and regulate runoff and renew slowly many scholars usually use river runoff to express surface water resources whereas neglect static surface water body such as lakes and reservoirs groundwater is also an important part of water resources and is one of the important water sources for agricultural irrigation industry mining and urbanism the community land model clm is the land component of the community earth system model cesm it mainly adopted in the land atmosphere interactions or the water balance studies at continental to global scales it is also used in hydrological simulations e g runoff the clm has been upgraded from version 2 to version 5 and its simulation accuracy of runoff evapotranspiration as well as total water storage continues to improve lawrence et al 2011 oleson et al 2013 lawrence et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 used clm4 5 driven by the atmospheric forcing dataset cruncep to simulate the spatial and temporal characteristics of soil moisture across the tibetan plateau from 1981 to 2016 the results showed that clm4 5 could well reproduce the spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture in the tibetan plateau liu et al 2016 evaluated the performance of clm4 5 to simulate the hydrologic fluxes wang et al 2019 used clm4 5 to simulate and analyze the spatiotemporal variability of evapotranspiration between 1993 and 2013 liu et al 2017 demonstrated that clm4 5 was superior colm2005 and colm2014 in runoff simulating however clm4 5 still has major shortcomings in the production confluence mechanism compared with distributed hydrological models furthermore the influence of human activities such as artificial water withdrawal and reservoir storage on hydrological processes is not considered the three gorges project is the world s largest hydraulic project and the hydropower project with the most comprehensive benefits it is a strategic reservoir of freshwater resources in china and an important ecological barrier in the yangtze river basin yrb but it is also one of the main ecologically vulnerable areas in the yrb since the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir area tgra in 2003 the water level has increased significantly and the expansion of the underlying waters has caused changes of the local climate in the tgra it causes the spatial and temporal redistribution of water resources and has a direct impact on precipitation evaporation runoff etc cui et al 2021 li et al 2021 ma et al 2018 in recent years many scholars have carried out studies on the impact of climate change on water resources in the tgra indicating that climate elements are closely related to runoff changes qin et al 2020 yan et al 2021 with the aggravation of global warming the water cycle in the tgra intensifies making it necessary to study future climate change trends on the overall water resources in the tgra in this study the effects of climate change and human activities were considered comprehensively and the water intake module and the confluence module were added to the clm4 5 land surface model then the community land model dualistic water cycle clm dwc model land surface hydrological model was formed the coupled model clm dwc was driven by the averaging values of five gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m ensemble which further formed the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model the spatial and temporal variation trends of runoff surface water and groundwater in the tgra from 2021 to 2050 under future scenarios were predicted 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the tgra is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river 28 56 n 31 44 n 106 16 e 111 28 e and its terrain is mainly composed of mountains hills and plains area controlled by river basin is about 58000 km2 and the basin water system consists of the main stream and 21 first level tributaries of the yrb of which the total length of the main stream of the yrb in the reservoir section is 660 km the tgra belongs to subtropical monsoon climate influenced by the east asian monsoon south asian monsoon and the topography of tibetan plateau the climate and hydrological characteristics have obvious seasonal changes qin et al 2020 affected by the entire basin the tgra has high evaporation resulting in more precipitation and significantly more and longer duration of autumn rains the average annual precipitation is about 1125 3 mm of which the precipitation from may to september in the flood season accounts for about 80 of the annual precipitation leading to multiple rainstorms and floods the average annual air temperature in the reservoir area is about 16 8 the annual runoff is approximately 400 billion m3 and the proportion of precipitation and runoff in the dry season is relatively small the main meteorological elements in the reservoir area are shown in table 1 the study divided the tgra into the reservoir head reservoir belly and reservoir tail according to the county boundaries of the tgra the specific distribution is shown in fig 1 2 2 data this study includes hydrological data and meteorological data the clm dwc model was calibrated and validated using the observed monthly runoff data of pingshan zhutuo and cuntan hydrological stations from 1971 to 2001 the surface water and groundwater data in the water resources bulletin of yangtze river basin and southwest rivers and runoff data in the hydrological yearbook of yangtze river basin were interpolated into the clm dwc model using the bilinear method and the results were used as a baseline period to predict future trend of water resources in the tgra meteorological data includes future forecast data and historical observation data the future projection data was provided by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip for the five ipcc fifth climate change assessment global climate models gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m output which was interpolated using the bilinear method and revised based on statistical deviations of the probability distribution detailed attribute information for the study using climate model scenario data is shown in table 2 to verify the accuracy of future climate change data the cn05 1 meteorological observation dataset developed by the china meteorological administration cma was used as observation data for comparison in order to meet the needs of high resolution climate model validation observation data from 2416 meteorological stations of the cma are interpolated using the distance level approximation method to form a gridded observation dataset with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 wu and gao 2013 the observation period is 1961 2015 and the observation elements include precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity this dataset has high accuracy and is now widely used in the validation of various climate models shi et al 2018 observation data from 1961 to 2000 were used as comparative observation data for the five climate model simulations since the spatial resolution of the observation data and the climate model simulation data do not agree the observation data were interpolated to a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 in conducting the study to facilitate direct comparison between the two 2 3 description of clm dwc model simulation of regional climate land hydrology can assess the impact of climate change and human activities on water resources security and maintain sustainable economic development ning et al 2019 in atmospheric hydrological simulations the land surface model is the common interface between hydrological and atmospheric processes therefore accurate simulation of large scale terrestrial water is essential for studying atmospheric processes and climate change the clm series of the land surface models developed by national center for atmospheric research ncar adopts a multi level sub grid scheme of grid land unit soil column vegetation functional type to reflect the spatial differences within the grid units which has a better simulation effect in terms of soil moisture and energy flux oleson et al 2013 at the same time clm is the land surface sub model of the cesm which can be well coupled with other sub models such as the atmospheric model so it has become the most widely used land surface model at present the latest version of clm series land surface model is clm 5 0 compared with clm 4 5 clm 5 0 has not changed much in water balance study and hydrological simulation in addition clm 5 0 has only been simulated offline and the coupling with other modules under different computing platforms and resolutions has not been rigorously verified by scientific climate considering the stability of the model this study still uses clm4 5 as the basis for land surface hydrological simulation and model coupling the clm4 5 model uses a grid as the basic computational unit for simulation calculation and the model is expressed as a three layer nested sub grid hierarchy the model divides each grid into several land units each land unit may have several soil columns and each soil column may have several vegetation types the model divides each grid into several land units and there may be several soil columns in each land unit and there may be several vegetation types in each soil column the first layer is land units including vegetation lakes glaciers cities and crops the purpose of setting this layer is mainly to reflect the spatial inhomogeneity within the grid the second layer is the soil column which defines the state variables and fluxes of water and energy in soil and snow the soil column can be divided into a maximum of 15 layers including the fixed 10 layers of soil layer and up to 5 layers of snow layer with the division of the snow layer depends on the snow depth the third layer is the vegetation functional type mainly to reflect the differences of biogeophysical and biogeochemical characteristics between different vegetation functional types a total of 16 vegetation functional types including bare soil are classified in this layer and all fluxes in and out of the surface and vegetation state variables are also defined the clm4 5 model is the land surface component model of the cesm 1 2 0 and its operation depends on the overall framework of the cesm in the framework of the cesm in addition to the land surface model there is the coupler and component models such as the confluence model and the atmospheric model in this study the water intake module and the confluence module were added which ran in parallel with the land surface process model and updated the operational data in real time to realize the land surface hydrological coupling land surface process model for calculating each elemental process layer by layer based on the atmospheric forcing data to obtain the yield flow data of the soil hydrological process the water intake module for determining the water intake scheme based on the received yield flow data and updating the yield flow data for transmission to the confluence module and returning the updated yield flow data to the land surface process model through the coupler for the remaining land surface process calculation the confluence module for determining the confluence scheme based on the updated yield flow data the coupler was the link between the component models which can transfer the model input and output data among the component models and also perform scale conversion to control the operation of the whole earth system model the specific operation process is referred to wang et al 2020 since the coupled model has the characteristics of both land surface model and binary water cycle model it was named community land model dualistic water cycle clm dwc model this system and method can solve the problem that the influence of human activities was not taken into account in the existing hydrological coupling simulation process and reduced the uncertainty of the simulation process the problem of accurately reflecting the actual variation law and characteristics of each element of land surface moisture the influence of uncertainty in hydrological prediction has become increasingly prominent and scholars have carried out relevant research fan et al 2022a fan et al 2022b considering that the clm dwc model is influenced by the topography climatic conditions upstream and downstream hydrological connections and other factors around the tgra in order to reduce the uncertainty caused by the scope boundary the whole yrb was taken as the research scope for modeling the parameters required for model confluence include calculating the upstream cumulative confluence area of the grid manning s roughness coefficient as well as the slope width depth and length of the channel etc among them the upstream cumulative confluence area was calculated using the multi flow direction method and other channel parameters were estimated by referring to relevant empirical equations getirana et al 2012 quinn et al 2010 wu et al 2012 2 4 climate model climate model is the main uncertainty when evaluating the impact of climate change on hydrological process followed by greenhouse gas emission scenarios and the uncertainty of hydrological model is relatively small carvajal et al 2017 chen et al 2017 su et al 2017 the working group on coupled modelling wgcm of the world climate research programme wcrp released dozens of climate model scenario data https cmip pcmdi llnl gov cmip5 in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 in this study gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m were selected to simulate the precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity in the tgra in order to eliminate the uncertainty between the simulation results of different climate models as much as possible the averaging values of multi model ensemble avme were used as the atmospheric driving for the subsequent clm dwc model land surface hydrology simulations bayesian model averaging method bma is a statistical method used for multi model ensemble forecasting which uses a bayesian formulation to obtain the posterior distribution of a given mode by combining the prior distribution of each mode sequence with a likelihood function so as to obtain its weights and then the avme is obtained by weighted averaging raftery et al 2005 assuming that q is the element of the model simulation f f 1 f 2 f 3 f t is the set of t model simulations and a is the measured element the bayesian probability forecast can be expressed as follows 1 p q a i 1 t p f i a p i q f i a where i is the model sequence t is the number of models p f i a is the posterior probability of the ith model simulation element fi when the measured element is a namely the bayesian weight which indicates the degree of matching between the model simulation values and the actual observation values the larger the weight the closer the sv of the model is to the measured value p i q f i a is the posterior distribution of the measured elements a and the svs q when the model simulation is fi assuming that the simulated and measured values of each model obey a normal distribution the bayesian mean can be obtained by a weighted average of the svs of each model as follows 2 e q a i 1 t p f i a e g q f i σ i 2 i 1 t w i f i where e is the bayesian average g is a normal distribution with mean f and variance σ 2 w is the weight expectation maximization algorithm em was used to estimate bayesian weight this method assumes that each model sequence obeys normal distribution and calculates the probability distribution parameters of the simulated variables by introducing latent variables the algorithm mainly performs cyclic calculation through two steps the first is to calculate the expected value in this step the latent variable is the hypothetical estimated value of the bayesian model s average distribution parameters the expected value is then maximized which the average distribution parameters of bayesian model are the current estimate of the latent variable these two steps are alternately iterative until the preset computational accuracy threshold is met with θ w i σ i 2 i 1 2 3

simulation effect of each model on each element in the whole reservoir area and taylor diagram was used to evaluate the performance of each climate model on the spatial climate distribution the box plot can reflect the center position and distribution range of a set or multiple sets of continuous quantitative data distribution benjamini 1988 taylor diagram is a visual graph proposed by taylor for examining simulation performance of the model it can compare the normalized standard deviation nsd correlation coefficient root mean square error etc between one or more model datasets and one or more reference datasets which can reflect the comprehensive performance of the prediction model and is widely used in the field of climate and meteorology the specific calculation process can be referred to taylor et al taylor 2001 2 5 scenario setting for future water resources change trend the clm dwc model was driven by the averaging results of five gcms ensemble to form the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model among four future scenarios rcp8 5 causes the largest temperature increase high emission scenario followed by rcp6 0 as well as rcp4 5 medium emission scenarios and rcp2 6 has the lowest effect on global warming low emission scenario since both rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 are climate scenarios under government intervention rcp4 5 is used in this study to represent the medium emission scenario in order to reveal the impact of future climate change on water resources in the tgra four groups of scenarios were designed to conduct the comparative analysis and the scenario design is shown in table 3 taking the historical scenario as a comparison the simulation baseline period was set as 1981 2010 and the simulation results reflected the change trend of water resources in the tgra during these 30 years for comparison scenarios 2 3 and 4 set 2021 2050 as the future period and the simulation scenarios are selected as rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively representing three climate change emission scenarios of low medium and high considering that the total water consumption in the yrb has stabilized at about 200 billion m3 since 2010 the water consumption under all three future climate change scenarios was set to the constant value in 2010 in order to ensure a stable initial state of the model in the future period the multi model ensemble mean meteorological driving data for 2021 2030 under each climate scenario were simulated in five times in a cycle so that the initial conditions of the model under each scenario could reach a relatively stable state then the state of the three groups of models at the end of the warm up period was saved as the initial state of each simulation 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation the monthly runoff data from actual hydrological stations three major control hydrological stations in the tgra pingshan zhutuo and cuntan were used for validation with the period 1971 1991 set as the calibration period and the period 1991 2001 as the validation period to evaluate the simulation performance of the clm dwc model the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the relative error re were chosen as evaluation indexes nse is used to reflect the matching degree between simulated runoff and observed runoff and the closer to 1 the better simulation performance nash and sutcliffe 1970 re is used to reflect the average deviation between simulated runoff and measured runoff with smaller values indicating better simulation gupta et al 1999 the formulas are shown as follows 11 re i 1 n si m i o b s i i 1 n ob s i 100 12 nse 1 0 i 1 n si m i o b s i 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 where i is the time series of hydrological elements n is the length of the sequence sim is the simulated value sv and obs is the observed value ov fig 2 fig 2 presents comparison of simulated and measured runoff processes at main control stations in the tgra the figure indicated that the coupled model can well simulate the runoff process at the three hydrological stations of pingshan zhutuo and cuntan and the peak line time was consistent but the minimum and maximum values of flow were underestimated table 4 lists the simulation results of monthly runoff process in the clm dwc model the re of pingshan zhutuo and cuntan were 1 41 6 67 2 88 respectively during calibration period and 1 14 7 88 4 41 respectively during the validation period the nse values of three hydrological stations were higher than 0 90 during calibration period and validation period simulation performance of the model was good when nse 0 50 and biasre 10 moriasi et al 2007 meng et al 2018 robert et al 2008 therefore the clm dwc model had good simulation performance in simulating the runoff process in the tgra 3 2 performance evaluation of averaging results of multi model ensemble based on the observation data of the tgra from 1961 to 2000 five climate models were selected to simulate precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity in order to verify the simulation effect of each model on each element in whole reservoir area the avme of the five climate models were obtained using the bma and the em was used to obtain the weight of each meteorological element simulated by five models through several iterations fig 3 draws the box plot of the weight of each element in each model in the box plot a line in the middle of the box represents the median line of the data the top and bottom of the box are the upper and lower quartiles of the data respectively the height of the box reflects the spatial variability of each element to some extent and the top and bottom edges represent the maximum and minimum values of the data the weights of the five climate models were equally divided into 0 20 and 0 20 is used as the baseline for precipitation the lower quartile of hadgem2 es lay above 0 20 and had the lowest box height indicating the least data fluctuation and the best simulation followed by noresm1 m while about 75 of the grid weights of gfdl esm2m and ipsl cm5a lr were lower than 0 20 and the simulation effect was poor for air temperature the grid weights of both hadgem2 es and noresm1 m were higher than 0 20 indicating that these two models could well reflect the spatial distribution of air temperature in the basin the box height of noresm1 m was lower than that of hadgem2 es indicating that the spatial difference of air temperature simulation of noresm1 m was less than that of hadgem2 es for wind speed the simulation effect of miroc esm was the worst and had a significantly low value with large spatial local differences and the weights of the other four models were all above 0 20 for relative humidity overall simulation of hadgem2 es miroc esm and noresm1 m were better among them the fluctuation and spatial difference of miroc esm and noresm1 m were small and the overall weight of hadgem2 es was larger but the spatial difference was also large combining the weight distribution of each meteorological element the model hadgem2 es performs better which is consistent with the previous studies mcsweeney and jones 2016 wang et al 2018 the avme of each element were obtained based on the weight of meteorological elements simulated by eq 10 according to each model calculated results the simulation performance of each model and the avme were evaluated using taylor diagrams fig 4 is the taylor diagram of monthly average meteorological elements of five climate models and multi model ensemble average in this figure each point represents the evaluation result of a model the distance of each point from the origin is the nsd between the sv and the ov of the model the closer the nsd is to 1 the closer the sv is to the ov draw a ray from the origin to each point and the intersection of the ray with the circumference of the circle is the correlation coefficient between the svs and ovs of the model the closer the point is to the horizontal axis the more similar the svs are to the ovs the distance of each point from the horizontal axis reference point ref represents the root mean square error of the svs and ovs the closer the point is to the ref point the smaller the dispersion degree of the sv is the taylor diagram can intuitively portray the relative amplitude correlation and deviation between the sv and ov the closer the simulation point is to the ref point the higher the simulation accuracy is from the figs a and b it can be seen that the results of the five models and their avme were almost consistent the nsd of precipitation was about 0 8 and the nsd of air temperature was close to 1 from the correlation coefficients the correlation coefficients were above 0 85 for air temperature and 0 6 for precipitation indicating that the five models could well capture the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation and air temperature with better air temperature simulation in fig c the correlation coefficients of all five models were above 0 7 but from the nsd index there were still large deviations between the simulated and measured values and the simulation error is large point 6 in the figure was the simulation average result of multi mode ensemble which can be seen that it had a large improvement on the three models indicating that avme can improve the simulation accuracy of climate models on relative humidity as can be seen from fig d the average results of the five models and their multi model ensemble were highly similar but overall the correlation coefficient was very low which could not reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of wind speed meanwhile the nsd and root mean square error results shown that there were still large errors between the simulated and measured values which indicated that the avme did not significantly improve the wind speed simulation results the reason was that the weights of the five models were relatively close to each other and most of the points fluctuated around 0 2 which could be visually confirmed in fig 3 therefore the avme was very close to the value of each model due to the simulation of wind speed by these five models was inherently poor it led to poor avme in summary the avme were the best for air temperature the second best for precipitation relative humidity ranking behind and the worst for wind speed because the spatial distribution of precipitation and air temperature under the five models was more consistent and the simulation effect was well so the avme were also great the simulation of relative humidity in hadgem2 es was the best and the weight is high and the avme of relative humidity could improve the simulation accuracy to a certain extent however the simulation of wind speed by all five models was poor and the difference among their respective weights was not large the avme could not effectively improve the simulation accuracy of wind speed which will have a certain impact on the simulation of water resources change trends in future scenarios 3 3 change trend of water resources under future scenarios in this study the water intake module and the confluence module were added to the clm4 5 to form the coupled model clm dwc land surface hydrological model it was driven by the avme to further form the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model the temporal and spatial variation trends of runoff surface water and groundwater were predicted in the tgra from 2021 to 2050 under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 3 3 1 change trend of runoff depth under future scenarios surface runoff is dynamic water on the land surface which is a part of surface water and usually flows into rivers and the sea in this study the variation trends of runoff depth under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were analyzed fig 5 depicts the spatial distribution of multi year average runoff depth in the tgra and its changes compared with the baseline period under three scenarios among them the runoff depth in all three scenarios presented the spatial distribution characteristics of high at belly of the reservoir low at head and tail of the reservoir which was well consistent with the baseline period moreover compared with the baseline period the runoff depth in the three scenarios had increased obviously in chongqing city at the tail of the reservoir and the left bank at the head of the reservoir in contrast the runoff depth elsewhere provided a decreasing regular among which the runoff depth on the right bank of the reservoir head had a significant decrease fig 6 shows the monthly averages runoff depth variation in multi year under the three scenarios compared to the baseline period in general runoff depth increased the most under the rcp4 5 with an annual average increase of 20 8 mm for the whole reservoir area runoff depth under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 showed a decreasing trend which decreased by 5 1 mm and 32 8 mm respectively and their monthly runoff depth changes remained basically consistent the combined three scenarios showed a significant decrease in runoff depth during the summer and fall june november between 2020 and 2050 with a decrease in the concentration of intra year distribution therefore the flood disasters in the tgra would be reduced which is conducive to the stability of the ecological environment of the basin and the optimal allocation of hydropower resources and the deviation and uncertainty of hydrological risk prediction can be reduced huang and fan 2021 fig 7 shows the inter annual variation of multi year average runoff depth for the baseline period and future period the annual average runoff depth in the baseline period was 549 1 mm and would decrease slowly in the next 30 years with a trend of 36 2 mm 10 year additionally the runoff depth under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 increased with the trend of 0 8 mm 10 year and 27 mm 10 year respectively under the rcp4 5 runoff depth increased rapidly at the beginning reached the maximum in 2032 and then began to decrease the annual distribution of runoff depth tends to be average but the inter annual variation showed an increasing trend precipitation and evaporation of climatic factors directly affect the formation and change of runoff the amount of rainfall as well as its spatial and temporal distribution determined the runoff and the larger the rainfall and the higher intensity the greater the runoff under certain surface conditions lu et al 2019 hu et al 2010 nevertheless evaporation is negatively correlated with runoff water storage water retention as well as soil conservation are influenced by vegetation especially forest vegetation which cuts the peak flood flow and increases the dry water flow so that the intra annual distribution of runoff tends to be even 3 3 2 change trend of surface water under future scenarios surface water is a general term for dynamic and static water on the land surface which contains surface runoff in this study surface water refers to the static water such as lakes and reservoirs precipitation is the main supplementary source of surface water and it has a complementary relationship with groundwater the water quantity and quality of surface water are greatly affected by the geological conditions climate human activities and other factors flowing through the region the spatial distribution of multi year average surface water in the tgra and its changes compared with the baseline period under the three scenarios are shown in fig 8 and it expressed that the spatial distribution of surface water in the three scenarios had good consistency with the baseline period and also had a good correspondence with the runoff depth meanwhile compared with the baseline period the surface water in the chongqing area and the left bank of the head of the reservoir had increased significantly and its increase was larger in the rcp4 5 than in the other two scenarios conversely the surface water in the other area showed different degrees of decrease compared with the baseline period among which the surface water on the right bank of the reservoir had a significant decrease fig 9 shows the changes of average monthly surface water compare to the baseline period in three scenarios the annual distribution of surface water in the three scenarios was basically consistent with the runoff depth and it increased except for july october fig 10 is the inter annual variation sequence of the average surface water in the baseline period and the future period the average annual surface water in the baseline period was 386 6 mm with a trend of 31 9 mm 10 years for the next 30 years under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 the surface water increased by 0 7 mm 10 years and 23 mm 10 years respectively but under rcp4 5 the surface water increased rapidly at first reaching the highest level in 2032 and then began to decrease climate change including precipitation evaporation and temperature is closely related to the change of surface water climate factors also interact with each other lyu and fan 2021 the amount and days of precipitation after impoundment in the tgra indicated an increasing trend while the temperature and evaporation shown a weak downward trend zhang et al 2019 these factors have a great impact on the future trend of surface water which may be the reason for the increase of annual distribution and inter annual variation of surface water in the future accordingly predicting the impact of climate change on surface water resources can provide information for water resources planning and management development and utilization benefit tapping and ecological environment protection 3 3 3 change trend of groundwater under future scenarios climate change not only significantly affect the spatial distribution of water level of surface water but also potentially affect those of the groundwater leith and whitfield 1998 zektser and loaiciga 1993 compared to the baseline period the spatial distribution of groundwater in the tgra under three scenarios and its changes are shown in fig 11 the spatial distribution of groundwater under all three scenarios was in good consistent with the baseline period compared with the baseline period groundwater had an increase of 5 10 mm on the left bank of the head of the reservoir and a decrease of 60 90 mm on the right bank groundwater in the other areas had a decrease of 0 30 mm because the response time of groundwater to climate change is longer the future change of groundwater is about two orders of magnitude less than runoff depth and surface water fig 12 shows the monthly average groundwater change in multi year compared to the baseline period under three scenarios overall groundwater increased slightly in spring and decreased in other seasons under the three scenarios with an average decrease of 1 6 mm and it decreased the most in the rcp8 5 reaching 1 84 mm fig 13 illustrates the sequence of inter annual variation of average groundwater in multi year between the baseline period and the future period the annual average groundwater in the baseline period was 162 5 mm which decreases insignificantly with a trend of 1 7 mm 10 year over the next 30 years except to rcp8 5 scenario rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 showed a decreasing trend of 0 2 mm 10 years and 5 mm 10 years respectively subsurface aquifers are known to respond more slowly to climate fluctuations than surface water when aquifers have high capacity they can act as more resilient buffers during droughts bovolo et al 2009 climate change alters groundwater recharge to the aquifer leading to changes in groundwater levels of non pressurized aquifers therefore determining changes in groundwater recharge is key to estimating the effects of climate change on groundwater increased temperature and decreased precipitation can also trigger groundwater withdrawal from aquifers as the climate warms and surface temperatures rise the demand for groundwater by surface plants increases meanwhile the development of urbanization has led to changes in the types of land use and the increase of concrete land has a greater impact on surface water infiltration these may be the reasons for the decrease of groundwater 4 conclusions the water intake module and the confluence module had been added to the clm4 5 land surface model formed the clm dwc model land surface hydrological model which took into account the influence of human activities on water resources the coupled model clm dwc was driven by the avme to formed the atmosphere land hydrology fully coupled model the change trend of water resources of the tgra in the future was predicted from three levels of runoff surface water and groundwater the simulated scenarios for each element of the five climate models were the best for air temperature the second best for precipitation relative humidity ranking behind and the worst for wind speed using the avme to drive the coupled model clm dwc would reduce the uncertainty of the simulation results spatially the runoff depth surface water and groundwater under the three future scenarios showed the high at the belly part of the reservoir and low at the head and tail of the reservoir which were all in well consistent with the baseline period under the three future scenarios runoff depth increases by 20 8 mm under the rcp4 5 compared to the baseline period while runoff depth tended to decrease under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 by 5 1 mm and 32 8 mm respectively the average increase in surface water for the future period 2021 2050 was 3 44 and the average decrease in groundwater is 11 72 from the perspective of inter annual variation the surface water increased significantly with a trend of 23 mm 10 years under rcp8 5 and the groundwater in rcp4 5 decreased significantly with a trend of 5 mm 10 years from the perspective of annual distribution both surface water and groundwater tended to average out over the year in general the distribution of water resources tended to average during the year and the inter annual variation presented an increasing trend indicated the frequency of drought and flood events increase significantly which can be effectively controlled through reservoir water dispatching and other means groundwater presented a declining trend in the future period as a source of domestic water industrial water and agricultural irrigation more attention should be paid to groundwater resources in the future land use type is an important influencing factor on the spatial distribution of water resources and future research can carry out in depth exploration the results of this study will have important theoretical and practical significance for the future planning and design development and utilization of the future water resources system as well as the protection of the water environment and water ecology in the tgra credit authorship contribution statement jing sang data curation

2389,drought severity is not only related to drought intensity but also depends on drought duration to accurately characterize short and long term droughts and comprehend drought propagation mechanisms it is essential to ascertain the multiscale features of drought extremes here we estimate terrestrial water storage changes twsc using global navigation satellite system gnss vertical crustal displacement and then develop a novel multiscale gnss based drought index mgdi to characterize hydrological droughts in brazil from 2010 to 2021 mgdi is a probability based drought index and we employ a normal distribution to fit the twsc result the comparisons of temporal variations indicate that the mgdi is similar to other multiscale drought indices i e standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized terrestrial water storage index sti at different time scales due to the longer response time to meteorological variables hydrological drought indicators i e mgdi and sti generally lag behind meteorological drought indicators i e spi and spei but with less noise on the short scale the spatial distribution of mgdi derived drought frequency reveals that hydrological droughts are most frequent in northeastern brazil and near the parana river basin with a frequency of up to 0 38 about 55 months on the 1 month scale the spatiotemporal evolutions of the 2015 2016 drought event imaged by 3 month mgdi and 12 month spi are generally consistent and 3 month mgdi shows good temporal continuity of evolution investigation of drought propagation in various basins shows that 1 month mgdi correlates well with spi on the specific time scales e g 6 month 11 month 13 month and 14 month with all correlation coefficients above 0 55 in the amazon basin we also find that mgdi on the 1 5 3 years scale is strongly correlated with el niño southern oscillation enso events suggesting hydrological droughts are likely to be modulated by enso our findings imply that mgdi can characterize hydrological deficits more comprehensively and offer some critical insights for multiscale drought research keywords multiscale gnss terrestrial water storage changes drought severity index hydrological drought 1 introduction drought is a highly destructive natural hazard which appears more frequently due to exacerbated climate change and intensive human activities gloor et al 2013 he et al 2020 mishra and singh 2010 mukherjee et al 2018 the occurrence of drought negatively affects ecological maintenance agricultural development and industrial construction in recent years severe droughts in south africa gerdener et al 2020 india satish kumar et al 2021 sinha et al 2019 syed et al 2017 america borsa et al 2014 jiang et al 2022b jin and zhang 2016 china wang et al 2021 wu et al 2020 xu et al 2015 europe li et al 2012 and australia zhao et al 2017a yang et al 2021 highlight their destructiveness and regional vulnerability therefore accurate quantification of drought characteristics is an urgent need for stakeholders for drought monitoring assessment and prevention jiang et al 2022b the drought severity index dsi is a numerical representation of meteorological and hydrological extremes most traditional dsis are proposed based on hydrological and meteorological variables observed by meteorological stations or remote sensing satellites e g kim et al 2018 several popular drought indices have made significant strides in monitoring and assessing drought episodes such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardized precipitation temperature index spti ali et al 2017 surface water supply index swsi shafer and dezman 1982 standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 and standardized groundwater index sgi marchant and bloomfield 2018 in particular spi can characterize short lived meteorological anomalies one month as well as other long term hydrological changes six months or longer because of different responses of the various water components to precipitation deficits vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 however drought indicators developed by one or more types of hydrological or meteorological components are insufficient to completely track drought sparse ground observations cannot reflect the spatial characteristics of global or continental scale drought and conventional satellite measured data also cannot capture the complete hydrological components especially deep groundwater anthropogenic effects e g dam and reservoir operations on the water cycle are hard to be quantified lópez moreno et al 2009 which has been deemed a challenge van loon 2015 hence the establishment of drought indicators that integrate more variables e g deep groundwater and human interventions is necessary gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace follow on grace fo have been demonstrated to be independent tools for monitoring total water storage changes on a global scale and have made progress in large scale hydrological drought monitoring feng 2018 sun et al 2018 tapley et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 a number of academics have developed drought indicators to determine dryness or wetness solely or jointly using grace derived twsc for example several indices including the water storage deficit index wsdi deng et al 2021 syed et al 2017 and grace dsi zhao et al 2017b are solely produced by grace twsc on the other hand due to the lack of deep groundwater observations thomas et al 2017 presented the grace groundwater drought index ggdi to quantify groundwater deficits in the california central valley using hydrological components from other agencies and grace derived total water storage anomalies sinha et al 2019 devised a novel drought index named the combined climatologic deviation index ccdi combining grace derived terrestrial water storage with meteorological precipitation to assess drought except for the above uni scale drought indicators cui et al 2021 developed the grace obtained result into a multi scale drought index called the standardized tws index sti nevertheless regional and global scale drought episodes are more readily captured since grace missions provide results at a coarse spatial scale approximately 350 km e g wahr et al 2004 the 11 month data gap between the grace and grace fo missions prevents the capture of drought events such as the drought that occurred in australia from april 2018 to july 2019 boergens et al 2020 yang et al 2021 degradation of data quality during the late grace mission also affects drought assessment overall these unfavorable factors may bias the drought quantification continuous gnss stations can record elastic crustal deformation caused by hydrological mass variation in the form of displacement time series argus et al 2014 some academics used displacement data to directly characterize droughts for instance vertical crustal displacement vcd was employed by jiang et al 2017 to diagnose the hydrological droughts in yunnan china to examine the crustal responses to drought episodes in various brazilian regions ferreira et al 2018 constructed a gps based vcd drought index divcd jiang et al 2022b converted discrete site displacement data into regional displacement fields using a time varying gnss imaging strategy and then assessed droughts following the same inversion methodology as argus et al 2014 many scholars inverted gnss measured vcd into regional twsc borsa et al 2014 enzminger et al 2018 fu et al 2015 in addition jiang et al 2022a utilized a spectral domain inversion approach to estimate twsc and developed the result into a new drought index known as gnss dsi since gnss derived twsc can overcome some shortcomings of grace derived twsc gnss has been suggested as a complementary tool for drought monitoring jiang et al 2021b the above mentioned gnss derived drought indices are typically based on uni scale but few studies use gnss to investigate hydrological drought at various scales it is critical to address the multiscale issue because droughts generally need to be effectively characterized on a specific time scale vicente serrano et al 2010 in other words the multiscale drought index can provide a perspective for the monitoring of long term droughts when users do not pay attention to short term droughts like the grace related drought indices our proposed multiscale gnss based drought index mgdi integrates deficits of all hydrological components for a more comprehensive characterization of hydrological drought mgdi can be compared and verified against grace based dsi and provides more advantages in temporal and spatial resolution data continuity etc developing mgdi allows us to better clarify drought propagation ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 and investigate links with climate events e g enso in addition combining the existing multiscale drought indicators e g spi and sri etc will probably help to fully understand drought characteristics this study is the first attempt to use gnss to characterize multiscale hydrological droughts we expect that geodetic techniques such as gnss and grace can play more important roles in the hydrological community in this study we aim to develop a novel multiscale gnss based drought index referred to as mgdi and systematically investigate the hydrological drought in brazil to illustrate the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of water changes in brazil and validate gnss estimated twsc we first compare these two water products derived from gnss and grace our main work includes a investigating the temporal variations of mgdi and other indices in four major basins and analyzing the spatial distribution of drought frequencies derived from various dsi data sets b looking into the spatiotemporal evolution of a drought event that occurred in 2015 2016 c clarifying the drought propagation in four major watersheds and d exploring the intrinsic link between long term hydrological droughts and enso events our result can provide a scientific basis for drought assessment in brazil and a new perspective for multi scale drought research 2 study area and data 2 1 study area brazil fig 1 a has the world s largest river in terms of volume of water the amazon river because of the abundant water resources the per capita water availability of brazilians is far greater than the global average despite this due to the extremely uneven distribution of water resources some citizens still suffer from extreme water shortages and even droughts cunha et al 2018 particularly in northeastern brazil brazil experiences relatively little temperature variation throughout each year fig 1 c with the majority of rainfall concentrated in the rainy season from january to march fig 1 b further drought diagnosis is required because these unique climates and landscapes amplify the occurrence of complex extreme events fortunately brazil is a great experimental site because gnss data exhibit apparent seasonal behavior and a high signal to noise ratio in brazil gnss is currently being used for uni scale drought monitoring we therefore further develop a multi scale hydrological drought index on the basis of the previous study i e jiang et al 2022a to provide new insights into brazil s hydrological droughts 2 2 data 2 2 1 meteorological data we collect the monthly precipitation units millimeters per month and temperature units degrees celsius data for the period 2010 2021 from the climatic research unit cru these data are gridded time series of version 4 06 i e cru ts 4 06 which cover the global land surface excluding antarctica after collecting global observations products are generated by implementing an interpolation method called angular distance weighting and gridded to a 0 5 regular grid harris et al 2020 this data set has been demonstrated to be more robust at large spatial scales than other similar data sets and has been widely applied to calculate spi and spei morsy et al 2022 dikshit et al 2021 tirivarombo et al 2018 in our study the monthly precipitation and temperature time series for four basins are calculated based on an area weighted scheme 2 2 2 gnss position time series we collect the time series products of gnss station coordinates that have been linked to the international gnss service 2014 igs14 geodetic reference frame from the nevada geodetic laboratory ngl blewitt et al 2018 these time series were produced using the daily repro3 0 products and the software gipsy x 1 0 developed by jpl the processing strategy for gnss data is available at http geodesy unr edu gps ngl acn txt the coordinates and time span of 104 stations we select in brazil fig 1 a can be viewed in table s1 jiang et al 2022a to obtain displacement signals that mainly contain hydrological loading effects the following strategy is applied to deduct other non hydrological factors a non tidal oceanic and atmospheric loading effects are corrected using the gfz products dill and dobslaw 2013 b according to least square regression the residual displacement time series are modeled to a velocity caused by secular tectonic motion and glacial isostatic adjustment annual and semi annual terms and step terms when and where needed text s1 and c gnss missing data interpolation software gmis liu et al 2018 a dynamic time space interpolation method using kriging kalman filter is implemented to fill missing data from 2010 to 2021 at each site to ensure a continuous time series the spatial distribution of the annual amplitude of hydrological loading displacement is shown in fig s1 the result shows significant annual amplitudes in the amazon basin of up to 30 mm and subtle annual amplitudes in southern and eastern brazil of less than 10 mm 2 2 3 grace data the grace solutions are used to validate the gnss inferred twsc we collect the rl06 level 2 sh solutions released by the center for space research csr and choose the data from january 2010 to december 2021 the processing covers the following steps a the mean field of the data is first removed b the c20 term is corrected by satellite laser ranging slr measurements sun et al 2016 swenson et al 2008 and the degree 1 geocentric term is added using a combination of grace ocean and model output loomis et al 2020 and c a widely accepted combined filtering strategy 350 km gaussian filtering and decorrelation filtering chen et al 2007 is used to reduce high degree noise and remove the correlated errors we obtain the twsc in form of equivalent water height ewh the resultant twsc is weighted by area and detrended to produce the regional water storage change time series note that we use cubic spline interpolation to fill in the short term 1 2 months missing data the 11 month data gap between grace and grace fo missions july 2017 to may 2018 is not processed 3 methods 3 1 calculations of spi and spei spi and spei are calculated since they can provide information about meteorological anomalies and help to understand the mechanism of drought propagation in our study these two probability based indices are generated employing the same standardization process but spei differs from spi in its input variable and fitting function as for the spei a three parameter log logistic probability density function pdf is utilized to fit samples e g observations for a certain month each year from input data we estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet based on the thornthwaite method overall the spei calculation steps can be summarized as follows 1 d s i p m i pet m i g y s i y g d s i d t spei s i φ 1 g y s i where p is precipitation and d is the difference between p and pet g is the log logistic function and g denotes the cumulative distribution function cdf of g an appropriate fitting function is critical for calculating spi due to the distribution of precipitation is not a normal distribution but a skewed distribution several pdfs particularly gamma pdf and pearson iii pdf have been applied to fit the input variable in previous studies we choose the pearson type iii based spi because of the stronger consistency with spei fig s2 it is likely the gamma based spi overestimates the severe droughts in brazilian hydrological conditions we adopt the procedures to obtain spi as follows 2 f x s i x f t s i d t spi s i φ 1 f x s i where t s i represents the precipitation data for the s th epoch with an i month time scale f is the pearson iii pdf and f is the corresponding cdf 3 2 generation strategy of mgdi 3 2 1 gnss inversion theory geophysical signals covering the entire planet can be described using conventional spherical harmonics as basic functions just like the monthly grace gravity fields however these basic functions cannot be used to analyze locally distributed non global data the slepian function method can construct a set of band limited basis functions that are orthogonal both globally and in the region of interest harig and simons 2012 applying the slepian basis the local geophysical signal can be expressed as follows 3 σ θ λ t a α 1 l 1 2 c α t g α θ λ where σ θ λ t is the geophysical signal in a specific space and time and a is the radius of the earth l denotes the maximum degree and l 1 2 orthonormal basis functions will be constructed when it is determined the slepian basis function of the α th item is represented by g α θ λ and the corresponding slepian coefficient is c α t for each epoch s signal field we can reconstruct it with the linear combination of the slepian basis the construction of the slepian basis is detailed in text s2 the process of estimating twsc based on the slepian basis consists of three key steps as follows 1 constructing slepian basis we directly use the software for the sphere analysis from simons laboratories harig et al 2015 and calculate the slepian basis functions with a bandwidth l 40 the spatial distribution of each basis function is exhibited in fig s3 we employ the same strategy as jiang et al 2022a and select the first forty two basis functions the energy concentration of each basis function is higher than 0 3 and the overall energy proportion is 94 fig s4 2 solving the slepian displacement coefficients we then use the gnss based hydrological loading displacement and 42 basis functions to solve the slepian displacement coefficients by performing the least squares method as follows 4 v θ λ t d n a u t d j g θ λ j n where d n j stand for the number of epochs stations and chosen basis functions respectively v θ λ t d n denotes displacement signals at discrete gnss stations the solved slepian displacement coefficient is denoted by u t d j and the matrix of slepian basis functions is represented by g θ λ j n 3 transforming the slepian coefficients according to the mass loading theory of the solid earth farrell 1972 the following equation illustrates the transformation relationship between the slepian twsc coefficient and the slepian displacement coefficient in the local spectral domain 5 s β t α 1 j u α t l 1 l m l l ρ e 3 ρ w 2 l 1 h l g α l m g β l m where s β t denotes the slepian twsc coefficient ρ e ρ w h l represent the earth s average density 5517 k g m 3 water density 1000 k g m 3 and l th degree vertical load love numbers wang et al 2012 respectively eventually the calculated slepian twsc coefficients are transformed into the space domain using the slepian basis functions eq 3 to obtain the twsc in the study area with a 1 1 regular grid 3 2 2 mgdi from gnss derived twsc we compare normal general extreme value gev logistic and gamma based mgdi to choose an optimal fitting function applied to gnss twsc in addition to the normal based mgdi results based on other distributions may be unstable fig s5 given that the population mean and variance are unknown we then implement the lilliefors method lilliefors 1967 to carry out a normal distribution based goodness of fit test for gnss twsc the test result indicates each sample is significant at the 95 confidence level table s2 demonstrating that the data are suitable for fitting with a normal distribution we develop the gnss derived twsc as a multi scale drought index using the same standardization process as spi and spei first the normal distribution function must be used to fit the twsc data for different scales the procedure is described as follows 6 y twsc s i 1 σ 2 π e twsc s i μ 2 2 σ 2 where twsc s i is gnss twsc of the s th epoch with the i month time scale μ and σ denote the mean and standard deviation which are resolved by the l moment method vogel and fennessey 1993 we calculate the cdf of y and convert it into standard normal distribution equations 7 and 8 represent these two steps respectively 7 y twsc s i twsc s i y twsc s i d t 8 mgdi s i φ 1 y twsc s i the previous definition of hydrological drought is generally only related to surface and subsurface water resources fortunately mgdi is constructed by twsc which integrates all water components and is able to characterize drought more comprehensively to be a reference we also compute the sti cui et al 2021 following the procedures outlined above because continuous data is required to calculate sti the 11 month data gap is replaced by normal climatological values we replace the raw gnss twsc time series from july 2017 to may 2018 with climatological values to demonstrate that the replacement operation impacts little on the sti value as shown in fig s6 stis calculated before and after replacement are generally consistent minor discrepancies can be found near the replaced period following the grading criteria which are widely applied in meteorology and hydrology mahmoudi et al 2021 mckee et al 1993 zarei et al 2021 fig s7 the sti spi spei and our proposed mgdi are classified into 9 categories to characterize different dry and wet levels which are extreme wet 2 or greater severe wet 1 5 2 moderate wet 1 1 5 slight wet 0 5 1 near normal 0 5 0 5 slight drought 1 0 5 moderate drought 1 5 1 severe drought 2 1 5 and extreme drought 2 or less 4 results the spatiotemporal patterns of twsc in brazil are first investigated we then compare the temporal changes of the proposed mgdi and other indicators spi spei and sti and reveal the spatial characteristics of the drought frequencies at different time scales finally to portray the evolution of the severe hydrological drought event that occurred in 2015 2016 we image monthly snapshots using mgdi 3 and spi 12 4 1 twsc in brazil investigating the spatiotemporal changes in terrestrial water storage can provide critical insights for drought diagnosis hence we use water mass changes inferred from grace and gnss to assess the temporal and spatial characteristics of twsc in brazil the spatial distribution of annual amplitude derived from gnss twsc fig 2 a is consistent with grace twsc fig 2 b both indicate dramatic annual changes in the amazon basin and subtle annual changes in the coastal area from the amazon basin to the east and south the magnitude of twsc annual variation gradually decreases with values decreasing from a maximum of 522 mm gnss ewh and 530 mm grace ewh to a minimum of 0 mm in the amazon basin abundant precipitation and numerous tributaries likely provide conditions for the storage of terrestrial water feng 2018 reported that the significant twsc in the amazon basin is mainly attributed to surface water in contrast the climate landscape and human intervention in eastern and southern brazil appear to be unfavorable for the storage of water mass we select a site in each region fig 2 to examine the time varying characteristics of twsc fig 3 the gnss inferred twsc time series is resampled to monthly variations for comparison with grace twsc the consistency of the twsc time series estimated by gnss and grace at four sites mabs naus mgub and cuib is strong both gnss twsc and grace twsc exhibit significant seasonal characteristics illustrating that most regions of brazil experienced periodic twsc these seasonal water mass fluctuations underlie the investigation of extreme or anomalous hydrological events in other words we can use deviations from multi year averages i e climatological values to identify anomalous events two important features including annual amplitude and phase are investigated the naus in the amazon basin has the largest annual amplitude about 800 mm followed by cuib about 400 mm in the central west mabs about 300 mm in the northeast and mgub about 200 mm in the southeast seasonal changes in scch located in the south can hardly be detected in addition to the discrepancies in annual amplitudes the time of peak twsc i e annual phase is different for example the time for peak twsc at naus lags behind mgub overall hydrological characteristics are likely to be inconsistent across different regions despite this these time varying features help to identify anomalous events when twsc is below or above average seasonal variation for example the 2016 water deficit at the naus is probably crucial for spotting drought 4 2 spatiotemporal variations of mgdi after converting previously analyzed water mass variation products into corresponding dryness indices we assess the spatiotemporal variations of mgdi sti spi and spei in four major river basins namely the amazon basin parana basin tocantins basin and são francisco basin over various timescales comparisons of indices show consistent trends but different details across basins and time scales fig 4 spi and spei show good consistency but with a few minor discrepancies that were primarily attributed to pet there are differences between the two hydrological drought indices mgdi and sti as well because twscs are numerically distinct nevertheless more inconsistencies have been found between the hydrological drought indicators and the meteorological drought indicators i e spi and spei the primary explanation is the frequent changes in meteorological conditions such as precipitation in other words meteorological fluxes are more sensitive to the occurrence of drought events than hydrological fluxes typically only a sustained decrease in precipitation can lead to water storage deficits that is the occurrence of hydrological drought lags behind meteorological flux deficits these lags are associated with the intricate dynamic processes involved in water storage and transport hsu et al 2020 we evaluate drought events that occurred in four watersheds between 2010 and 2021 using the monthly scale drought indices here we determine drought if the dsi is less than 0 5 and the duration exceeds three months liu et al 2020 in the amazon basin fig 4 a the 2010 drought on record is successfully identified mgdi is lower than normal until september 2011 whereas this drought event is not detected by two meteorological drought indices from 2015 to 2016 spi and spei detected a severe drought in june 2015 and dropped to the lowest about 2 0 in september by contrast sti and mgdi observed hydrological dominated dryness in september 2015 and had a peak deficit about 2 0 in january 2016 the well known el niño phenomenon that occurred during this period provided dry and hot conditions jimenez munoz et al 2016 yang et al 2018 we also monitor a drought in the amazon basin that lasted for 14 months january 2020 to february 2021 although spi and spei showed abundant precipitation especially june 2020 during this period three droughts hit the parana basin fig 4 b in 2010 2014 2015 and 2020 2021 but neither the spi nor spei indicated persistent deficits during these droughts meteorological oscillations occurred frequently especially in the 2014 2015 drought except for a short term drought in 2010 the tocantins basin fig 4 c experienced the longest drought which lasted 36 months from december 2014 to december 2017 similar droughts affected the são francisco basin fig 4 d but the long term drought began in april 2016 and lasted until december 2017 longer scale drought indices can offer critical insights when we do not concentrate on short term droughts for example we discuss in section 5 3 the relationship between hydrological droughts on long time scales and enso events in the amazon basin with the increasing time scale the temporal variations of these indices are delayed and smoothed as shown in fig 4 the longer scale indices illustrate that drought occurs fewer in number but longer in duration we display the correlations on all grids in fig s8 which reveals stronger correlations on longer scales particularly the 36 month scale however note that these longer scale indicators are generally applied to investigate results with longer time spans defining drought frequency as the proportion of months with an index of less than 0 5 potop and možný 2011 we exhibit the spatial distributions of drought frequency grid by grid derived from mgdi spi and spei in fig 5 here we do not consider sti in this comparison because the replacement related to data gap can lead to statistical bias drought frequencies from various dsi data sets have different spatial patterns on the 1 month scale the semi arid northeast and near the parana basin are likely to experience multiple droughts according to the mgdi estimated maximum drought frequency of 0 38 about 55 months on a longer scale the frequency of droughts in the rest of brazil has decreased significantly but high frequency droughts still occur in the northeast and parana basins fig 5 d and g however these signals are not well recorded by the spi and spei in contrast to the mgdi the monthly scale spi shows that droughts occur most frequently in southeast brazil and tributaries of the upper amazon river and much less frequently in central western and northeastern brazil fig 5 b spei estimates a higher frequency of droughts than the mgdi and spi especially in the south and southeast fig 5 c f and i these discrepancies are mainly attributed to the sensitivity to drought although the same drought event can be monitored various indicators differ in characterizing drought e g duration and severity it is well documented that droughts recurrently hit northeast brazil cunha et al 2019 mgdi discovers evidence of reasonably high frequency hydrological drought in the northeast demonstrating that mgdi enables us to monitor hydrological drought robustly 4 3 spatiotemporal evolution of hydrological drought event in 2015 2016 the 2015 2016 drought event was reported in many previous studies e g cunha et al 2019 erfanian et al 2017 jiang et al 2022a jiménez muñoz et al 2016 junqueira et al 2020 yang et al 2018 hence we focus on the evolution of this drought event given the consistency between mgdi and spi on the multiscale table s3 we choose mgdi 3 3 month mgdi and spi 12 12 month spi to illustrate the evolution of this drought as shown in fig 6 continuous monthly snapshots show the complete progression of this drought the mgdi 3 based drought snapshots can be divided into three stages including the first stage from october 2015 to december 2015 the second stage from january to march 2016 and the third stage from march 2016 to july 2016 the mgdi 3 indicates that a drought occurred in october 2015 near the parana basin with a drought index close to about 1 2 meanwhile a few tributaries of the upper amazon river were experiencing severe drought index close to 1 6 due to the persistently high temperatures the drought crept from the south to the northeast from october to december affecting all areas except northern brazil we speculate that the drought was in recovery from january to march 2016 since the drought coverage decreased due to the abundant precipitation during this period fig 1 b especially in the tocantins and são francisco basin fig 4 c and d the drought expanded to the northeast once again after march and it had become an extreme drought index below 2 0 in may the drought covered regions that spi 12 identifies are similar to those of mgdi 3 in most months spi 12 shows finer spatial variation which might be attributed to the high spatial resolution of precipitation data slepian based inversion scheme is typically applied to the continental or watershed scales han and razeghi 2017 jiang et al 2021a whereas it is not sensitive to monitoring local droughts in regions with sparse sites however spi 12 shows poor time continuity from december 2015 to january 2016 this could be caused by the coarse resolution and accuracy of precipitation data overall mgdi 3 can stably reflect hydrological conditions after meteorological changes 5 discussion 5 1 influencing factors on mgdi value there are three factors that contribute to mgdi bias 1 the hydrological loading signal extracted from gnss 2 the inversion model and 3 the process for generating mgdi therefore it is difficult to directly quantify mgdi s uncertainty here we consider the errors caused by the model and standardization strategy because we focus on the accuracy of mgdi and the difference between mgdi and gnss dsi to evaluate the impact of the model on mgdi estimates we employ grace twsc as simulated data to examine the difference between the mgdis using and not using this model the flow of the synthesis experiment is shown in fig s9 we choose grace twsc from january 2010 to june 2017 to isolate the impact caused by the interpolation synthetic mgdi and model estimated mgdi are shown in fig 7 results of the simulation experiment show the weakest difference in the amazon basin fig 7 a c with root mean square errors rmse of less than 0 1 in contrast forecasts for the parana basin fig 7 d f underestimate the 2010 drought and overestimate the 2013 drought and there are distinctions in the overall this may be attributed to the sparse station coverage and subtle water storage fluctuations in this watershed fewer sites are generally required because slepian method is excellent for extracting common spatial patterns nevertheless more bias will be caused to the results for areas with less station coverage for the other two basins fig 7 g l the forecast results are consistent well with the synthetic index indicating that our model influents less on drought detection especially in the amazon basin tocantins basin and são francisco basin we contrast multi scale mgdi 1 and uni scale gnss dsi in four watersheds to clarify the distinction between them and assess the influence of standardization strategy note that gnss dsi is defined as the standardized twsc anomalies jiang et al 2022a gnss d s i m n t w s c m n tws c n σ n where twsc m n denotes the twsc in the n th month of m th year twsc n and σ n are the average and standard deviation of n th month in all years respectively as shown in fig 8 these indices are highly consistent in the four watersheds with rmse ranging from 0 11 to 0 19 assuming that twsc follows a normal distribution the two standardization approaches are equivalent mathematically the main contributions to their discrepancies are the mean u and standard deviation σ mgdi uses u and σ of the population derived from parameter estimation whereas gnss dsi uses u and σ of the sample in addition to being less accurate than mgdi another limitation is that the standardization approach of gnss dsi cannot be used to standardize data that follows another distribution the mgdi generation process provides users access to data that follows any distribution which can serve as a multi scale hydrological drought characterization framework note that the generation of mgdi is affected by the distribution function and data length in addition to the distribution functions discussed in section 3 2 2 record length can also be crucial in the standardization process joint inversion of twsc or fusing grace and gnss based dsi will be included in our future work to reduce the bias caused by data length 5 2 investigation of drought propagation it is widely acknowledged that there are complicated propagation mechanisms from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts das et al 2022 ma et al 2019 wu et al 2018 previous studies have discussed how various available water resources respond to different time scales of drought indices e g vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 to investigate the linear propagation or response time between meteorological and hydrological droughts some scholars used the monthly standardized streamflow index ssi and multi scale spi for correlation analysis e g barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 ma et al 2019 motivated by this we use mgdi 1 to ascertain the propagation of drought in brazil the correlations between mgdi 1 and spi n spi at the n month scale in different watersheds are shown in fig 9 spi 14 in the amazon basin spi 6 in the parana basin spi 11 in the tocantins basin and spi 13 in the são francisco basin correlate best with mgdi 1 cc 0 63 0 55 0 74 and 0 75 respectively these timescales longer than 6 months are close to the scale considered to be related to hydrological drought indicators by vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts is likely associated with catchment characteristics as evidenced by different scales in different watersheds in addition spi has lower correlations with mgdi 1 on a short time scale 6 months typically spis on these short scales reflect near real time meteorological droughts or preliminary accumulated agricultural droughts these ccs are reasonable according to the difference between spi and mgdi meteorological drought is driven by atmospheric circulation and the nature of the underlying surface while hydrological drought is also affected by human activities and is more complex the multi scale advantage of spi cannot fully compensate for the complex dynamic processes that lead to hydrological drought such as nonlinear propagation in contrast mgdi integrates all hydrological components and takes into account the impact of human intervention which can reflect the hydrological anomalies more comprehensively we use the spi at optimal time scales for collaborative monitoring to further validate mgdi s ability to track hydrological drought robustly the results of drought monitoring in four watersheds using mgdi 1 and spi n n ranges from 1 to 36 months are shown in fig 10 spi 14 suggests that a super long drought hit the amazon basin from may 2015 to august 2018 but results based on gnss vcd barely show the drought in 2015 ferreira et al 2018 a recent study reported by jiang et al 2022a identified this drought event from november 2015 to november 2016 the evidence only supports the result mgdi 1 observed in the parana basin except for the drought that was only monitored by mgdi 1 from august 2014 to april 2015 most results inferred from spi 6 are in agreement with mgdi 1 there is evidence that the drought that occurred in 2014 manifested as deficits in soil storage and reservoir storage melo et al 2016 in the tocantins basin and são francisco basin mgdi 1 and spi revealed similar results apart from some short term droughts note that a hydrological drought indicator cannot be derived from the multiscale spi which only provides accumulated meteorological precipitation deficits at a specific scale the inconsistent monitoring results occur in several watersheds for example only meteorological drought but no hydrological drought occurred in tocantins basin from march 2021 to november 2021 the opposite behavior happened in são francisco basin from november 2019 to february 2020 these are likely associated with the non linear propagation caused by human intervention wu et al 2017 and changing environments in addition we collect the well documented historical drought events spanning 2010 2021 taken from some references table s4 which further demonstrate the suitability of the mgdi for drought monitoring in brazil 5 3 relationship between hydrological droughts and enso events in the amazon basin it is well known that extreme events in the amazon basin are modulated by enso according to previous reports santoso et al 2017 recurring every 2 7 years is the typical frequency of enso this means that its association with mgdi may only be significant on certain timescales the niño3 4 index tracks the average sea surface temperature sst anomalies in a specific ocean area 5 s 5 n 170 w 120 w which is widely used to characterize enso hence we apply the niño3 4 index and multiscale mgdi to reveal the relationship between drought events and enso fig 11 a shows the correlations between mgdi at different scales and the niño3 4 index mgdi is strongly correlated with niño3 4 when the time scale ranges from 18 months to 36 months with the cc exceeding 0 60 the strongest correlation between mgdi and niño3 4 is approximately 0 68 corresponding to a timescale of 27 month as shown in fig 11 b the time varying mgdi 27 is consistent well with niño3 4 note that enso could be negatively or positively correlated with drought during 2015 2016 the main reason for the resultant positive correlation may be that short term droughts are smoothed on a long scale we find a strong linear relationship between long scale mgdi and niño3 4 whereas enso is not significantly associated with hydrological drought indicators on short time scales e g gnss dsi recent advances have shown that gnss can record both short term meteorological anomalies e g rainstorms heki and arief 2022 and long term climate related variations white et al 2022 however this emerging twsc monitoring tool is rarely employed in investigating long scale phenomena our findings provide new perspective for using gnss to investigate other macroscale events such as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo that modulate water flux overall mgdi broadens the applications of gnss in the hydro geodesy field 6 conclusion we focus on proposing a multi scale hydrological drought index named mgdi to systematically analyze the hydrological drought in brazil the comparison of temporal and spatial variation shows that mgdi can more robustly characterize brazil s hydrological drought mgdi reveals a potential risk of hydrological drought in northeastern brazil and regions near the parana basin crucially mgdi can also provide drought results on longer timescales the evolution of droughts derived from mgdi shows good temporal continuity providing an opportunity for the investigation of the spatiotemporal evolution of hydrological drought both short and long scale mgdi are effectively applied basin based investigation of drought propagation demonstrates that the response time from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts is different in each watershed the drought propagation times in the four watersheds are 14 months 6 months 11 months and 13 months which can provide constraints on hydrodynamic processes in our study mgdi is applied to investigate the relationship between multiscale hydrological drought and enso events and we find a strong correlation between mgdi and enso on the scales of 1 5 3 years these findings help to robustly monitor and comprehensively understand hydrological drought in brazil and

2389,drought severity is not only related to drought intensity but also depends on drought duration to accurately characterize short and long term droughts and comprehend drought propagation mechanisms it is essential to ascertain the multiscale features of drought extremes here we estimate terrestrial water storage changes twsc using global navigation satellite system gnss vertical crustal displacement and then develop a novel multiscale gnss based drought index mgdi to characterize hydrological droughts in brazil from 2010 to 2021 mgdi is a probability based drought index and we employ a normal distribution to fit the twsc result the comparisons of temporal variations indicate that the mgdi is similar to other multiscale drought indices i e standardized precipitation index spi standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and standardized terrestrial water storage index sti at different time scales due to the longer response time to meteorological variables hydrological drought indicators i e mgdi and sti generally lag behind meteorological drought indicators i e spi and spei but with less noise on the short scale the spatial distribution of mgdi derived drought frequency reveals that hydrological droughts are most frequent in northeastern brazil and near the parana river basin with a frequency of up to 0 38 about 55 months on the 1 month scale the spatiotemporal evolutions of the 2015 2016 drought event imaged by 3 month mgdi and 12 month spi are generally consistent and 3 month mgdi shows good temporal continuity of evolution investigation of drought propagation in various basins shows that 1 month mgdi correlates well with spi on the specific time scales e g 6 month 11 month 13 month and 14 month with all correlation coefficients above 0 55 in the amazon basin we also find that mgdi on the 1 5 3 years scale is strongly correlated with el niño southern oscillation enso events suggesting hydrological droughts are likely to be modulated by enso our findings imply that mgdi can characterize hydrological deficits more comprehensively and offer some critical insights for multiscale drought research keywords multiscale gnss terrestrial water storage changes drought severity index hydrological drought 1 introduction drought is a highly destructive natural hazard which appears more frequently due to exacerbated climate change and intensive human activities gloor et al 2013 he et al 2020 mishra and singh 2010 mukherjee et al 2018 the occurrence of drought negatively affects ecological maintenance agricultural development and industrial construction in recent years severe droughts in south africa gerdener et al 2020 india satish kumar et al 2021 sinha et al 2019 syed et al 2017 america borsa et al 2014 jiang et al 2022b jin and zhang 2016 china wang et al 2021 wu et al 2020 xu et al 2015 europe li et al 2012 and australia zhao et al 2017a yang et al 2021 highlight their destructiveness and regional vulnerability therefore accurate quantification of drought characteristics is an urgent need for stakeholders for drought monitoring assessment and prevention jiang et al 2022b the drought severity index dsi is a numerical representation of meteorological and hydrological extremes most traditional dsis are proposed based on hydrological and meteorological variables observed by meteorological stations or remote sensing satellites e g kim et al 2018 several popular drought indices have made significant strides in monitoring and assessing drought episodes such as the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardized precipitation temperature index spti ali et al 2017 surface water supply index swsi shafer and dezman 1982 standardized runoff index sri shukla and wood 2008 and standardized groundwater index sgi marchant and bloomfield 2018 in particular spi can characterize short lived meteorological anomalies one month as well as other long term hydrological changes six months or longer because of different responses of the various water components to precipitation deficits vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 however drought indicators developed by one or more types of hydrological or meteorological components are insufficient to completely track drought sparse ground observations cannot reflect the spatial characteristics of global or continental scale drought and conventional satellite measured data also cannot capture the complete hydrological components especially deep groundwater anthropogenic effects e g dam and reservoir operations on the water cycle are hard to be quantified lópez moreno et al 2009 which has been deemed a challenge van loon 2015 hence the establishment of drought indicators that integrate more variables e g deep groundwater and human interventions is necessary gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace follow on grace fo have been demonstrated to be independent tools for monitoring total water storage changes on a global scale and have made progress in large scale hydrological drought monitoring feng 2018 sun et al 2018 tapley et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 a number of academics have developed drought indicators to determine dryness or wetness solely or jointly using grace derived twsc for example several indices including the water storage deficit index wsdi deng et al 2021 syed et al 2017 and grace dsi zhao et al 2017b are solely produced by grace twsc on the other hand due to the lack of deep groundwater observations thomas et al 2017 presented the grace groundwater drought index ggdi to quantify groundwater deficits in the california central valley using hydrological components from other agencies and grace derived total water storage anomalies sinha et al 2019 devised a novel drought index named the combined climatologic deviation index ccdi combining grace derived terrestrial water storage with meteorological precipitation to assess drought except for the above uni scale drought indicators cui et al 2021 developed the grace obtained result into a multi scale drought index called the standardized tws index sti nevertheless regional and global scale drought episodes are more readily captured since grace missions provide results at a coarse spatial scale approximately 350 km e g wahr et al 2004 the 11 month data gap between the grace and grace fo missions prevents the capture of drought events such as the drought that occurred in australia from april 2018 to july 2019 boergens et al 2020 yang et al 2021 degradation of data quality during the late grace mission also affects drought assessment overall these unfavorable factors may bias the drought quantification continuous gnss stations can record elastic crustal deformation caused by hydrological mass variation in the form of displacement time series argus et al 2014 some academics used displacement data to directly characterize droughts for instance vertical crustal displacement vcd was employed by jiang et al 2017 to diagnose the hydrological droughts in yunnan china to examine the crustal responses to drought episodes in various brazilian regions ferreira et al 2018 constructed a gps based vcd drought index divcd jiang et al 2022b converted discrete site displacement data into regional displacement fields using a time varying gnss imaging strategy and then assessed droughts following the same inversion methodology as argus et al 2014 many scholars inverted gnss measured vcd into regional twsc borsa et al 2014 enzminger et al 2018 fu et al 2015 in addition jiang et al 2022a utilized a spectral domain inversion approach to estimate twsc and developed the result into a new drought index known as gnss dsi since gnss derived twsc can overcome some shortcomings of grace derived twsc gnss has been suggested as a complementary tool for drought monitoring jiang et al 2021b the above mentioned gnss derived drought indices are typically based on uni scale but few studies use gnss to investigate hydrological drought at various scales it is critical to address the multiscale issue because droughts generally need to be effectively characterized on a specific time scale vicente serrano et al 2010 in other words the multiscale drought index can provide a perspective for the monitoring of long term droughts when users do not pay attention to short term droughts like the grace related drought indices our proposed multiscale gnss based drought index mgdi integrates deficits of all hydrological components for a more comprehensive characterization of hydrological drought mgdi can be compared and verified against grace based dsi and provides more advantages in temporal and spatial resolution data continuity etc developing mgdi allows us to better clarify drought propagation ma et al 2019 wu et al 2020 and investigate links with climate events e g enso in addition combining the existing multiscale drought indicators e g spi and sri etc will probably help to fully understand drought characteristics this study is the first attempt to use gnss to characterize multiscale hydrological droughts we expect that geodetic techniques such as gnss and grace can play more important roles in the hydrological community in this study we aim to develop a novel multiscale gnss based drought index referred to as mgdi and systematically investigate the hydrological drought in brazil to illustrate the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of water changes in brazil and validate gnss estimated twsc we first compare these two water products derived from gnss and grace our main work includes a investigating the temporal variations of mgdi and other indices in four major basins and analyzing the spatial distribution of drought frequencies derived from various dsi data sets b looking into the spatiotemporal evolution of a drought event that occurred in 2015 2016 c clarifying the drought propagation in four major watersheds and d exploring the intrinsic link between long term hydrological droughts and enso events our result can provide a scientific basis for drought assessment in brazil and a new perspective for multi scale drought research 2 study area and data 2 1 study area brazil fig 1 a has the world s largest river in terms of volume of water the amazon river because of the abundant water resources the per capita water availability of brazilians is far greater than the global average despite this due to the extremely uneven distribution of water resources some citizens still suffer from extreme water shortages and even droughts cunha et al 2018 particularly in northeastern brazil brazil experiences relatively little temperature variation throughout each year fig 1 c with the majority of rainfall concentrated in the rainy season from january to march fig 1 b further drought diagnosis is required because these unique climates and landscapes amplify the occurrence of complex extreme events fortunately brazil is a great experimental site because gnss data exhibit apparent seasonal behavior and a high signal to noise ratio in brazil gnss is currently being used for uni scale drought monitoring we therefore further develop a multi scale hydrological drought index on the basis of the previous study i e jiang et al 2022a to provide new insights into brazil s hydrological droughts 2 2 data 2 2 1 meteorological data we collect the monthly precipitation units millimeters per month and temperature units degrees celsius data for the period 2010 2021 from the climatic research unit cru these data are gridded time series of version 4 06 i e cru ts 4 06 which cover the global land surface excluding antarctica after collecting global observations products are generated by implementing an interpolation method called angular distance weighting and gridded to a 0 5 regular grid harris et al 2020 this data set has been demonstrated to be more robust at large spatial scales than other similar data sets and has been widely applied to calculate spi and spei morsy et al 2022 dikshit et al 2021 tirivarombo et al 2018 in our study the monthly precipitation and temperature time series for four basins are calculated based on an area weighted scheme 2 2 2 gnss position time series we collect the time series products of gnss station coordinates that have been linked to the international gnss service 2014 igs14 geodetic reference frame from the nevada geodetic laboratory ngl blewitt et al 2018 these time series were produced using the daily repro3 0 products and the software gipsy x 1 0 developed by jpl the processing strategy for gnss data is available at http geodesy unr edu gps ngl acn txt the coordinates and time span of 104 stations we select in brazil fig 1 a can be viewed in table s1 jiang et al 2022a to obtain displacement signals that mainly contain hydrological loading effects the following strategy is applied to deduct other non hydrological factors a non tidal oceanic and atmospheric loading effects are corrected using the gfz products dill and dobslaw 2013 b according to least square regression the residual displacement time series are modeled to a velocity caused by secular tectonic motion and glacial isostatic adjustment annual and semi annual terms and step terms when and where needed text s1 and c gnss missing data interpolation software gmis liu et al 2018 a dynamic time space interpolation method using kriging kalman filter is implemented to fill missing data from 2010 to 2021 at each site to ensure a continuous time series the spatial distribution of the annual amplitude of hydrological loading displacement is shown in fig s1 the result shows significant annual amplitudes in the amazon basin of up to 30 mm and subtle annual amplitudes in southern and eastern brazil of less than 10 mm 2 2 3 grace data the grace solutions are used to validate the gnss inferred twsc we collect the rl06 level 2 sh solutions released by the center for space research csr and choose the data from january 2010 to december 2021 the processing covers the following steps a the mean field of the data is first removed b the c20 term is corrected by satellite laser ranging slr measurements sun et al 2016 swenson et al 2008 and the degree 1 geocentric term is added using a combination of grace ocean and model output loomis et al 2020 and c a widely accepted combined filtering strategy 350 km gaussian filtering and decorrelation filtering chen et al 2007 is used to reduce high degree noise and remove the correlated errors we obtain the twsc in form of equivalent water height ewh the resultant twsc is weighted by area and detrended to produce the regional water storage change time series note that we use cubic spline interpolation to fill in the short term 1 2 months missing data the 11 month data gap between grace and grace fo missions july 2017 to may 2018 is not processed 3 methods 3 1 calculations of spi and spei spi and spei are calculated since they can provide information about meteorological anomalies and help to understand the mechanism of drought propagation in our study these two probability based indices are generated employing the same standardization process but spei differs from spi in its input variable and fitting function as for the spei a three parameter log logistic probability density function pdf is utilized to fit samples e g observations for a certain month each year from input data we estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet based on the thornthwaite method overall the spei calculation steps can be summarized as follows 1 d s i p m i pet m i g y s i y g d s i d t spei s i φ 1 g y s i where p is precipitation and d is the difference between p and pet g is the log logistic function and g denotes the cumulative distribution function cdf of g an appropriate fitting function is critical for calculating spi due to the distribution of precipitation is not a normal distribution but a skewed distribution several pdfs particularly gamma pdf and pearson iii pdf have been applied to fit the input variable in previous studies we choose the pearson type iii based spi because of the stronger consistency with spei fig s2 it is likely the gamma based spi overestimates the severe droughts in brazilian hydrological conditions we adopt the procedures to obtain spi as follows 2 f x s i x f t s i d t spi s i φ 1 f x s i where t s i represents the precipitation data for the s th epoch with an i month time scale f is the pearson iii pdf and f is the corresponding cdf 3 2 generation strategy of mgdi 3 2 1 gnss inversion theory geophysical signals covering the entire planet can be described using conventional spherical harmonics as basic functions just like the monthly grace gravity fields however these basic functions cannot be used to analyze locally distributed non global data the slepian function method can construct a set of band limited basis functions that are orthogonal both globally and in the region of interest harig and simons 2012 applying the slepian basis the local geophysical signal can be expressed as follows 3 σ θ λ t a α 1 l 1 2 c α t g α θ λ where σ θ λ t is the geophysical signal in a specific space and time and a is the radius of the earth l denotes the maximum degree and l 1 2 orthonormal basis functions will be constructed when it is determined the slepian basis function of the α th item is represented by g α θ λ and the corresponding slepian coefficient is c α t for each epoch s signal field we can reconstruct it with the linear combination of the slepian basis the construction of the slepian basis is detailed in text s2 the process of estimating twsc based on the slepian basis consists of three key steps as follows 1 constructing slepian basis we directly use the software for the sphere analysis from simons laboratories harig et al 2015 and calculate the slepian basis functions with a bandwidth l 40 the spatial distribution of each basis function is exhibited in fig s3 we employ the same strategy as jiang et al 2022a and select the first forty two basis functions the energy concentration of each basis function is higher than 0 3 and the overall energy proportion is 94 fig s4 2 solving the slepian displacement coefficients we then use the gnss based hydrological loading displacement and 42 basis functions to solve the slepian displacement coefficients by performing the least squares method as follows 4 v θ λ t d n a u t d j g θ λ j n where d n j stand for the number of epochs stations and chosen basis functions respectively v θ λ t d n denotes displacement signals at discrete gnss stations the solved slepian displacement coefficient is denoted by u t d j and the matrix of slepian basis functions is represented by g θ λ j n 3 transforming the slepian coefficients according to the mass loading theory of the solid earth farrell 1972 the following equation illustrates the transformation relationship between the slepian twsc coefficient and the slepian displacement coefficient in the local spectral domain 5 s β t α 1 j u α t l 1 l m l l ρ e 3 ρ w 2 l 1 h l g α l m g β l m where s β t denotes the slepian twsc coefficient ρ e ρ w h l represent the earth s average density 5517 k g m 3 water density 1000 k g m 3 and l th degree vertical load love numbers wang et al 2012 respectively eventually the calculated slepian twsc coefficients are transformed into the space domain using the slepian basis functions eq 3 to obtain the twsc in the study area with a 1 1 regular grid 3 2 2 mgdi from gnss derived twsc we compare normal general extreme value gev logistic and gamma based mgdi to choose an optimal fitting function applied to gnss twsc in addition to the normal based mgdi results based on other distributions may be unstable fig s5 given that the population mean and variance are unknown we then implement the lilliefors method lilliefors 1967 to carry out a normal distribution based goodness of fit test for gnss twsc the test result indicates each sample is significant at the 95 confidence level table s2 demonstrating that the data are suitable for fitting with a normal distribution we develop the gnss derived twsc as a multi scale drought index using the same standardization process as spi and spei first the normal distribution function must be used to fit the twsc data for different scales the procedure is described as follows 6 y twsc s i 1 σ 2 π e twsc s i μ 2 2 σ 2 where twsc s i is gnss twsc of the s th epoch with the i month time scale μ and σ denote the mean and standard deviation which are resolved by the l moment method vogel and fennessey 1993 we calculate the cdf of y and convert it into standard normal distribution equations 7 and 8 represent these two steps respectively 7 y twsc s i twsc s i y twsc s i d t 8 mgdi s i φ 1 y twsc s i the previous definition of hydrological drought is generally only related to surface and subsurface water resources fortunately mgdi is constructed by twsc which integrates all water components and is able to characterize drought more comprehensively to be a reference we also compute the sti cui et al 2021 following the procedures outlined above because continuous data is required to calculate sti the 11 month data gap is replaced by normal climatological values we replace the raw gnss twsc time series from july 2017 to may 2018 with climatological values to demonstrate that the replacement operation impacts little on the sti value as shown in fig s6 stis calculated before and after replacement are generally consistent minor discrepancies can be found near the replaced period following the grading criteria which are widely applied in meteorology and hydrology mahmoudi et al 2021 mckee et al 1993 zarei et al 2021 fig s7 the sti spi spei and our proposed mgdi are classified into 9 categories to characterize different dry and wet levels which are extreme wet 2 or greater severe wet 1 5 2 moderate wet 1 1 5 slight wet 0 5 1 near normal 0 5 0 5 slight drought 1 0 5 moderate drought 1 5 1 severe drought 2 1 5 and extreme drought 2 or less 4 results the spatiotemporal patterns of twsc in brazil are first investigated we then compare the temporal changes of the proposed mgdi and other indicators spi spei and sti and reveal the spatial characteristics of the drought frequencies at different time scales finally to portray the evolution of the severe hydrological drought event that occurred in 2015 2016 we image monthly snapshots using mgdi 3 and spi 12 4 1 twsc in brazil investigating the spatiotemporal changes in terrestrial water storage can provide critical insights for drought diagnosis hence we use water mass changes inferred from grace and gnss to assess the temporal and spatial characteristics of twsc in brazil the spatial distribution of annual amplitude derived from gnss twsc fig 2 a is consistent with grace twsc fig 2 b both indicate dramatic annual changes in the amazon basin and subtle annual changes in the coastal area from the amazon basin to the east and south the magnitude of twsc annual variation gradually decreases with values decreasing from a maximum of 522 mm gnss ewh and 530 mm grace ewh to a minimum of 0 mm in the amazon basin abundant precipitation and numerous tributaries likely provide conditions for the storage of terrestrial water feng 2018 reported that the significant twsc in the amazon basin is mainly attributed to surface water in contrast the climate landscape and human intervention in eastern and southern brazil appear to be unfavorable for the storage of water mass we select a site in each region fig 2 to examine the time varying characteristics of twsc fig 3 the gnss inferred twsc time series is resampled to monthly variations for comparison with grace twsc the consistency of the twsc time series estimated by gnss and grace at four sites mabs naus mgub and cuib is strong both gnss twsc and grace twsc exhibit significant seasonal characteristics illustrating that most regions of brazil experienced periodic twsc these seasonal water mass fluctuations underlie the investigation of extreme or anomalous hydrological events in other words we can use deviations from multi year averages i e climatological values to identify anomalous events two important features including annual amplitude and phase are investigated the naus in the amazon basin has the largest annual amplitude about 800 mm followed by cuib about 400 mm in the central west mabs about 300 mm in the northeast and mgub about 200 mm in the southeast seasonal changes in scch located in the south can hardly be detected in addition to the discrepancies in annual amplitudes the time of peak twsc i e annual phase is different for example the time for peak twsc at naus lags behind mgub overall hydrological characteristics are likely to be inconsistent across different regions despite this these time varying features help to identify anomalous events when twsc is below or above average seasonal variation for example the 2016 water deficit at the naus is probably crucial for spotting drought 4 2 spatiotemporal variations of mgdi after converting previously analyzed water mass variation products into corresponding dryness indices we assess the spatiotemporal variations of mgdi sti spi and spei in four major river basins namely the amazon basin parana basin tocantins basin and são francisco basin over various timescales comparisons of indices show consistent trends but different details across basins and time scales fig 4 spi and spei show good consistency but with a few minor discrepancies that were primarily attributed to pet there are differences between the two hydrological drought indices mgdi and sti as well because twscs are numerically distinct nevertheless more inconsistencies have been found between the hydrological drought indicators and the meteorological drought indicators i e spi and spei the primary explanation is the frequent changes in meteorological conditions such as precipitation in other words meteorological fluxes are more sensitive to the occurrence of drought events than hydrological fluxes typically only a sustained decrease in precipitation can lead to water storage deficits that is the occurrence of hydrological drought lags behind meteorological flux deficits these lags are associated with the intricate dynamic processes involved in water storage and transport hsu et al 2020 we evaluate drought events that occurred in four watersheds between 2010 and 2021 using the monthly scale drought indices here we determine drought if the dsi is less than 0 5 and the duration exceeds three months liu et al 2020 in the amazon basin fig 4 a the 2010 drought on record is successfully identified mgdi is lower than normal until september 2011 whereas this drought event is not detected by two meteorological drought indices from 2015 to 2016 spi and spei detected a severe drought in june 2015 and dropped to the lowest about 2 0 in september by contrast sti and mgdi observed hydrological dominated dryness in september 2015 and had a peak deficit about 2 0 in january 2016 the well known el niño phenomenon that occurred during this period provided dry and hot conditions jimenez munoz et al 2016 yang et al 2018 we also monitor a drought in the amazon basin that lasted for 14 months january 2020 to february 2021 although spi and spei showed abundant precipitation especially june 2020 during this period three droughts hit the parana basin fig 4 b in 2010 2014 2015 and 2020 2021 but neither the spi nor spei indicated persistent deficits during these droughts meteorological oscillations occurred frequently especially in the 2014 2015 drought except for a short term drought in 2010 the tocantins basin fig 4 c experienced the longest drought which lasted 36 months from december 2014 to december 2017 similar droughts affected the são francisco basin fig 4 d but the long term drought began in april 2016 and lasted until december 2017 longer scale drought indices can offer critical insights when we do not concentrate on short term droughts for example we discuss in section 5 3 the relationship between hydrological droughts on long time scales and enso events in the amazon basin with the increasing time scale the temporal variations of these indices are delayed and smoothed as shown in fig 4 the longer scale indices illustrate that drought occurs fewer in number but longer in duration we display the correlations on all grids in fig s8 which reveals stronger correlations on longer scales particularly the 36 month scale however note that these longer scale indicators are generally applied to investigate results with longer time spans defining drought frequency as the proportion of months with an index of less than 0 5 potop and možný 2011 we exhibit the spatial distributions of drought frequency grid by grid derived from mgdi spi and spei in fig 5 here we do not consider sti in this comparison because the replacement related to data gap can lead to statistical bias drought frequencies from various dsi data sets have different spatial patterns on the 1 month scale the semi arid northeast and near the parana basin are likely to experience multiple droughts according to the mgdi estimated maximum drought frequency of 0 38 about 55 months on a longer scale the frequency of droughts in the rest of brazil has decreased significantly but high frequency droughts still occur in the northeast and parana basins fig 5 d and g however these signals are not well recorded by the spi and spei in contrast to the mgdi the monthly scale spi shows that droughts occur most frequently in southeast brazil and tributaries of the upper amazon river and much less frequently in central western and northeastern brazil fig 5 b spei estimates a higher frequency of droughts than the mgdi and spi especially in the south and southeast fig 5 c f and i these discrepancies are mainly attributed to the sensitivity to drought although the same drought event can be monitored various indicators differ in characterizing drought e g duration and severity it is well documented that droughts recurrently hit northeast brazil cunha et al 2019 mgdi discovers evidence of reasonably high frequency hydrological drought in the northeast demonstrating that mgdi enables us to monitor hydrological drought robustly 4 3 spatiotemporal evolution of hydrological drought event in 2015 2016 the 2015 2016 drought event was reported in many previous studies e g cunha et al 2019 erfanian et al 2017 jiang et al 2022a jiménez muñoz et al 2016 junqueira et al 2020 yang et al 2018 hence we focus on the evolution of this drought event given the consistency between mgdi and spi on the multiscale table s3 we choose mgdi 3 3 month mgdi and spi 12 12 month spi to illustrate the evolution of this drought as shown in fig 6 continuous monthly snapshots show the complete progression of this drought the mgdi 3 based drought snapshots can be divided into three stages including the first stage from october 2015 to december 2015 the second stage from january to march 2016 and the third stage from march 2016 to july 2016 the mgdi 3 indicates that a drought occurred in october 2015 near the parana basin with a drought index close to about 1 2 meanwhile a few tributaries of the upper amazon river were experiencing severe drought index close to 1 6 due to the persistently high temperatures the drought crept from the south to the northeast from october to december affecting all areas except northern brazil we speculate that the drought was in recovery from january to march 2016 since the drought coverage decreased due to the abundant precipitation during this period fig 1 b especially in the tocantins and são francisco basin fig 4 c and d the drought expanded to the northeast once again after march and it had become an extreme drought index below 2 0 in may the drought covered regions that spi 12 identifies are similar to those of mgdi 3 in most months spi 12 shows finer spatial variation which might be attributed to the high spatial resolution of precipitation data slepian based inversion scheme is typically applied to the continental or watershed scales han and razeghi 2017 jiang et al 2021a whereas it is not sensitive to monitoring local droughts in regions with sparse sites however spi 12 shows poor time continuity from december 2015 to january 2016 this could be caused by the coarse resolution and accuracy of precipitation data overall mgdi 3 can stably reflect hydrological conditions after meteorological changes 5 discussion 5 1 influencing factors on mgdi value there are three factors that contribute to mgdi bias 1 the hydrological loading signal extracted from gnss 2 the inversion model and 3 the process for generating mgdi therefore it is difficult to directly quantify mgdi s uncertainty here we consider the errors caused by the model and standardization strategy because we focus on the accuracy of mgdi and the difference between mgdi and gnss dsi to evaluate the impact of the model on mgdi estimates we employ grace twsc as simulated data to examine the difference between the mgdis using and not using this model the flow of the synthesis experiment is shown in fig s9 we choose grace twsc from january 2010 to june 2017 to isolate the impact caused by the interpolation synthetic mgdi and model estimated mgdi are shown in fig 7 results of the simulation experiment show the weakest difference in the amazon basin fig 7 a c with root mean square errors rmse of less than 0 1 in contrast forecasts for the parana basin fig 7 d f underestimate the 2010 drought and overestimate the 2013 drought and there are distinctions in the overall this may be attributed to the sparse station coverage and subtle water storage fluctuations in this watershed fewer sites are generally required because slepian method is excellent for extracting common spatial patterns nevertheless more bias will be caused to the results for areas with less station coverage for the other two basins fig 7 g l the forecast results are consistent well with the synthetic index indicating that our model influents less on drought detection especially in the amazon basin tocantins basin and são francisco basin we contrast multi scale mgdi 1 and uni scale gnss dsi in four watersheds to clarify the distinction between them and assess the influence of standardization strategy note that gnss dsi is defined as the standardized twsc anomalies jiang et al 2022a gnss d s i m n t w s c m n tws c n σ n where twsc m n denotes the twsc in the n th month of m th year twsc n and σ n are the average and standard deviation of n th month in all years respectively as shown in fig 8 these indices are highly consistent in the four watersheds with rmse ranging from 0 11 to 0 19 assuming that twsc follows a normal distribution the two standardization approaches are equivalent mathematically the main contributions to their discrepancies are the mean u and standard deviation σ mgdi uses u and σ of the population derived from parameter estimation whereas gnss dsi uses u and σ of the sample in addition to being less accurate than mgdi another limitation is that the standardization approach of gnss dsi cannot be used to standardize data that follows another distribution the mgdi generation process provides users access to data that follows any distribution which can serve as a multi scale hydrological drought characterization framework note that the generation of mgdi is affected by the distribution function and data length in addition to the distribution functions discussed in section 3 2 2 record length can also be crucial in the standardization process joint inversion of twsc or fusing grace and gnss based dsi will be included in our future work to reduce the bias caused by data length 5 2 investigation of drought propagation it is widely acknowledged that there are complicated propagation mechanisms from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts das et al 2022 ma et al 2019 wu et al 2018 previous studies have discussed how various available water resources respond to different time scales of drought indices e g vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 to investigate the linear propagation or response time between meteorological and hydrological droughts some scholars used the monthly standardized streamflow index ssi and multi scale spi for correlation analysis e g barker et al 2016 huang et al 2017 ma et al 2019 motivated by this we use mgdi 1 to ascertain the propagation of drought in brazil the correlations between mgdi 1 and spi n spi at the n month scale in different watersheds are shown in fig 9 spi 14 in the amazon basin spi 6 in the parana basin spi 11 in the tocantins basin and spi 13 in the são francisco basin correlate best with mgdi 1 cc 0 63 0 55 0 74 and 0 75 respectively these timescales longer than 6 months are close to the scale considered to be related to hydrological drought indicators by vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 drought propagation from meteorological to hydrological droughts is likely associated with catchment characteristics as evidenced by different scales in different watersheds in addition spi has lower correlations with mgdi 1 on a short time scale 6 months typically spis on these short scales reflect near real time meteorological droughts or preliminary accumulated agricultural droughts these ccs are reasonable according to the difference between spi and mgdi meteorological drought is driven by atmospheric circulation and the nature of the underlying surface while hydrological drought is also affected by human activities and is more complex the multi scale advantage of spi cannot fully compensate for the complex dynamic processes that lead to hydrological drought such as nonlinear propagation in contrast mgdi integrates all hydrological components and takes into account the impact of human intervention which can reflect the hydrological anomalies more comprehensively we use the spi at optimal time scales for collaborative monitoring to further validate mgdi s ability to track hydrological drought robustly the results of drought monitoring in four watersheds using mgdi 1 and spi n n ranges from 1 to 36 months are shown in fig 10 spi 14 suggests that a super long drought hit the amazon basin from may 2015 to august 2018 but results based on gnss vcd barely show the drought in 2015 ferreira et al 2018 a recent study reported by jiang et al 2022a identified this drought event from november 2015 to november 2016 the evidence only supports the result mgdi 1 observed in the parana basin except for the drought that was only monitored by mgdi 1 from august 2014 to april 2015 most results inferred from spi 6 are in agreement with mgdi 1 there is evidence that the drought that occurred in 2014 manifested as deficits in soil storage and reservoir storage melo et al 2016 in the tocantins basin and são francisco basin mgdi 1 and spi revealed similar results apart from some short term droughts note that a hydrological drought indicator cannot be derived from the multiscale spi which only provides accumulated meteorological precipitation deficits at a specific scale the inconsistent monitoring results occur in several watersheds for example only meteorological drought but no hydrological drought occurred in tocantins basin from march 2021 to november 2021 the opposite behavior happened in são francisco basin from november 2019 to february 2020 these are likely associated with the non linear propagation caused by human intervention wu et al 2017 and changing environments in addition we collect the well documented historical drought events spanning 2010 2021 taken from some references table s4 which further demonstrate the suitability of the mgdi for drought monitoring in brazil 5 3 relationship between hydrological droughts and enso events in the amazon basin it is well known that extreme events in the amazon basin are modulated by enso according to previous reports santoso et al 2017 recurring every 2 7 years is the typical frequency of enso this means that its association with mgdi may only be significant on certain timescales the niño3 4 index tracks the average sea surface temperature sst anomalies in a specific ocean area 5 s 5 n 170 w 120 w which is widely used to characterize enso hence we apply the niño3 4 index and multiscale mgdi to reveal the relationship between drought events and enso fig 11 a shows the correlations between mgdi at different scales and the niño3 4 index mgdi is strongly correlated with niño3 4 when the time scale ranges from 18 months to 36 months with the cc exceeding 0 60 the strongest correlation between mgdi and niño3 4 is approximately 0 68 corresponding to a timescale of 27 month as shown in fig 11 b the time varying mgdi 27 is consistent well with niño3 4 note that enso could be negatively or positively correlated with drought during 2015 2016 the main reason for the resultant positive correlation may be that short term droughts are smoothed on a long scale we find a strong linear relationship between long scale mgdi and niño3 4 whereas enso is not significantly associated with hydrological drought indicators on short time scales e g gnss dsi recent advances have shown that gnss can record both short term meteorological anomalies e g rainstorms heki and arief 2022 and long term climate related variations white et al 2022 however this emerging twsc monitoring tool is rarely employed in investigating long scale phenomena our findings provide new perspective for using gnss to investigate other macroscale events such as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo that modulate water flux overall mgdi broadens the applications of gnss in the hydro geodesy field 6 conclusion we focus on proposing a multi scale hydrological drought index named mgdi to systematically analyze the hydrological drought in brazil the comparison of temporal and spatial variation shows that mgdi can more robustly characterize brazil s hydrological drought mgdi reveals a potential risk of hydrological drought in northeastern brazil and regions near the parana basin crucially mgdi can also provide drought results on longer timescales the evolution of droughts derived from mgdi shows good temporal continuity providing an opportunity for the investigation of the spatiotemporal evolution of hydrological drought both short and long scale mgdi are effectively applied basin based investigation of drought propagation demonstrates that the response time from meteorological droughts to hydrological droughts is different in each watershed the drought propagation times in the four watersheds are 14 months 6 months 11 months and 13 months which can provide constraints on hydrodynamic processes in our study mgdi is applied to investigate the relationship between multiscale hydrological drought and enso events and we find a strong correlation between mgdi and enso on the scales of 1 5 3 years these findings help to robustly monitor and comprehensively understand hydrological drought in brazil and
