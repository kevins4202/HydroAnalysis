economic development of a country like india is depends largely on industrialization however large scale industries deteriorate the environment by generating huge amount of toxic wastewater cyanide one of the toxic inorganic pollutants is found in wastewater from steel industries especially from blast furnace effluent in tata steel jamshedpur india 25 m3 of water is used per tonne of steel produced and volume of wastewater is generated at the rate of 5 m3 h the stringent pollution control norms dictate industries for zero discharge plant hence industries are coming forward to provide adequate treatment to the wastewater generated for reuse in the process itself this practice minimizes production of wastewater from the industry and also makes water available for several other applications including cooling water water required for housekeeping or process water due to their toxic effects cyanide containing effluents cannot be discharged directly to the environment according to the central pollution control board of india the permissible limit for cyanide is less than 0 2 mg l for surface discharge various processes are employed to remove free cyanide fcn from effluent streams these include hydrogen peroxide treatment 1 2 micellar enhanced ultrafiltration meuf 3 titanium di oxide catalyst 4 ozonation 5 6 biological treatment 7 9 electro coagulation 10 and use of

which may be discharged safely however this treatment procedure is extremely corrosive recovery of surfactants is an expensive procedure in meuf sulphur dioxide treatment has not been proven to be efficient and biological treatment is a very slow process electro coagulation is an energy intensive process increasing the operating cost in such scenario activated carbon based separation process provides an excellent scalable alternative activated carbon based packed beds may be employed to remove fcn which is an energy efficient non corrosive process it has no side stream generation and has high throughput however commercial activated carbon is relatively expensive compared to steel industry by product coke breeze coke breeze contains sufficient amount of carbon to adsorp fcn thereby

given as 5 e 1 2 b d r the value of e kj mol suggests the process to be a physical adsorption or a chemisorption 2 3 3 thermodynamic study change in gibbs free energy δ g was calculated to assess whether the process was spontaneous or not also the temperature dependency of the process was evaluated by the enthalpy change δ h change in gibbs free energy was calculated as 20 21 6 δ g r t ln k

of 10 mg l were shaken in a flask with 15 g l of coke breeze and shaker speed of 150 rpm for different duration and the residual concentration of cyanide was measured the experiments were performed at three temperatures 298 k 308 k and 318 k 2 4 analysis cyanide concentration was measured using an ion selective electrode model orion 720a thermo electron corporation beverly usa the solution was treated with excess lead carbonate to remove the interfering sulphide ions 10 ml of the sulphide free aliquot was taken in a glass tube followed by addition of 0 1 ml of 10 m naoh after 5 min the cyanide concentration was measured the effluent used in this study was collected from m s tata steel located in jamshedpur 22 8046 n 86 2029 e india ph conductivity total dissolved solids tds were measured using multi parameter tester model pcs testr 35 eutech instruments singapore 2 5 source of cyanide effluent during the production of liquid iron in a blast furnace hot air blast was blown to the furnace after undergoing necessary chemical reactions the flue gas came out from the top of blast furnace containing dust water particles large amount of suspended solids and combustible gas this flue gas went through elaborate cleaning system first it was passed through a dust catcher thereby removing coarser particles and then was sent to wet cleaning system venturi scrubber water and gas were there in contact and almost all the suspended particles were separated from the gas more than 99 and got dissolved in water polluted water from the system contained high concentration of suspended particles 500 10000 mg l and as such was sent to cleaning basins where some amount of suspended particles were precipitated the water was collected in a water reservoir from where rest of the suspended solids were separated by sedimentation after this treatment water still contained large amount of solids and various ions like cyanide water was collected from this stage of blast furnace effluent for cyanide removal 22 the characterization of the effluent is presented in table 1 it is observed that ph of the effluent is 7 4 effluent from different locations of iron and steel plant has varied ph 13 the ph of blast furnace effluent is in the range of 6 to 8 23 and effluent from coke oven plant has a ph above 9 24 solution ph has significant effect on speciation of cyanide above ph 8 7 most of the cyanide is present in free form 25 26 at low ph values ph 8 7 hydrolysis of cyanide occurs as follows 27 8 c n a q h 2 o h c n a q o h under such ph conditions ph 8 7 cyanide exists in the form of soluble hcn that is a weak acid pka 8 7 and free cyanide cn in the solution satisfies the equilibrium in eq 8 28 29 for ph 3 0 cyanide ion exists mostly in the form of volatile hcn gas 13 30 31 thus between ph 3 and 8 7 existing species of cyanide are hcn aq and cn aq in the present study at ph 7 0 as cn aq is adsorbed by coke breeze more hcn aq is dissociated to form cn aq to maintain the equilibrium eq 8 facilitating enhanced adsorption of cn aq by the coke breeze similar reports are found in literature by activated carbon 11 13 2 6 column study 2 6 1 preparation of adsorbent bed continuous fixed bed adsorption was carried out with perspex column internal diameter 4 cm adsorbent bed was prepared using coke breeze diameter 0 2 mm constant flow rate of inlet cyanide solution 5 10 and 15 ml min was regulated at up flow mode with a booster pump bypass line was provided to control the feed flow rate three different bed depths of 60 70 and 80 cm were used for fixed bed adsorption of cyanide all column studies were performed using tata steel effluent cyanide concentration 4 84 mg l and experiments were carried out at room temperature 300 2 0 k and atmospheric pressure treated effluent was collected through the outlet pipe in a container at regular intervals of time for measurement of residual cyanide as a function of time inlet flow rate was noted by the rotameter various properties of coke breeze particle and bed are reported in table 2 these properties were measured by the methods used by borjesson et al 32 2 6 2 adsorption modeling for fixed bed column 2 6 2 1 pore diffusion model film pore diffusion model is used to predict the fixed bed break through curves for cyanide adsorption onto coke breeze the one dimensional solute transport model in the fixed bed is described by the convection diffusion model the following basic assumptions are made to formulate the pore diffusion model 33 34 flow is one dimensional in the axial direction and uniform across the cross sectional area the bed is fully saturated i e all inter particle voids are filled with liquid the velocity of the liquid phase is constant along the column the cyanide balance in the bulk fluid inside the column is given as 9 c t d l 2 c z 2 v c z 3 k f a p 1 ε b ε b ρ s c c r a p the following initial and boundary conditions are considered 9a at t 0 c 0 9b at z 0 t 0 d l c z v c 0 c 9c at z l t 0 c z 0 2 6 2 2 intra pellet adsorption the intra pellet adsorption is governed by the pore diffusion model intra particle mass transport is due to fickian diffusion and is characterized by the pore diffusion coefficient dp the mass balance equation for the liquid phase inside the pore in a spherical particle can be written as 10 ε p c p t 1 ε p ρ s q t d p 2 c p r 2 2 r c p r where ε p is the particle porosity cp is solute concentration in the liquid filled pore within the particle assuming instantaneous equilibrium 11 q t c p t q c p modifying eq

simulation tool utilizing the pdepe function the unknown parameters d p d l and kf were determined using the optimization routine of interior point algorithm following a trust region method by minimizing the sum of square of errors between the experimental and predicted concentration data sum of square error was defined as 13 s i 1 n e x p j 1 k c c a l i j c exp i j c exp i j 2 where i is number of experiments and j is number of time points in the i th experiment algorithm for numerical solution of these coupled partial differential equations is given in fig 1 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of coke breeze 3 1 1 sem and energy dispersive x ray edx sem images and elemental analysis of coke breeze before and after cyanide adsorption are presented in fig 2 it can be observed that the texture of nascent coke breeze is smoother and porous compared to cn adsorbed coke breeze also it is quite evident from this figure that deposits of cn occur on the surface of coke breeze after cn adsorption the elemental analysis shown in table 3 indicates that the presence of nitrogen after adsorption of cn by coke breeze edx image corresponding to the presence of different elements within coke breeze is depicted in fig 2 c carbon 88 87 wt and oxygen 7 96 wt are the major components present in the coke breeze and carbon plays an important role in the adsorption of cyanide 11 12 adsorption of cyanide is corroborated by the presence of nitrogen peak in the used coke breeze specimen after column run shown in fig 2 d impurities such as silica phosphorus and calcium are present in negligible amount weight percentages of elements present in coke breeze before and after cyanide adsorption are tabulated in table 3 size distribution of coke breeze in distilled water is shown in fig 3 it can be observed from fig 3 a that the most of the particles have diameter below 1000 μm there is a sharp peak at 200 μm indicating the average diameter of coke breeze zeta potential of the coke breeze is shown in fig 3 b it is clear from the figure that at lower ph the particles have positive charge and they become more negative at higher ph for example at ph 2 the particles have zeta potential of 5 3 mv and at higher ph of 11 the zeta potential of the coke breeze is 7 1 mv phzpc of the coke breeze was 7 4 xrd patterns of nascent coke breeze and cyanide adsorbed coke breeze are presented in fig 3 c it can be observed that no new peaks are observed though existing peaks have been modified for the case of nascent coke breeze characteristic peaks at 2 θ 20 5 26 38 5 and 44 5 signify the crystal structure as quartz quartz graphite quartz quartz and graphite respectively it is evident from the xrd pattern of adsorbed coke breeze that existing peaks have been sharpened signifying that upon adsorption there is no modification of original crystal structure though physical interaction between adsorbate cyanide ion cn and coke breeze on the surface and inside the pores is present nitrogen adsorption and bet analysis are shown in fig 4 the nitrogen adsorption isotherm is a type i isotherm with a steep increase at p p0 0 1 followed by nearly constant adsorption at higher pressure a limiting value is attained at p p0 1 and a hysteresis is observed refer fig 4a type i isotherms are typical for microporous solids such as coke breeze having relatively small external surfaces 35 the derived bet surface area is 31 8 m2 g the t plot of the coke breeze is presented in fig 4 b the intercept of the t plot is positive 2 64 suggesting that the material is microporous the average pore diameter of coke breeze can be determined from fig 4 c and it is around 48 å corroborating its micro structural properties ftir analysis of nascent coke breeze and cn adsorbed coke breeze is presented in fig 5 it is observed from fig 5 that nascent coke breeze shows a strong co stretch along with very strong oh stretch however in case of adsorbed coke breeze new chemical interactions are observed a broad stretch in the frequency region 3000 2800 cm 1 suggests the formation of amine salt with coke breeze structure also the original c o stretch frequency has been weakened indicating the formation of chemical interaction between more electronegative carbonyl carbon with n atom of cyanide group 3 2 adsorption study effects of adsorbent dosage on cyanide adsorption are displayed in fig 6 it is observed that the percentage of cyanide removal increases with coke breeze dose upto 15 g l and remains constant thereafter therefore 15 g l of coke breeze is considered for further studies 3 3 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm of cyanide by coke breeze is shown in fig 7 and adsorption parameters are summarized in table 4 it is observed that maximum adsorption capacity q max is increased marginally with lowering in solution ph since the variation of adsorption capacity is insignificant ph 7 is selected for further study also it may be noted that effluent has a ph around 7 variation of maximum adsorption capacity with temperature is also negligible for example q max changes from 13 6 mg g to 15 9 mg g as the temperature varies from 25 c to 45 c it can be observed from table 4 that values of separation factor rl vary within the range of 0 03 0 87 at all temperatures and ph indicating favorable adsorption 36 37 the mean free energy of the adsorbate e was calculated using eq 5 after fitting d r isotherm energy of adsorption is the free energy of transfer of 1 mol of solute from infinity in solution to the surface of coke breeze the magnitude of e is used for estimating the type of adsorption mechanism if the value of e is below 8 kj mol the adsorption process can be considered as the physical adsorption and if the value of e is between 8 and 16 kj mol the adsorption type can be explained by chemisorption 38 39 it can be observed from table 4 that the calculated values of e are within the range of 0 48 1 0 kj mol for coke breeze at all temperature and ph indicating physical adsorption 40 it is observed from table 5 that all the values of δgº are in negative confirming the spontaneous nature and the feasibility of the adsorption 41 42 besides the decrease in the negative value of δgº with temperature suggests that the adsorption is more favorable at higher temperature researchers have reported that the δhº of physical adsorption is smaller than 40 kj mol 43 the value of δhº is 23 04 kj mol confirming cn adsorption by coke breeze is a physical adsorption and the adsorption reaction is endothermic these observation are consistent with the effect of temperature 44 also the positive value of entropy change δsº indicates that the process is spontaneous 3 4 adsorption kinetics as observed in fig 8 the adsorption progresses rapidly at initial stage and the equilibrium is attained after 5 h maximum adsorption occurs in the initial phase due to particles are microporous in nature it is clear that the mobility of cyanide ions increases with temperature this observation is in line with the trends in fig 7 b 3 5 pore diffusion model fig 9 represents the experimental data along with predicted results using pore diffusion model the optimization variables in the model are axial dispersion coefficient dl pore diffusivity dp and mass transfer coefficient kf and this values are tabulated in table 6 effect of bed depth on dimensionless concentration ct c0 has been shown in fig 9 a bed depth was varied from 60 cm to 80 cm for constant flow rate 5 ml min it is observed that breakthrough curves shift towards right as the bed depth increases due to availability of more adsorption sites effect of flow rate for concentration profile is shown in fig 9 b flow rates are varied from 5 ml min to 15 ml min for 60 cm bed depth breakthrough curves shift towards left with flow rate due to lower contact time resulting early onset of breakthrough 3 6 scale up study the scale up study predicts the loading volume bed depth and material required for treating the effluent in a real life scenario with higher breakthrough time outlet cyanide concentration not exceeding 0 2 mg l amount of materials required with breakthrough time for different flow rate and concentration is presented in fig 10 it is observed that amount of materials required is more for high flow rate and high cyanide concentration for example at 5 mg l initial cyanide concentration 2 t of coke breeze is required to have a treatment life 375 days for 5 kl day flow rate and for 200 days treatment life 20 t of coke breeze is required for 50 kl day flow rate at same cyanide concentration for 10 mg l cyanide concentration in feed 3 t of coke breeze is required to have a treatment life of 200 days for 5000 l day flow rate 4 conclusions coke breeze a waste product of steel plant was utilized for adsorptive removal of cyanide from steel plant wastewater maximum adsorption capacity of cyanide was in the range of 11 to 16 mg g for a ph range of 3 to 10 and temperature variation 298 to 318 k separation factor r l less than 1 0 indicated favourable adsorption nature of adsorption was physisorption as observed from the magnitude of dr isotherm parameter the optimum adsorption dose was found to be 15 g l thermodynamic parameters indicated that the cyanide adsorption by coke breeze was spontaneous and endothermic application of pore diffusion model led to the estimation of parameters pore diffusivity 2 0 2 10 10 m2 s axial dispersion coefficient 1 5 0 3 10 11 m2 s and mass transfer coefficient 4 0 4 10 6 m s for a 80 cm bed height using the model parameters the scale up study showed that 3 ts of coke breeze were required for treating an effluent having feed concentration 10 mg l cyanide for 200 days with a flow rate 5000 l day acknowledgement this work is supported by a grant from tata steel ltd jamshedpur india under the mou dated 11 08 2015

were there in contact and almost all the suspended particles were separated from the gas more than 99 and got dissolved in water polluted water from the system contained high concentration of suspended particles 500 10000 mg l and as such was sent to cleaning basins where some amount of suspended particles were precipitated the water was collected in a water reservoir from where rest of the suspended solids were separated by sedimentation after this treatment water still contained large amount of solids and various ions like cyanide water was collected from this stage of blast furnace effluent for cyanide removal 22 the characterization of the effluent is presented in table 1 it is observed that ph of the effluent is 7 4 effluent from different locations of iron and steel plant has varied ph 13 the ph of blast furnace effluent is in the range of 6 to 8 23 and effluent from coke oven plant has a ph above 9 24 solution ph has significant effect on speciation of cyanide above ph 8 7 most of the cyanide is present in free form 25 26 at low ph values ph 8 7 hydrolysis of cyanide occurs as follows 27 8 c n a q h 2 o h c n a q o h under such ph conditions ph 8 7 cyanide exists in the form of soluble hcn that is a weak acid pka 8 7 and free cyanide cn in the solution satisfies the equilibrium in eq 8 28 29 for ph 3 0 cyanide ion exists mostly in the form of volatile hcn gas 13 30 31 thus between ph 3 and 8 7 existing species of cyanide are hcn aq and cn aq in the present study at ph 7 0 as cn aq is adsorbed by coke breeze more hcn aq is dissociated to form cn aq to maintain the equilibrium eq 8 facilitating enhanced adsorption of cn aq by the coke breeze similar reports are found in literature by activated carbon 11 13 2 6 column study 2 6 1 preparation of adsorbent bed continuous fixed bed adsorption was carried out with perspex column internal diameter 4 cm adsorbent bed was prepared using coke breeze diameter 0 2 mm constant flow rate of inlet cyanide solution 5 10 and 15 ml min was regulated at up flow mode with a booster pump bypass line was provided to control the feed flow rate three different bed depths of 60 70 and 80 cm were used for fixed bed adsorption of cyanide all column studies were performed using tata steel effluent cyanide concentration 4 84 mg l and experiments were carried out at room temperature 300 2 0 k and atmospheric pressure treated effluent was collected through the outlet pipe in a container at regular intervals of time for measurement of residual cyanide as a function of time inlet flow rate was noted by the rotameter various properties of coke breeze particle and bed are reported in table 2 these properties were measured by the methods used by borjesson et al 32 2 6 2 adsorption modeling for fixed bed column 2 6 2 1 pore diffusion model film pore diffusion model is used to predict the fixed bed break through curves for cyanide adsorption onto coke breeze the one dimensional solute transport model in the fixed bed is described by the convection diffusion model the following basic assumptions are made to formulate the pore diffusion model 33 34 flow is one dimensional in the axial direction and uniform across the cross sectional area the bed is fully saturated i e all inter particle voids are filled with liquid the velocity of the liquid phase is constant along the column the cyanide balance in the bulk fluid inside the column is given as 9 c t d l 2 c z 2 v c z 3 k f a p 1 ε b ε b ρ s c c r a p the following initial and boundary conditions are considered 9a at t 0 c 0

3 1 characterization of coke breeze 3 1 1 sem and energy dispersive x ray edx sem images and elemental analysis of coke breeze before and after cyanide adsorption are presented in fig 2 it can be observed that the texture of nascent coke breeze is smoother and porous compared to cn adsorbed coke breeze also it is quite evident from this figure that deposits of cn occur on the surface of coke breeze after cn adsorption the elemental analysis shown in table 3 indicates that the presence of nitrogen after adsorption of cn by coke breeze edx image corresponding to the presence of different elements within coke breeze is depicted in fig 2 c carbon 88 87 wt and oxygen 7 96 wt are the major components present in the coke breeze and carbon plays an important role in the adsorption of cyanide 11 12 adsorption of cyanide is corroborated by the presence of nitrogen peak in the used coke breeze specimen after column run shown in fig 2 d impurities such as silica phosphorus and calcium are present in negligible amount weight percentages of elements present in coke breeze before and after cyanide adsorption are tabulated in table 3 size distribution of coke breeze in distilled water is shown in fig 3 it can be observed from fig 3 a that the most of the particles have diameter below 1000 μm there is a sharp peak at 200 μm indicating the average diameter of coke breeze zeta potential of the coke breeze is shown in fig 3 b it is clear from the figure that at lower ph the particles have positive charge and they become more negative at higher ph for example at ph 2 the particles have zeta potential of 5 3 mv and at higher ph of 11 the zeta potential of the coke breeze is 7 1 mv phzpc of the coke breeze was 7 4 xrd patterns of nascent coke breeze and cyanide adsorbed coke breeze are presented in fig 3 c it can be observed that no new peaks are observed though existing peaks have been modified for the case of nascent coke breeze characteristic peaks at 2 θ 20 5 26 38 5 and 44 5 signify the crystal structure as quartz quartz graphite quartz quartz and graphite respectively it is evident from the xrd pattern of adsorbed coke breeze that existing peaks have been sharpened signifying that upon adsorption there is no modification of original crystal structure though physical interaction between adsorbate cyanide ion cn and coke breeze on the surface and inside the pores is present nitrogen adsorption and bet analysis are shown in fig 4 the nitrogen adsorption isotherm is a type i isotherm with a steep increase at p p0 0 1 followed by nearly constant adsorption at higher pressure a limiting value is attained at p p0 1 and a hysteresis is observed refer fig 4a type i isotherms are typical for microporous solids such as coke breeze having relatively small external surfaces 35 the derived bet surface area is 31 8 m2 g the t plot of the coke breeze is presented in fig 4 b the intercept of the t plot is positive 2 64 suggesting that the material is microporous the average pore diameter of coke breeze can be determined from fig 4 c and it is around 48 å corroborating its micro structural properties ftir analysis of nascent coke breeze and cn adsorbed coke breeze is presented in fig 5 it is observed from fig 5 that nascent coke breeze shows a strong co stretch along with very strong oh stretch however in case of adsorbed coke breeze new chemical interactions are observed a broad stretch in the frequency region 3000 2800 cm 1 suggests the formation of amine salt with coke breeze structure also the original c o stretch frequency has been weakened indicating the formation of chemical interaction between more electronegative carbonyl carbon with n atom of cyanide group 3 2 adsorption study effects of adsorbent dosage on cyanide adsorption are displayed in fig 6 it is observed that the percentage of cyanide removal increases with coke breeze dose upto 15 g l and remains constant thereafter therefore 15 g l of coke breeze is considered for further studies 3 3 adsorption isotherm adsorption isotherm of cyanide by coke breeze is shown in fig 7 and adsorption parameters are summarized in table 4 it is observed that maximum adsorption capacity q max is increased marginally with lowering in solution ph since the variation of adsorption capacity is insignificant ph 7 is selected for further study also it may be noted that effluent has a ph around 7 variation of maximum adsorption capacity with temperature is also negligible for example q max changes from 13 6 mg g to 15 9 mg g as the temperature varies from 25 c to 45 c it can be observed from table 4 that values of separation factor rl vary within the range of 0 03 0 87 at all temperatures and ph indicating favorable adsorption 36 37 the mean free energy of the adsorbate e was calculated using eq 5 after fitting d r isotherm energy of adsorption is the free energy of transfer of 1 mol of solute from infinity in solution to the surface of coke breeze the magnitude of e is used for estimating the type of adsorption mechanism if the value of e is below 8 kj mol the adsorption process can be considered as the physical adsorption and if the value of e is between 8 and 16 kj mol the adsorption type can be explained by chemisorption 38 39 it can be observed from table 4 that the calculated values of e are within the range of 0 48 1 0 kj mol for coke breeze at all temperature and ph indicating physical adsorption 40 it is observed from table 5 that all the values of δgº are in negative confirming the spontaneous nature and the feasibility of the adsorption 41 42 besides the decrease in the negative value of δgº with temperature suggests that the adsorption is more favorable at higher temperature researchers have reported that the δhº of physical adsorption is smaller than 40 kj mol 43 the value of δhº is 23 04 kj mol confirming cn adsorption by coke breeze is a physical adsorption and the adsorption reaction is endothermic these observation are consistent with the effect of temperature 44 also the positive value of entropy change δsº indicates that the process is spontaneous 3 4 adsorption kinetics as observed in fig 8 the adsorption progresses rapidly at initial stage and the equilibrium is attained after 5 h maximum adsorption occurs in the initial phase due to particles are microporous in nature it is clear that the mobility of cyanide ions increases with temperature this observation is in line with the trends in fig 7 b 3 5 pore diffusion model fig 9 represents the experimental data along with predicted results using pore diffusion model the optimization variables in the model are axial dispersion coefficient dl pore diffusivity dp and mass transfer coefficient kf and this values are tabulated in table 6 effect of bed depth on dimensionless concentration ct c0 has been shown in fig 9 a bed depth was varied from 60 cm to 80 cm for constant flow rate 5 ml min it is observed that breakthrough curves shift towards right as the bed depth increases due to availability of more adsorption sites effect of flow rate for concentration profile is shown in fig 9 b flow rates are varied from 5 ml min to 15 ml min for 60 cm bed depth breakthrough curves shift towards left with flow rate due to lower contact time resulting early onset of breakthrough 3 6 scale up study the scale up study predicts the loading volume bed depth and material required for treating the effluent in a real life scenario with higher breakthrough time outlet cyanide concentration not exceeding 0 2 mg l amount of materials required with breakthrough time for different flow rate and concentration is presented in fig 10 it is observed that amount of materials required is more for high flow rate and high cyanide concentration for example at 5 mg l initial cyanide concentration 2 t of coke breeze is required to have a treatment life 375 days for 5 kl day flow rate and for 200 days treatment life 20 t of coke breeze is required for 50 kl day flow rate at same cyanide concentration for 10 mg l cyanide concentration in feed 3 t of coke breeze is required to have a treatment life of 200 days for 5000 l day flow rate 4 conclusions coke breeze a waste product of steel plant was utilized for adsorptive removal of cyanide from steel plant wastewater maximum adsorption capacity of cyanide was in the range of 11 to 16 mg g for a ph range of 3 to 10 and temperature variation 298 to 318 k separation factor r l less than 1 0 indicated favourable adsorption nature of adsorption was physisorption as observed from the magnitude of dr isotherm parameter the optimum adsorption dose was found to be 15 g l thermodynamic parameters indicated that the cyanide adsorption by coke breeze was spontaneous and endothermic application of pore diffusion model led to the estimation of parameters pore diffusivity 2 0 2 10 10 m2 s axial dispersion coefficient 1 5 0 3 10 11 m2 s and mass transfer coefficient 4 0 4 10 6 m s for a 80 cm bed height using the model parameters the scale up study showed that 3 ts of coke breeze were required for treating an effluent having feed concentration 10 mg l cyanide for 200 days with a flow rate 5000 l day acknowledgement this work is supported by a grant from tata steel ltd jamshedpur india under the mou dated 11 08 2015 
14441,the nitrification process was simulated using benchtop bioreactors to gain insight into the fate of the antimicrobials triclosan tcs and triclocarban tcc as well their transformation products during wastewater treatment currently little information exists on the impact of nitrification treatment on concentrations of tcc tcc degradation products and tcs degradation products reactors were run using samples collected from a large municipal wastewater treatment plant at two ph ranges 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 9 5 for 171 h to simulate an extended hydraulic retention time hrt tcs was degraded under both ph conditions with a 28 5 overall reduction in solids samples when the ph range was 6 5 7 5 and an overall reduction of 83 2 in solids samples when the ph ranged 8 5 9 5 methyltriclosan metcs was formed in solids samples during both treatment conditions metcs formed the most rapidly during the first 25 h of treatment at ph 8 5 9 5 levels of 2 4 dichlorophenol a tcs photolysis product and tcc did not change over the 171 h treatment period indicating that nitrification is not an effective treatment for reduction of these compounds three tcc dechlorination products and triclosan o sulfate were not observed at or above the limit of quantitation in any bioreactor samples keywords nitrification biodegradation transformation products triclosan triclocarban 1 introduction the land application of treated sludge biosolids and discharge of liquid effluent to local water bodies from wastewater treatment plants wwtps can act as environmental sources of emerging contaminants ecs not fully removed within treatment systems with worldwide chemical production projected to increase beyond population growth 1 the inevitable reliance on chemicals by industry medicine agriculture households etc can result in the presence of a variety of ecs within wastewater treatment processes such chemicals can include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps flame retardants surfactants and food additives among others 2 one group of ppcps that have garnered interest from regulatory agencies due to health and environmental concerns are antimicrobials specifically triclosan tcs and triclocarban tcc in 2016 the united states food and drug administration issued a phase out of tcs and tcc from consumer antiseptic washes 3 while in the same year tcs was not approved for use in product type 1 items human hygiene biocidal products for skin or scalps by the european commission 4 in the united states these antimicrobials can still remain in products used in healthcare situations 3 concerns regarding tcs and tcc in the environment primarily center around their endocrine disrupting capabilities 5 7 as well as microbial resistance issues 8 9 furthermore tcs and tcc transformation products such as methyltriclosan metcs and carbanilides can also induce endocrine disruption 5 tcs and tcc have been shown to be prolific in various stages of the wastewater treatment system 10 12 while transformation of tcc during wastewater treatment has been observed 13 14 the structure of the compound and its antimicrobial properties tend to limit biodegradation 15 however studies have demonstrated that microbial populations are readily able to degrade compounds similar to tcc including carbanilide a non chlorinated analog and similarly structured herbicides that posses one not two phenyl rings 16 research into which microbial species effectively degrade the compound is limited but has indicated that biodegradation is possible 15 17 tcs on the other hand has been demonstrated to be readily removed during aerobic microbial wastewater treatment processes 14 18 for instance a strain of sphingomonas sp isolated from activated sludge demonstrated the ability to mineralize tcs in a 72 hour period 19 biodegradation of the compound however can be hindered due to factors including its antimicrobial properties 20 and sorbative behavior 21 both tcs and tcc are hydrophobic in nature with log kow values of 4 8 for tcs and 4 9 for tcc 22 and have been demonstrated to primarily sorb to sludge during wastewater treatment 14 23 24 thus a majority of their removal during treatment occurs due to sludge sorption during primary sedimentation 14 due to their limited transformation during the treatment process tcs and tcc are commonly released into the environment due to wastewater effluent discharge and biosolids application field studies have estimated the half lives of tcs and tcc in soils after biosolids applications to be 104 days and 288 days respectively while metcs is more persistent with a half life of approximately 443 days after biosolids application 25 26 additionally it has been demonstrated that the long term application of biosoids to agricultural soils can result in the migration of both tcs and tcc through a terrestrial food web from primary consumers to secondary and tertiary consumers 27 as well as the phytoaccumulation of the compounds in different vegetative species including switch grass and squash 28 bioavailability of tcs and tcc in solids can be dependent on sludge application techniques i e application of liquid or dewatered biosolids 29 in surface waters concentrations of the antimicrobials have been detected in aqueous suspended particulate and sediment samples with the highest concentrations occurring near wwtp discharge points 30 tcs tcc and metcs can bioaccumulate in freshwater snails and algae 31 and furthermore tcs and tcc can also inhibit the growth of freshwater algae 32 one way to reduce the presence of tcs and tcc in the environment via wastewater treatment discharge is by altering common wastewater treatment processes to improve compound degradation nitrification treatment biologically converts ammonia ammonium in waste streams to nitrate and the process has demonstrated the ability to degrade tcs 33 34 little information exists on the impact of nitrification treatment on concentrations of tcc tcc degradation products and tcs degradation products this study focuses on the fate of tcs tcc and their transformation products during nitrification treatment in a laboratory setting benchtop bioreactors were used to simulate the nitrification process and allowed for conditions such as hydraulic retention time hrt and ph to be altered in order to understand how these changes impact compound concentration over time research has demonstrated that increasing the hrt during activated sludge treatment improves tcs and tcc degradation 18 and that the optimum ph for nitrification in waste streams can vary 35 36 the us epa reports that while the ideal ph range for nitrosomonas and nitrobacter is between 7 0 and 8 0 nitrification can occur at ph concentrations ranging from 6 6 to 9 7 due to additional environmental factors that can impact nitrifying bacterial populations 37 two reactors were run simultaneously at 21 c for 171 h at a ph range of 6 5 7 5 and then again at a range of 8 5 9 5 with sample collected from a nitrification reactor from a large wwtp located in the mid atlantic region of the united states no spiking of the target compounds into the bioreactors took place samples were collected periodically from each reactor so that tcs and tcc degradation rates and transformation product formation rates could be calculated over the 171 hour period results from this study demonstrate how altering a somewhat common treatment process can impact concentrations of antimicrobials and their transformation products in wastewater which in turn can influence the amount of each compound emitted to the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 target analytes all samples were analyzed for concentrations of tcs and its transformation products metcs 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp and triclosan o sulfate tcs o sulf additionally samples were analyzed for tcc and its dechlorination products 4 4 dichlorocarbanilide dcc 1 3 chlorophenyl 3 phenylurea

nitrification denitrification treatment filtration and disinfection sludge is treated by the cambi thermal hydrolysis process in conjunction with mesophilic anaerobic digestion a process flow diagram of treatment stages at the facility is provided in figure si 1 in the supplemental information the average hrt for the nitrification denitrification reactors combined is 8 h while the average sludge retention time for the two reactors is 20 days these time periods however can vary with flow the target dissolved oxygen do concentration for the nitrification reactors is 2 0 mg l but can range from 1 2 to 4 8 mg l the target ph of the nitrification process is 6 5 the on site reactors are outdoors exposed to the elements and without heating elements as such typical temperatures within the reactors can range from 14 to 23 c depending on seasonal ambient temperatures 2 3 benchtop bioreactor experimental setup the nitrification treatment process was simulated at a laboratory scale using two bioflo 115 benchtop bioreactors new brunswick scientific edison nj usa samples were collected from the study wwtp near the input of a nitrification reactor in an area of sufficient mixing and immediately transported to the laboratory for use within the bioreactors five 5 liters of nitrification sample was placed in each bioreactor no spiking of target compounds into the bioreactors took place no additional wastewater was added to the reactors after the start of the experiments the two reactors were operated simultaneously as duplicates for two separate runs experimental conditions for each run are provided in table 1 the bioflow 115 control panel allowed as needed for the automatic addition of 3 m sodium hydroxide or 1 5 m sulfuric acid to constantly maintain the ph within the allowable range provided in table 1 as well as the automatic adjustment of mixing rates to maintain a target dissolved oxygen do concentration of 2 mg l the bioreactors were operated for 171 h during each run well beyond the 8 hour hrt for the nitrification reactors at the study wwtp in order to gauge trends of tcs tcc and transformation product concentrations 200 ml samples were collected at

microbial activity the remainder was frozen at 20 c for eventual analysis of tcs tcc and transformation products additionally 1 l airtight jars were filled with 0 5 l of nitrification sample and 1 g of mercuric chloride to act as control reactors the control reactors were placed in a water bath maintained at 30 c and agitated continuously for 171 h initial samples hour 0 and final samples hour 171 were analyzed for all target compounds furthermore final samples were plated to confirm that microbial populations within the control reactors did not survive treatment with mercuric chloride 2 4 extraction and analysis of target analytes 2 4 1 sample extraction the aqueous and solid fractions of each sample collected from the bioreactor were analyzed separately to achieve this each sample was filtered through a whatman ga f 0 7 μm filter ge healthcare life sciences pittsburgh pa usa prior to extraction all samples were extracted in duplicate the aqueous matrix was extracted according to a

were used to determine compound degradation or formation rates where applicable via equation 1 1 ln c c 0 k t where c is the target compound concentration at a given time point co is the initial concentrations of the target compound t is time and k is the degradation rate 3 1 triclosan and its transformation products 3 1 1 triclosan the majority of the tcs mass in the nitrification reactors was sorbed to the solids matrix at both experimental ph ranges fig 1 a at a ph range of 6 5 7 5 tcs concentrations decreased under nitrifying conditions at an average rate of 0 0195 0 006 h 1 until approximately 37 49 hours after which concentrations leveled out and did not change significantly conversely when the reactors were run at a ph range of 8 5 9 5 tcs was consistently degraded over the 171 hour period at a rate of 0 0101 0 005 h 1 after 171 h concentrations of tcs were reduced by 28 5 0 09 at a ph range of 6 5 7 5 and 83 2 0 05 at a ph range of 8 5 9 5 demonstrating an increased efficiency over the course of the experiments of compound removal from the solids phase during nitrification at a higher ph range additionally tcs degradation continued to occur beyond the 8 hour mark under both treatment conditions demonstrating that extending treatment beyond facility hrt led to increased degradation of tcs concentrations of tcs in the aqueous fraction fig 1b of nitrification samples did not significantly change over the 171 hour period when the bioreactors were run at a ph range of 6 5 7 5 linear regression slope test p 0 2034 and 8 5 9 5 linear regression slope test p 0 8329 average concentrations in aqueous samples were below 2 5 ng ml under reactor conditions decreases of tcs in the solids phase and stagnation of compound concentrations in the aqueous phase during experiments run at a ph range of 8 5 9 5 occurred despite an increase in the ionization of tcs in this range pka 8 1 42 this indicates that the compound was not simply redistributing into the aqueous phase due to increased solubility but rather was removed during the course of the experiments furthermore while photolysis has been shown to be a more efficient means of tcs removal at high ph levels 43 reactors were covered completely with aluminum foil to prevent this type of reaction observations within this study that demonstrate that tcs can be degraded under nitrifying conditions are consistent with those within the literature roh et al 2009 found that a pure culture of the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas europaea has the ability to biodegrade the antimicrobial via cometabolic reactions in experiments carried out in 1 l flasks the bacterial strain reduced tcs concentrations by over 60 additionally the authors demonstrated the tcs could be significantly removed by nitrifying activated sludge samples over a 5 day period concluding that both aob and heterotrophic microbes possess the ability to biodegrade the compound 33 laboratory scale simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd reactors operated with synthetic wastewater resulted in high tcs removal rates seventy seven percent 77 of tcs removal from the snds was attributed to various processes which included biodegradation but not sorption or removal via effluent 44 however while these experiments demonstrate the ability of microbial populations associated with nitrification denitrification can degrade tcs they do not specifically focus on actual treatment of wastewater by either nitrification as in the present study or nitrification denitrification in a mass balance performed at the same wwtp utilized for the present study lozano et al 2013 found that the combined nitrification denitrification process at the facility was able to remove 2 29 kg tcs per day it was also observed that this removal was higher than that observed during secondary activated sludge treatment at the facility 14 conversely in a similar study conducted using benchtop bioreactors and activated sludge from the same facility tcs degradation rates in the solids fraction for reactors run at 21 c and 30 c 0 0170 0 003 and 0 0224 0 007 h 1 respectively were fairly similar to those observed in the course of this study table 2 18 indicating that a variety of aerobic microbial populations can degrade tcs in wastewater results from these studies in conjunction with the present study demonstrate the complexity of the treatment process and based on these results future work should focus on the impact of the denitrification process and identification of microbial species present during nitrification treatment 3 1 2 methyltriclosan as was observed for tcs the metcs present within the systems was overwhelmingly associated with the solids fraction fig 2 while concentrations within the aqueous fraction were not detected above the loq metcs formation began right from the start of the experiments under both ph conditions in reactors run at the ph range of 6 5 7 5 concentrations increased slowly at a rate of 0 00985 0 007 h 1 until hour 98 metcs concentrations then leveled out for the remainder of the experiments however when run at a ph range of 8 5 9 5 metcs solids concentrations within the bioreactors increased more rapidly at a rate of 0 0174 0 005 h 1 until hour 25 and then continued to increase more slowly at a rate of 0 00190 0 002 h 1 the overall rate of metcs formation for reactors run with a ph range of 8 5 9 5 was 0 0023 0 004 h 1 while metcs is considered one of the main tcs transformation products its formation in solids samples was associated with 19 5 and 22 2 of observed tcs loss in solids for ph ranges of 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 9 5 respectively indicating that more mechanistic studies focusing on both tcs degradation and metcs formation are needed little information exists regarding the formation of metcs during the nitrification treatment process lozano et al 2013 observed that significant metcs formation occurred during nitrification denitrification treatment at the same wwtp used for the present study a mass balance of the facility revealed that 0 03 kg metcs per day was produced and was associated with tcs degradation 14 formation rates of metcs in the present study differed from those observed by armstrong et al 2018 in bioreactors run using activated sludge from the same wwtp table 2 in the previous study formation rates of metcs appeared to be more variable different reactors run under the same treatment conditions were shown to result in dissimilar final concentrations of metcs during the course of experiments this demonstrates the complexity of the degradation formation process during aerobic wastewater treatment 3 1 3 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp was only detected in solids samples from all bioreactors fig 3 over the course of the experiments concentrations did not significantly change in bioreactors run at a ph range of 6 5 7 5 linear regression slope test p 0 8632 or 8 5 9 5 linear regression slope test p 0 3472 the presence of 2 4 dcp in the reactors could be due to a combination of tcs photolysis 45 upstream and the degradation of other organic compounds that result in 2 4 dcp formation given that 2 4 dcp can be both formed by the degradation of other compounds such as dichlorprop 2 4 dp and 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d 46 48 and degraded aerobically 49 it may be that concentrations remain relatively steady over the course of the experiments due to continuous formation degradation 3 1 4 triclosan o sulfate tcs o sulf was not detected at or above the loq in any samples aqueous or solids fraction collected from the bioreactors 3 2 triclocarban and its transformation products 3 2 1 triclocarban tcc was predominantly affiliated with the solids fraction of nitrification samples fig 4 a concentrations within the solids matrix were unchanged under both experimental ph ranges linear regression slope test p 0 1209 ph 6 5 7 5 p 0 1151 ph 8 5 9 5 furthermore tcc was not detected above 2 5 ng ml in any aqueous samples fig 4b results show that the nitrification process was unable to degrade tcc significantly conversely lozano et al 2013 observed that at the same study facility significant amounts of tcc was degraded during nitrification denitrification treatment however removal of tcc during nitrification denitrification as observed by lozano et al may have been due predominantly to the denitrification process the bacterial strain ochrobactrum sp tcc 1 has been demonstrated to degrade tcc under anoxic conditions and could do such during wastewater denitrification 50 under aerobic conditions activated sludge was demonstrated to degrade tcc at a rate of 0 0158 0 012 h 1 at a temperature of 30 c but was not removed at all at 21 c table 2 18 further research into the separate impacts of wastewater nitrification and denitrification on concentrations of tcc as well as the microbial populations involved in the processes needs to be conducted to gain further insight into the degradability of the antimicrobial during treatment 3 2 2 triclocarban dechlorination products concentrations of dcc mcc and ncc were not detected at or above the loq during the course of the experiments 4 conclusions tcs and tcc are commonly detected in the wastewater treatment process concerns exist regarding their environmental impacts due to release via wastewater effluent discharge and the land application of biosolids simulation of nitrification process allows for a better understanding of how the treatment can influence concentrations of tcs tcc and their antimicrobials the majority of tcs was associated with the solids fraction of nitrification samples and concentrations decreased when treatment was operated at both experimental ph ranges 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 9 5 a greater reduction of tcs levels in solids samples occurred at the higher ph range metcs was formed in solids samples under both ph conditions with formation rates being the most rapid under ph conditions ranging 8 5 9 5 0 0174 0 005 h 1 first 25 h tcc and 2 4 dcp concentrations however did not change during either nitrification treatment overall the impact of

14441,the nitrification process was simulated using benchtop bioreactors to gain insight into the fate of the antimicrobials triclosan tcs and triclocarban tcc as well their transformation products during wastewater treatment currently little information exists on the impact of nitrification treatment on concentrations of tcc tcc degradation products and tcs degradation products reactors were run using samples collected from a large municipal wastewater treatment plant at two ph ranges 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 9 5 for 171 h to simulate an extended hydraulic retention time hrt tcs was degraded under both ph conditions with a 28 5 overall reduction in solids samples when the ph range was 6 5 7 5 and an overall reduction of 83 2 in solids samples when the ph ranged 8 5 9 5 methyltriclosan metcs was formed in solids samples during both treatment conditions metcs formed the most rapidly during the first 25 h of treatment at ph 8 5 9 5 levels of 2 4 dichlorophenol a tcs photolysis product and tcc did not change over the 171 h treatment period indicating that nitrification is not an effective treatment for reduction of these compounds three tcc dechlorination products and triclosan o sulfate were not observed at or above the limit of quantitation in any bioreactor samples keywords nitrification biodegradation transformation products triclosan triclocarban 1 introduction the land application of treated sludge biosolids and discharge of liquid effluent to local water bodies from wastewater treatment plants wwtps can act as environmental sources of emerging contaminants ecs not fully removed within treatment systems with worldwide chemical production projected to increase beyond population growth 1 the inevitable reliance on chemicals by industry medicine agriculture households etc can result in the presence of a variety of ecs within wastewater treatment processes such chemicals can include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps flame retardants surfactants and food additives among others 2 one group of ppcps that have garnered interest from regulatory agencies due to health and environmental concerns are antimicrobials specifically triclosan tcs and triclocarban tcc in 2016 the united states food and drug administration issued a phase out of tcs and tcc from consumer antiseptic washes 3 while in the same year tcs was not approved for use in product type 1 items human hygiene biocidal products for skin or scalps by the european commission 4 in the united states these antimicrobials can still remain in products used in healthcare situations 3 concerns regarding tcs and tcc in the environment primarily center around their endocrine disrupting capabilities 5 7 as well as microbial resistance issues 8 9 furthermore tcs and tcc transformation products such as methyltriclosan metcs and carbanilides can also induce endocrine disruption 5 tcs and tcc have been shown to be prolific in various stages of the wastewater treatment system 10 12 while transformation of tcc during wastewater treatment has been observed 13 14 the structure of the compound and its antimicrobial properties tend to limit biodegradation 15 however studies have demonstrated that microbial populations are readily able to degrade compounds similar to tcc including carbanilide a non chlorinated analog and similarly structured herbicides that posses one not two phenyl rings 16 research into which microbial species effectively degrade the compound is limited but has indicated that biodegradation is possible 15 17 tcs on the other hand has been demonstrated to be readily removed during aerobic microbial wastewater treatment processes 14 18 for instance a strain of sphingomonas sp isolated from activated sludge demonstrated the ability to mineralize tcs in a 72 hour period 19 biodegradation of the compound however can be hindered due to factors including its antimicrobial properties 20 and sorbative behavior 21 both tcs and tcc are hydrophobic in nature with log kow values of 4 8 for tcs and 4 9 for tcc 22 and have been demonstrated to primarily sorb to sludge during wastewater treatment 14 23 24 thus a majority of their removal during treatment occurs due to sludge sorption during primary sedimentation 14 due to their limited transformation during the treatment process tcs and tcc are commonly released into the environment due to wastewater effluent discharge and biosolids application field studies have estimated the half lives of tcs and tcc in soils after biosolids applications to be 104 days and 288 days respectively while metcs is more persistent with a half life of approximately 443 days after biosolids application 25 26 additionally it has been demonstrated that the long term application of biosoids to agricultural soils can result in the migration of both tcs and tcc through a terrestrial food web from primary consumers to secondary and tertiary consumers 27 as well as the phytoaccumulation of the compounds in different vegetative species including switch grass and squash 28 bioavailability of tcs and tcc in solids can be dependent on sludge application techniques i e application of liquid or dewatered biosolids 29 in surface waters concentrations of the antimicrobials have been detected in aqueous suspended particulate and sediment samples with the highest concentrations occurring near wwtp discharge points 30 tcs tcc and metcs can bioaccumulate in freshwater snails and algae 31 and furthermore tcs and tcc can also inhibit the growth of freshwater algae 32 one way to reduce the presence of tcs and tcc in the environment via wastewater treatment discharge is by altering common wastewater treatment processes to improve compound degradation nitrification treatment biologically converts ammonia ammonium in waste streams to nitrate and the process has demonstrated the ability to degrade tcs 33 34 little information exists on the impact of nitrification treatment on concentrations of tcc tcc degradation products and tcs degradation products this study focuses on the fate of tcs tcc and their transformation products during nitrification treatment in a laboratory setting benchtop bioreactors were used to simulate the nitrification process and allowed for conditions such as hydraulic retention time hrt and ph to be altered in order to understand how these changes impact compound concentration over time research has demonstrated that increasing the hrt during activated sludge treatment improves tcs and tcc degradation 18 and that the optimum ph for nitrification in waste streams can vary 35 36 the us epa reports that while the ideal ph range for nitrosomonas and nitrobacter is between 7 0 and 8 0 nitrification can occur at ph concentrations ranging from 6 6 to 9 7 due to additional environmental factors that can impact nitrifying bacterial populations 37 two reactors were run simultaneously at 21 c for 171 h at a ph range of 6 5 7 5 and then again at a range of 8 5 9 5 with sample collected from a nitrification reactor from a large wwtp located in the mid atlantic region of the united states no spiking of the target compounds into the bioreactors took place samples were collected periodically from each reactor so that tcs and tcc degradation rates and transformation product formation rates could be calculated over the 171 hour period results from this study demonstrate how altering a somewhat common treatment process can impact concentrations of antimicrobials and their transformation products in wastewater which in turn can influence the amount of each compound emitted to the environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 target analytes all samples were analyzed for concentrations of tcs and its transformation products

1 2 to 4 8 mg l the target ph of the nitrification process is 6 5 the on site reactors are outdoors exposed to the elements and without heating elements as such typical temperatures within the reactors can range from 14 to 23 c depending on seasonal ambient temperatures 2 3 benchtop bioreactor experimental setup the nitrification treatment process was simulated at a laboratory scale using two bioflo 115 benchtop bioreactors new brunswick scientific edison nj usa samples were collected from the study wwtp near the input of a nitrification reactor in an area of sufficient mixing and immediately transported to the laboratory for use within the bioreactors five 5 liters of nitrification sample was placed in each bioreactor no spiking of target compounds into the bioreactors took place no additional wastewater was added to the reactors after the start of the experiments the two reactors were operated simultaneously as duplicates for two separate runs experimental conditions

each run well beyond the 8 hour hrt for the nitrification reactors at the study wwtp in order to gauge trends of tcs tcc and transformation product concentrations 200 ml samples were collected at

were used to determine compound degradation or formation rates where applicable via equation 1 1 ln c c 0 k t where c is the target compound concentration at a given time point co is the initial concentrations of the target compound t is time and k is the degradation rate 3 1 triclosan and its transformation products 3 1 1 triclosan the majority of the tcs mass in the nitrification reactors was sorbed to the solids matrix at both experimental ph ranges fig 1 a at a ph range of 6 5 7 5 tcs concentrations decreased under nitrifying conditions at an average rate of 0 0195 0 006 h 1 until approximately 37 49 hours after which concentrations leveled out and did not change significantly conversely when the reactors were run at a ph range of 8 5 9 5 tcs was consistently degraded over the 171 hour period at a rate of 0 0101 0 005 h 1 after 171 h concentrations of tcs were reduced by 28 5 0 09 at a ph range of 6 5 7 5 and 83 2 0 05 at a ph range of 8 5 9 5 demonstrating an increased efficiency over the course of the experiments of compound removal from the solids phase during nitrification at a higher ph range additionally tcs degradation continued to occur beyond the 8 hour mark under both treatment conditions demonstrating that extending treatment beyond facility hrt led to increased degradation of tcs concentrations of tcs in the aqueous fraction fig 1b of nitrification samples did not significantly change over the 171 hour period when the bioreactors were run at a ph range of 6 5 7 5 linear regression slope test p 0 2034 and 8 5 9 5 linear regression slope test p 0 8329 average concentrations in aqueous samples were below 2 5 ng ml under reactor conditions decreases of tcs in the solids phase and stagnation of compound concentrations in the aqueous phase during experiments run at a ph range of 8 5 9 5 occurred despite an increase in the ionization of tcs in this range pka 8 1 42 this indicates that the compound was not simply redistributing into the aqueous phase due to increased solubility but rather was removed during the course of the experiments furthermore while photolysis has been shown to be a more efficient means of tcs removal at high ph levels 43 reactors were covered completely with aluminum foil to prevent this type of reaction observations within this study that demonstrate that tcs can be degraded under nitrifying conditions are consistent with those within the literature roh et al 2009 found that a pure culture of the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrosomonas europaea has the ability to biodegrade the antimicrobial via cometabolic reactions in experiments carried out in 1 l flasks the bacterial strain reduced tcs concentrations by over 60 additionally the authors demonstrated the tcs could be significantly removed by nitrifying activated sludge samples over a 5 day period concluding that both aob and heterotrophic microbes possess the ability to biodegrade the compound 33 laboratory scale simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd reactors operated with synthetic wastewater resulted in high tcs removal rates seventy seven percent 77 of tcs removal from the snds was attributed to various processes which included biodegradation but not sorption or removal via effluent 44 however while these experiments demonstrate the ability of microbial populations associated with nitrification

14442,the prime objective of the present study is to establish the ultra high lime alumina uhla process for desalination of clarified water at commercial scale whereas very limited information is available for such purpose this process was used for removal of chloride from coke quenching water having high salinity the process parameters were optimized with help of the design of experiment as the kinetics of uhla process plays a major role in deducing proper sizing of stirred tank reactor a model has developed with help of non linear optimization technique for evaluation of kinetics parameters using the data obtained from pilot plant study the process followed second order reaction kinetics with 80 chloride removal efficiency a detailed analysis and characterization of input water treated water and solid waste were conducted that would help us to access the further utilization of solid material generated in uhla process the process feasibility has been established for commercialization of the present process in steel industry perspective keywords desalination nonlinear kinetics water treatment ultra high lime alumina process 1 introduction industrial wastewater management wants to establish zero discharge system where water recycling plays a major role the effluent discharge from blast furnace of a steel industry has a major concern considering the detrimental effect on the environment because of the presence of toxic chemicals including organic and inorganic materials amongst these contaminants chloride is a deleterious ionic species because it promotes corrosion in pipelines 1 3 by a number of mechanisms including enhancing the corrosion effect of oxygen and co2 the chloride contamination takes place during quenching of hot coke with saline process water fig 1 in general practise the process water is taken from rivers which are connected to the sea and during summer season the concentration of chloride in quenching or process water is increased manifold chloride is trapped inside the porous structure of coke during steel making process at very high temperature in blast furnace 1100 c chloride comes out from coke high concentrated chloride corrodes the gas cleaning pipelines pumps etc significantly which requires maintenance and replacement very frequently even twice in a year many methods like reverse osmosis ion exchange and electro dialysis have been used to remove chloride 4 6 from wastewater however lime softening is the cheapest method of all treatment alternatives for recycling the cooling water 7 furthermore the use of other technologies is limited due to operating problems such as fouling of membranes that lead to frequent cleaning of the membrane also such process produces brine which has a problem for disposal 8 they are also sensitive to water quality and water temperature 9 additionally pre treatment is needed in most cases 10 the uhla process is an innovative technology with excellent potential for efficient use in industrial water treatment to achieve zero discharge chloride can be removed from water with help of uhla process through precipitation as calcium chloro aluminate a layered double hydroxide ldh with chemical formula ca4al2cl2 oh 12 also known as friedel s salt 11 12 calcium chloro aluminate is composed of positively charged main layers of composition ca2aloh 6 and negatively charged interlayers of composition cl 2h2o the chloride anions are surrounded by 10 hydrogen atoms of which six belong to hydroxyl groups and four of water molecules the uhla is an innovative modification of ultra high lime process in which aluminum is added to facilitate the removal of sulfate as calcium sulfoaluminate ca6al2 so4 3 oh 12 which is a low solubility product 13 16 the complex formation depends on the ph temperature and sulfate availability it has been reported that the most favorable ph conditions for the formation and stability of ettringite are in the range of 11 and 12 5 17 18 the exploratory work on sulfate removal by abdel wahab and batchelor revealed that the sulfate removal kinetics can be implemented in practical purposes 19 20 the uhla process has demonstrated the ability to achieve high sulfate removal efficiency 21 23 in addition to sulfate exclusion it also removes major scale forming materials such as ca2 mg2 sio2 po4 3 and co3 2 the process can also be utilized to remove chloride from water the conditions of uhla are suitable for removing chloride through formation of calcium chloroaluminate ca4al2cl2 oh 12 24 despite the attractiveness of uhla process there is limited data to support its application for chloride removal an extensive research work has been found in the context on different ions removal from cooling water 19 20 but all the data is limited to the laboratory scale activities and far way behind commercialization also there are limited data available on characterization of the solid and kinetics of the formation of calcium chloro aluminate during the reaction of uhla process the main bottleneck of the process is the non availability of techno economic feasibility to develop uhla process at industrial level it is very important to understand one must understand the kinetics of the process quality parameters and characterization of generated solid waste in the process the kinetics of the process has not been elaborated much for the above said process beyond the laboratory scale therefore the goal of this research is to evaluate the process efficiency for chloride removal from saline water used for quenching process through uhla technique and to understand the kinetics of calcium chloro aluminate precipitation as well as detail characterization the solids this work also reveals the effect of chemical doses water quality ph and initial chloride concentration on the process at pilot scale level a pilot plant has been developed and installed at hoogly met coke a subsidiary company of tata steel ltd haldia india to address the challenges for commercialization of uhla process with real process water used for coke quenching the present article attempts to portray the use of uhla process at 5 m3 h continuous pilot plant solid sludge generated was characterized critically to evaluate the fate of reject the entire process is continuous and optimized with the help of design of experiment finally based on the plant results recommendation has been given for encouraging steel plants towards adoption of the process for desalination purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot plant set up the process flow diagram of the same pilot plant has been shown in the fig 2 the entire unit consist of three agitated tank three storage tank two settling tank two centrifugal pumps and four number of dosing pumps ph sensor has been introduced at the mixing vessel and the final settling tank to measure the ph of the process two agitated tanks were used for reagent preparation one was for slacker and another one for sodium aluminate solution preparation proper dosing rate and the input water flow rate can be set as per the residence time maintained inside the main mixing tank the second settling tank was able to eliminate almost 99 5 slurry all the slurry from both the settling tank was sent to a pit to maintain suspended solid level 50 ntu one pressure filter followed by cartridge filter has been attached in downstream of the second settling tank these filters can manage to trap the particle having size of 5 to 10 μm level discharged water from the filter was found to be clear and can be connected with the quenching pond ph was adjusted in the main reactor and in the second settling tank by an acetic acid dosing pump thus a continuous process was executed for removal chloride 2 2 experimental method uhla process has been applied with varying ph reagent concentration dosing sequence and time of reaction time of reaction has been set to one hour as per kinetic analysis of the process dosing sequence was also identified based on some preliminary experimentation and the ph was fixed at 12 3 as the cost of reagent was high the dosing sequence was maintained accurately at optimized condition in order to get maximum removal of chloride a design of experiment doe was made to evaluate the optimum parametric condition by box behnken method table 1 shows the factor and level of variation of the factors and table 2 represents the percentage of chloride removal with variation of factors all the experimentations are being conducted at the reaction time of 3 h 3 results discussion 3 1 kinetic study reaction time is one of the major factors which can reduce operating cost significantly kinetic analysis can reveal the retention time of the reaction although bachelor and mcdevitt 25 explained that the kinetics of silica removal by ultra high lime process was very fast therefore a rigorous experimentation is essential at large scale to optimize the rate equation for uhla process it is obvious that laboratory scale study is unable to predict the intricate relationship between the process parameters thus a pilot trial was conducted in order to study the kinetics of chloride removal and to obtain the time required to reach equilibrium or at least metastable equilibrium samples were taken filtered and analyzed for chloride at a time interval of 10 min in a span of 60 min data points were used to evaluate rate constant and reaction order rate law parameters reaction rate rc and specific rate constants can be evaluated using the result obtained from single experiment by using non linear least square technique with help of the matlab software the optimizer algorithm will search for those values that will minimize the sum of the squared differences of the measured reaction rates rm and the calculated reaction rates rc the sum of rm rc 2 for all data points should be minimum for n number of experiments the optimizer would be executed to find out the parameter values e g rate constant reaction order etc that would minimize the quantity σ sum of squares which can be defined in eq 1 1 σ 2 s 2 n k i 1 i n r i m r i c 2 n k where k is the number of parameter to be estimated here the required value of k is 2 in the present study a new algorithm has been developed with combination of non linear optimization and ode ordinary differential equation solver fig 3 first initial parameters k0 and n0 has been supplied to optimizer model optimizer has calculated new values of k and n based on non linear algorithm where jacobeans and hessian matrix were calculated with the help of levenberg marquardt algorithm the new estimated k and n value move to the solver where stiff ode has been solved by ode23s package provided in matlab now ode is calculated by concentration values which denoted as xcalculated fig 3 then this calculated values compared with experimental values if error values exhibit more than threshold tolerance of 0 001 the whole algorithm will iterate if the desired tolerance is achieved then programme will converge and gives the value of final k and n theoretical model value a typical kinetics data was ontained from the concentration of reactants with respect to time but as the concertation varied with time at any magnitude it was relatively difficult to capture the entire kinetics by optimization method on the above mentioned basis therefore the entire concentration data had been normalized to evaluate all the kinetics parameters at optimized condition on the scale of 0 to 100 the normalized ion intensities were calculated according to the following equation 2 n c l 100 100 i m a x i t i m a x i m i n where ncl is the normalized ion intensity imax is the maximum concentraton it is the concetration at time t and imin is the minimum concentration hence the kinetic parameters were obtained from the variation of normalized concentration with respect to time in chemical kinetics the overall rate of a reaction is often approximately determined by the slowest step known as the rate determining step in the present study following conditions has been executed during experiment to capture exact rate determining step and thereby order or the process or complete rate expression three reactants a b and c with different concentration were reacted to produce the product d 3 a b c d where a denotes sodium aluminate b is calcium hydroxide c is sodium chloride and product d calcium chloro aluminate evaluating the higher order reaction rate with reactants a b and c involved in this case can be problematic a common solution for that problem is the pseudo first order approximation the rate equation of the above reaction eq 3 can be expressed as eq 4 4 r a k c a a c b b c c c where ca cb and cc are concentration of reactant a b and c whereas a b and c are order of the reaction with respect to reactant a b and c respectively and k is rate constant the concentration of a was taken 5 gm lit and concentration of b 100 gm lit and c 200 gm lit were taken into excess amount then the change in concentration of b and c remain unchanged during the reaction hence above eq 4 becomes 5 r a k c a a where k k c b b c c c hence the non linear optimizer has been applied for simulation the measured value of k was 0 0578 and order of the reaction was found to be 1 0323 which can be considered as 1 therefore the eq 5 becomes 6 r a 0 0578 c a the eq 6 devotes that reaction is first order reaction with respect to a the concentration of b was used as 8 gm lit and a 100 gm lit and c 200 gm lit were taken in to excess amount as explained earlier hence eq 4 can be written as 7 r a k c b b where k k c a a c c c similarly by solving non linear optimizer model it was measured that order of reaction and rate constant was 1 and 0 4452 respectively hence eq 7 becomes 8 r a 0 4452 c a in the final case concentration of c is kept nominal at 2 gm lit and concentration of a and b taken as excess amount the expression becomes from eq 4 9 r a k c c c where k k c a a c b b after solving the measured value of rate constant and order of the reaction was 1 3857 and 0 07 approximately 0 those value implies that the reaction is zero order with respect to c this is zeroth order reaction hence reaction becomes 10 r a 1 3857 c c 0 finally it was estimated considering three different rate constant value as well as different concentration of the reactants that rate of reaction ra overall rate constant k and order of the reaction n was 0 3 0 0079 and 2 respectively fig 4 shows that model predictive data is very near to the experimental data therefore it may be concluded that kinetics should not be a limitation to applying the uhla process for commercial case 3 2 the effect of ph of the medium a range of ph values 11 12 3 and uncontrolled 13 2 was investigated with three different initial concentrations of chloride to study the effect of ph on chloride removal through uhla the dosing of lime and aluminum were kept constant at 200 and 100 of initial chloride concentration respectively fig 5 shows the effect of ph on a particular chloride concentrations the cl removal at ph 12 is found to be greater than removal at ph 13 this result is in good agreement with the result obtained by ahmed et al 26 they reported that the chloride removal was optimum at ph in between 11 12 26 and high ph 13 was detrimental to the uhla process at low ph values formation of afm type ldhs e g calcium chloro aluminate calcium hydroxyl aluminate was not favored and hence chloride concentration was high the chloride removal was increased with increament of ph as the formation of afm phases became favorable and at the same time formation of both calcium chloro aluminate and calcium hydroxyl aluminate was expedited this trend continued until ph reaches the optimum value for calcium chloro aluminate precipitation ph 12 5 moreover ph value higher than the reported level precipitation of calcium hydroxyl aluminate becomes more favorable than precipitation of calcium chloro aluminate 3 3 optimization of process parameters the optimization of every chemical is essential to establish the process feasibility for commercialization of any chemical process fig 6 represent the cl removal percentage with change of reagent dosing it was observed that the cl removal increased with increase of lime dosing keeping the naalo2 was fixed at 3 kg and 5 kg but the removal remained unchanged even with increase in lime dosing at 7 kg naalo2 the fig 6 indicates that if the sodium aluminate concentration is too low then the variation of lime does not impart much in the system but when the concentration of sodium aluminate exceeds a threshold value it starts affecting the system significantly with the variation of lime as per the pareto chart fig 7 sodium aluminate only crosses the 5 confidence level interval which implies sodium aluminate has the maximum influence on the process this also implies lime concentration is not the limiting factor sodium aluminate has ability to change process performance as sodium aluminate is a costly regent the entire process feasibility is directly depends upon the amount of sodium aluminate consumption the result of doe is very much in agreement with the kinetics developed for the process the rate of the reaction of the uhla depends upon sodium aluminate and hence it follows a first order kinetics with respect to sodium aluminate 3 4 characterization of feed treated water the quality parameters of the feed and treated water of a typical set of experiment and the degree of separation achieved against different impurities has been depicted in table 3 hardness was removed almost by 90 as ca and mg ions were removed from the water iron was also removed from the water by 60 most importantly cl and so4 2 ions were removed from the water by more than 80 batchelor and mcdevit 21 also reported the process was appricable towards sulphate removal apart from desalination efficiency moreover this process was capable of removal other major scale forming material also as lime was used for removal of major scale forming material such as calcium magnesium and phosphate the same benefit could be observed here one major drawback in uhla process is a significant amount of tds is enhanced in the system due to the contribution of na ion in the form of sodium aluminate none of the work being found emphasizing this problem however the increament in tds should not affect the coke quality because of solubility of na is very high in any solution 3 5 characterization of solid waste the solid contains mainly al 7 8 ca 27 30 and chlorine 4 5 as elements which might be combined to form complex compound and loss of ignition loi is around 37 40 the result of chemical analysis shows some indication that it can be used in other process industries based on the chemical analysis a structure has been proposed for the generated solid which is very close to the structure of hydrocalumite fig 8 3 5 1 xrd analysis xrd spectrum of solid precipitated have been shown in the fig 9 the solids are identified by comparing the peaks and the corresponding interplanar spacing d values in å with standard data in the panicsd database the xrd patterns showed the presence of hydrocalumite at 2θ 11 30 31 32 37 and 40 degrees having d spacing value 7 8 3 9 2 9 2 8 2 4 and 2 2 å respectively at all investigated experimental conditions since hydrocalumite like compounds crystallize in a hexagonal lattice cell the parameter α of the fresh samples was found to be 5 75 a from the formula a 2d 110 using the reflection located at 31 on the other hand as cao crystallize in cubic lattices their cell parameter α was found to be 4 83 a from the formulas a 2d 200 using the reflections found at 37 4 of 2θ moreover a minor phase of caco3 icsd 98 015 8257 could also be identified the basic conditions of synthesis of hydrocalumite permitted the formation caco3 due to absorption of atmospheric co2 3 5 2 ftir analysis the reject solid was characterized by ft ir fig 10 the broader absorption band at 3639 cm 1 represents the stretching vibration of hydroxyl group from the lattice water molecule along with surface adsorbed water 27 and broadening arisen due to hydrogen bonding existing between these species in addition a shoulder peak at 3590 cm 1 has been observed in spectra which may be attributed to the stretching mode of oh groups bonded to ca2 cations also a strong band at 3468 cm 1 is related to the oh stretching frequency in the portlandite like layers of hydrocalumite the shoulder peak around 1618 cm 1 is due to the deformation mode of water molecules and the other weak bands like band at 1411 cm 1 are due to co stretching from surface carbonate or hydrogen carbonate species formed by adsorption of atmospheric co2 on the external surface of the crystallites during handling to record the spectrum the strong band at 1108 cm 1 is assigned to the si o si asymmetric stretching vibrations and the stretching and deformation of al o vibrations and al oh were observed at 961 and 789 cm 1 respectively the absorption band at 516 and 430 cm 1 correspond to cao and caoca the bending vibration of osio reflects at the wavenumber of 471 cm 1 the ft ir spectrum of the reject solid powder has been found almost similar spectra of hydrocalumite and calcite which is also in very good agreement with the xrd results 4 cost economics an exhaustive detail cost economics has been done based on above pilot sacle study in comparision with the standard ro membrae process the propsoed plant capasity is around 180 200 m3 hr the calculated value for capital expenditure capex for the uhla plant will be around 1700 lakh inr indian rupees and the operation cost opex will be 500 lakh inr for this plant which includes chemicals electricity labour charges transport etc thus cost for 1 m3 water treatment is around 30 inr wheras the treatment cost for ro membrane is around 200 inr per one cubic meter of water thus the cost of treatment directly goes down sigificantly moreover the major problem associated with ro treatment is handling of reject as the reject is either to be consumed internally or to be treated via evaporation route which is very costly affair on the other hand in uhla process calcium chloroaluminate is generated reject and the rate of generation is 1 of total water treatment thus 180 m3 h treatment plant usually generates 1 8 ton of solid per hour based on the composition analysis and trials with waste material we found it could be a suitable raw material of paint as the sludge contains high amount of al and ca it gives a good binding property towards the paint thererfore uhla process not only reoves chloride from water but also a by product is generated which is a raw material for paint industry however the extra benefit incurred from selling sludge has not been considered in cost economy calculation 5 conclusion the present article focused towards the commercialization of uhla process for desalination of process water used for coke quenching the process had been evaluated at a continuous pilot plant scale having capacity of 5 m3 h the results were very encouraging and the current process was able to remove almost 80 desalinate from feed water the kinetics of the process was second order moreover a detailed investigation had been done to realize the ph effect on the rate of the reaction the solid waste generated during the process was characterized and the composition of solid was mainly hydrocalumite and calcium carbonate which is very essential ingredient for other process industries e g paint industry moreover uhla process is more economic than conventional ro process thus the present process may catch up an attractive feasible direction to remove salinity from process water for steel industries

the process flow diagram of the same pilot plant has been shown in the fig 2 the entire unit consist of three agitated tank three storage tank two settling tank two centrifugal pumps and four number of dosing pumps ph sensor has been introduced at the mixing vessel and the final settling tank to measure the ph of the process two agitated tanks were used for reagent preparation one was for slacker and another one for sodium aluminate solution preparation proper dosing rate and the input water flow rate can be set as per the residence time maintained inside the main mixing tank the second

accurately at optimized condition in order to get maximum removal of chloride a design of experiment doe was made to evaluate the optimum parametric condition by box behnken method table 1 shows the factor and level of variation of the factors and table 2 represents the percentage of chloride removal with variation of factors all the experimentations are being conducted at the reaction time of 3 h 3 results discussion 3 1 kinetic study reaction time is one of the major factors which can reduce operating cost significantly kinetic analysis can reveal the retention time of the reaction although bachelor and mcdevitt 25 explained that the kinetics of silica removal by ultra high lime process was very fast therefore a rigorous experimentation is essential at large scale to optimize the rate equation for uhla process it is obvious that laboratory scale study is unable to predict the intricate relationship between the process parameters thus a pilot trial was conducted in order to study

from single experiment by using non linear least square technique with help of the matlab software the optimizer algorithm will search for those values that will minimize the sum of the squared

the number of parameter to be estimated here the required value of k is 2 in the present study a new algorithm has been developed with combination of non linear optimization and ode ordinary differential equation solver fig 3 first initial parameters k0 and n0 has been supplied to optimizer model optimizer has calculated new values of k and n based on non linear algorithm where jacobeans and hessian matrix were calculated with the help of levenberg marquardt algorithm the new estimated k and n value move to the solver where stiff ode has been solved by ode23s package provided in matlab now ode is calculated by concentration values which denoted as xcalculated fig 3 then this calculated values compared with experimental values if error values exhibit more than threshold tolerance of 0 001 the whole algorithm will iterate if the desired tolerance is achieved then programme will converge and gives the value of final k and n theoretical model value a typical kinetics data was ontained from the concentration of reactants with respect to time but as the concertation varied with time at any magnitude it was relatively difficult to capture the entire kinetics by optimization method on the above mentioned basis therefore the entire concentration data had been normalized to evaluate all the kinetics parameters at optimized condition on the scale of 0 to 100 the normalized ion intensities were calculated according to the following equation 2 n c l 100 100 i m a x i t i m a x i m i n where ncl is the normalized ion intensity imax is the maximum concentraton it is the concetration at time t and imin is the minimum concentration hence the kinetic parameters were obtained from the variation of normalized concentration with respect to time in chemical kinetics the overall rate of a reaction is often approximately determined by the slowest step known as the rate determining step in the present study following conditions has been executed during experiment to capture exact rate determining step and thereby order or the process or complete rate expression three reactants a b and c with different concentration were reacted to produce the product d 3 a b c d where a denotes sodium aluminate b is calcium hydroxide c is sodium chloride and product d calcium chloro aluminate evaluating the higher order reaction rate with reactants a b and c involved in this case can be problematic a common solution for that problem is the pseudo first order approximation the rate equation of the above reaction eq 3 can be expressed as eq 4 4 r a k c a a c b b c c c where ca cb and cc are concentration of reactant a b and c whereas a b and c are order of the reaction with respect to reactant a b and c respectively and k is rate constant the concentration of a was taken 5 gm lit and concentration of b 100 gm lit and c 200 gm lit were taken into excess amount then the change in concentration of b and c remain unchanged during the reaction hence above eq 4 becomes 5 r a k c a a where k k c b b c c c hence the non linear optimizer has been applied for simulation the measured value of k was 0 0578 and order of the reaction was found to be 1 0323 which can be considered as 1 therefore the eq 5 becomes 6 r a 0 0578 c a the eq 6 devotes that reaction is first order reaction with respect to a the concentration of b was used as 8 gm lit and a 100 gm lit and c 200 gm lit were taken in to excess amount as explained earlier hence eq 4 can be written as 7 r a k c b b where k k c a a c c c similarly by solving non linear optimizer model it was measured that order of reaction and rate constant was 1 and 0 4452 respectively hence eq 7 becomes 8 r a 0 4452 c a in the final case concentration of c is kept nominal at 2 gm lit and concentration of a and b taken as excess amount the expression becomes from eq 4 9 r a k c c c where k k c a a c b b after solving the measured value of rate constant and order of the reaction was 1 3857 and 0 07 approximately 0 those value implies that the reaction is zero order with respect to c this is zeroth order reaction hence reaction becomes 10 r a 1 3857 c c 0 finally it was estimated considering three different rate constant value as well as different concentration of the reactants that rate of reaction ra overall rate constant k and order of the reaction n was 0 3 0 0079 and 2 respectively fig 4 shows that model predictive data is very near to the experimental data therefore it may be concluded that kinetics should not be a limitation to applying the uhla process for commercial case 3 2 the effect of ph of the medium a range of ph values 11 12 3 and uncontrolled 13 2 was investigated with three different initial concentrations of chloride to study the effect of ph on chloride removal through uhla the dosing of lime and aluminum were kept constant at 200 and 100 of initial chloride concentration respectively fig 5 shows the effect of ph on a particular chloride concentrations the cl removal at ph 12 is found to be greater than removal at ph 13 this result is in good agreement with the result obtained by ahmed et al 26 they reported that the chloride removal was optimum at ph in between 11 12 26 and high ph 13 was detrimental to the uhla process at low ph values formation of afm type ldhs e g calcium chloro aluminate calcium hydroxyl aluminate was not favored and hence chloride concentration was high the chloride removal was increased with increament of ph as the formation of afm phases became favorable and at the same time formation of both calcium chloro aluminate and calcium hydroxyl aluminate was expedited this trend continued until ph reaches the optimum value for calcium chloro aluminate precipitation ph 12 5 moreover ph value higher than the reported level precipitation of calcium hydroxyl aluminate becomes more favorable than precipitation of calcium chloro aluminate 3 3 optimization of process parameters the optimization of every chemical is essential to establish the process feasibility for commercialization of any chemical process fig 6 represent the cl removal percentage with change of reagent dosing it was observed that the cl removal increased with increase of lime dosing keeping the naalo2 was fixed at 3 kg and 5 kg but the removal remained unchanged even with increase in lime dosing at 7 kg naalo2 the fig 6 indicates that if the sodium aluminate concentration is too low then the variation of lime does not impart much in the system but when the concentration of sodium aluminate exceeds a threshold value it starts affecting the system significantly with the variation of lime as per the pareto chart fig 7 sodium aluminate only crosses the 5 confidence level interval which implies sodium aluminate has the maximum influence on the process this also implies lime concentration is not the limiting factor sodium aluminate has ability to change process performance as sodium aluminate is a costly regent the entire process feasibility is directly depends upon the amount of sodium aluminate consumption the result of doe is very much in agreement with the kinetics developed for the process the rate of the reaction of the uhla depends upon sodium aluminate and hence it follows a first order kinetics with respect to sodium aluminate 3 4 characterization of feed treated water the quality parameters of the feed and treated water of a typical set of experiment and the degree of separation achieved against different impurities has been depicted in table 3 hardness was removed almost by 90 as ca and mg ions were removed from the water iron was also removed from the water by 60 most importantly cl and so4 2 ions were removed from the water by more than 80 batchelor and mcdevit 21 also reported the process was appricable towards sulphate removal apart from desalination efficiency moreover this process was capable of removal other major scale forming material also as lime was used for removal of major scale forming material such as calcium magnesium and phosphate the same benefit could be observed here one major drawback in uhla process is a significant amount of tds is enhanced in the system due to the contribution of na ion in the form of sodium aluminate none of the work being found emphasizing this problem however the increament in tds should not affect the coke quality because of solubility of na is very high in any solution 3 5 characterization of solid waste the solid contains mainly al 7 8 ca 27 30 and chlorine 4 5 as elements which might be combined to form complex compound and loss of ignition loi is around 37 40 the result of chemical analysis shows some indication that it can be used in other process industries based on the chemical analysis a structure has been proposed for the generated solid which is very close to the structure of hydrocalumite fig 8 3 5 1 xrd analysis xrd spectrum of solid precipitated have been shown in the fig 9 the solids are identified by comparing the peaks and the corresponding interplanar spacing d values in å with standard data in the panicsd database the xrd patterns showed the presence of hydrocalumite at 2θ 11 30 31 32 37 and 40 degrees having d spacing value 7 8 3 9 2 9 2 8 2 4 and 2 2 å respectively at all investigated experimental conditions since hydrocalumite like compounds crystallize in a hexagonal lattice cell the parameter α of the fresh samples was found to be 5 75 a from the formula a 2d 110 using the reflection located at 31 on the other hand as cao crystallize in cubic lattices their cell parameter α was found to be 4 83 a from the formulas a 2d 200 using the reflections found at 37 4 of 2θ moreover a minor phase of caco3 icsd 98 015 8257 could also be identified the basic conditions of synthesis of hydrocalumite permitted the formation caco3 due to absorption of atmospheric co2 3 5 2 ftir analysis the reject solid was characterized by ft ir fig 10 the broader absorption band at 3639 cm 1 represents the stretching vibration of hydroxyl group from the lattice water molecule along with surface adsorbed water 27 and broadening arisen due to hydrogen bonding existing between these species in addition a shoulder peak at 3590 cm 1 has been observed in spectra which may be attributed to the stretching mode of oh groups bonded to ca2 cations also a strong band at 3468 cm 1 is related to the oh stretching frequency in the portlandite like layers of hydrocalumite the shoulder peak around 1618 cm 1 is due to the deformation mode of water molecules and the other weak bands like band at 1411 cm 1 are due to co stretching from surface carbonate or hydrogen carbonate species formed by adsorption of atmospheric co2 on the external surface of the crystallites during handling to record the spectrum the strong band at 1108 cm 1 is assigned to the si o si asymmetric stretching vibrations and the stretching and deformation of al o vibrations and al oh were observed at 961 and 789 cm 1 respectively the absorption band at 516 and 430 cm 1 correspond to cao and caoca the bending vibration of osio reflects at the wavenumber of 471 cm 1 the ft ir spectrum of the reject solid powder has been found almost similar spectra of hydrocalumite and calcite which is also in very good agreement with the xrd results 4 cost economics an exhaustive detail cost economics has been done based on above pilot sacle study in comparision with the standard ro membrae process the propsoed plant capasity is around 180 200 m3 hr the calculated value for capital expenditure capex for the uhla plant will be around 1700 lakh inr indian rupees and the operation cost opex will be 500 lakh inr for this plant which includes chemicals electricity labour charges transport etc thus cost for 1 m3 water treatment is around 30 inr wheras the treatment cost for ro membrane is around 200 inr per one cubic meter of water thus the cost of treatment directly goes down sigificantly moreover the major problem associated with ro treatment is handling of reject as the reject is either to be consumed internally or to be treated via evaporation route which is very costly affair on the other hand in uhla process calcium chloroaluminate is generated reject and the rate of generation is 1 of total water treatment thus 180 m3 h treatment plant usually generates 1 8 ton of solid per hour based on the composition analysis and trials with waste material we found it could be a suitable raw material of paint as the sludge contains high amount of al and ca it gives a good binding property towards the paint thererfore uhla process not only reoves chloride from water but also a by product is generated which is a raw material for paint industry however the extra benefit incurred from selling sludge has not been considered in cost economy calculation 5 conclusion the present article focused towards the commercialization of uhla process for desalination of process water used for coke quenching the process had been evaluated at a continuous pilot plant scale having capacity of 5 m3 h the results were very encouraging and the current process was able to remove almost 80 desalinate from feed water the kinetics of the process was second order moreover a detailed investigation had been done to realize the ph effect on the rate of the reaction the solid waste generated during the process was characterized and the composition of solid was mainly hydrocalumite and calcium carbonate which is very essential ingredient for other process industries e g paint industry moreover uhla process is more economic than conventional ro process thus the present process may catch up an attractive feasible direction to remove salinity from process water for steel industries 
14443,in this research the application of the organic complexing agent oxalic acid in photo fenton reaction was assessed in the treatment of landfill leachate using a lab scale photoreactor with coupled uvvis irradiation the operational parameters fe3 and initial ph were studied in central composite rotatable design and assessed through a response surface methodology the best operational conditions were observed at ph 7 8 and 90 mg fe3 l 1 with around 5 8 kj l 1 accumulated energy and consumption of approximately 220 mm of h2o2 obtaining reductions of 52 5 and 47 0 in color and abs 254 nm respectively a high efficiency of the mediated photo fenton process as a function of the accumulated energy profile 0 0 9 8 kj l 1 was observed with significant reductions of biochemical oxygen demand chemical oxygen demand total dissolved carbon and dissolved organic carbon as well as an increase in the biodegradability ratio additionally a high degradation of several molecular structures present in the landfill leachate was observed via gas chromatography mass spectrometry which was associated with the low toxicity of the treated effluent lc50 of 67 showed by the artemia salina bioassays thus the mediated photo fenton process presented a high efficiency in the reduction of the toxic effects of the landfill leachate contributing with the minimization of the environmental impacts caused by its discharge in soils or water bodies keywords landfill leachate mediated photo fenton process toxicity bioassays recalcitrant byproducts 1 introduction a large amount of natural resources is daily extracted from the environment and transformed in goods in order to improve quality of life of the society and keep its consumption patterns 1 alongside this there has been a reduction on the life cycle of the goods leading to a high generation of solid waste which demands an environmentally proper disposal 2 landfills are efficient conventional technologies applied to the final disposal of solid waste in which its decomposition occurs by chemical physical and biological processes generating landfill leachate ll as a byproduct 3 5 the main characteristics of ll are a high toxicity and a low biodegradability fraction 6 containing predominantly dissolved organic matter such as refractory compounds humic and fulvic acids inorganic micropollutants ca2 mg2 na k nh4 fe2 mn2 cl so4 2 hco3 heavy metals cd2 cr3 cu2 pb2 ni2 zn2 xenobiotic organic compounds aromatic hydrocarbons phenols chlorinated aliphatics pesticides and plastizers 7 seeking alternatives for the minimization of the adverse impacts of the disposal of ll in water bodies several researches on treatment methods have been developed such as electrochemical 8 10 electrochemical integrated with biological oxidation 11 photo fenton mediated by organic complexes 12 membrane bioreactor 13 15 adsorption 16 conventional coagulation flocculation 17 18 ultrafiltration 19 nanofiltration 20 reverse osmosis 21 22 the complexity of ll requires processes that present high efficiency in degradation mineralization of refractory and recalcitrant pollutants as well as in the increase of the biodegradability fraction of the effluent within this context advanced oxidation processes aops can be highlighted 12 23 being also investigated in the decontamination of textile effluents 24 26 tannery industrial wastewater 27 29 and winery wastewater 30 31 among the aops the photo fenton process has been the subject of several studies being based on the production of hydroxyl radicals oh by the simultaneous combination of h2o2 fe2 ions ph near 2 8 and an uv vis irradiation source of wavelength up to 550 nm 32 34 more recent studies have investigated the possibility of using organic complexing agents such as edta 12 35 and citric acid 36 in the conventional photo fenton reaction aiming to provide a higher amount of fe2 ions solution at intermediate ph values between 5 0 and 8 0 12 35 and convert persistent pollutants into co2 h2o and inorganic ions 37 38 the complexing agent oxalic acid can increase the efficiency of the conventional photo fenton oxidation process due the in situ production of ferrioxalate complexes 39 40 these complexes are more photosensitive with irradiation spectral range up to 580 nm thus providing a faster regeneration of fe2 to fe3 and increasing the production of oh which attack the target pollutants forming other radicals that in the absence of ferrioxalate fe2 c2o4 react with oxygen and form hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 see eqs 1 3 in the presence of fe c2o4 3 3 fe2 is continuously generated and reacts with h2o2 avoiding the production of less oxidative and more selective radicals see eq 4 39 41 43 1 fe2 c2o4 h2o2 hv fe3 c2o4 oh oh 2

the influence of the rop on the response variables 49 after preliminary tests data not shown solution ph j1 and fe3 mg l 1 j2 were defined as the rop to be investigated the reductions of color and abs 254 nm of the ll were chosen as independent variables the experimental runs were proposed by a 22 central composite rotatable design ccrd with two independent variables n 2 triplicates at the central point and four axial points totalizing 11 experiments as shown in table 1 the data were adjusted according to an empirical polynomial second order model eq 6 applying the lagrange criteria 50 and the

treated ll a salina was previously reported by researchers 53 as a toxicity bioindicator with advantages compared to indirect methods such as low cost great sensitivity to toxic substances and a fast response which is used to estimate directly the real toxicity levels following methodology described in literature 54 were hatched for 48 h in a nutrient solution the samples of ll were diluted in v v fractions of 20 40 60 80 and 100 in order to obtain a partitioned reduction of the its toxicity samples of ll with no dilution were also included in the bioassays 5 ml of the ll samples were pipetted in 10 ml bioassay tubes ten nauplii of a salina specie were put into each of the 5 ml bioassay sample in triplicate the bioassay samples with the nauplii were held for 24 h under the presence of light in a laminar flow cabinet the number of living a salina nauplii was counted at the end of each bioassay and the median lethal concentration lc50 was calculated using functions based on the trimmed spearman karber method 55 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the untreated ll a high load of organic compounds was observed in the characterization of the untreated ll identified through the high concentrations of doc cod bod5 and nitrogen as well as high values of absorbance at 254 nm associated with the simple and conjugated aromatic compounds indicating high concentrations of polyphenols see table 2 12 these characteristics are suggested to be related to the degradation of waste in the landfill cells a large variety of organic compounds with different molecular structures was identified via gc ms see table 3 including diamylphthalate rt 9 9 min that is considered toxic to human and animal health having inhibitory effects on nicotinic receptors of humans and animals 56 and bisphenol a tr 14 46 which even is low concentrations presents high toxicity to aquatic ecosystems and human health acting as an endocrine disruptor and causing several reproductive problems 57 similar characterizations of untreated ll were observed by klauck et al 58 which highlighted the presence of alkanes alkenes ketones alcohols and carboxylic acids the presence of these compounds may cause inefficiency in the biological degradation of organic matter contributing to the pollution potential and persistence of these contaminants in the environment 59 3 2 central composite rotatable design based on preliminary tests data not show a central composite rotatable design ccrd was proposed with the investigation parameters ph and fe3 in ranges of 2 2 7 8 and 48 132 mg l 1 respectively all the experimental runs were carried out with an accumulated energy quv of 5 8 kj l 1 and a molar ratio of 1 3 fe3 oxalic acid table 4 reductions of color from 4 99 to 52 5 and abs 254 nm from 17 8 to 47 0 were reached with the mediated photo fenton process a positive interaction between the studied variables was observed through the reduction of the investigated responses suggesting the rop had a direct influence in the photo fenton processes mediated by oxalic acid an analysis of variance anova with a 95 confidence level was applied to assess the adjustment of the second order polynomial model to the obtained experimental responses see table 5 the f test validated the model for the studied variables considering its linear and quadratic effects as well as its interactions fcalc 26 6 and 17 3 was higher than fstat 4 46 and 4 35 for the reductions of color and abs 254 nm respectively thus describing the reproductivity of the experimental data in fig 2 the influence of the variables initial ph j1 and fe3 j2 as well as its interactions in reduction of color and abs 254 nm of the studied ll can be observed in fig 2 the influence of the variables initial ph j1 and fe3 j2 as well as its interactions was observed in the reduction of color and abs 254 nm the positive effects of the linear terms j1 3 79 and j1 4 17 reduction of color and abs 254 nm respectively see fig 2 suggest an excellent performance of the mediated photo fenton process in neutral ph according to researchers 60 62 the use of complexing agents in aops allows a higher dissolution of the iron ion in ph values close to neutrality leading to a higher quantum yield in the photo reduction regenerating fe3 at higher rates and promoting a higher generation of oh in the reactional media the eqs 7 and 8 were proposed to explain the behavior of the experimental responses of color and abs 254 nm reduction as a function of the linear and quadratic terms as well as its interactions j1 x j2 7 rcolor 9 72 13 23 j1 0 98 j1 2 1 44 j2 0 011 j2 2 0 093 j1 x j2 8 rabs254 104 01 22 02 j1 1 69 j1 2 1 89 j2 0 01 j2 2 0 01 j1 x j2 the behavior of the experimental data and the best areas for color and abs 254 nm removal were identified in the response surfaces see fig 3 an excellent performance of the mediated photo fenton process was observed in ph 7 8 and 90 mg fe3 l 1 with a color and abs 254 nm reduction of 52 5 and 47 0 respectively similar results were reported by souza et al 42 that attained a higher efficiency of the photo fenton mediated with oxalic acid in the degradation of diclofenac in ph near neutral 3 3 accumulated energy profile kj l 1 the efficiency of the process was investigated within the accumulated energy profile from 0 a 9 8 kj l 1 initial ph 2 2 5 0 and 7 8 and 90 mg fe3 l 1 the performance of color and abs 254 nm removal as well as the concentration of dissolved iron and consumed h2o2 were evaluated in the reaction a fast reduction of color and abs 254 nm was observed in ph 2 2 during the acidification step remaining constant until accumulated energy 9 8 kj l 1 see fig 4ab according to silva et al 63 the reduction of pollutants in the acidification process is directly related to the precipitation of humic and fulvic compounds leading to a low oxidation rate of the contaminants by the mediated photo fenton process an excellent performance of the mediated photo fenton process was observed in ph 7 8 reaching a reduction rates of 0 58 and 0 53 for abs 254 nm and color respectively see fig 4 ab under these conditions dissolved iron concentration of 70 mg l 1 was observed see fig 4c which increases formation of more photo active and soluble species fe oh 2 that minimize the precipitation of fe3 in the media 36 42 clarizia et al 64 reported that the reaction in neutral ph of the photo fenton process mediated by complexing agents such as oxalate tartrate citrate edta nta and edds has a high efficiency of degradation of contaminants has a high efficiency due to i stable fe3 complexes that do not precipitate easily ii significant absorption of uv vis radiation and iii photolysis of complexes generating fe2 ions seibert et al 12 reported that in the mediated photo fenton processes the reactions in ph near 7 0 allow higher amount of organic compounds to be degraded and or mineralized because they do not precipitate with the acidification a constant consumption of h2o2 220 mm was observed during the application of the accumulated energy 0 2 9 8 kj l 1 in ph see fig 4d suggesting its partial conversion in hydroxyl radicals oh in the presence of dissolved iron 70 mg l 1 promoting the abatement of organic compounds present in the ll three replicates of experimental runs were performed in ph 7 8 and 90 mg fe3 l 1 the concentrations of bod5 cod tdc doc and bod5 cod ratio were monitored during the application of accumulated energy in order to assess the efficiency of pollutants abatement by the process see fig 5 a constant reduction in the concentrations of bod5 tdc doc and cod was observed during the application of accumulated energy reaching final concentrations of 430 mg l 1 340 mg l 1 140 mg l 1 and 512 mg o2 l 1 respectively the reduction of recalcitrant and refractory compounds can be related to the increase in the bod5 cod ratio 12 65 from 0 25 to 0 85 as showed in fig 5 3 4 gc ms byproducts present in the ll treated by the mediated photo fenton process with the best experimental conditions ph 7 8 90 mg fe3 l 1 and accumulated energy of 5 8 kj l 1 were identified by a gc ms analysis a strong oxidation of the ll samples was evidenced by the formation fragmentation and or rearrangement of the molecular structures resulting in byproducts such as 2 butoxyethanol polypropylene glycol methyl ether 1 2 methoxypropoxy 2 propanol n butylbenzenesulfonamide 1 bromo 4 isobutyl 2 nitrobenzene in retention times rt 3 6 4 0 4 1 7 8 and 9 3 respectively as shown in table 6 among the identified compounds n butylbenzenesulfonamide can be highlighted because of its use in the plastic industry usually polyvinyl chloride and in the synthesis of the herbicide sulfonyl carbamate which has negative effects in the nervous system of organisms 66 as well as the surfactant 2 butoxyethanol that is frequently detected in wastewaters 67 an industrial compound used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins denominated bisphenol a 59 68 was identified in the untreated ll samples see table 3 however bisphenol a was not identified in the samples of ll treated by the mediated photo fenton process suggesting the oxidation of this compound minimizing its risks to the environment and public health 3 5 assessment of the toxicity through the bioindicator a salina toxicity bioassays with the bioindicator a salina were performed in dilutions of 20 to 100 in order to evaluate the possible toxic effects caused by the untreated and treated ll samples by the mediated photo fenton process using the experimental conditions ph 7 8 and 90 mg fe3 l 1 varying the accumulated energy from 0 a 7 3 kj l 1 the untreated ll sample 0 kj l 1 was considered highly toxic in all the tested dilutions 20 80 as well in natura 100 due to the high mortality ratio of a salina it was not possible to identify the lc50 as shown in table 7 a slight and constant reduction of the toxicity lc50 56 was observed in the treated samples with no dilution 100 in the accumulated energy profile up to 4 4 kj l 1 according to vedrenne et al 69 high concentrations of cod 680 mg o2 l 1 and tdc 457 mg l 1 see fig 5 generate a toxic aquatic environment inhibiting the development and increasing the mortality of microcrustaceans such as a salina olivero verbel et al 70 reported that refractory and recalcitrant substances identified in ll inhibit the development of the aquatic fauna and flora causing clastogenic mutagenic and highly toxic effects in the environment an efficient reduction in the toxicity was observed in accumulated energy higher than 5 8 kj l 1 for all the tested dilutions 20 100 reaching a lc50 of 67 the possible minimization of the toxic effects in the treated ll may be related to the mineralization of the toxic recalcitrant and or refractory compounds described in topic 3 4 and to the high reduction in concentration of cod 450 mg o2 l 1 and tdc 280 mg l 1 4 conclusions the physical chemical characterization of the untreated ll showed high concentrations of organic inorganic and especially highly toxic refractory and recalcitrant compounds including emerging contaminants of difficult mineralization and or degradation via conventional treatment processes an undesired phenomenon was observed in the mediated photo fenton process in acid media ph 2 2 which was the chemical precipitation of organic compounds during the acidification step decreasing the amount of pollutants available in solution for degradation and mineralization thus reducing the efficiency of the process under this experimental condition the development of a rsm based on a ccrd allowed the identification of the best experimental conditions for the mediated photo fenton process which were ph 7 8 90 mg fe3 l 1 and accumulated energy of 5 8 kj l 1 these conditions promoted a reduction of 47 52 46 80 88 and 86 in abs 254 nm color bod tdc doc and cod respectively

than 5 8 kj l 1 reaching a satisfactory lc50 of 67 indicating a partial purification of the ll samples treated via mediated photo fenton process thus we can consider the mediated photo fenton

14443,in this research the application of the organic complexing agent oxalic acid in photo fenton reaction was assessed in the treatment of landfill leachate using a lab scale photoreactor with coupled uvvis irradiation the operational parameters fe3 and initial ph were studied in central composite rotatable design and assessed through a response surface methodology the best operational

demand chemical oxygen demand total dissolved carbon and dissolved organic carbon as well as an increase in the biodegradability ratio additionally a high degradation of several molecular structures present in the landfill leachate was observed via gas chromatography mass spectrometry which was associated with the low toxicity of the treated effluent lc50 of 67 showed by the artemia salina bioassays thus the mediated photo fenton process presented a high efficiency in the reduction of the toxic effects of the landfill leachate contributing with the minimization of the environmental impacts caused by its discharge in soils or water bodies keywords landfill leachate mediated photo fenton process toxicity bioassays recalcitrant byproducts 1 introduction a large amount of natural resources is daily extracted from the environment and transformed in goods in order to improve quality of life of the society and keep its consumption patterns 1 alongside this there has been a reduction on the life cycle of the goods leading to a high generation of solid waste which demands an environmentally proper disposal 2 landfills are efficient conventional technologies applied to the final disposal of solid waste in which its decomposition occurs by chemical physical and biological processes generating landfill leachate ll as a byproduct 3 5 the main characteristics of ll are a high toxicity and a low biodegradability fraction 6 containing predominantly dissolved organic matter such as refractory compounds humic and fulvic acids inorganic micropollutants ca2 mg2 na k nh4 fe2 mn2 cl so4 2 hco3 heavy metals cd2 cr3 cu2 pb2 ni2 zn2 xenobiotic organic compounds aromatic hydrocarbons phenols chlorinated aliphatics pesticides and plastizers 7 seeking alternatives for the minimization of the adverse impacts of the disposal of ll in water bodies several researches on treatment methods have been developed such as electrochemical 8 10 electrochemical integrated with biological oxidation 11 photo fenton mediated by organic complexes 12 membrane bioreactor 13 15 adsorption 16 conventional coagulation flocculation 17 18 ultrafiltration 19 nanofiltration 20 reverse osmosis 21 22 the complexity of ll requires processes that present high efficiency in degradation mineralization of refractory and recalcitrant pollutants as well as in the increase of the biodegradability fraction of the effluent within this context advanced oxidation processes aops can be highlighted 12 23 being also investigated in the decontamination of textile effluents 24 26 tannery industrial wastewater 27 29 and winery wastewater 30 31 among the aops the photo fenton process has been the subject of several studies being based on the production of hydroxyl radicals oh by the simultaneous combination of h2o2 fe2 ions ph near 2 8 and an uv vis irradiation source of wavelength up to 550 nm 32 34 more recent studies have investigated the possibility of using organic complexing agents such as edta 12 35 and citric acid 36 in the conventional photo fenton reaction aiming to provide a higher amount of fe2 ions solution at intermediate ph values between 5 0 and 8 0 12 35 and convert persistent pollutants into co2 h2o and inorganic ions 37 38 the complexing agent oxalic acid can increase the efficiency of the conventional photo fenton oxidation process due the in situ production of ferrioxalate complexes 39 40 these complexes are more photosensitive with irradiation spectral range up to 580 nm thus providing a faster regeneration of fe2 to fe3 and increasing the production of oh which attack the target pollutants forming other radicals that in the absence of ferrioxalate fe2 c2o4 react with oxygen and form hydroperoxyl radicals ho2 see eqs 1 3 in the presence of fe c2o4 3 3 fe2 is continuously generated and reacts with h2o2 avoiding the production of less oxidative and more selective radicals see eq 4 39 41 43 1 fe2 c2o4 h2o2 hv fe3 c2o4 oh oh 2

temperature was kept at 250 c for selection and quantification of the organic compounds whose structures were proposed based on the nist 08 library of the equipment 2 6 rsm a rsm was applied to assess the influence of the rop on the response variables 49 after preliminary tests data not shown solution ph j1 and fe3 mg l 1 j2 were defined as the rop to be investigated the reductions of color and abs 254 nm of the ll were chosen as independent variables the experimental runs were proposed by a 22 central composite rotatable design ccrd with two independent variables n 2 triplicates at the central point and four axial points totalizing 11 experiments as shown in table 1 the data were adjusted according to an empirical polynomial second order model eq 6 applying the lagrange criteria 50 and the

treated ll a salina was previously reported by researchers 53 as a toxicity bioindicator with advantages compared to indirect methods such as low cost great sensitivity to toxic substances and a fast response which is used to estimate directly the real toxicity levels following methodology described in literature 54 were hatched for 48 h in a nutrient solution the samples of ll were diluted in v v fractions of 20 40 60 80 and 100 in order to obtain a partitioned reduction of the its toxicity samples of ll with no dilution were also included in the bioassays 5 ml of the ll samples were pipetted in 10 ml bioassay tubes ten nauplii of a salina specie were put into each of the 5 ml bioassay sample in triplicate the bioassay samples with the nauplii were held for 24 h under the presence of light in a laminar flow cabinet the number of living a salina nauplii was counted at the end of each bioassay and the median lethal concentration lc50 was calculated using functions based on the trimmed spearman karber method 55 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the untreated ll a high load of organic compounds was observed in the characterization of the untreated ll identified through the high concentrations of doc cod bod5 and nitrogen as well as high values of absorbance at 254 nm associated with the simple and conjugated aromatic compounds indicating high concentrations of polyphenols see table 2 12 these characteristics are suggested to be related to the degradation of waste in the landfill cells a large variety of organic compounds with different molecular structures was identified via gc ms see table 3 including diamylphthalate rt 9 9 min that is considered toxic to human and animal health having inhibitory effects on nicotinic receptors of humans and animals 56 and bisphenol a tr 14 46 which even is low concentrations presents high toxicity to aquatic ecosystems and human health acting as an endocrine disruptor and causing several reproductive problems 57 similar characterizations of untreated ll were observed by klauck et al 58 which highlighted the presence of alkanes alkenes ketones alcohols and carboxylic acids the presence of these compounds may cause inefficiency in the biological degradation of organic matter contributing to the pollution potential and persistence of these contaminants in the environment 59 3 2 central composite rotatable design based on preliminary tests data not show a central composite rotatable design ccrd was proposed with the investigation parameters ph and fe3 in ranges of 2 2 7 8 and 48 132 mg l 1 respectively all the experimental runs were carried out with an accumulated energy quv of 5 8 kj l 1 and a molar ratio of 1 3 fe3 oxalic acid table 4 reductions of color from 4 99 to 52 5 and abs 254 nm from 17 8 to 47 0 were reached with the mediated photo fenton process a positive interaction between the studied variables was observed through the reduction of the investigated responses suggesting the rop had a direct influence in the photo fenton processes mediated by oxalic acid an analysis of variance anova with a 95 confidence level was applied to assess the adjustment of the second order polynomial model to the obtained experimental responses see table 5 the f test validated the model for the studied variables considering its linear and quadratic effects as well as its interactions fcalc 26 6 and 17 3 was higher than fstat 4 46 and 4 35 for the reductions of color and abs 254 nm respectively thus describing the reproductivity of the experimental data in fig 2 the influence of the variables initial ph j1 and fe3 j2 as well as its interactions in reduction of color and abs 254 nm of the studied ll can be observed in fig 2 the influence of the variables initial ph j1 and fe3 j2 as well as its interactions was observed in the reduction of color and abs 254 nm the positive effects of the linear terms j1 3 79 and j1 4 17 reduction of color and abs 254 nm respectively see fig 2 suggest an excellent performance of the mediated photo fenton process in neutral ph according to researchers 60 62 the use of complexing agents in aops allows a higher dissolution of the iron ion in ph values close to neutrality leading to a higher quantum yield in the photo reduction regenerating fe3 at higher rates and promoting a higher generation of oh in the reactional media the eqs 7 and 8 were proposed to explain the behavior of the experimental responses of color and abs 254 nm reduction as a function of the linear and quadratic terms as well as its interactions j1 x j2 7 rcolor 9 72 13 23 j1 0 98 j1 2 1 44 j2 0 011 j2 2 0 093 j1 x j2 8 rabs254 104 01 22 02 j1 1 69 j1 2 1 89 j2 0 01 j2 2 0 01 j1 x j2 the behavior of the experimental data and the best areas for color and abs 254 nm removal were identified in the response surfaces see fig 3 an excellent performance of the mediated photo fenton process was observed in ph 7 8 and 90 mg fe3 l 1 with a color and abs 254 nm reduction of 52 5 and 47 0 respectively similar results were reported by souza et al 42 that attained a higher efficiency of the photo fenton mediated with oxalic acid in the degradation of diclofenac in ph near neutral 3 3 accumulated energy profile kj l 1 the efficiency of the process was investigated within the accumulated energy profile from 0 a 9 8 kj l 1 initial ph 2 2 5 0 and 7 8 and 90 mg fe3 l 1 the performance of color and abs 254 nm removal as well as the concentration of dissolved iron and consumed h2o2 were evaluated in the reaction a fast reduction of color and abs 254 nm was observed in ph 2 2 during the acidification step remaining constant until accumulated energy 9 8 kj l 1 see fig 4ab according to silva et al 63 the reduction of pollutants in the acidification process is directly related to the precipitation of humic and fulvic compounds leading to a low oxidation rate of the contaminants by the mediated photo fenton process an excellent performance of the mediated photo fenton process was observed in ph 7 8 reaching a reduction rates of 0 58 and 0 53 for abs 254 nm and color respectively see fig 4 ab under these conditions dissolved iron concentration of 70 mg l 1 was observed see fig 4c which increases formation of more photo active and soluble species fe oh 2 that minimize the precipitation of fe3 in the media 36 42 clarizia et al 64 reported that the reaction in neutral ph of the photo fenton process mediated by complexing agents such as oxalate tartrate citrate edta nta and edds has a high efficiency of degradation of contaminants has a high efficiency due to i stable fe3 complexes that do not precipitate easily ii significant absorption of uv vis radiation and iii photolysis of complexes generating fe2 ions seibert et al 12 reported that in the mediated photo fenton processes the reactions in ph near 7 0 allow higher amount of organic compounds to be degraded and or mineralized because they do not precipitate with the acidification a constant consumption of h2o2 220 mm was observed during the application of the accumulated energy 0 2 9 8 kj l 1 in ph see fig 4d suggesting its partial conversion in hydroxyl radicals oh in the presence of dissolved iron 70 mg l 1 promoting the abatement of organic compounds present in the ll three replicates of experimental runs were performed in ph 7 8 and 90 mg fe3 l 1 the concentrations of bod5 cod tdc doc and bod5 cod ratio were monitored during the application of accumulated energy in order to assess the efficiency of pollutants abatement by the process see fig 5 a constant reduction in the concentrations of bod5 tdc doc and cod was observed during the application of accumulated energy reaching final concentrations of 430 mg l 1 340 mg l 1 140 mg l 1 and 512 mg o2 l 1 respectively the reduction of recalcitrant and refractory compounds can be related to the increase in the bod5 cod ratio 12 65 from 0 25 to 0 85 as showed in fig 5 3 4 gc ms byproducts present in the ll treated by the mediated photo fenton process with the best experimental conditions ph 7 8 90 mg fe3 l 1 and accumulated energy of 5 8 kj l 1 were identified by a gc ms analysis a strong oxidation of the ll samples was evidenced by the formation fragmentation and or rearrangement of the molecular structures resulting in byproducts such as 2 butoxyethanol polypropylene glycol methyl ether 1 2 methoxypropoxy 2 propanol n butylbenzenesulfonamide 1 bromo 4 isobutyl 2 nitrobenzene in retention times rt 3 6 4 0 4 1 7 8 and 9 3 respectively as shown in table 6 among the identified compounds n butylbenzenesulfonamide can be highlighted because of its use in the plastic industry usually polyvinyl chloride and in the synthesis of the herbicide sulfonyl carbamate which has negative effects in the nervous system of organisms 66 as well as the surfactant 2 butoxyethanol that is frequently detected in wastewaters 67 an industrial compound used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins denominated bisphenol a 59 68 was identified in the untreated ll samples see table 3 however bisphenol a was not identified in the samples of ll treated by the mediated photo fenton process suggesting the oxidation of this compound minimizing its risks to the environment and public health 3 5 assessment of the toxicity through the bioindicator a salina toxicity bioassays with the bioindicator a salina were performed in dilutions of 20 to 100 in order to evaluate the possible toxic effects caused by the untreated and treated ll samples by the mediated photo fenton process using the experimental conditions ph 7 8 and 90 mg fe3 l 1 varying the accumulated energy from 0 a 7 3 kj l 1 the untreated ll sample 0 kj l 1 was considered highly toxic in all the tested dilutions 20 80 as well in natura 100 due to the high mortality ratio of a salina it was not possible to identify the lc50 as shown in table 7 a slight and constant reduction of the toxicity lc50 56 was observed in the treated samples with no dilution 100 in the accumulated energy profile up to 4 4 kj l 1 according to vedrenne et al 69 high concentrations of cod 680 mg o2 l 1 and tdc 457 mg l 1 see fig 5 generate a toxic aquatic environment inhibiting the development and increasing the mortality of microcrustaceans such as a salina olivero verbel et al 70 reported that refractory and recalcitrant substances identified in ll inhibit the development of the aquatic fauna and flora causing clastogenic mutagenic and highly toxic effects in the environment an efficient reduction in the toxicity was observed in accumulated energy higher than 5 8 kj l 1 for all the tested dilutions 20 100 reaching a lc50 of 67 the possible minimization of the toxic effects in the treated ll may be related to the mineralization of the toxic recalcitrant and or refractory compounds described in topic 3 4 and to the high reduction in concentration of cod 450 mg o2 l 1 and tdc 280 mg l 1 4 conclusions the physical chemical characterization of the untreated ll showed high concentrations of organic inorganic and especially highly toxic refractory and recalcitrant compounds including emerging contaminants of difficult mineralization and or degradation via conventional treatment processes an undesired phenomenon was observed in the mediated photo fenton process in acid media ph 2 2 which was the chemical precipitation of organic compounds during the acidification step decreasing the amount of pollutants available in solution for degradation and mineralization thus reducing the efficiency of the process under this experimental condition the development of a rsm based on a ccrd allowed the identification of the best experimental conditions for the mediated photo fenton process which were ph 7 8 90 mg fe3 l 1 and accumulated energy of 5 8 kj l 1 these conditions promoted a reduction of 47 52 46 80 88 and 86 in abs 254 nm color bod tdc doc and cod respectively as well as an increase in the biodegradability ratio bod5 cod from 0 25 to 0 85 by applying these experimental conditions it was possible to remove highly recalcitrant and toxic compounds among which bisphenol a can be highlighted within this context the toxicity analysis using the bioindicator a salina evidenced the high reduction the toxicity of the treated samples with accumulated energy higher than 5 8 kj l 1 reaching a satisfactory lc50 of 67 indicating a partial purification of the ll samples treated via mediated photo fenton process thus we can consider the mediated photo fenton oxidation process an efficient and environmentally clean alternative that contributes significantly in the minimization of the impacts caused by the inadequate discharge of ll into water bodies

14444,mesoporous fe2o3 sio2 composite was prepared from rice husk for heterogeneous fenton like process and the performance was evaluated from oxidation of dyes in aqueous solution iron oxide particles with average 5 nm 8 1 wt of composite were well dispersed on surface of silica particles and the fe2o3 sio2 composite was mesoporous with a high surface area 109 5 m2 g the reaction rate and degradation efficiency of tartrazine by as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite were compared with those of physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 as synthesized fe2o3 and sio2 and commercial fe2o3 at optimal reaction conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c the fe2o3 sio2 composite showed much greater reaction rate and degradation efficiency of tartrazine than the others in addition the reusability of as prepared composite was evaluated the reaction rate and degradation efficiency of tratrazine were slightly decreased by the addition of nacl and na2so4 in the solution where the addition of na2hpo4 and edta led to drastic reduction of oxidation performance the degradation profiles at temperature range of 30 60 c were well fitted by the first order kinetic model and the reaction mechanism of tartrazine was proposed keywords fe2o3 sio2 sio2 heterogeneous fenton rice husk dyes 1 introduction the discharge of several hazardous dyes from waster water of many textile industries is one of main causes for serious environmental problems that concerned with human health and aquatic ecosystem due to the toxicity and the carcinogenic effect of these materials 1 2 therefore the removal of dyes from wastewater is a challenge to the related industries because of their high solubility in water complex structure and synthetic origin 3 numerous physical chemical and biological methods are presently available for degradation of dye effluents from various industries 4 6 however the physical and biological methods may simply transfer the pollutants from one phase to another phase furthermore high cost of equipments involved in these processes limits their practical large scale application 7 alternatively advanced oxidation processes aops are reported as promising substitute technologies for efficient elimination of organic pollutants from wastewater with high chemical stability and low biodegradability 8 it was pointed out that selection and preparation of catalyst is a key factor for an advanced oxidation process with high performance aops are based on the generation of non selective oh radicals which one of the most powerful oxidation species to degrade organic compounds into non toxic products ideally co2 and h2o 9 homogenceous photo fenton is a common aop in which soluble iron ii is the catalyst but the difficulty of catalyst recovery and tight ph range for reaction are reported as disadvantages 10 to overcome the disadvantages of the homogeneous fenton process some attempts have been made to develop heterogeneous catalysts prepared by loading iron iii oxide onto a porous support such as zeolites clays silica and activated carbon 11 14 recently metal containing mesoporous silica have attracted much attention because the silica based materials have the high surface area good thermal stability and favorable hydrothermal stability numerous iron mesoporous silica composites were synthesized for degrading organic compounds such as methyl orange acid orange polyarylamide and phenol 11 15 17 the selection of suitable silica source is a crucial factor with respect to practical application because the silica source is directly affected not only to properties of silica supporters but to cost effective application mesoporous silica synthesized by using tetraethyl orthosilicate teos was known as a relatively expense silica material in this study rice husk rh a cheap silica source was utilized rh is the outer covering of rice grain which is obtained from the rice production rh contributes about 20 25 wt of the dry weight of paddy rice it was reported that world rice production is 489 1 million tons every year which means approximately 122 163 million tons of rice husk biomass will be generated globally 18 the bulk density of rh is approximately 100 122 kg m3 rh contains about 15 28 wt of silica and 72 85 wt of lignocellulose depending on the variety geographic location origin climate and season 19 20 the conversion of rh into valuable products has been attracted the great attention for researchers to synthesize sio2 and its composites various methods have been developed such as directed extraction of silica from rice husk 18 21 impregnation method 22 and burning the rice husk at high temperature above 500 23 26 these methods had been carried out with many stages and used a lot of chemicals such as sulfuric acid hydrogen chloride oxalic acid sodium hydroxide ionic liquids etc however the surface area of sio2 based composites was still low below 80 m2 g since surface area and pore volume of material are the crucial factors affecting to catalytic performance of catalyst therefore it is desirable to develop a suitable method for producing silica composites with large surface area and high pore volume the main objective of this study was a synthesis of mesoporous fe2o3 sio2 composite by using porous silica prepared from rice husk with the assistant of ctab the catalytic performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite was evaluated by the degradation of tartrazine in the presence of h2o2 and it was compared to physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 as synthesized fe2o3 and sio2 and commercial fe2o3 the parametric studies on reaction such as tartrazine concentration dosage catalyst h2o2 concentration ph solution and temperature on the degradation of tartrazine were carried out to elucidate the optimal reaction condition in addition the reusability of catalyst was evaluated moreover as the solution additionally contained inorganic salts nacl na2so4 and na2hpo4 and iron ligand edta the degradation efficiency of tartrazine was also evaluated the degradation kinetics were obtained from experimental

autoclave at 100 for 48 h the white solid powder was recovered by filtration and wash with distilled water to remove the excess amounts of surfactant and acid until measuring neutral ph value finally the white powder was dried and calcined at 600 to obtain porous silica 2 3 preparation of catalysts the porous fe2o3 sio2 composite was prepared by a facile impregnation method typically 1 44 g of silica powder was immersed in 10 ml of 0 2 m fe no3 3 and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 24 h at room temperature after the impregnation the sample was dried at 80 c for 24 h and then calcined at 500 c for 5 h in a muffle furnace the obtained powder was cooled to room temperature and stored in a stoppered bottle denote assynthesized fe2o3 sio2 for catalytic experiments as an alternative

mixing were used to compare with the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite with respect to degradation of tartrazine from aqueous solution in the presence of h2o2 2 4 characterization the crystalline

a quantachrome instrument autosorb iq version 3 0 analyzer the specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter were obtained by using the brunauer emmett teller bet method 2 5 catalytic activity studies experiments on the degradation of tartrazine were conducted in a bath mode reactor typically 50 mg of catalyst and premeasured amount of h2o2 solution were added to a beaker of 250 ml containing 100 ml of dye solution at desired ph condition under magnetic stirring at a given time interval an aliquot 2 ml of dye was withdrawn from the suspension and immediately filtered by a syringe filter 0 45 μ m ptfe membrane then the dye concentration was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer agilent 8453 at the maximum absorbance wavelength of tartrazine λmax 428 nm the degradation efficiency of tartrazine was calculated by the following equation 2 degradation efficiency c 0 c t c o 100 the degradation rate of tartrazine was determined by fitting the degradation profile with the first order kinetic model as presented by the following equation 3 ln c o c t k ap t where kap s 1 is the rate constant co is the initial concentration of tartrazine and ct is the concentration of tartrazine in time and t is reaction time presented by min and s for eqs 2 and 3 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization fig 1 presents the fe sem and tem images eds spectrum and eds mapping image of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 and as synthesized sio2 silica showed an aggregate shape like light clouds fig 1a and the surface morphology for as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 became darker and denser fig 1b after loading iron the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite exhibited higher aggregation than silica due to impregnation and calcination processes as shown in tem images fig 1c and d both samples showed bulk shape consisting of many small particles with approximately 10 20 nm in size the silica and iron oxide were not clearly distinguished from the sem images however iron oxide nanoparticles with 5 nm in size were well dispersed on silica particles in a tem image fig 1e the elemental composition of the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite from energy dispersive spectrometry eds fig 1f stated that the composite contained 8 1 wt fe 38 1 wt si and 53 3 wt o in addition the eds mapping image fig 1g clearly showed the dispersion of fe on the surface of sio2 fig 2 a shows the wide angle xrd diffractions of as synthesized sio2 and as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite the diffraction peak at 2θ 20 1 was assigned to amorphous silica 27 and the diffraction peaks at 2θ 21 8 25 0 35 39 and 49 3 were assigned to α fe2o3 jcpds data 89 596 27 the broad and low intensity peaks of fe2o3 could result from low loading deposition level well dispersion and poor crystalline with a small size of metal oxide particles in the composite fig 2b presents the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of as synthesized sio2 and as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 according to the iupac classification both of samples clearly showed a type ii with an h1 hysteresis loop indicating material with agglomerates or compacts of approximately uniform spheres 28 the hysteresis of both fe2o3 sio2 and sio2 samples was observed at relative pressure p po of 0 82 1 0 but the hysteresis level of fe2o3 sio2 was slightly higher the pore size of sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 was distributed in the range of 10 60 nm but the distribution intensity of as prepared fe2o3 sio2 was slightly reduced from that of sio2 the average pore diameters of sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 were 28 8 and 28 3 nm respectively as presented in table 2 after loading fe2o3 by impregnation method in this study the surface area slightly increased from 98 2 to 109 5 m2 g and mesopore volume increased from 0 746 to 0 818 cm3 g but the variation of micropore volume was negligible according to the results in table 2 it was expected that fe2o3 nanoparticles were mainly dispersed in relatively large pores and surface of sio2 the ft ir spectra of as synthesized sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 composite were almost similar as shown in fig 2c the bands near 3653 and 3043 cm 1 corresponded to the oh stretching vibration of sioh and absorbed water hoh 29 the intense bands at 1117 805 and 460 cm 1 could be assigned to the siosi asymmetric stretching vibrations 30 the small bands found at 685 and 604 cm 1 could be assigned to stretching vibrations of feo and siofe respectively which confirmed that sio2 indeed binds with fe2o3 3 2 degradation of tartrazine 3 2 1 effect of catalytic system fig 3 shows the degradation of tartrazine in different reaction systems at the same reaction conditions dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c the degradation efficiency was about 2 9 for only h2o2 within 80 min and reaction rate of k 2 8e 3 min 1 table 3 indicating that tartrazine is a persistent compound and hardly degraded in h2o2 solution even though h2o2 is a powerful oxidizing agent for the reaction system with only sio2 or fe2o3 sio2 the degradation efficiency was also negligible showing 0 7 and 1 6 for sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 the minute decrease in concentration of tartrazine could come from the adsorption of tartrazine on sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 the adsorption ability of tartrazine on fe2o3 sio2 was slightly higher than that of sio2 because of 8 wt of fe2o3 the interaction between negatively charged tartrazine in aqueous solution and positively charged iron iii on sio2 could improve electrostatic adsorption affinity of tartrazine on the fe2o3 sio2 composite the degradation of tartrazine for commercial fe2o3 h2o2 and as synthesized fe2o3 h2o2 catalytic systems reached almost saturation within an initial 10 min showing the degradation efficiencies of approximately 10 0 and 2 5 and reaction rates of 1 8e 3 and 0 47e 3 min 1 for commercial fe2o3 h2o2 and as synthesized fe2o3 h2o2 respectively the degradation efficiency of tartrazine with the physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system varied almost linearly with time the removal efficiency was higher than that of commercial fe2o3 h2o2 system at 80 min 13 5 while the reaction rate was slower the degradation of tartrazine in the commercial fe2o3 h2o2 as synthesized fe2o3 h2o2 and physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 systems could be attributed to fenton like system oxidation according to the results since the decomposition of h2o2 by iron oxide has been reported to yield hydroxyl radial oh and superoxide radicals o2 31 it was expected that sio2 contributed to improving the reactivity of tartrazine in the fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system the degradation efficiency and reaction rate of tatrazine in rh fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system were 47 1 and 0 024 min 1 respectively these were larger than those of commercial fe2o3 h2o2 as synthesized fe2o3 h2o2 and physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 systems however the degradation efficiency and reaction rate of tartrazine in the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system was much higher than the others showing the degradation efficiency of 98 5 at 80 min and reaction rate of 0 063 min 1 the surface area of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 was similar to that of physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 according to table 2 the difference in physical properties between synthesized fe2o3 sio2 and physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 was not enough to explain the difference in performance between both samples it implied that the reaction on well dispersed fe2o3 on sio2 could be accelerated by the surface diffusion of tartrazine physically adsorbed on the pores of sio2 therefore the dispersion of iron on porous media was a more important factor for decomposition of tartrazine in heterogeneous catalysts than the physical properties of composite 3 2 2 effect of initial ph the ph in solution is a decisive parameter to design a reaction process it significantly affects not only the functional groups and surface charges of adsorbents but also the structure and ionization degree of pollutant molecules 32 in this study the effect of initial ph in solution on degradation of tartrazine in the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system was investigated the performance was evaluated at wide range of ph values from 2 0 to 6 0 under the fixed other conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l catalyst dosage of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm and temperature of 30 c fig 4 a b presents the degradation efficiency with time at different ph conditions and first order fitting plots the initial ph condition in solution gave a critical impact on the degradation of tartrazine in fenton like system although the reaction rate and efficiency at ph 2 5 was slightly lower than those at ph 3 0 during 40 min the degradation efficiencies at both ph conditions reached 98 5 within 80 min at initial ph 3 0 in solution the ph variation with reaction time was monitored in fig 4c the ph decreased slightly with time showing the decrease from 3 0 to 2 9 in 40 min and to 2 8 in 80 min it has been reported that methyl orange mo could be degraded in fenton like catalyst the initial ph of the stock solution was remarkably decreased from 7 3 to 2 9 and it was attributed to the formation of hno3 and other organic acids such as oxalic acid acetic acid and succinic acid 15 also the similar results were obtained for the degradation of azo dyes reactive red 120 reactive black 5 reactive yellow 84 in h2o2 under uv irradiation 33 in this study small variation of ph solution could be attributed primarily to formation of organic acids rather than strong acid hno3 at lower than ph 2 5 ph 2 0 the reaction performance decreased significantly showing the degradation efficiency of 39 7 in 80 min and reaction rate of 0 005 min 1 the reduced reaction rate might be attributed to the stabilization of h2o2 through the formation of oxonimum ion h3o2 leading to substantially the reduced reactivity with ferrous ion in addition the fenton reaction could be retarded due to the scaveging effect of hydroxyl radicals oh by excessive amount of h ion at low ph conditions 34 4 oh h e h2o furthermore the formation of complex species fe h2o 6 2 and fe h2o 6 3 can also contribute to more slow reaction with h2o2 35 at greater than ph 3 0 the reaction rate and efficiency were significantly decreased with an increase in ph value the degradation efficiencies were 64 3 7 9 and 1 1 at 80 min and reaction rates were 0 011 0 001 and 0 0002 min 1 at ph 3 5 4 0 and 6 0 respectively since the surface of fe2o3 sio2 catalyst is charged negatively at higher ph value the interaction between catalyst surface and tartrazine dye is reduced in addition some portion of h2o2 can undergo self decomposition into molecular oxygen without production of radicals in less acidic medium 36 and the formation of ferric hydroxide complexes leads to a reduction of oh radical as a result higher than ph 3 0 condition for degradation of tartrazine in the fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system was not desirable due to drastic decrease of performance 3 2 3 effect of initial h2o2 concentration the effect of initial h2o2 concentration on degradation of tartrazine was investigated by varying h2o2 concentration from 1 2 mm to 60 mm at the fixed other conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c the degradation efficiency and kinetic model fitting are presented in fig 5 at low h2o2 concentration of 1 2 mm the reaction rate and degradation efficiency were low 0 002 min 1 and 13 9 respectively when h2o2 concentration increased to 6 mm the reaction rate and degradation efficiency remarkably increased to 0 036 min 1 and 95 2 respectively then these values achieved 0 063 min 1 and 98 5 respectively at 12 mm since the increase of h2o2 concentration in the solution led to increase the formation of oh the reaction rate and degradation efficiency increased however further increase from h2o2 concentration of 12 mm resulted in the gradual decrease of reaction rate and degradation efficiency because a competition of oh consumption between the substrate and h2o2 increased with increasing h2o2 concentration the reaction rates were 0 044 0 038 0 027 min 1 and degradation efficiencies were 97 0 95 0 and 88 0 at h2o2 concentrations of 18 30 and 60 mm respectively since excess h2o2 molecules act as scavenger of hydroxyl radical oh can recombine to form h2o2 and o2 as expressed in eqs 5 and 6 therefore it is necessary to select an optimal initial h2o2 concentration for the heterogeneous fenton system 31 in the study h2o2 concentration of 12 mm was an optimal value for the degradation of tartrazine in the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system 5 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 6 ho2 oh h2o o2 3 2 4 effect of catalyst dosage experiments were conducted at different amounts of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite to obtain an optimum catalyst dosage the catalyst dosage was varied from 0 1 to 0 6 g l at the fixed other conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c as shown in fig 6 when the catalyst concentration increased from 0 1 to 0 5 g l the reaction rate and degradation efficiency significantly increased showing the variation from 19 9 to 98 5 at 80 min more active iron sites resulted in the improved catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and faster generation of oh radicals 35 37 further increase in catalyst dosage from 0 5 g l led to decreasing reaction rate without any significant change in degradation efficiency 98 5 at catalyst dosage of 0 6 g l this phenomenon could be ascribed to decomposing certain amount of h2o2 to o2 due to thermodynamic and mass transfer limitation 38 in addition quenching of oh radials by excess iron ions in reaction process eq 7 may also be responsible for the result 7 fe2 2oh fe3 2oh 3 2 5 effect of initial dye concentration experiments were carried out by various concentrations of tartrazine from 40 to 70 mg at the other fixed conditions dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c in heterogeneous fenton processes the reaction occurs at the surface of fe3o3 sio2 catalyst between oh radicals generated at the active sites and tartrazine molecules adsorbed on the surface the increase of initial dye concentration could decrease the probability of reaction between dye molecules and the hydroxyl radicals because more tartrazine molecules adsorb on the catalyst surface and the occupied active sites of the catalyst lead to fewer hydroxyl radials at the surface of the catalyst 39 in addition the intermediates generated in dye degradation process might also compete for the limited adsorption sites with dye molecules which blocked their interactions with fe ii fe iii active sites 40 as shown in fig 7 the reaction rate was slightly decreased with an increase in initial concentration of tartrazine but the degradation efficiency within 80 min was almost same regardless of tartrazine concentrations however compared with previous other experimental parameters the effects of initial concentration on performance were relatively minute 3 2 6 effect of reaction temperature the effect of reaction temperature on dye degradation in the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite system was performed in the range of 30 to 60 c fig 8 a shows significant increase of reaction rates within initial 10 min with an increase in temperature but the degradation efficiency of tartrazine was almost similar it implied that the increased temperature led to accelerating the decomposition of h2o2 into hydroxyl radical oh and subsequently enhancing degradation efficiency during an initial period 41 however as the temperature increased from 50 to 60 the performance variation was trivial since increasing temperature also accelerates the thermal decomposition of h2o2 into oxygen and water the utilization efficiency of h2o2 can be decreased and the consumption is deteriorated 42 in addition the high reaction temperature will give the industrial application drawback due to energy penalty therefore it is important to choose an appropriate reaction temperature with respect to degradation efficiency and energy consumption as presented in fig 8b the rate constant increased with temperature according to the rate constants obtained at different temperatures the activation energy ea for the oxidation of tartrazine by h2o2 with as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 catalyst was calculated by the arrhenius equation 8 k a p a e x p e a r t where a is the pre exponential factor ea is the activation energy j mol r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the reaction temperature k the arrhenius plot of lnkap versus 1 t is presented in fig 8c activation enthalpy and activation entropy were calculated using the eyring equation 9 l n k a p t l n k b h δ s r δ h r t where kb and h are the boltzmann and planck s constant respectively the free activation energy δg was determined using the following equation at 298 k 10 δg δh tδs the activation parameters obtained were as follows ea 30 578 kj mol δh 27 943 kj mol δs 210 925 j mol and δg 33 587 kj mol the results indicated that the oxidative process is spontaneous with low demand of energy 3 2 7 effect of additive industrial wastewater might contain certain level of inorganic salts sodium chloride sodium sulphate potassium sulphate etc as electrolytes 43 44 and organic agents edta tartaric acid formic acid glycine nitrilotriacetic acid etc as iron ligands 45 therefore it is worthwhile to investigate the effects of dissolute salt and iron ligand on the degradation of dye with the fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system for dye treatment processes the experiments were carried out by adding nacl na2so4 na2hpo4 and edta each additive of 20 mg to tartrazine solution while keeping the other variables constant at the conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c as seen in fig 9 the reaction rate and degradation efficiency were slightly decreased when tartrazine solution contained nacl and na2so4 the result indicated that the degradation of tartrazine was not significantly inhibited by the presence of cl and so4 2 on the other hand the reaction rate was substantially dropped by the addition of na2hpo4 into tartrazine solution a possible reason for the inhibition of tartrazine oxidation process is that h2po4 anion forms complexes with fe3 ion such as fe h2po4 3 which are more stable than the complexes formed by cl and so4 2 another reason is that the h2po4 can serve as oh scavengers to form less reactive h2po4 radical eq 11 and leads to the shortage of oh in the fenton system therefore the oxidation rate and degradation efficiency were suppressed in the presence of h2po4 11 h2po4 oh h2po4 oh the similar phenomenon of h2po4 was observed as iron ligand edta was added however the mechanism of heterogeneous fenton reactions in the presence of edta is unclear because it can simultaneously react as homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions edta can induce an enhanced homogeneous fenton mechanism by increasing the dissolution of solid catalysts 29 in contrast the surface complexed ligands can compete with organic compounds and h2o2 to occupy the surface active sites 30 consequently it led to decreasing h2o2 activation and the generation of high valent iron species was also speculated according to some inhibitive effects of different scavengers 3 3 reaction mechanism discussion the uv vis spectral change of tartrazine was measured at the time interval of 10 min during degradation process in fig 10 a before oxidation t 0 the absorption spectrum of tartrazine was characterized by one band in the ultraviolet region located at 257 nm and by another band in visible region located at 428 nm the peak at 257 nm is due to benzene like structure in the molecules while the band in the visible region is associated with the chromophore containing azo linkage 38 the disappearance of the absorbance peak at 428 nm with the reaction time could stem from the fragmentation of the azo links by oxidation 46 in addition to this rapid degradation effect the decay of the absorbance at 257 nm was considered as evidence of aromatic fragment degradation in the dye molecule and its intermediates in the degradation of tartrazine via oxidation reaction by h2o2 under activation of catalyst the iron oxide actively reacts with h2o2 leading to formation of hydroxyl oh and perhydroxy ho2 radicals via reactions 12 and 13 it was well reported that oh radical is the responsible species for the mineralization of organic pollutant however ho2 radial does not play significant role in degradation of organic pollutant due to its lower oxidation potential than oh 38 as a result tartrazine was very highly degraded within 80 min the oxidation reactions of tartrazine with oh and ho2 were described in reactions 14 and 15 the fragmentation mechanism of tartrazine could be proposed in fig 10b with the cleavage of the symmetrical and asymmetrical azo bonds 12 sio2 fe3 h2o2 sio2 fe2 ho2 h 13 sio2 fe2 h2o2 sio2 fe3 ho oh 14 oh ho2 tartrazine intermediate products 15 oh ho2 intermediate products co2 h2o so2 n2 na2co3 etc 3 4 reusability of catalyst and fixed bed experiment the reusability of catalyst is one of important factors from industrial perspective the reusability potential of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 was evaluated by the catalytic performance through five consecutive cycles after an experiment the solid catalyst was filtered and washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times and then dried at 80 c for 12 h dry powder was re used as the catalyst for next experiment without further treatment in addition the fe2o3 sio2 composite after fifth cyclic experiment was characterized by ft ir as shown in fig 11 a the degradation efficiency of tartrazine slightly decreased and it still remained at 82 in fifth cyclic experiment the reduction of catalytic activity may be due to leaching the small amount of metal ions from the face of solid leading the vibration bands at 685 and 604 cm 1 for fe o bonding were almost disappeared for the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 sample after fifth cyclic experiment as seen in fig 11b in addition the intense band observed at 3326 cm 1 of oh and the small bands at 1731 and 1625 cm 1 of stretching vibrations of coh and co espectively 47 were evidences for the formation of organic acids as mention in section 3 2 2 these results indicated that the catalyst deactivation may occur from diverse factors including catalyst poisoning by compounds formed during the oxidation and adsorption of some organic acids on the surface of catalyst the catalytic performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite was initially evaluated by fixed bed reactor inner diameter 7 mm length 250 mm as seen in fig s2a both ends of column were packed with glass wool and glass beads the dye solution tartrazine 50 mg l h2o2 concentration 12 mm ph 3 0 was fed into the column at 200 ml min by a peristaltic pump the dye concentration at the outlet of the reactor column was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer the breakthrough curve of tartrazine on as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite is presented in fig s2b the breakthrough time and saturation time were 52 and 342 min respectively the degradation capacity of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite for tartrazine estimated by the same method mentioned in our previous report 27 was 0 128 g g 3 5 the degradation of other organic dyes and comparison with other catalysts the degradation efficiency of dyes in fenton catalyst system depends not only catalyst behaviour such as surface area pore volume and pore size distribution and reaction parameters but also properties of dyes each catalyst might have the own optimum condition for degradation of certain dye beside to tartrazine in this study the performance of the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite was evaluated by other organic dyes such as congo red cr janus green b jgb and methylene blue mb at the optimal conditions for tartrazine dye concentration of 50 mg l dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 additive of 20 mg and temperature of 30 c the results are presented in fig 12 janus green b was found to be the lowest reaction rate and efficiency in 80 min 0 016 min 1 71 2 respectively the reaction rate of methylene blue was highest 0 113 min 1 among tested dyes while the degradation efficiencies of methylene blue tartrazine and congo red in 80 min were similar the catalytic performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite was compared with different catalysts from recent literatures 48 53 the reaction condition and degradation efficiency of these catalysts are listed in table 4 since each study evaluated the removal capacity under different conditions direct comparison among catalysts is challenging but the relative performance of fe2o3 sio2 catalyst can be evaluated indirectly in table 4 the degradation efficiency of tartrazine on fe2o3 sio2 composite within 80 min was higher than that of al and fe pillared clays under visible light and even tio2 ag tio2 and periwinkle shell ash under uv light the degradation efficiency was lower than that of nano composite of molecularly imprinted polymer mip and polyvinylpyrrolidone capped cadmium sulfide nanoparticles but the reaction rate of tartrazine with fe2o3 sio2 composite was faster therefore fe2o3 sio2 composite prepared by the facile method is expected to reduce the cost of catalyst for large scale application 4 conclusion mesoporous sio2 was successfully prepared from rice husk and it was used to synthesize the mesoporous fe2o3 sio2 composite by a facile impregnation method compared with the physical properties of the sio2 sample the dispersion of iron oxide by the impregnation and decomposition of fe no3 3 at 500 led to increasing the bet surface area bjh mesopore volume total pore volume of fe2o3 sio2 109 5 m2 g 0 818 cm3 g and 0 8206 cm3 g respectively it was found that the iron oxide particles with a small size of about 5 nm were well dispersed on silica the performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 was evaluated by fenton degradation of dyes tartrazine congo red janus green b and methylene blue the fe2o3 sio2 composite exhibited an excellent performance for degradation of tartrazine 98 5 in 80 min at the optimal reaction conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c the performance was much higher than those of physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 as synthesized fe2o3 and sio2 and commercial fe2o3 the activation energy enthalpy entropy and free energy data demonstrated the spontaneous and endothermic process but the demand of reaction energy was not high the addition of inorganic salt na2hpo4 and iron ligand edta into tartrazine solution led to significantly drop the reaction rate and degradation efficiency whereas the addition of nacl and na2so4 did not significantly affect catalytic performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite in addition the as prepared composite exhibited high catalyst performance in reuse with the degradation efficiency as high as 82 after fifth cyclic experiment thus the mesoporous fe2o3 sio2 composite had a great potential for removal application of dyes from wastewater without phosphates and iron ligand

discharge of several hazardous dyes from waster water of many textile industries is one of main causes for serious environmental problems that concerned with human health and aquatic ecosystem due to the toxicity and the carcinogenic effect of these materials 1 2 therefore the removal of dyes from wastewater is a challenge to the related industries because of their high solubility in water complex structure and synthetic origin 3 numerous physical chemical and biological methods are presently available for degradation of dye effluents from various industries 4 6 however the physical and biological methods may simply transfer the pollutants from one phase to another phase furthermore high cost of equipments involved in these processes limits their practical large scale application 7 alternatively advanced oxidation processes aops are reported as promising substitute technologies for efficient elimination of organic pollutants from wastewater with high chemical stability and low biodegradability 8 it was pointed out that selection and preparation of catalyst is a key factor for an advanced oxidation process with high performance aops are based on the generation of non selective oh radicals which one of the most powerful oxidation species to degrade organic compounds into non toxic products ideally co2 and h2o 9 homogenceous photo fenton is a common aop in which soluble iron ii is the catalyst but the difficulty of catalyst recovery and tight ph range for reaction are reported as disadvantages 10 to overcome the disadvantages of the homogeneous fenton process some attempts have been made to develop heterogeneous catalysts prepared by loading iron iii oxide onto a porous support such as zeolites clays silica and activated carbon 11 14 recently metal containing mesoporous silica have attracted much attention because the silica based materials have the high surface area good thermal stability and favorable hydrothermal stability numerous iron mesoporous silica composites were synthesized for degrading organic compounds such as methyl orange acid orange polyarylamide and phenol 11 15 17 the selection of suitable silica source is a crucial factor with respect to practical application because the silica source is directly affected not only to properties of silica supporters but to cost effective application mesoporous silica synthesized by using tetraethyl orthosilicate teos was known as a relatively expense silica material in this study rice husk rh a cheap silica source was utilized rh is the outer covering of rice grain which is obtained from the rice production rh contributes about 20 25 wt of the dry weight of paddy rice it was reported that world rice production is 489 1 million tons every year which means approximately 122 163 million tons of rice husk biomass will be generated globally 18 the bulk density of rh is approximately 100 122 kg m3 rh contains about 15 28 wt of silica and 72 85 wt of lignocellulose depending on the variety geographic location origin climate and season 19 20 the conversion of rh into valuable products has been attracted the great attention for researchers to synthesize sio2 and its composites various methods have been developed such as directed extraction of silica from rice husk 18 21 impregnation method 22 and burning the rice husk at high temperature above 500 23 26 these methods had been carried out with many stages and used a lot of chemicals such as sulfuric acid hydrogen chloride oxalic acid sodium hydroxide ionic liquids etc however the surface area of sio2 based composites was still low below 80 m2 g since surface area and pore volume of material are the crucial factors affecting to catalytic performance of catalyst therefore it is desirable to develop a suitable method for producing silica composites with large surface area and high pore volume the main objective of this study was a synthesis of mesoporous fe2o3 sio2 composite by using porous silica prepared from rice husk with the assistant of ctab the catalytic performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite was evaluated by the degradation of tartrazine in the presence of h2o2 and it was compared to physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 as synthesized fe2o3 and sio2 and commercial fe2o3 the parametric studies on reaction such as tartrazine concentration dosage catalyst h2o2 concentration ph solution and temperature on the degradation of tartrazine were carried out to elucidate the optimal reaction condition in addition the reusability of catalyst was evaluated moreover as the solution additionally contained inorganic salts nacl na2so4 and na2hpo4 and iron ligand edta the degradation efficiency of tartrazine was also evaluated the degradation kinetics were obtained from experimental degradation profile with time by using the first order kinetic model 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals rice husk was obtained from a farm in thai binh province of vietnam the silica content was determined by mass analysis the result showed that rice husk contained 21 3 wt of silica tartrazine from sigma aldrich 99 0 was used without further purification and its characteristics are presented in table 1

solution was adjusted by using dilute solutions of h2so4 and naoh 2 2 preparation of porous silica raw rice husk was initially washed with tap water and rinsed with distilled water in 5 times to remove the dirty then the rh was treated with hydrochloric acid of 0 5 m for 30 min at the constant stirring to remove the metal impurities in a batch reactor subsequently it was rinsed with distilled water again to remove acid filtered and dried at 80 for 24 h the dry rh was burned in a muffle furnace at 600 for 2 h under air flow condition to obtained rha after 5 g of rha was mixed with 100 ml of naoh 2 m in an erlenmeyer flask the mixture was boiled for 2 h to dissolve silica from ash the na2sio3 was formed by following reaction 1 sio2 rha 2naoh na2sio3 h2o the slurry consisting of residue digested ash na2sio3 water and free naoh was then filtered and the colorless filtrated solution with ph of about 13 was cool to room temperature an amount ctab of 0 219 g was added into 34 ml of 0 6 n hcl for 6 min it was added into the na2sio3 solution obtained above under the ph control of 7 5 8 5 after the solution was aged at 50 for 24 h the white gel was obtained and then poured in an autoclave at 100 for 48 h the white solid powder was recovered by filtration and wash with distilled water to remove the excess amounts of surfactant and acid until measuring neutral ph value finally the white powder was dried and calcined at 600 to obtain porous silica 2 3 preparation of catalysts the porous fe2o3 sio2 composite was prepared by a facile impregnation method typically 1 44 g of silica powder was immersed in 10 ml of 0 2 m fe no3 3 and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 24 h at room temperature after the impregnation the sample was dried at 80 c for 24 h and then calcined at 500 c for 5 h in a muffle furnace the obtained powder was cooled to room temperature and stored in a stoppered bottle denote assynthesized fe2o3 sio2 for catalytic experiments as an alternative method fe2o3 sio2 composite was prepared by directed extraction of silica from rh fig s1 the raw rh was also pre treated by hcl and distilled water by the similar procedure in section 2 2 subsequently 7 g of dry rh was added into 100 ml naoh 1 m prepared by dissolving 4 g of naoh in 100 ml distilled water the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then was filtered to removal of rice husk residue the obtained dark brown na2sio3 was added 6 16 g of fe no 3 9h2o the ph solution was adjusted to 3 0 by hno3 solution to form the dark gel after aging for 24 h the gel was filtered and washed several times by distilled water and ethanol the gel was dried at 110 for 12 h and calcined at 500 in air for 5 h the dark brown powder was obtained and denoted as rh fe2o3 sio2 commercial fe2o3 as synthesized fe2o3 prepared by vaporizing fe no3 3 solution at 80 c for 24 h and then calcined at 500 c for 5 h and as synthesized fe2o3 with commercial sio2 fe2o3 sio2 prepared by a physical mixing were used to compare with the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite with respect to degradation of tartrazine from aqueous solution in the presence of h2o2 2 4 characterization the crystalline phase of sample was investigated by x ray power diffraction xrd xrd patterns were obtained by using bruker d8 ax xrd diffractometer germany with cu kα irradiation 40 kv 40 ma the 2θ ranging from 10 to

fe sem jeol 7600 f the chemical composition of composite was determined by energy dispersive spectrometry eds jeol 7600 f textural properties were measured via n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using a quantachrome instrument autosorb iq version 3 0 analyzer the specific surface area pore volume and pore diameter were obtained by using the brunauer emmett teller bet method 2 5 catalytic activity studies experiments on the degradation of tartrazine were conducted in a bath mode reactor typically 50 mg of catalyst and premeasured amount of h2o2 solution were added to a beaker of 250 ml containing 100 ml of dye solution at desired ph condition under magnetic stirring at a given time interval an aliquot 2 ml of dye was withdrawn from the suspension and immediately filtered by a syringe filter 0 45 μ m ptfe membrane then the dye concentration was analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer agilent 8453 at the maximum absorbance wavelength of tartrazine λmax 428 nm the degradation efficiency of tartrazine was calculated by the following equation 2 degradation efficiency c 0 c t c o 100 the degradation rate of tartrazine was determined by fitting the degradation profile with the first order kinetic model as presented by the following equation 3 ln c o c t k ap t where kap s 1 is the rate constant co is the initial concentration of tartrazine and ct is the concentration of tartrazine in time and t is reaction time presented by min and s for eqs 2 and 3 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization fig 1 presents the fe sem and tem images eds spectrum and eds mapping image of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 and as synthesized sio2 silica showed an aggregate shape like light clouds fig 1a and the surface morphology for as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 became darker and denser fig 1b after loading iron the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite exhibited higher aggregation than silica due to impregnation and calcination processes as shown in tem images fig 1c and d both samples showed bulk shape consisting of many small particles with approximately 10 20 nm in size the silica and iron oxide were not clearly distinguished from the sem images however iron oxide nanoparticles with 5 nm in size were well dispersed on silica particles in a tem image fig 1e the elemental composition of the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite from energy dispersive spectrometry eds fig 1f stated that the composite contained 8 1 wt fe 38 1 wt si and 53 3 wt o in addition the eds mapping image fig 1g clearly showed the dispersion of fe on the surface of sio2 fig 2 a shows the wide angle xrd diffractions of as synthesized sio2 and as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite the diffraction peak at 2θ 20 1 was assigned to amorphous silica 27 and the diffraction peaks at 2θ 21 8 25 0 35 39 and 49 3 were assigned to α fe2o3 jcpds data 89 596 27 the broad and low intensity peaks of fe2o3 could result from low loading deposition level well dispersion and poor crystalline with a small size of metal oxide particles in the composite fig 2b presents the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of as synthesized sio2 and as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 according to the iupac classification both of samples clearly showed a type ii with an h1 hysteresis loop indicating material with agglomerates or compacts of approximately uniform spheres 28 the hysteresis of both fe2o3 sio2 and sio2 samples was observed at relative pressure p po of 0 82 1 0 but the hysteresis level of fe2o3 sio2 was slightly higher the pore size of sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 was distributed in the range of 10 60 nm but the distribution intensity of as prepared fe2o3 sio2 was slightly reduced from that of sio2 the average pore diameters of sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 were 28 8 and 28 3 nm respectively as presented in table 2 after loading fe2o3 by impregnation method in this study the surface area slightly increased from 98 2 to 109 5 m2 g and mesopore volume increased from 0 746 to 0 818 cm3 g but the variation of micropore volume was negligible according to the results in table 2 it was expected that fe2o3 nanoparticles were mainly dispersed in relatively large pores and surface of sio2 the ft ir spectra of as synthesized sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 composite were almost similar as shown in fig 2c the bands near 3653 and 3043 cm 1 corresponded to the oh stretching vibration of sioh and absorbed water hoh 29 the intense bands at 1117 805 and 460 cm 1 could be assigned to the siosi asymmetric stretching vibrations 30 the small bands found at 685 and 604 cm 1 could be assigned to stretching vibrations of feo and siofe respectively which confirmed that sio2 indeed binds with fe2o3 3 2 degradation of tartrazine 3 2 1 effect of catalytic system fig 3 shows the degradation of tartrazine in different reaction systems at the same reaction conditions dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c the degradation efficiency was about 2 9 for only h2o2 within 80 min and reaction rate of k 2 8e 3 min 1 table 3 indicating that tartrazine is a persistent compound and hardly degraded in h2o2 solution even though h2o2 is a powerful oxidizing agent for the reaction system with only sio2 or fe2o3 sio2 the degradation efficiency was also negligible showing 0 7 and 1 6 for sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 the minute decrease in concentration of tartrazine could come from the adsorption of tartrazine on sio2 and fe2o3 sio2 the adsorption ability of tartrazine on fe2o3 sio2 was slightly higher than that of sio2 because of 8 wt of fe2o3 the interaction between negatively charged tartrazine in aqueous solution and positively charged iron iii on sio2 could improve electrostatic adsorption affinity of tartrazine on the fe2o3 sio2 composite the degradation of tartrazine for commercial fe2o3 h2o2 and as synthesized fe2o3 h2o2 catalytic systems reached almost saturation within an initial 10 min showing the degradation efficiencies of approximately 10 0 and 2 5 and reaction rates of 1 8e 3 and 0 47e 3 min 1 for commercial fe2o3 h2o2 and as synthesized fe2o3 h2o2 respectively the degradation efficiency of tartrazine with the physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system varied almost linearly with time the removal efficiency was higher than that of commercial fe2o3 h2o2 system at 80 min 13 5 while the reaction rate was slower the degradation of tartrazine in the commercial fe2o3 h2o2 as synthesized fe2o3 h2o2 and physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 systems could be attributed to fenton like system oxidation according to the results since the decomposition of h2o2 by iron oxide has been reported to yield hydroxyl radial oh and superoxide radicals o2 31 it was expected that sio2 contributed to improving the reactivity of tartrazine in the fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system the degradation efficiency and reaction rate of tatrazine in rh fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system were 47 1 and 0 024 min 1 respectively these were larger than those of commercial fe2o3 h2o2 as synthesized fe2o3 h2o2 and physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 systems however the degradation efficiency and reaction rate of tartrazine in the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system was much higher than the others showing the degradation efficiency of 98 5 at 80 min and reaction rate of 0 063 min 1 the surface area of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 was similar to that of physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 according to table 2 the difference in physical properties between synthesized fe2o3 sio2 and physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 was not enough to explain the difference in performance between both samples it implied that the reaction on well dispersed fe2o3 on sio2 could be accelerated by the surface diffusion of tartrazine physically adsorbed on the pores of sio2 therefore the dispersion of iron on porous media was a more important factor for decomposition of tartrazine in heterogeneous catalysts than the physical properties of composite 3 2 2 effect of initial ph the ph in solution is a decisive parameter to design a reaction process it significantly affects not only the functional groups and surface charges of adsorbents but also the structure and ionization degree of pollutant molecules 32 in this study the effect of initial ph in solution on degradation of tartrazine in the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system was investigated the performance was evaluated at wide range of ph values from 2 0 to 6 0 under the fixed other conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l catalyst dosage of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm and temperature of 30 c fig 4 a b presents the degradation efficiency with time at different ph conditions and first order fitting plots the initial ph condition in solution gave a critical impact on the degradation of tartrazine in fenton like system although the reaction rate and efficiency at ph 2 5 was slightly lower than those at ph 3 0 during 40 min the degradation efficiencies at both ph conditions reached 98 5 within 80 min at initial ph 3 0 in solution the ph variation with reaction time was monitored in fig 4c the ph decreased slightly with time showing the decrease from 3 0 to 2 9 in 40 min and to 2 8 in 80 min it has been reported that methyl orange mo could be degraded in fenton like catalyst the initial ph of the stock solution was remarkably decreased from 7 3 to 2 9 and it was attributed to the formation of hno3 and other organic acids such as oxalic acid acetic acid and succinic acid 15 also the similar results were obtained for the degradation of azo dyes reactive red 120 reactive black 5 reactive yellow 84 in h2o2 under uv irradiation 33 in this study small variation of ph solution could be attributed primarily to formation of organic acids rather than strong acid hno3 at lower than ph 2 5 ph 2 0 the reaction performance decreased significantly showing the degradation efficiency of 39 7 in 80 min and reaction rate of 0 005 min 1 the reduced reaction rate might be attributed to the stabilization of h2o2 through the formation of oxonimum ion h3o2 leading to substantially the reduced reactivity with ferrous ion in addition the fenton reaction could be retarded due to the scaveging effect of hydroxyl radicals oh by excessive amount of h ion at low ph conditions 34 4 oh h e h2o furthermore the formation of complex species fe h2o 6 2 and fe h2o 6 3 can also contribute to more slow reaction with h2o2 35 at greater than ph 3 0 the reaction rate and efficiency were significantly decreased with an increase in ph value the degradation efficiencies were 64 3 7 9 and 1 1 at 80 min and reaction rates were 0 011 0 001 and 0 0002 min 1 at ph 3 5 4 0 and 6 0 respectively since the surface of fe2o3 sio2 catalyst is charged negatively at higher ph value the interaction between catalyst surface and tartrazine dye is reduced in addition some portion of h2o2 can undergo self decomposition into molecular oxygen without production of radicals in less acidic medium 36 and the formation of ferric hydroxide complexes leads to a reduction of oh radical as a result higher than ph 3 0 condition for degradation of tartrazine in the fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system was not desirable due to drastic decrease of performance 3 2 3 effect of initial h2o2 concentration the effect of initial h2o2 concentration on degradation of tartrazine was investigated by varying h2o2 concentration from 1 2 mm to 60 mm at the fixed other conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c the degradation efficiency and kinetic model fitting are presented in fig 5 at low h2o2 concentration of 1 2 mm the reaction rate and degradation efficiency were low 0 002 min 1 and 13 9 respectively when h2o2 concentration increased to 6 mm the reaction rate and degradation efficiency remarkably increased to 0 036 min 1 and 95 2 respectively then these values achieved 0 063 min 1 and 98 5 respectively at 12 mm since the increase of h2o2 concentration in the solution led to increase the formation of oh the reaction rate and degradation efficiency increased however further increase from h2o2 concentration of 12 mm resulted in the gradual decrease of reaction rate and degradation efficiency because a competition of oh consumption between the substrate and h2o2 increased with increasing h2o2 concentration the reaction rates were 0 044 0 038 0 027 min 1 and degradation efficiencies were 97 0 95 0 and 88 0 at h2o2 concentrations of 18 30 and 60 mm respectively since excess h2o2 molecules act as scavenger of hydroxyl radical oh can recombine to form h2o2 and o2 as expressed in eqs 5 and 6 therefore it is necessary to select an optimal initial h2o2 concentration for the heterogeneous fenton system 31 in the study h2o2 concentration of 12 mm was an optimal value for the degradation of tartrazine in the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system 5 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o 6 ho2 oh h2o o2 3 2 4 effect of catalyst dosage experiments were conducted at different amounts of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite to obtain an optimum catalyst dosage the catalyst dosage was varied from 0 1 to 0 6 g l at the fixed other conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c as shown in fig 6 when the catalyst concentration increased from 0 1 to 0 5 g l the reaction rate and degradation efficiency significantly increased showing the variation from 19 9 to 98 5 at 80 min more active iron sites resulted in the improved catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and faster generation of oh radicals 35 37 further increase in catalyst dosage from 0 5 g l led to decreasing reaction rate without any significant change in degradation efficiency 98 5 at catalyst dosage of 0 6 g l this phenomenon could be ascribed to decomposing certain amount of h2o2 to o2 due to thermodynamic and mass transfer limitation 38 in addition quenching of oh radials by excess iron ions in reaction process eq 7 may also be responsible for the result 7 fe2 2oh fe3 2oh 3 2 5 effect of initial dye concentration experiments were carried out by various concentrations of tartrazine from 40 to 70 mg at the other fixed conditions dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c in heterogeneous fenton processes the reaction occurs at the surface of fe3o3 sio2 catalyst between oh radicals generated at the active sites and tartrazine molecules adsorbed on the surface the increase of initial dye concentration could decrease the probability of reaction between dye molecules and the hydroxyl radicals because more tartrazine molecules adsorb on the catalyst surface and the occupied active sites of the catalyst lead to fewer hydroxyl radials at the surface of the catalyst 39 in addition the intermediates generated in dye degradation process might also compete for the limited adsorption sites with dye molecules which blocked their interactions with fe ii fe iii active sites 40 as shown in fig 7 the reaction rate was slightly decreased with an increase in initial concentration of tartrazine but the degradation efficiency within 80 min was almost same regardless of tartrazine concentrations however compared with previous other experimental parameters the effects of initial concentration on performance were relatively minute 3 2 6 effect of reaction temperature the effect of reaction temperature on dye degradation in the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite system was performed in the range of 30 to 60 c fig 8 a shows significant increase of reaction rates within initial 10 min with an increase in temperature but the degradation efficiency of tartrazine was almost similar it implied that the increased temperature led to accelerating the decomposition of h2o2 into hydroxyl radical oh and subsequently enhancing degradation efficiency during an initial period 41 however as the temperature increased from 50 to 60 the performance variation was trivial since increasing temperature also accelerates the thermal decomposition of h2o2 into oxygen and water the utilization efficiency of h2o2 can be decreased and the consumption is deteriorated 42 in addition the high reaction temperature will give the industrial application drawback due to energy penalty therefore it is important to choose an appropriate reaction temperature with respect to degradation efficiency and energy consumption as presented in fig 8b the rate constant increased with temperature according to the rate constants obtained at different temperatures the activation energy ea for the oxidation of tartrazine by h2o2 with as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 catalyst was calculated by the arrhenius equation 8 k a p a e x p e a r t where a is the pre exponential factor ea is the activation energy j mol r is the ideal gas constant 8 314 j mol k t is the reaction temperature k the arrhenius plot of lnkap versus 1 t is presented in fig 8c activation enthalpy and activation entropy were calculated using the eyring equation 9 l n k a p t l n k b h δ s r δ h r t where kb and h are the boltzmann and planck s constant respectively the free activation energy δg was determined using the following equation at 298 k 10 δg δh tδs the activation parameters obtained were as follows ea 30 578 kj mol δh 27 943 kj mol δs 210 925 j mol and δg 33 587 kj mol the results indicated that the oxidative process is spontaneous with low demand of energy 3 2 7 effect of additive industrial wastewater might contain certain level of inorganic salts sodium chloride sodium sulphate potassium sulphate etc as electrolytes 43 44 and organic agents edta tartaric acid formic acid glycine nitrilotriacetic acid etc as iron ligands 45 therefore it is worthwhile to investigate the effects of dissolute salt and iron ligand on the degradation of dye with the fe2o3 sio2 h2o2 system for dye treatment processes the experiments were carried out by adding nacl na2so4 na2hpo4 and edta each additive of 20 mg to tartrazine solution while keeping the other variables constant at the conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c as seen in fig 9 the reaction rate and degradation efficiency were slightly decreased when tartrazine solution contained nacl and na2so4 the result indicated that the degradation of tartrazine was not significantly inhibited by the presence of cl and so4 2 on the other hand the reaction rate was substantially dropped by the addition of na2hpo4 into tartrazine solution a possible reason for the inhibition of tartrazine oxidation process is that h2po4 anion forms complexes with fe3 ion such as fe h2po4 3 which are more stable than the complexes formed by cl and so4 2 another reason is that the h2po4 can serve as oh scavengers to form less reactive h2po4 radical eq 11 and leads to the shortage of oh in the fenton system therefore the oxidation rate and degradation efficiency were suppressed in the presence of h2po4 11 h2po4 oh h2po4 oh the similar phenomenon of h2po4 was observed as iron ligand edta was added however the mechanism of heterogeneous fenton reactions in the presence of edta is unclear because it can simultaneously react as homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions edta can induce an enhanced homogeneous fenton mechanism by increasing the dissolution of solid catalysts 29 in contrast the surface complexed ligands can compete with organic compounds and h2o2 to occupy the surface active sites 30 consequently it led to decreasing h2o2 activation and the generation of high valent iron species was also speculated according to some inhibitive effects of different scavengers 3 3 reaction mechanism discussion the uv vis spectral change of tartrazine was measured at the time interval of 10 min during degradation process in fig 10 a before oxidation t 0 the absorption spectrum of tartrazine was characterized by one band in the ultraviolet region located at 257 nm and by another band in visible region located at 428 nm the peak at 257 nm is due to benzene like structure in the molecules while the band in the visible region is associated with the chromophore containing azo linkage 38 the disappearance of the absorbance peak at 428 nm with the reaction time could stem from the fragmentation of the azo links by oxidation 46 in addition to this rapid degradation effect the decay of the absorbance at 257 nm was considered as evidence of aromatic fragment degradation in the dye molecule and its intermediates in the degradation of tartrazine via oxidation reaction by h2o2 under activation of catalyst the iron oxide actively reacts with h2o2 leading to formation of hydroxyl oh and perhydroxy ho2 radicals via reactions 12 and 13 it was well reported that oh radical is the responsible species for the mineralization of organic pollutant however ho2 radial does not play significant role in degradation of organic pollutant due to its lower oxidation potential than oh 38 as a result tartrazine was very highly degraded within 80 min the oxidation reactions of tartrazine with oh and ho2 were described in reactions 14 and 15 the fragmentation mechanism of tartrazine could be proposed in fig 10b with the cleavage of the symmetrical and asymmetrical azo bonds 12 sio2 fe3 h2o2 sio2 fe2 ho2 h 13 sio2 fe2 h2o2 sio2 fe3 ho oh 14 oh ho2 tartrazine intermediate products 15 oh ho2 intermediate products co2 h2o so2 n2 na2co3 etc 3 4 reusability of catalyst and fixed bed experiment the reusability of catalyst is one of important factors from industrial perspective the reusability potential of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 was evaluated by the catalytic performance through five consecutive cycles after an experiment the solid catalyst was filtered and washed with distilled water and ethanol for several times and then dried at 80 c for 12 h dry powder was re used as the catalyst for next experiment without further treatment in addition the fe2o3 sio2 composite after fifth cyclic experiment was characterized by ft ir as shown in fig 11 a the degradation efficiency of tartrazine slightly decreased and it still remained at 82 in fifth cyclic experiment the reduction of catalytic activity may be due to leaching the small amount of metal ions from the face of solid leading the vibration bands at 685 and 604 cm 1 for fe o bonding were almost disappeared for the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 sample after fifth cyclic experiment as seen in fig 11b in addition the intense band observed at 3326 cm 1 of oh and the small bands at 1731 and 1625 cm 1 of stretching vibrations of coh and co espectively 47 were evidences for the formation of organic acids as mention in section 3 2 2 these results indicated that the catalyst deactivation may occur from diverse factors including catalyst poisoning by compounds formed during the oxidation and adsorption of some organic acids on the surface of catalyst the catalytic performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite was initially evaluated by fixed bed reactor inner diameter 7 mm length 250 mm as seen in fig s2a both ends of column were packed with glass wool and glass beads the dye solution tartrazine 50 mg l h2o2 concentration 12 mm ph 3 0 was fed into the column at 200 ml min by a peristaltic pump the dye concentration at the outlet of the reactor column was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer the breakthrough curve of tartrazine on as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite is presented in fig s2b the breakthrough time and saturation time were 52 and 342 min respectively the degradation capacity of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite for tartrazine estimated by the same method mentioned in our previous report 27 was 0 128 g g 3 5 the degradation of other organic dyes and comparison with other catalysts the degradation efficiency of dyes in fenton catalyst system depends not only catalyst behaviour such as surface area pore volume and pore size distribution and reaction parameters but also properties of dyes each catalyst might have the own optimum condition for degradation of certain dye beside to tartrazine in this study the performance of the as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite was evaluated by other organic dyes such as congo red cr janus green b jgb and methylene blue mb at the optimal conditions for tartrazine dye concentration of 50 mg l dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 additive of 20 mg and temperature of 30 c the results are presented in fig 12 janus green b was found to be the lowest reaction rate and efficiency in 80 min 0 016 min 1 71 2 respectively the reaction rate of methylene blue was highest 0 113 min 1 among tested dyes while the degradation efficiencies of methylene blue tartrazine and congo red in 80 min were similar the catalytic performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite was compared with different catalysts from recent literatures 48 53 the reaction condition and degradation efficiency of these catalysts are listed in table 4 since each study evaluated the removal capacity under different conditions direct comparison among catalysts is challenging but the relative performance of fe2o3 sio2 catalyst can be evaluated indirectly in table 4 the degradation efficiency of tartrazine on fe2o3 sio2 composite within 80 min was higher than that of al and fe pillared clays under visible light and even tio2 ag tio2 and periwinkle shell ash under uv light the degradation efficiency was lower than that of nano composite of molecularly imprinted polymer mip and polyvinylpyrrolidone capped cadmium sulfide nanoparticles but the reaction rate of tartrazine with fe2o3 sio2 composite was faster therefore fe2o3 sio2 composite prepared by the facile method is expected to reduce the cost of catalyst for large scale application 4 conclusion mesoporous sio2 was successfully prepared from rice husk and it was used to synthesize the mesoporous fe2o3 sio2 composite by a facile impregnation method compared with the physical properties of the sio2 sample the dispersion of iron oxide by the impregnation and decomposition of fe no3 3 at 500 led to increasing the bet surface area bjh mesopore volume total pore volume of fe2o3 sio2 109 5 m2 g 0 818 cm3 g and 0 8206 cm3 g respectively it was found that the iron oxide particles with a small size of about 5 nm were well dispersed on silica the performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 was evaluated by fenton degradation of dyes tartrazine congo red janus green b and methylene blue the fe2o3 sio2 composite exhibited an excellent performance for degradation of tartrazine 98 5 in 80 min at the optimal reaction conditions tartrazine concentration of 50 mg l dosage catalyst of 0 5 g l h2o2 concentration of 12 mm ph 3 0 and temperature of 30 c the performance was much higher than those of physically mixed fe2o3 sio2 as synthesized fe2o3 and sio2 and commercial fe2o3 the activation energy enthalpy entropy and free energy data demonstrated the spontaneous and endothermic process but the demand of reaction energy was not high the addition of inorganic salt na2hpo4 and iron ligand edta into tartrazine solution led to significantly drop the reaction rate and degradation efficiency whereas the addition of nacl and na2so4 did not significantly affect catalytic performance of as synthesized fe2o3 sio2 composite in addition the as prepared composite exhibited high catalyst performance in reuse with the degradation efficiency as high as 82 after fifth cyclic experiment thus the mesoporous fe2o3 sio2 composite had a great potential for removal application of dyes from wastewater without phosphates and iron ligand
