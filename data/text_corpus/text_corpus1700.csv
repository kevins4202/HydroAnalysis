8500,study region to provide a picture of hydrological impact of climate change across different climatic zones in europe this study considers eight river basins tagus in iberian peninsula emån and lule in scandinavia rhine danube and teteriv in central and eastern europe tay on the island of great britain and northern dvina in north eastern europe study focus in this study the assessment of the impacts of moderate and high end climate change scenarios on the hydrological patterns in european basins was conducted to assess the projected changes the process based eco hydrological model swim soil and water integrated model was set up calibrated and validated for the basins the swim was driven by the bias corrected climate projections obtained from the coupled simulations of the global circulation models and regional climate models new hydrological insights for the region the results show robust decreasing trends in water availability in the most southern river basin tagus an overall increase in discharge in the most northern river basin lule increase in the winter discharge and shift in seasonality in northern and central european catchments the impacts of the high end climate change scenario rcp 8 5 continue to develop until the end of the century while those of the moderate climate change scenario rcp 4 5 level off after the mid century the results of this study also confirm trends found previously with mostly global scale models keywords european rivers climate change hydrology eco hydrological modelling climate change impact high end scenarios 1 introduction climate change is one of the world s most important global challenges which will have global as well as regional consequences and is expected to affect all aspects of modern humanity ipcc wgii 2014 the paris agreement entered in force at the 21st conference of parties cop21 in 2015 indicated a great success of more than 20 years of negotiations but also imposed a significant challenge to the contemporary society by setting the goal of limiting the global warming to 2 c while aspiring to 1 5 c rogelj et al 2016 schellnhuber et al 2016 this goal is ambitious as now the trajectories of the greenhouse gases emissions are pointing to the high end climate change scenarios above the agreed threshold and this development still remains probable if global actions are not taken urgently the flow regimes of rivers are being modified all over the world by anthropogenic impacts such as water management operations and land use changes some measures put freshwater resources at significant stress and climate change is expected to alter the hydrological conditions further posing additional pressure on water resources and aquatic ecosystems the climate change risks have to be understood quantified and incorporated into water management strategies at the regional level döll et al 2014 all adaptation measures including those of no regret type have to be based on a solid understanding of the current situation and possible future trends harding et al 2014 both long term and short term hydrological modelling is a primary tool to obtain projections on how climate change would impact water resources and hydrological patterns of river basins in general there is a voluminous amount of literature on the impact of climate change on hydrological cycle and water resources covering different scales from river basins to continental and global scales most of the continental and global scale studies employ global scale hydrological models as the application of a regional model to all river basins in a continent e g in europe would result in significant calibration efforts and high input data requirements at the scale of europe papadimitriou et al 2016 conducted a study on impacts of the high end climate change on river discharge in eight selected european river basins applying the non calibrated global hydrological model jules best et al 2011 they have found an increase in the number of days with low flow for central and southern europe rhine danube guadiana and an increase in low flows for scandinavia kemijoki river further several studies conducted with different global models e g watergap mac pdm 09 have projected an increase of discharge in the high latitudes and decrease in the mediterranean and southern europe arnell and gosling 2013 hagemann et al 2013 schneider et al 2013 and seasonal changes in the snowmelt driven rivers where discharge in winter is increasing while the summer discharge is decreasing döll and schmied 2012 wanders et al 2015 uncertainties associated with global scale hydrological modelling are usually higher as compared with those related to the regional scale hydrological models hagemann et al 2013 gosling et al 2017 hattermann et al 2017 this can be explained by coarser resolution of the input data and usually poor performance of global models most of them are not calibrated in the historical reference period hattermann et al 2017 as well as inability of most of the global models to take into account water management infrastructure abbaspour et al 2015 due to this it makes sense to verify trends by application of the basin scale models further there are some continental scale studies performed with the pan european models which are partly calibrated donnelly et al 2016 applied a multi basin model e hype to the entire europe which showed good simulation results and can be used for climate impact studies after some improvements regarding input data and additional calibration roudier et al 2016 applying three pan european models lisflood burek et al 2012 e hype donnelly et al 2016 and vic liang et al 1994 found that drought events may increase in southern europe in particular in southern france and spain and the frequency of flood events may increase in northern europe if the global temperature will increase by 2 c a study of alfieri et al 2015 applied the distributed hydrological model lisflood driven by the high end climate change scenario in major river basins across the entire european region they found decrease of runoff in the southern europe and increase of runoff in northern europe and no specific trends for the discharges in the central europe however the abovementioned analyses were focused on the extreme events frequency analysis or on the validation of the pan european models and not on the general picture of the hydrological impacts of projected climate change regarding the hydrological impact assessments performed with the regional scale hydrological models it usually focuses on individual regions often single river basins and studies encompassing large areas are rare aich et al 2014 vetter et al 2016 recently a special issue in climatic change see editorial krysanova and hattermann 2017 addressed the issue of intercomparison of the regional scale hydrological models and climate change impacts across twelve large river basins around the globe including two basins in europe rhine and tagus fulfilled by the efforts of the isi mip project warszawski et al 2014 group our study aims to close the existing gap and provides an assessment of trends in the long term mean annual dynamics of river discharge in eight representative european basins triggered by climatic change for that an eco hydrological process based catchment scale hydrological model was applied which was calibrated and validated for each case study in advance and accounted for water management operations where applicable it used a more elaborated approach when compared to the previous european scale studies we provide an assessment and intercomparison of the moderate and high end climate change impacts on river discharge across different regions in europe focused on eight river basins tagus in iberian peninsula emån and lule in scandinavia rhine in central europe danube and teteriv in central and eastern europe tay on the island of great britain and northern dvina in north eastern europe these basins were selected within the european case study of the eu funded project impressions impacts and risks from the high end scenarios strategies for innovative solutions our assessment considers two future climate change scenarios of moderate rcp4 5 and high end rcp8 5 global warming and two future time slices intermediate 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 evaluated with respect to the reference period 1981 2010 current study complements the picture of the european scale assessments done before and verifies the trends found in the previous studies fulfilled with the global and pan european scale models 2 case study basins the river basins considered in this study were selected to represent the variety of conditions in the river basins in europe the selected basins are situated in different climatic zones see annex 1 in supplementary material that provides a map of the basins with respect to climatic zones after the köppen geiger classification have different basin areas ranging from meso to macroscale basins from 4500 km2 for the emån to 817000 km2 for the danube covering large sub regions of europe have different topographic conditions from river basins with flat topography in lowland like the northern dvina to mountainous regions like the tagus basin or the rhine headwaters have different land use conditions from areas covered mostly with forest the northern dvina emån to extensively cultivated river basins the teteriv danube have different levels of anthropogenic influence on river discharge from highly regulated river basins with many reservoirs and diversion channels the tagus and lule to rivers with mostly pristine conditions the northern dvina have different discharge regime characteristics specific for their climatic areas like the tagus river with the mediterranean type of regime characterized by low discharge in summer and peak discharge in winter or rivers with different snowmelt driven regimes specific for their climatic regions e g the norhern dvina with peak discharge in may or lule with peak discharge in june july the basins were also selected based on their significance for the respective regions in europe for example the danube and rhine catchments cover the large area of central and eastern europe and are important for population of many countries there further the emån lule and tay rivers are very significant rivers in sweden and scotland the latter two also for energy production the northern dvina is one of the largest rivers in the north european part of russia with natural flow conditions the tagus in the iberian peninsula is very important water supplier for spain and portugal and the teteriv river basins is one of the largest tributaries of the most important river in the ukraine dniepr river the most important characteristics of the eight river basins under consideration are summarized in table 1 and in annex 1 of the supplementary material and the location of river basins is shown in fig 1 3 methods 3 1 swim model the soil and water integrated model swim is a process based deterministic eco hydrological model based on two earlier created models swat arnold et al 1998 and matsalu krysanova et al 1989 the model is described in krysanova et al 1998 the swim model can be seen as an assemblage of numerical representations of physical processes of hydrological cycle and related processes vegetation growth nutrient cycling and erosion at the river basin scale these physical processes are mathematically interpreted with similar levels of complexity and form four main modules of the model describing hydrological processes groundwater biogeochemical cycles and plant growth swim operates on a daily time step and uses climatic land use topographic vegetation and soil datasets as input files the topographical map of a catchment serves as a basis to create a subbasin map which is later intersected with land use and soil maps to identify the so called hrus hydrological response units or hydrotopes areas within each subbasin where a unique combination of land use and soil type is present the identical hrus the ones which have the same land use and soil types in a subbasin are assumed to have the same hydrological behaviour and are later combined into hydrotope classes within each subbasin and modelled as one subarea the components of hydrological cycle nutrient cycling and sediment loads are calculated at the hydrotope level and lateral flows are added for subbasins after that the lateral flows of water nutrients and sediments are routed through the basin using conceptual representation of the open channel hydraulics the muskingum method taking into account transmission losses more than 20 years of application history of the swim include development of model versions for specific processes wetlands nutrients in streams reservoirs etc and many stories of successful application as well as some failure cases as thoroughly discussed in krysanova et al 2015 the swim model has been successfully applied for investigation of different hydrological phenomena like impacts of climatic change on stream flow aich et al 2013 huang et al 2013 lobanova et al 2016 stagl and hattermann 2015 on agricultural production liersch et al 2013 and on extreme hydrological events aich et al 2016 hattermann et al 2012 huang et al 2014 2013 as well as for analysis of the glacier lakes outburst floods wortmann et al 2014 and hydrological impacts of irrigation activities huang et al 2015 3 2 reservoir module the reservoir module of swim is a conceptual representation of the storage release processes at dams and reservoirs koch et al 2013 it is fully integrated in the swim model and can represent three management strategies depending on the minimum discharge from reservoirs e g for environmental needs minimum and maximum reservoir volumes in a given month or firm hydropower production target the reservoir module requires a volume discharge surface area relationship for each reservoir and also the inflow outflow and stored volume time series for parametrization of the management process the reservoir module can also simulate the hydropower production and requires data of the hydropower plant installed as an input for the calculation of the daily produced hydropower each reservoir in the catchment is integrated into the subbasin map of the river basin under consideration as a separate subbasin the precipitation over the reservoirs as well as evaporation rates and seepage of water to the groundwater are considered 3 3 water allocation module the water allocation module wam and its application for the simulation of the tagus segura water transfer were described in detail in the work of lobanova et al 2017 the wam simulates water withdrawals by e g irrigation channels and inter and intrabasin transfers of water for example for drinking water supply the module operates on a daily time step and enables water withdrawal from one subbasin and assignment to the other subbasin within the river basin or simply outside the basin on the next day taking into account transmission losses e g due to evaporation in the case of the tagus segura water transfer the observed withdrawn values over the calibration and validation periods were applied within wam and for the future projections the mean values over the entire observed period were applied as the projection of the withdrawal evolution was beyond the scope of this study the analysis of the possible water allocation scenarios in this area under the projected climate change scenarios can be found in lobanova et al 2017 3 4 input data the input data needed to set up the swim model for a river basin are land use map soil map digital elevation model dem and climate data as well as observed runoff for calibration and validation of the model the corine2000 land use database and the dem from the cgiar database jarvis et al 2008 both with the resolution of 100 m were used for seven case study basins except the northern dvina the land use types in the corine database were then aggregated to match the 15 land use classes of swim krysanova et al 2000 in the case of the northern dvina river the input datasets were different in particular the land use data was obtained from the global corine dataset with a coarser resolution of 250 m which is covering the european part of russia the dem model used for this catchment was obtained from the aster dataset with the resolution of 30 m which provides dem covering the entire globe tachikawa et al 2011 the aster dataset was the only one dem available for the northern dvina river as the cgiar dataset covers the globe only until 60th latitude the soil data for all basins was extracted from the european soil data centre panagos et al 2012 the parameters of each soil typological unit within each soil mapping unit were considered and weighted according to their percentage shares the missing parameters needed for the swim model simulation were derived using the pedo transfer functions krysanova et al 2000 for the modelling the vegetation parameters from the swim database for 71 vegetation types 23 parameters per type attached to the model were used and they were not adjusted for the catchments to calibrate and validate the swim model the gridded climate watch era interim forcing data weedon et al 2014 were used the watch era interim dataset covers the entire globe and provides synthetically generated climatic variables corrected to observations the watch era interim dataset is provided on a grid with a resolution of 0 5 and covers time period 1979 2010 the observed discharge data at the outlets of the basins were obtained from the global runoff data centre grdc koblenz germany database for all basins except for the tagus river basin for which the observed data at the almourol gauge were taken from the sistema nacional de informação de recursos hídricos snirh database of the portuguese ministry of environment initially the swim model was set up for the rhine river and described in huang et al 2010 for the danube river in stagl and hattermann 2015 and for the teteriv river in didovets et al 2017 for the first two basins swim was initially calibrated using watch era 40 weedon et al 2011 data as input and for the application in this study the models were re calibrated using watch era interim data as input 3 5 calibration and validation two main criteria of fit between the observed and simulated discharges were used the relative volume error rve and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the rve is a total deviation in the volume of water discharged expressed in percent and the nse is an efficiency coefficient which relates a sum of squared differences between the observed and simulated discharges to the variance of the observed values of discharge the rve coefficient can vary from 100 to inf where 0 indicates a perfect fit and the nse coefficient from inf to 1 0 where 1 indicates a perfect fit the specific limits for both criteria which correspond to a good performance of a hydrological model are nse 0 65 and pbias 15 as was specified by moriasi et al 2007 in order to test the model performance during the low flow periods also the log transformed nse lognse on the daily simulated and observed values were calculated the swim model was calibrated and validated against the observed discharge data series on the daily time step for all eight basins the calibration and validation periods were different for each river basin subject to discharge data availability the model calibration was done based on sensitivity analysis for swim performed previously for many river basins in europe the calibration procedure was performed manually altering the evapotranspiration correction coefficient base flow factor groundwater delay factor two routing coefficients manning coefficient and saturated conductivity correction coefficient also the snow parameters including threshold temperatures of snowfall and snowmelt as well as snowmelt rate were included in the calibration process in all basins except the tagus for two of eight selected river basins the lule and tagus water management infrastructure was included in the model set up the reservoirs were represented by the swim reservoir module and they were calibrated against the observed inflow outflow and water storage data obtained from the country specific databases river discharge of the lule river was found to be the most affected by water regulation followed by the tagus river basin further the tay river basin also includes several natural lakes that are regulated for electricity production however these lakes were not included in the model due to inaccessibility of data on lakes operation for the same reason due to absence of data the reservoirs in the teteriv river basin were also not considered in the model as the aim of this paper was to quantify impacts of climate change on the long term average monthly discharge it was decided to calculate the nse and rve criteria of fit on the monthly time step for all cases additionally the log nse nse and rve were calculated on the daily time step in order to test the model ability to simulate the daily dynamics of discharge as well as low flows the operational rules of the reservoirs in the tagus and lule river basins were not altered for the future projections and were preserved as current ones because the response of water infrastructure operation to changes in water availability was beyond the scope of this paper 3 6 climate scenarios the climate change projections used in this study were developed within the impressions project the projections were obtained from the cordex coupled gcm global circulation models rcm regional climate models simulations the downscaled individual climate variables were bias corrected to the reanalysis data watch era interim using the quantile mapping method themeβl et al 2012 wilcke et al 2013 the projections include seven gcm rcm coupled simulations forced by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of increase in the radiative forcing the projections were selected to cover the full range of future climate projections from 1 1 c to 4 2 c globally kok et al 2015 the selection of the gcm rcm coupled simulations was driven in the first place by the expert judgement of their performance in europe and elsewhere and in the second place by direct comparison of their ability to represent the reference cycle of temperature and precipitation in europe further the selected subset was reduced to models that represent different model sensitivity to the greenhouse gases emissions to reproduce the climate model variability the selected models cover the global increase in temperature up to 4 c as the aim of the impressions project was to focus on the high end scenarios kok et al 2015 the northern dvina river basin lies exactly at the border of the euro cordex domain and therefore the rcm simulation results may not represent this area with sufficient accuracy due to the strong influence of boundary conditions inherited from the gcms therefore it was decided to use the raw gcm output for this basin and then to bias correct it applying the same quantile mapping method as for the other basins 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation in general the performance of the swim model during the calibration and validation periods for all selected basins on the monthly time step was satisfactory however the model showed lower performance related to low flow conditions in some of the case study river basins fig 2 depicts the long term average seasonal dynamics observed and simulated with swim driven by the watch era interim data at the outlets of the selected basins over the respective calibration and validation periods together table 2 summarizes the nse and rve values obtained for the calibration and validation periods with the monthly and daily time steps and the lognse values on the daily time step for each case study basin figures a2 a9 annex 3 show the monthly mean time series the long term mean annual dynamics as well as 10th 50th and 90th flow percentiles of the observed and simulated discharge over the both calibration and validation periods for each case study river basin the swim model performance was acceptable in all case studies showing very good to acceptable performance based on ranges specified in moriasi et al 2007 in terms of the nse values both on the daily and monthly time steps the best model fitting was found for the northern dvina basin and the lowest values were estimated for the tay teteriv and lule river basins the largest rve values reaching 10 19 were obtained for the tagus and teteriv rivers this can be explained by the continuous development of irrigation channels and increase in water consumption for irrigation during the calibration and validation periods in the tagus which were not taken into account in the model as discussed in lobanova et al 2016 for the case of the teteriv river the situation might be similar to the one described for the tagus river the overestimation of the water volumes in the model in the validation period may reflect the water withdrawals effects which were not taken into account however in this case due to the absence of data on water management no solid conclusion can be drawn when looking at the seasonal dynamics one can observe that the swim model simulations reproduce observed dynamics well in most cases but also exhibit some deviations in certain sub periods in some cases in the case of the tay river the timing of flow was not properly met probably due to absence of the regulated lakes integration into the model set up in the case of the tagus river the low flows during summer were underestimated possibly due to similar reasons as this river is one of the most highly regulated in europe there are more than 40 large reservoirs in the catchment whereas in our model only 16 major reservoirs were included still the inclusion of reservoirs has increased the performance of swim in this case significantly as discussed in lobanova et al 2016 but some uncertainty due to water management infrastructure which was not taken into account is left however the most explicit example of the effects of anthropogenic activities on river flow in this study is the lule river basin in fig 1 one can see discharge measured at the outlet of the river the naturalized flow of the river simulated with the hype model lindström et al 2010 and discharge simulated with the swim model considering four major reservoirs one can observe that the natural dynamics of the river was completely transformed eliminating the flow variability making flow nearly constant throughout the year by introducing the reservoirs in the swim model the dynamics could be brought closer to the observed one however still it is far from the perfect fit when looking at the lognse values that are more sensitive to the low flow conditions one can observe that the model performance for low flow varies between basins it is quite good for the emån northern dvina and danube satisfactory for the rhine and lule but quite poor for the regulated rivers such as tagus validation period tay and teteriv where the existing flow regulation was not considered or considered only partly tagus in the case of the lule lognse was still high as the goodness of fit was calculated for the naturalized flow i e without the implementation of the reservoirs simulated with the hype model and naturalized flow simulated with the swim model the reservoirs were added to the swim model setup after the calibration of the naturalized flow conditions the calibration and validation results especially the results with the lognse criterium indicate that inclusion of the water management infrastructure is essential especially when aiming at the assessment of the low and high flows in addition to the average flow conditions in the rivers 4 2 representation of the historical discharge dynamics by swim driven by climate models to check the performance of the bias corrected climate data in the historical period the observed discharge was additionally compared with discharge simulated by swim driven by the selected gcm rcm projections fig 3 the systematic overestimation of flows with swim driven by the gcm rcm climate runs was found in two cases for the rhine and danube river basins in all other cases the simulated dynamics was similar to that driven by the era interim data the long term mean annual discharge dynamics in the teteriv river basin was represented satisfactory even though the catchment is situated in the same region as the danube in the cases of the emån and tagus there is some uncertainty in representing winter flows what is indicated by a larger spread of model outputs as for the tay the lag in timing of the high and low flows follows the pattern of the swim simulation driven by the era interim data and is probably due to the regulated lakes omitted in the model setup 4 3 changes in climate and components of hydrological cycle in the case study basins figures a10 a13 in annex 4 depict the long term mean annual dynamics of temperature and figures a14 and a15 of precipitation and aet values for the reference intermediate and far future periods as indicated by the multi model means of the climate projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the eight case study basins when looking at the precipitation patterns for the most southern basin of the tagus river one can observe a moderate decrease in spring under the rcp 4 5 scenario and a strong decrease in spring and autumn under the rcp8 5 scenario under the low end scenario precipitation is also projected to decrease in the rhine basin in summer and early autumn months further precipitation is projected to increase in the rhine danube northern dvina tay and teteriv during the winter and late autumn months under both scenarios in the lule and emån river basins precipitation is expected to increase throughout the year under both scenarios temperature increases in all basins throughout the year under both scenarios and for the both future time slices with higher increases under the high end scenario compared to rcp 4 5 and in the far future compared to mid century for the rivers located in northern central and eastern europe the winter temperatures are projected to become positive approximately one month earlier in spring as compared to the reference period in the cases of the danube and teteriv the multi model long term mean temperature under climate change projections is expected to become positive throughout the year under rcp 8 5 in the far future the strongest increase in temperature is projected for the tagus river basin in summer months table 3 provides an overview of changes in the components of the hydrological cycle relative to the reference period by the end of the century in particular in precipitation pp actual evapotranspiration aet surface runoff ro and the budyko aridity index which is potential evapotranspiration divided by precipitation the aridity index slightly increases under both rcps in the danube and strongly in the tagus river due to decrease in precipitation and increase in pet subject to rising temperatures especially under rcp8 5 also pp ro and aet show strong decreases in the tagus under rcp8 5 on the contrary the aridity index is decreasing in the tay basin for other basins the ratio between pet and pp remains practically stable under both climate projections an increasing trend in precipitation is projected over the northern dvina tay lule teteriv and rhine under both future warming scenarios and for the emån under rcp8 5 similar patterns were found for runoff which follows trends in precipitation the aet shows increases in summer months in the basins of lule nortern dvina emån and teteriv which is associated with increased temperatures see figs a10 a13 and increase in precipitation figs a14 a15 in the tagus and danube river on the contrary the aet decreases constrained by the reduced water availability in other catchments changes in aet are less pronounced but still even slight changes in aet can lead to significant changes in the water balance especially in the southern catchments and therefore they have to be considered 4 4 changes in river discharge in the basins under climatic change the impacts of projected changes in climate on the water resources availability in the case study basins were heterogeneous figs 4 and 5 show the multi model means three model runs for rcp4 5 and four for rcp8 5 and the model spreads minimum to maximum values for the long term mean annual discharge at the outlets of the basins in two future periods 2041 2070 mid future and 2071 2100 far future under two global warming scenarios rcp4 5 moderate and rcp8 5 high end global warming against the model runs in the reference period the significance of changes in the monthly discharge of river basins under consideration was evaluated with the wilcoxon rank test at the p 05 significance level comparing reference period to two future periods annex 5 provides the p values for each monthly flow in each basin for the two future periods please note that only statistically significant changes are described in this section an overall statistically significant increase in discharge throughout the year all months was found in the most northern catchment of the lule river under both warming scenarios and for both future periods the projected increase in discharge is accompanied by a shift in seasonality in particular the peak in discharge is expected to occur approximately one month earlier shifting from end of july to mid june as the average temperature in the catchment will become positive earlier due to increased temperatures in the future the difference between the intermediate and far future periods is obvious under the rcp8 5 scenario where the increasing trend is developing further whereas under rcp4 5 the difference between the far and intermediate future time slices is rather small in the case of the northern dvina the spring peak is shifted one month earlier by the end of the century under rcp 8 5 and the peak discharge period is prolonged in time under rcp4 5 the high flow period begins already in april and reaches its maximum in may there is also a slight increase in discharge of the northern dvina in late autumn and winter under rcp8 5 in the both time slices and in the far future under rcp4 5 in the emån rhine tay and teteriv rivers a statistically significant increase in the winter and early spring discharge is projected under rcp8 5 in both periods see annex 5 the increase is the highest in the teteriv and emån rivers reaching up to 60 with respect to the reference period in january for the emån and up to two times higher in the teteriv under rcp8 5 in the rhine and tay rivers the increase in winter is up to 30 under rcp8 5 by the end of the century the same tendency is observed in these four basins under rcp4 5 and in january and february the increase by 20 25 is statistically significant in all four basins in both periods besides there are seasonal shifts projected for the emån and teteriv under rcp8 5 shifting from april to february for the emån and from april to march for the teteriv in the case of danube a decrease in discharge is projected from april until december under rcp4 5 and from april until july under rcp8 5 based on all model runs one can see no significant changes of the multi model mean and a large spread of projections from august to december under rcp8 5 under the moderate climate change scenario the peak discharge is shifted from april to march under the high end climate change scenario in the southern catchment the tagus an overall decrease in discharge throughout the year was found under both rcp scenarios based on the multi model means the changes are much more pronounced and statistically significant for all months under rcp8 5 in both periods see annex 5 resulting in the decrease of discharge by more than 50 throughout the year compared to up to 20 under rcp4 5 the reduction of flows was found to be statistically significant under rcp4 5 only during the low flow period april november except july for the far future the model spread was the highest during the high flow period in january march for both rcps under rcp4 5 in the winter months some model runs projected an increase and some decrease however the multi model mean still indicates a slight decrease in discharge and also statistical test showed that this trend is not significant however also in the reference period the multi model spread was much larger during the high flow period in this basin as can be seen in fig 3 figs 6 and 7 provide an overview of the monthly flow variability over the reference and two future periods depicting the inter quantile range from 25th to 75th of the long term monthly average flows as box and whiskers diagram it is undoubtedly important to know how the mean of the flow will change but also it is important especially for water managers how the inter annual flow variability would change in the future and how far it would deviate from the reference conditions one can observe that the important changes with respect to the inter annual flow variability under the moderate scenario rcp4 5 are projected for the northern dvina tagus and danube basins in the northern dvina river the flow variability would increase significantly in the late spring period when the shift of peak discharge is projected too in the tagus river the variability of flows will increase significantly during the high flow period in winter early spring and slightly during the low flows period in the danube river basin the intra annual flow variability will increase during the summer and autumn months when looking at the high end scenario for the tagus river basin fig 7 we can see an opposite pattern the variability of flows significantly decreases in the winter month compared to the reference period similar results were found for the late winter and early spring discharges in the rhine river basin in the case of the danube river the variability remains higher in the late summer and autumn months than in the reference period under rcp 8 5 and in the emån river the flow variability slightly increases in the winter months 5 discussion this study aimed to provide an assessment of impacts of the projected climate change on streamflow in the eight representative river basins in europe for that we employed the eco hydrological process based catchment scale model swim which was set up calibrated and validated to the observed data at the outlets of each river basin the swim model included water management infrastructure in two case study basins tagus and lule the impacts of climate change were explored by applying the bias corrected gcm rcm climate datasets obtained in the framework of the impressions project the swim model was successfully calibrated and validated for all basins given their climatic hydrological and physical heterogeneity however swim has encountered some problems in simulation of the observed discharge in the lule tay teteriv and tagus basins where anthropogenic influence on discharge was significant when accounting for water management was introduced by implementing major reservoirs in swim in the cases of lule and tagus the model performance in these catchments has improved still the low flow segments in the tay and teteriv and in the tagus during the validation period were not properly met as indicated by the log transformed nse values table 2 in our opinion when conducting climate change impact assessment the effects of current water infrastructure operations if their influence is significant have to be taken into account the bias corrected climate data were used to drive swim in the historical period and were tested for their ability to represent the observed discharge dynamics the results were satisfactory for all basins except the rhine and danube catchments where the seasonality was met but the systematic overestimation of flows was found this is probably associated with the not perfectly performed bias correction of the gcm rcm climate data for these regions in the impressions project according to our results the hydrological impacts of climate change will be heterogeneous across the european river basins one can distinguish the following statistically significant trends based on the projections a general increase in discharge in the northern catchments lule northern dvina and tay and a strong decrease in the iberian peninsula for tagus statistically significant under rcp8 5 the largest differences in impacts between the moderate and high end climate change scenarios were found for the northern dvina lule and tagus characterized by strong inter and intra annual variability of flows see annex 6 in the tagus the deviations in discharge projected under rcp4 5 were practically within the bounds of the historical inter annual flow variability as indicated by the wilcoxon signed rank test until the year 2070 whereas under rcp8 5 a strong decrease in flows reaching up to 50 was found therefore our results show that when accounting for the climate change effects on river discharge in the water management strategies it is important to account for the deviations not only in mean annual flows but also in the intra annual variability of flows in the future in the central and eastern european catchments rhine danube teteriv as well as in emån discharge is expected to increase in winter and late autumn in three northern catchments n dvina lule and emån and in two central and eastern european catchments danube and teteriv the shifts in seasonality were found at the end of the century under rcp8 5 where the spring peak appears approximately one month earlier our analysis shows that the major drivers behind the projected shifts in seasonality are the projected increases in temperature that will trigger earlier snowmelt as well as increase in precipitation in the late autumn and winter months the share of snow to rain in the snowmelt driven catchments will decrease in spring and autumn based on the analysis done for the lule river in the n dvina teteriv lule and emån the projected increase in aet will be outweighed by the increase in precipitation also due to the fact that the increase in aet is projected for summer months and the increase in precipitation would occur in winter and late autumn leading to increase of discharge in late autumn and winter in these basins decrease in precipitation is the main driver behind the overall decrease of discharge in the tagus river as well as decrease in discharge of the danube river in summer and late spring in those basins also the aet shows decreasing trends during summer and late spring due to decreased water availability on the other hand an increase in discharge during the january march period in the danube is driven by an increase in precipitation when looking at the results taking into account location of catchments in the specific climatic zones koppen geiger classification annex 1 one can see similar trends for some of them located in one zone in particular an increase in winter discharge under both climate change scenarios was projected for the rhine tay emån and danube river basins which are situated fully or mostly large parts of the emån and danube in the temperate oceanic climate zone for the lule and northern dvina which belong to the subarctic climate zone an increase in discharge is projected as well as shifts in seasonality however changes in seasonality of discharge for both rivers are slightly different whereas a general increase in discharge is projected throughout the year for the lule discharge is expected to increase in autumn winter and spring but remain the same in summer in the northern dvina the impact assessment results of our study go in line in terms of general tendencies in northern and southern europe with the results of studies conducted before alfieri et al 2015 döll and schmied 2012 papadimitriou et al 2016 schneider et al 2013 using the non calibrated global scale models however zooming in the global or european maps of previous studies for results related to certain river basins is difficult one former study papadimitriou et al 2016 presented impacts also for five selected river basins and they are comparable with our results except for the rhine where no statistically significant trends were found before in general our results with the calibrated and validated regional scale model are probably more credible for all selected eight basins compared to the outputs of non calibrated global scale models often showing poor performance in the historical period hattermann et al 2017 krysanova et al 2018 still the similarity of impacts is important as the previous studies involved different types of models and climate change projections therefore the trends found in our study can be considered as robust such modelling chains as applied in this paper are associated with different sources of uncertainty starting from the uncertainty coming with radiative forcing scenarios rcps following with uncertainty related to climate models and downscaling methods and finishing with the uncertainty associated with hydrological modelling arising from model structure parametrization and calibration also the phenomenon of equifinality is especially important for such large basins as the danube or rhine when the good performance of a hydrological model during the calibration can be reached with different and sometimes physically inadequate sets of parameters values though no detailed analysis with quantification of uncertainty sources was conducted in this study it is doubtless that the results obtained and described in this paper are subject to biases coming from different sources as shortly listed above as was described above the results for the rhine and the danube rivers are possibly subject to larger biases as the bias corrected climate models failed to represent the water volumes of both rivers and results of this study in absolute units should be referred to with a caution on the other hand the small model spreads obtained for the past dynamics simulated by the swim model driven by the gcm rcm outputs indicate general agreement between the simulated and observed seasonal dynamics of discharge and also for the danube and rhine the patterns are similar additionally the uncertainty can potentially be higher for the high and low flow conditions in some of our river basins e g where the swim model failed to represent successfully the low flows in the tay teteriv and tagus where streamflow regulation effects on river flow were significant potentially also the selection of the rcp scenarios can be a significant source of uncertainty as in the case of the tagus river basin where the projected changes in discharge remained in the range of the observed intra annual flow variability under rcp4 5 but were beyond the reference conditions already by the mid century under rcp8 5 this applies also to the danube river basin where the decrease in summer flow was larger under the rcp4 5 scenario than under rcp8 5 however in the case of the danube river the spread due to climate models was large in the summer months under rcp8 5 indicating on larger uncertainty of the results a large multi model spread was also found in the high flow period for the tagus and lule river basins under both rcp scenarios referring to large uncertainty of the results 6 conclusions climate change will alter the hydrological regimes of rivers in europe this will create additional challenges for water resources and aquatic ecosystems which are already stressed due to extensive anthropogenic activities therefore the impacts of the projected climate change have to be understood and incorporated into the regional water management strategies to ensure sustainable approach in governing the water systems when looking at the impacts the south north gradient can be clearly detected the results of this study indicate an increase in discharge in the considered scandinavian and northern european basins as well as a strong decrease in the tagus river basin located in the iberian peninsula in general apart from the tagus and danube there seems to be no significant changes in the low flow period in other catchments whereas the flows in the high flow periods in winter and early spring are going to increase across central northern and eastern europe the major driver behind these changes as our results show is the increase in precipitation in autumn and winter months in some cases also in spring projected for these rivers the shifts in seasonality in particular shifts of the spring peak discharge to earlier time were found in the snowmelt driven catchments like northern dvina lule emån danube and teteriv under rcp8 5 which are associated with the earlier snowmelt due to rising temperatures that will become positive earlier most pronounced in the northern dvina river the aet is also expected to increase in the summer months in northern catchments and in the teteriv river basin however these changes would be overcompensated by the increases in precipitation the differences in deviations between the high end and moderate climate warming scenarios become evident after the mid century where the changes triggered under rcp4 5 level off but continue to develop further under rcp8 5 the biggest differences between the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were found for the northern dvina lule and tagus where changes under rcp4 5 until the year 2070 were within the bounds of the natural variability of flows in the reference period and they become more evident only by the end of the century and under rcp8 5 in both periods the global models are useful tools to be applied when general impacts picture is needed at the global and continental scales and the regional scale models are absolutely necessary in cases when regional impacts are of interest for certain specific river basins and also climate adaptation and water management strategies are of interest for them hattermann et al 2017 the local developments in each particular catchment are of a great importance while considering different scenarios of global warming even if the dangerous global warming can be avoided e g by switching to the green sources of energy the freshwater resources can still be adversely affected by e g extension of the hydropower installation hermoso 2017 the results of this study go in line in terms of general tendencies with the results of the previous studies conducted mostly with the global or pan european scale models and therefore these trends can be considered robust conflicts of interest none acknowledgements the research was supported by the project impressions funded

8500,study region to provide a picture of hydrological impact of climate change across different climatic zones in europe this study considers eight river basins tagus in iberian peninsula emån and lule in scandinavia rhine danube and teteriv in central and eastern europe tay on the island of great britain and northern dvina in north eastern europe study focus in this study the assessment of the impacts of moderate and high end climate change scenarios on the hydrological patterns in european basins was conducted to assess the projected changes the process based eco hydrological model swim soil and water integrated model was set up calibrated and validated for the basins the swim was driven by the bias corrected climate projections obtained from the coupled simulations of the global

overall increase in discharge in the most northern river basin lule increase in the winter discharge and shift in seasonality in northern and central european catchments the impacts of the high end

also confirm trends found previously with mostly global scale models keywords european rivers climate change hydrology eco hydrological modelling climate change impact high end scenarios 1 introduction climate change is one of the world s most important global challenges which will have global as well as regional consequences and is expected to affect all aspects of modern humanity ipcc wgii 2014 the paris agreement entered in force at the 21st conference of parties cop21 in 2015 indicated a great success of more than 20 years of negotiations but also imposed a significant challenge to the contemporary society by setting the goal of limiting the global warming to 2 c while aspiring to 1 5 c rogelj et al 2016 schellnhuber et al 2016 this goal is ambitious as now the trajectories of the greenhouse gases emissions are pointing to the high end climate change scenarios above the agreed threshold and this development still remains probable if global actions are not taken urgently the flow regimes of rivers are being modified all over the world by anthropogenic impacts such as water management operations and land use changes some measures put freshwater resources at significant stress and climate change is expected to alter the hydrological conditions further posing additional pressure on water resources and aquatic ecosystems the climate change risks have to be understood quantified and incorporated into water management strategies at the regional level döll et al 2014 all adaptation measures including those of no regret type have to be based on a solid understanding of the current situation and possible future trends harding et al 2014 both long term and short term hydrological modelling is a primary tool to obtain projections on how climate change would impact water resources and hydrological patterns of river basins in general there is a voluminous amount of literature on the impact of climate change on hydrological cycle and water resources covering different scales from river basins to continental and global scales most of the continental and global scale studies employ global scale hydrological models as the application of a regional model to all river basins in a continent e g in europe would result in significant calibration efforts and high input data requirements at the scale of europe papadimitriou et al 2016 conducted a study on impacts of the high end climate change on river discharge in eight selected european river basins applying the non calibrated global hydrological model jules best et al 2011 they have found an increase in the number of days with low flow for central and southern europe rhine danube guadiana and an increase in low flows for scandinavia kemijoki river further several studies conducted with different global models e g watergap mac pdm 09 have projected an increase of discharge in the high latitudes and decrease in the mediterranean and southern europe arnell and gosling 2013 hagemann et al 2013 schneider et al 2013 and seasonal changes in the snowmelt driven rivers where discharge in winter is increasing while the summer discharge is decreasing döll and schmied 2012 wanders et al 2015 uncertainties associated with global scale hydrological modelling are usually higher as compared with those related to the regional scale hydrological models hagemann et al 2013 gosling et al 2017 hattermann et al 2017 this can be explained by coarser resolution of the input data and usually poor performance of global models most of them are not calibrated in the historical reference period hattermann et al 2017 as well as inability of most of the global models to take into account water management infrastructure abbaspour et al 2015 due to this it makes sense to verify trends by application of the basin scale models further there are some continental scale studies performed with the pan european models which are partly calibrated donnelly et al 2016 applied a multi basin model e hype to the entire europe which showed good simulation results and can be used for climate impact studies after some improvements regarding input data and additional calibration roudier et al 2016 applying three pan european models lisflood burek et al 2012 e hype donnelly et al 2016 and vic liang et al 1994 found that drought events may increase in southern europe in particular in southern france and spain and the frequency of flood events may increase in northern europe if the global temperature will increase by 2 c a study of alfieri et al 2015 applied the distributed hydrological model lisflood driven by the high end climate change scenario in major river basins across the entire european region they found decrease of runoff in the southern europe and increase of runoff in northern europe and no specific trends for the discharges in the central europe however the abovementioned analyses were focused on the extreme events frequency analysis or on the validation of the pan european models and not on the general picture of the hydrological impacts of projected climate change regarding the hydrological impact assessments performed with the regional scale hydrological models it usually focuses on individual regions often single river basins and studies encompassing large areas are rare aich et al 2014 vetter et al 2016 recently a special issue in climatic change see editorial krysanova and hattermann 2017 addressed the issue of intercomparison of the regional scale hydrological models and climate change impacts across twelve large river basins around the globe including two basins in europe rhine and tagus fulfilled by the efforts of the isi mip project warszawski et al 2014 group our study aims to close the existing gap and provides an assessment of trends in the long term mean annual dynamics of river discharge in eight representative european basins triggered by climatic change for that an eco hydrological process based catchment scale hydrological model was applied which was calibrated and validated for each case study in advance and accounted for water management operations where applicable it used a more elaborated approach when compared to the previous european scale studies we provide an assessment and intercomparison of the moderate and high end climate change impacts on river discharge across different regions in europe focused on eight river basins tagus in iberian peninsula emån and lule in scandinavia rhine in central europe danube and teteriv in central and eastern europe tay on the island of great britain and northern dvina in north eastern europe these basins were selected within the european case study of the eu funded project impressions impacts and risks from the high end scenarios strategies for innovative solutions our assessment considers two future climate change scenarios of moderate rcp4 5 and high end rcp8 5 global warming and two future time slices intermediate 2041 2070 and far future 2071 2100 evaluated with respect to the reference period 1981 2010 current study complements the picture of the european scale assessments done before and verifies the trends found in the previous studies fulfilled with the global and pan european scale models 2 case study basins the river basins considered in this study were selected to represent the variety of conditions in the river basins in europe the selected basins are situated in different climatic zones see annex 1 in supplementary material that provides a map of the basins with respect to climatic zones after the köppen geiger classification have different basin areas ranging from meso to macroscale basins from 4500 km2 for the emån to 817000 km2 for the danube covering large sub regions of europe have different topographic conditions from river basins with flat topography in lowland like the northern dvina to mountainous regions like the tagus basin or the rhine headwaters have different land use conditions from areas covered mostly with forest the northern dvina emån to extensively cultivated river basins the teteriv danube have different levels of anthropogenic influence on river discharge from highly regulated river basins with many reservoirs and diversion channels the tagus and lule to rivers with mostly pristine conditions the northern dvina have different discharge regime characteristics specific for their climatic areas like the tagus river with the mediterranean type of regime characterized by low discharge in summer and peak discharge in winter or rivers with different snowmelt driven regimes specific for their climatic regions e g the norhern dvina with peak discharge in may or lule with peak discharge in june july the basins were also selected based on their significance for the respective regions in europe for example the danube and rhine catchments cover the large area of central and eastern europe and are important for population of many countries there further the emån lule and tay rivers are very significant rivers in sweden and scotland the latter two also for energy production the northern dvina is one of the largest rivers in the north european part of russia with natural flow conditions the tagus in the iberian peninsula is very important water supplier for spain and portugal and the teteriv river basins is one of the largest tributaries of the most important river in the ukraine dniepr river the most important characteristics of the eight river basins under consideration are summarized in table 1 and in annex 1 of the supplementary material and the location of river basins is shown in fig 1 3 methods 3 1 swim model the soil and water integrated model swim is a process based deterministic eco hydrological model based on two earlier created models swat arnold et al 1998 and matsalu krysanova et al 1989 the model is described in krysanova et al 1998 the swim model can be seen as an assemblage of numerical representations of physical processes of hydrological cycle and related processes vegetation growth nutrient cycling and erosion at the river basin scale these physical processes are mathematically interpreted with similar levels of complexity and form four main modules of the model describing hydrological processes groundwater biogeochemical cycles and plant growth swim operates on a daily time step and uses climatic land use topographic vegetation and soil datasets as input files the topographical map of a catchment serves as a basis to create a subbasin map which is later intersected with land use and soil maps to identify the so called hrus hydrological response units or hydrotopes areas within each subbasin where a unique combination of land use and soil type is present the identical hrus the ones which have the same land use and soil types in a subbasin are assumed to have the same hydrological behaviour and are later combined into hydrotope classes within each subbasin and modelled as one subarea the components of hydrological cycle nutrient cycling and sediment loads are calculated at the hydrotope level and lateral flows are added for subbasins after that the lateral flows of water nutrients and sediments are routed through the basin using conceptual representation of the open channel hydraulics the muskingum method taking into account transmission losses more than 20 years of application history of the swim include development of model versions for specific processes wetlands nutrients in streams reservoirs etc and many stories of successful application as well as some failure cases as thoroughly discussed in krysanova et al 2015 the swim model has been successfully applied for investigation of different hydrological phenomena like impacts of climatic change on stream flow aich et al 2013 huang et al 2013 lobanova et al 2016 stagl and hattermann 2015 on agricultural production liersch et al 2013 and on extreme hydrological events aich et al 2016 hattermann et al 2012 huang et al 2014 2013 as well as for analysis of the glacier lakes outburst floods wortmann et al 2014 and hydrological impacts of irrigation activities huang et al 2015 3 2 reservoir module the reservoir module of swim is a conceptual representation of the storage release processes at dams and reservoirs koch et al 2013 it is fully integrated in the swim model and can represent three management strategies depending on the minimum discharge from reservoirs e g for environmental needs minimum and maximum reservoir volumes in a given month or firm hydropower production target the reservoir module requires a volume discharge surface area relationship for each reservoir and also the inflow outflow and stored volume time series for parametrization of the management process the reservoir module can also simulate the hydropower production and requires data of the hydropower plant installed as an input for the calculation of the daily produced hydropower each reservoir in the catchment is integrated into the subbasin map of the river basin under consideration as a separate subbasin the precipitation over the reservoirs as well as evaporation rates and seepage of water to the groundwater are considered 3 3 water allocation module the water allocation module wam and its application for the simulation of the tagus segura water transfer were described in detail in the work of lobanova et al 2017 the wam simulates water withdrawals by e g irrigation channels and inter and intrabasin transfers of water for example for drinking water supply the module operates on a daily time step and enables water withdrawal from one subbasin and assignment to the other subbasin within the river basin or simply outside the basin on the next day taking into account transmission losses e g due to evaporation in the case of the tagus segura water transfer the observed withdrawn values over the calibration and validation periods were applied within wam and for the future projections the mean values over the entire observed period were applied as the projection of the withdrawal evolution was beyond the scope of this study the analysis of the possible water allocation scenarios in this area under the projected climate change scenarios can be found in lobanova et al 2017 3 4 input data the input data needed to set up the swim model for a river basin are land use map soil map digital elevation model dem and climate data as well as observed runoff for calibration and validation of the model the corine2000 land use database and the dem from the cgiar database jarvis et al 2008 both with the resolution of 100 m were used for seven case study basins except the northern dvina the land use types in the corine database were then aggregated to match the 15 land use classes of swim krysanova et al 2000 in the case of the northern dvina river the input datasets were different in particular the land use data was obtained from the global corine dataset with a coarser resolution of 250 m which is covering the european part of russia the dem model used for this catchment was obtained from the aster dataset with the resolution of 30 m which provides dem covering the entire globe tachikawa et al 2011 the aster dataset was the only one dem available for the northern dvina river as the cgiar dataset covers the globe only until 60th latitude the soil data for all basins was extracted from the european soil data centre panagos et al 2012 the parameters of each soil typological unit within each soil mapping unit were considered and weighted according to their percentage shares the missing parameters needed for the swim model simulation were derived using the pedo transfer functions krysanova et al 2000 for the modelling the vegetation parameters from the swim database for 71 vegetation types 23 parameters per type attached to the model were used and they were not adjusted for the catchments to calibrate and validate the swim model the gridded climate watch era interim forcing data weedon et al 2014 were used the watch era interim dataset covers the entire globe and provides synthetically generated climatic variables corrected to observations the watch era interim dataset is provided on a grid with a resolution of 0 5 and covers time period 1979 2010 the observed discharge data at the outlets of the basins were obtained from the global runoff data centre grdc koblenz germany database for all basins except for the tagus river basin for which the observed data at the almourol gauge were taken from the sistema nacional de informação de recursos hídricos snirh database of the portuguese ministry of environment initially the swim model was set up for the rhine river and described in huang et al 2010 for the danube river in stagl and hattermann 2015 and for the teteriv river in didovets et al 2017 for the first two basins swim was initially calibrated using watch era 40 weedon et al 2011 data as input and for the application in this study the models were re calibrated using watch era interim data as input 3 5 calibration and validation two main criteria of fit between the observed and simulated discharges were used the relative volume error rve and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the rve is a total deviation in the volume of water discharged expressed in percent and the nse is an efficiency coefficient which relates a sum of squared differences between the observed and simulated discharges to the variance of the observed values of discharge the rve coefficient can vary from 100 to inf where 0 indicates a perfect fit and the nse coefficient from inf to 1 0 where 1 indicates a perfect fit the specific limits for both criteria which correspond to a good performance of a hydrological model are nse 0 65 and pbias 15 as was specified by moriasi et al 2007 in order to test the model performance during the low flow periods also the log transformed nse lognse on the daily simulated and observed values were calculated the swim model was calibrated and validated against the observed discharge data series on the daily time step for all eight basins the calibration and validation periods were different for each river basin subject to discharge data availability the model calibration was done based on sensitivity analysis for swim performed previously for many river basins in europe the calibration procedure was performed manually altering the evapotranspiration correction coefficient base flow factor groundwater delay factor two routing coefficients manning coefficient and saturated conductivity correction coefficient also the snow parameters including threshold temperatures of snowfall and snowmelt as well as snowmelt rate were included in the calibration process in all basins except the tagus for two of eight selected river basins the lule and tagus water management infrastructure was included in the model set up the reservoirs were represented by the swim reservoir module and they were calibrated against the observed inflow outflow and water storage data obtained from the country specific databases river discharge of the lule river was found to be the most affected by water regulation followed by the tagus river basin further the tay river basin also includes several natural lakes that are regulated for electricity production however these lakes were not included in the model due to inaccessibility of data on lakes operation for the same reason due to absence of data the reservoirs in the teteriv river basin were also not considered in the model as the aim of this paper was to quantify impacts of climate change on the long term average monthly discharge it was decided to calculate the nse and rve criteria of fit on the monthly time step for all cases additionally the log nse nse and rve were calculated on the daily time step in order to test the model ability to simulate the daily dynamics of discharge as well as low flows the operational rules of the reservoirs in the tagus and lule river basins were not altered for the future projections and were preserved as current ones because the response of water infrastructure operation to changes in water availability was beyond the scope of this paper 3 6 climate scenarios the climate change projections used in this study were developed within the impressions project the projections were obtained from the cordex coupled gcm global circulation models rcm regional climate models simulations the downscaled individual climate variables were bias corrected to the reanalysis data watch era interim using the quantile mapping method themeβl et al 2012 wilcke et al 2013 the projections include seven gcm rcm coupled simulations forced by rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of increase in the radiative forcing the projections were selected to cover the full range of future climate projections from 1 1 c to 4 2 c globally kok et al 2015 the selection of the gcm rcm coupled simulations was driven in the first place by the expert judgement of their performance in europe and elsewhere and in the second place by direct comparison of their ability to represent the reference cycle of temperature and precipitation in europe further the selected subset was reduced to models that represent different model sensitivity to the greenhouse gases emissions to reproduce the climate model variability the selected models cover the global increase in temperature up to 4 c as the aim of the impressions project was to focus on the high end scenarios kok et al 2015 the northern dvina river basin lies exactly at the border of the euro cordex domain and therefore the rcm simulation results may not represent this area with sufficient accuracy due to the strong influence of boundary conditions inherited from the gcms therefore it was decided to use the raw gcm output for this basin and then to bias correct it applying the same quantile mapping method as for the other basins 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation in general the performance of the swim model during the calibration and validation periods for all selected basins on the monthly time step was satisfactory however the model showed lower performance related to low flow conditions in some of the case study river basins fig 2 depicts the long term average seasonal dynamics observed and simulated with swim driven by the watch era interim data at the outlets of the selected basins over the respective calibration and validation periods together table 2 summarizes the nse and rve values obtained for the calibration and validation periods with the monthly and daily time steps and the lognse values on the daily time step for each case study basin figures a2 a9 annex 3 show the monthly mean time series the long term mean annual dynamics as well as 10th 50th and 90th flow percentiles of the observed and simulated discharge over the both calibration and validation periods for each case study river basin the swim model performance was acceptable in all case studies showing very good to acceptable performance based on ranges specified in moriasi et al 2007 in terms of the nse values both on the daily and monthly time steps the best model fitting was found for the northern dvina basin and the lowest values were estimated for the tay teteriv and lule river basins the largest rve values reaching 10 19 were obtained for the tagus and teteriv rivers this can be explained by the continuous development of irrigation channels and increase in water consumption for irrigation during the calibration and validation periods in the tagus which were not taken into account in the model as discussed in lobanova et al 2016 for the case of the teteriv river the situation might be similar to the one described for the tagus river the overestimation of the water volumes in the model in the validation period may reflect the water withdrawals effects which were not taken into account however in this case due to the absence of data on water management no solid conclusion can be drawn when looking at the seasonal dynamics one can observe that the swim model simulations reproduce observed dynamics well in most cases but also exhibit some deviations in certain sub periods in some cases in the case of the tay river the timing of flow was not properly met probably due to absence of the regulated lakes integration into the model set up in the case of the tagus river the low flows during summer were underestimated possibly due to similar reasons as this river is one of the most highly regulated in europe there are more than 40 large reservoirs in the catchment whereas in our model only 16 major reservoirs were included still the inclusion of reservoirs has increased the performance of swim in this case significantly as discussed in lobanova et al 2016 but some uncertainty due to water management infrastructure which was not taken into account is left however the most explicit example of the effects of anthropogenic activities on river flow in this study is the lule river basin in fig 1 one can see discharge measured at the outlet of the river the naturalized flow of the river simulated with the hype model lindström et al 2010 and discharge simulated with the swim model considering four major reservoirs one can observe that the natural dynamics of the river was completely transformed eliminating the flow variability making flow nearly constant throughout the year by introducing the reservoirs in the swim model the dynamics could be brought closer to the observed one however still it is far from the perfect fit when looking at the lognse values that are more sensitive to the low flow conditions one can observe that the model performance for low flow varies between basins it is quite good for the emån northern dvina and danube satisfactory for the rhine and lule but quite poor for the regulated rivers such as tagus validation period tay and teteriv where the existing flow regulation was not considered or considered only partly tagus in the case of the lule lognse was still high as the goodness of fit was calculated for the naturalized flow i e without the implementation of the reservoirs simulated with the hype model and naturalized flow simulated with the swim model the reservoirs were added to the swim model setup after the calibration of the naturalized flow conditions the calibration and validation results especially the results with the lognse criterium indicate that inclusion of the water management infrastructure is essential especially when aiming at the assessment of the low and high flows in addition to the average flow conditions in the rivers 4 2 representation of the historical discharge dynamics by swim driven by climate models to check the performance of the bias corrected climate data in the historical period the observed discharge was additionally compared with discharge simulated by swim driven by the selected gcm rcm projections fig 3 the systematic overestimation of flows with swim driven by the gcm rcm climate runs was found in two cases for the rhine and danube river basins in all other cases the simulated dynamics was similar to that driven by the era interim data the long term mean annual discharge dynamics in the teteriv river basin was represented satisfactory even though the catchment is situated in the same region as the danube in the cases of the emån and tagus there is some uncertainty in representing winter flows what is indicated by a larger spread of model outputs as for the tay the lag in timing of the high and low flows follows the pattern of the swim simulation driven by the era interim data and is probably due to the regulated lakes omitted in the model setup 4 3 changes in climate and components of hydrological cycle in the case study basins figures a10 a13 in annex 4 depict the long term mean annual dynamics of temperature and figures a14 and a15 of precipitation and aet values for the reference intermediate and far future periods as indicated by the multi model means of the climate projections under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the eight case study basins when looking at the precipitation patterns for the most southern basin of the tagus river one can observe a moderate decrease in spring under the rcp 4 5 scenario and a strong decrease in spring and autumn under the rcp8 5 scenario under the low end scenario precipitation is also projected to decrease in the rhine basin in summer and early autumn months further precipitation is projected to increase in the rhine danube northern dvina tay and teteriv during the winter and late autumn months under both scenarios in the lule and emån river basins precipitation is expected to increase throughout the year under both scenarios temperature increases in all basins throughout the year under both scenarios and for the both future time slices with higher increases under the high end scenario compared to rcp 4 5 and in the far future compared to mid century for the rivers located in northern central and eastern europe the winter temperatures are projected to become positive approximately one month earlier in spring as compared to the reference period in the cases of the danube and teteriv the multi model long term mean temperature under climate change projections is expected to become positive throughout the year under rcp 8 5 in the far future the strongest increase in temperature is projected for the tagus river basin in summer months table 3 provides an overview of changes in the components of the hydrological cycle relative to the reference period by the end of the century in particular in precipitation pp actual evapotranspiration aet surface runoff ro and the budyko aridity index which is potential evapotranspiration divided by precipitation the aridity index slightly increases under both rcps in the danube and strongly in the tagus river due to decrease in precipitation and increase in pet subject to rising temperatures especially under rcp8 5 also pp ro and aet show strong decreases in the tagus under rcp8 5 on the contrary the aridity index is decreasing in the tay basin for other basins the ratio between pet and pp remains practically stable under both climate projections an increasing trend in precipitation is projected over the northern dvina tay lule teteriv and rhine under both future warming scenarios and for the emån under rcp8 5 similar patterns were found for runoff which follows trends in precipitation the aet shows increases in summer months in the basins of lule nortern dvina emån and teteriv which is associated with increased temperatures see figs a10 a13 and increase in precipitation figs a14 a15 in the tagus and danube river on the contrary the aet decreases constrained by the reduced water availability in other catchments changes in aet are less pronounced but still even slight changes in aet can lead to significant changes in the water balance especially in the southern catchments and therefore they have to be considered 4 4 changes in river discharge in the basins under climatic change the impacts of projected changes in climate on the water resources availability in the case study basins were heterogeneous figs 4 and 5 show the multi model means three model runs for rcp4 5 and four for rcp8 5 and the model spreads minimum to maximum values for the long term mean annual discharge at the outlets of the basins in two future periods 2041 2070 mid future and 2071 2100 far future under two global warming scenarios rcp4 5 moderate and rcp8 5 high end global warming against the model runs in the reference period the significance of changes in the monthly discharge of river basins under consideration was evaluated with the wilcoxon rank test at the p 05 significance level comparing reference period to two future periods annex 5 provides the p values for each monthly flow in each basin for the two future periods please note that only statistically significant changes are described in this section an overall statistically significant increase in discharge throughout the year all months was found in the most northern catchment of the lule river under both warming scenarios and for both future periods the projected increase in discharge is accompanied by a shift in seasonality in particular the peak in discharge is expected to occur approximately one month earlier shifting from end of july to mid june as the average temperature in the catchment will become positive earlier due to increased temperatures in the future the difference between the intermediate and far future periods is obvious under the rcp8 5 scenario where the increasing trend is developing further whereas under rcp4 5 the difference between the far and intermediate future time slices is rather small in the case of the northern dvina the spring peak is shifted one month earlier by the end of the century under rcp 8 5 and the peak discharge period is prolonged in time under rcp4 5 the high flow period begins already in april and reaches its maximum in may there is also a slight increase in discharge of the northern dvina in late autumn and winter under rcp8 5 in the both time slices and in the far future under rcp4 5 in the emån rhine tay and teteriv rivers a statistically significant increase in the winter and early spring discharge is projected under rcp8 5 in both periods see annex 5 the increase is the highest in the teteriv and emån rivers reaching up to 60 with respect to the reference period in january for the emån and up to two times higher in the teteriv under rcp8 5 in the rhine and tay rivers the increase in winter is up to 30 under rcp8 5 by the end of the century the same tendency is observed in these four basins under rcp4 5 and in january and february the increase by 20 25 is statistically significant in all four basins in both periods besides there are seasonal shifts projected for the emån and teteriv under rcp8 5 shifting from april to february for the emån and from april to march for the teteriv in the case of danube a decrease in discharge is projected from april until december under rcp4 5 and from april until july under rcp8 5 based on all model runs one can see no significant changes of the multi model mean and a large spread of projections from august to december under rcp8 5 under the moderate climate change scenario the peak discharge is shifted from april to march under the high end climate change scenario in the southern catchment the tagus an overall decrease in discharge throughout the year was found under both rcp scenarios based on the multi model means the changes are much more pronounced and statistically significant for all months under rcp8 5 in both periods see annex 5 resulting in the decrease of discharge by more than 50 throughout the year compared to up to 20 under rcp4 5 the reduction of flows was found to be statistically significant under rcp4 5 only during the low flow period april november except july for the far future the model spread was the highest during the high flow period in january march for both rcps under rcp4 5 in the winter months some model runs projected an increase and some decrease however the multi model mean still indicates a slight decrease in discharge and also statistical test showed that this trend is not significant however also in the reference period the multi model spread was much larger during the high flow period in this basin as can be seen in fig 3 figs 6 and 7 provide an overview of the monthly flow variability over the reference and two future periods depicting the inter quantile range from 25th to 75th of the long term monthly average flows as box and whiskers diagram it is undoubtedly important to know how the mean of the flow will change but also it is important especially for water managers how the inter annual flow variability would change in the future and how far it would deviate from the reference conditions one can observe that the important changes with respect to the inter annual flow variability under the moderate scenario rcp4 5 are projected for the northern dvina tagus and danube basins in the northern dvina river the flow variability would increase significantly in the late spring period when the shift of peak discharge is projected too in the tagus river the variability of flows will increase significantly during the high flow period in winter early spring and slightly during the low flows period in the danube river basin the intra annual flow variability will increase during the summer and autumn months when looking at the high end scenario for the tagus river basin fig 7 we can see an opposite pattern the variability of flows significantly decreases in the winter month compared to the reference period similar results were found for the late winter and early spring discharges in the rhine river basin in the case of the danube river the variability remains higher in the late summer and autumn months than in the reference period under rcp 8 5 and in the emån river the flow variability slightly increases in the winter months 5 discussion this study aimed to provide an assessment of impacts of the projected climate change on streamflow in the eight representative river basins in europe for that we employed the eco hydrological process based catchment scale model swim which was set up calibrated and validated to the observed data at the outlets of each river basin the swim model included water management infrastructure in two case study basins tagus and lule the impacts of climate change were explored by applying the bias corrected gcm rcm climate datasets obtained in the framework of the impressions project the swim model was successfully calibrated and validated for all basins given their climatic hydrological and physical heterogeneity however swim has encountered some problems in simulation of the observed discharge in the lule tay teteriv and tagus basins where anthropogenic influence on discharge was significant when accounting for water management was introduced by implementing major reservoirs in swim in the cases of lule and tagus the model performance in these catchments has improved still the low flow segments in the tay and teteriv and in the tagus during the validation period were not properly met as indicated by the log transformed nse values table 2 in our opinion when conducting climate change impact assessment the effects of current water infrastructure operations if their influence is significant have to be taken into account the bias corrected climate data were used to drive swim in the historical period and were tested for their ability to represent the observed discharge dynamics the results were satisfactory for all basins except the rhine and danube catchments where the seasonality was met but the systematic overestimation of flows was found this is probably associated with the not perfectly performed bias correction of the gcm rcm climate data for these regions in the impressions project according to our results the hydrological impacts of climate change will be heterogeneous across the european river basins one can distinguish the following statistically significant trends based on the projections a general increase in discharge in the northern catchments lule northern dvina and tay and a strong decrease in the iberian peninsula for tagus statistically significant under rcp8 5 the largest differences in impacts between the moderate and high end climate change scenarios were found for the northern dvina lule and tagus characterized by strong inter and intra annual variability of flows see annex 6 in the tagus the deviations in discharge projected under rcp4 5 were practically within the bounds of the historical inter annual flow variability as indicated by the wilcoxon signed rank test until the year 2070 whereas under rcp8 5 a strong decrease in flows reaching up to 50 was found therefore our results show that when accounting for the climate change effects on river discharge in the water management strategies it is important to account for the deviations not only in mean annual flows but also in the intra annual variability of flows in the future in the central and eastern european catchments rhine danube teteriv as well as in emån discharge is expected to increase in winter and late autumn in three northern catchments n dvina lule and emån and in two central and eastern european catchments danube and teteriv the shifts in seasonality were found at the end of the century under rcp8 5 where the spring peak appears approximately one month earlier our analysis shows that the major drivers behind the projected shifts in seasonality are the projected increases in temperature that will trigger earlier snowmelt as well as increase in precipitation in the late autumn and winter months the share of snow to rain in the snowmelt driven catchments will decrease in spring and autumn based on the analysis done for the lule river in the n dvina teteriv lule and emån the projected increase in aet will be outweighed by the increase in precipitation also due to the fact that the increase in aet is projected for summer months and the increase in precipitation would occur in winter and late autumn leading to increase of discharge in late autumn and winter in these basins decrease in precipitation is the main driver behind the overall decrease of discharge in the tagus river as well as decrease in discharge of the danube river in summer and late spring in those basins also the aet shows decreasing trends during summer and late spring due to decreased water availability on the other hand an increase in discharge during the january march period in the danube is driven by an increase in precipitation when looking at the results taking into account location of catchments in the specific climatic zones koppen geiger classification annex 1 one can see similar trends for some of them located in one zone in particular an increase in winter discharge under both climate change scenarios was projected for the rhine tay emån and danube river basins which are situated fully or mostly large parts of the emån and danube in the temperate oceanic climate zone for the lule and northern dvina which belong to the subarctic climate zone an increase in discharge is projected as well as shifts in seasonality however changes in seasonality of discharge for both rivers are slightly different whereas a general increase in discharge is projected throughout the year for the lule discharge is expected to increase in autumn winter and spring but remain the same in summer in the northern dvina the impact assessment results of our study go in line in terms of general tendencies in northern and southern europe with the results of studies conducted before alfieri et al 2015 döll and schmied 2012 papadimitriou et al 2016 schneider et al 2013 using the non calibrated global scale models however zooming in the global or european maps of previous studies for results related to certain river basins is difficult one former study papadimitriou et al 2016 presented impacts also for five selected river basins and they are comparable with our results except for the rhine where no statistically significant trends were found before in general our results with the calibrated and validated regional scale model are probably more credible for all selected eight basins compared to the outputs of non calibrated global scale models often showing poor performance in the historical period hattermann et al 2017 krysanova et al 2018 still the similarity of impacts is important as the previous studies involved different types of models and climate change projections therefore the trends found in our study can be considered as robust such modelling chains as applied in this paper are associated with different sources of uncertainty starting from the uncertainty coming with radiative forcing scenarios rcps following with uncertainty related to climate models and downscaling methods and finishing with the uncertainty associated with hydrological modelling arising from model structure parametrization and calibration also the phenomenon of equifinality is especially important for such large basins as the danube or rhine when the good performance of a hydrological model during the calibration can be reached with different and sometimes physically inadequate sets of parameters values though no detailed analysis with quantification of uncertainty sources was conducted in this study it is doubtless that the results obtained and described in this paper are subject to biases coming from different sources as shortly listed above as was described above the results for the rhine and the danube rivers are possibly subject to larger biases as the bias corrected climate models failed to represent the water volumes of both rivers and results of this study in absolute units should be referred to with a caution on the other hand the small model spreads obtained for the past dynamics simulated by the swim model driven by the gcm rcm outputs indicate general agreement between the simulated and observed seasonal dynamics of discharge and also for the danube and rhine the patterns are similar additionally the uncertainty can potentially be higher for the high and low flow conditions in some of our river basins e g where the swim model failed to represent successfully the low flows in the tay teteriv and tagus where streamflow regulation effects on river flow were significant potentially also the selection of the rcp scenarios can be a significant source of uncertainty as in the case of the tagus river basin where the projected changes in discharge remained in the range of the observed intra annual flow variability under rcp4 5 but were beyond the reference conditions already by the mid century under rcp8 5 this applies also to the danube river basin where the decrease in summer flow was larger under the rcp4 5 scenario than under rcp8 5 however in the case of the danube river the spread due to climate models was large in the summer months under rcp8 5 indicating on larger uncertainty of the results a large multi model spread was also found in the high flow period for the tagus and lule river basins under both rcp scenarios referring to large uncertainty of the results 6 conclusions climate change will alter the hydrological regimes of rivers in europe this will create additional challenges for water resources and aquatic ecosystems which are already stressed due to extensive anthropogenic activities therefore the impacts of the projected climate change have to be understood and incorporated into the regional water management strategies to ensure sustainable approach in governing the water systems when looking at the impacts the south north gradient can be clearly detected the results of this study indicate an increase in discharge in the considered scandinavian and northern european basins as well as a strong decrease in the tagus river basin located in the iberian peninsula in general apart from the tagus and danube there seems to be no significant changes in the low flow period in other catchments whereas the flows in the high flow periods in winter and early spring are going to increase across central northern and eastern europe the major driver behind these changes as our results show is the increase in precipitation in autumn and winter months in some cases also in spring projected for these rivers the shifts in seasonality in particular shifts of the spring peak discharge to earlier time were found in the snowmelt driven catchments like northern dvina lule emån danube and teteriv under rcp8 5 which are associated with the earlier snowmelt due to rising temperatures that will become positive earlier most pronounced in the northern dvina river the aet is also expected to increase in the summer months in northern catchments and in the teteriv river basin however these changes would be overcompensated by the increases in precipitation the differences in deviations between the high end and moderate climate warming scenarios become evident after the mid century where the changes triggered under rcp4 5 level off but continue to develop further under rcp8 5 the biggest differences between the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were found for the northern dvina lule and tagus where changes under rcp4 5 until the year 2070 were within the bounds of the natural variability of flows in the reference period and they become more evident only by the end of the century and under rcp8 5 in both periods the global models are useful tools to be applied when general impacts picture is needed at the global and continental scales and the regional scale models are absolutely necessary in cases when regional impacts are of interest for certain specific river basins and also climate adaptation and water management strategies are of interest for them hattermann et al 2017 the local developments in each particular catchment are of a great importance while considering different scenarios of global warming even if the dangerous global warming can be avoided e g by switching to the green sources of energy the freshwater resources can still be adversely affected by e g extension of the hydropower installation hermoso 2017 the results of this study go in line in terms of general tendencies with the results of the previous studies conducted mostly with the global or pan european scale models and therefore these trends can be considered robust conflicts of interest none acknowledgements the research was supported by the project impressions funded

processes gonfiantini and zuppi 2003 sanford 1997 that are not represented in the pearson method in recharge water 14c is commonly considered to be derived from soil gas which contains co2 formed from decomposing plant matter and has a 14c concentration similar to that of the contemporaneous atmosphere this 14c is diluted when the infiltrating water containing dissolved co2 dissolves rock calcite if the rock calcite has a consistent δ13c value δ13c carb and contains no 14c the added bicarbonate will have δ13c close to δ13ccarb and a14c content of 0 pmc a dilution factor q for the 14c may be defined as follows 1 q a14cdic a14crech 0 q 1 where the a14c terms are activities of 14c expressed for instance as pmc rech recharge using an isotope balance based on δ13c q may also be expressed as 2 q δ13cdic δ13ccarb δ13crech δ13ccarb the corrected value a14crech is then calculated from eq 1 acceptable results cannot exceed the peak pmc of seasonally averaged atmospheric co2 during the bomb spike of the 1960s approximately 190 pmc burchuladze et al 1989 acceptable results for q cannot exceed 1 the corrected age is the given by 3 age 8033 ln a14crech a0 where a0 is the 14c activity of recharge values used for a0 are discussed below if recharge occurs from the saturated bed of a large stream an alternative approach to estimating δ13crech arises saturated alluvium contains little or no soil gas in such a case δ13crech is δ13cdic dic dissolved inorganic carbon of the river water and a14crech is the typical 14c content of the river water this approach was used here and was also used by gates et al 2008 in the badain jaran desert zhu et al 2008 and chen et al 2006 on the other hand used values δ13crech based on soil gas composition assumptions for the present study include 1 that rock carbonate has been dissolved into groundwater consistent with the range of δ13cdic and ph in the samples table s3 groundwater with no dissolved rock carbonate has lower values of both δ13cdic and ph e g le gal la salle et al 2001 2 that each region of the basin is homogeneous with respect to δ13ccarb 3 that calcite in the basin fill sediments has average δ13ccarb values 1 0 correction procedures used in the hrb and neighboring basins by zhu et al 2008 and chen et al 2006 used δ13ccarb values of 0 8 and 1 5 respectively while ma et al 2010 used 2 all without explicit justification in this study we use 2 0 an unacceptable number of invalid values of q and a14crech resulted if δ13ccarb values 1 were used table s4 4 that the value of δ13crech in river water can be estimated by examining the range of δ13c in dic of groundwater as a function of 14c fig 8a the range 12 to 2 appears to be generally dependent on 14c with the lowest values in modern samples with uncorrected 14c between 90 pmc and 120 pmc and the highest values in samples with uncorrected 14c 60 pmc by this reasoning the average δ13c of infiltrating river water would be 12 or less in the mr and 10 or less in the lguo et al 2013 found that δ13c increased in a similar way from 12 in mountain headwaters to 10 in downstream basins in four rivers near xian 1130 km southeast of zhangye note that the heihe river in their study is a different river of that name gates et al 2008 based their value of δ13cdic on a very young groundwater sample with a δ13cdic value of 9 8 and containing 96 9 pmc corrected ages of pre bomb samples are calculated for three cases of 14c content in recharge 80 90 and 100 pmc table s4 results range from post bomb many cases to about 12000 years a value near 90 pmc is supported by the minimum value 90 of corrected pmc values calculation of which is independent of the pmc of recharge in shallow groundwater see section 4 3 4 if river water characteristically had lower pmc then a lower minimum value might be expected among the corrected results in environments similar to that of the hrb arid with recharge from streams into predominantly siliciclastic basin fill pmc values near 100 in infiltrating surface water have been proposed e g in the badain jaran desert gates et al 2008 and the hueco bolson basin of northern mexico eastoe et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotopes 4 1 1 precipitation δd and δ18o in the ur and mr values of δ18o and δd span broad and similar ranges in the ur and mr fig 2 the lmwl in the ur is δd 7 9δ18o 14 3 values of d deuterium excess are generally higher than 10 suggesting recycling of continental moisture into the moisture reaching the qilian mountains clark and fritz 1961 araguás araguás et al 1998 tian et al 2005 zhao et al 2011 gammons et al 2006 in the mr the lmwl is δd 7 0 δ18o 2 9 with slope and the intercept lower than those of the gmwl suggesting evaporation of falling rain mook and de vries 2000 as a result of high temperature and low humidity in the mr fig s1 the slope and intercept of the lmwl for the ur were higher than those of the mr fig 2 suggesting that stronger evaporation of falling raindrops occurs in the mr as a result of high temperature and low relative humidity fig s1 no isotope altitude effect is evident between the ur and mr despite their large differences in elevation fig 2 coplen 1993 observed that altitude effects are commonly absent on mountain ranges in continental interiors 4 1 2 river δd and δ18o in the hrb the δ18o and δd values of ur and most mr river water plot close to the lmwl of the ur but have greatly attenuated ranges relative to precipitation fig 3 demonstrating that river water originates mainly as precipitation from the ur from the ur to the lr δ18o and δd values of river water become more positive and the d excess lower consistent with progressive evaporation downstream fig 3 certain δ18o and δd values of river water sampled near zhangye linze and gaotai in the mr are lower than the average values found in the ur indicating discharge of isotopically light irrigation groundwater into heihe river 4 1 3 variations of δ18o and d excess in groundwater 4 1 3 1 upper region groundwater mainly spring water plots on or above the lmwl for the ur fig 4 a indicating that infiltration occurs without change to the isotope composition of precipitation grünberger et al 2004 montoroi et al 2002 the d excess values range from 11 3 to 26 8 table 1 most samples cluster around 8 0 and 46 0 and resemble data for 2012 2013 meltwater from snow and glacier ice at shiyi glacier approximately 38 25 n 99 85 e in the upper heihe catchment li et al 2015 this and other glaciers and high elevation snowfields of the qilian mountains are principal sources of ur groundwater 4 1 3 2 middle region shallow groundwater of the mr plots on a linear regression line of slope 5 0 and deep groundwater along a line of slope 6 4 fig 4b neither regression line contains the main cluster of ur groundwater and the trends fall above the lmwl for zhangye both trends are strongly influenced by evaporation and appear to originate at values of δ18o δd near or less than 10 70 table 1 data with d excess near 0 plot below the zhangye lmwl in the mr neither local precipitation at zhangye nor present day runoff from the qilian mountains can account for most of the mr groundwater isotope data however the origins of the trends suggest mountain derived groundwater of different isotope composition relative to present day meltwater 4 1 3 3 lower region there is no apparent isotopic distinction between deep and shallow groundwater in the lr many groundwater samples from the lr overlap the field of mr groundwater fig 4c other samples with d excess ranging down to 22 7 table s2 plot along or above a line of slope 5 intersecting the gmwl at δ18o 16 much of the lr groundwater is therefore of the same origin as mr groundwater however the water plotting along the lower line of slope 5 in fig 4c originated as precipitation with δ18o δd near or less than 16 5 120 mixing occurs between these two types of water ur groundwater and surface water differs in isotopes from mr and lr groundwater indicating that present day meltwater from the qilian mountains has not yet infiltrated mr and lr aquifers to a detectable extent the sequential isotope changes in groundwater from the mountains to the alluvial basins suggest a temporal isotope evolution in glacial meltwater in the qilian mountains evidence from radioactive isotopes presented below will be used to evaluate this suggestion 4 1 4 implication of stable o and h isotopes 4 1 4 1 runoff regimes stable o and h isotopes document large changes in the isotope composition of runoff entering the hrb over at least 12 ka the data require three regimes of runoff 1 present day runoff mainly with δ18o values near 8 0 resembling 2012 2013 meltwater from the shiyi glacier 2 earlier runoff the main source of water to the mr and lr without evaporation this kind of runoff had δ18o values of 9 0 or less 3 older runoff still encountered mainly in the lr it is preserved as an evaporation trend fig 4c originating at δ18o 16 5 and δd 120 no change in geographic source area for runoff is possible over the last 10 20 millennia rather climate change leading to a unidirectional evolution of isotopes in precipitation in the qilian mountains is indicated a discussion of when and why such changes occurred follows below 4 1 4 2 age constraints on climate change ice records regime 1 runoff resembles the isotope composition of the shiyi glacier and its meltwater in 2012 2013 ce li et al 2015 the isotope compositions of regimes 2 and 3 are also present in ice from other parts of the tibetan plateau in the dunde ice sheet 38 00 n 96 41 e ice from 12ka before present to 2002 has an isotope composition takeuchi et al 2009 thompson 2000 davis and thompson 2004 like that of unevaporated regime 2 runoff fig 4b ice and meltwater runoff matching regime 3 in isotopes accumulate at present only in southern tibet from the south asian summer monsoon tian et al 2001 an example occurs in the noijing kangsang ice sheet 29 09 n 90 20 e zhao et al 2012 the change from regime 2 to regime 1 represents a change in moisture source at some time during the last six decades before the shift meltwater in the qilian mountains had isotope compositions like those of the dunde ice sheet no similar shift at dunde ice sheet had occurred by 2002 however tian et al 2001 recorded summer precipitation with an isotope signature matching regime 1 in precipitation at nearby delingha 37 37 n 97 97 e the change from regime 3 to regime 2 represents a larger change in moisture source in the qilian mountains prior to 12ka before present near 30 n latitude most post glacial δ18o shifts in precipitation δ18oglacial δ18orecent range from 3 to 2 jasechko et al 2015 the larger shift 6 to 8 in the qilian mountains can be explained better by a change in monsoonal weather patterns the south asian summer monsoon which at present supplies precipitation with average δ18o near 16 as far north as lhasa tian et al 2001 may have penetrated as far north as the qilian mountains at some time prior to 12 ka most likely at a time of glacial retreat in the qilian mountains one such retreat is documented at about 10 ka and another prior to 20 ka by owen and dortch 2014 fig 19 4 1 4 3 possible record of human caused climate change the shift from regime 2 to regime 1 correlates in time with accelerated shrinking of the aral sea 45 0 n 59 5 e as a result of diversion of river water in the early 1960s by 2006 the surface area had declined to 26 of the original area leading to increased evaporation from the remaining lakes small et al 2001 although they lie far to the west the aral and caspian seas are likely sources of recycled continental moisture in the prevailing westerly winds in the tien shan of kyrgyzstan kreutz et al 2003 and along the north rim of the tibetan plateau owen and dortch 2014 progressive increase in δ18o and δd of residual aral sea water as a result of declining input from the mountains to the south and increasing input of local groundwater oberhänsli et al 2009 alekseeva et al 2009 may explain the recent isotope changes in precipitation the qilian mountains 4 1 4 4 summary ur groundwater and surface water differs in isotopes from mr and lr groundwater indicating that present day meltwater from the qilian mountains has not yet infiltrated mr and lr aquifers to a detectable extent the sequential isotope changes in groundwater from the mountains to the alluvial basins suggest a temporal isotope evolution in glacial meltwater in the qilian mountains evidence from radioactive isotopes presented below will be used to evaluate this suggestion 4 2 tritium 4 2 1 precipitation and river water fig 5 a and b shows available data for tritium in precipitation calculated as amount weighted annual means collected in the hrb at zhangye 38 93 n 100 45 e along with datasets for hong kong 22 28 n 114 19 e wulumuqi 43 82 n 87 60 e and shijiazhuang 38 04 n 100 45 e in china st petersburg 59 97 n 30 3 e and arkhangelsk 64 58 n 40 5 e in russia and vienna 48 25 n 16 36 e austria international atomic energy agency iaea 2016 the data for zhangye shijiazhuang and st petersburg provide discontinuous coverage between 1985 and 2003 since 1970 mean annual tritium at most stations in north america eastoe et al 2011 and at vienna and arkhangelsk decreased at rates close to those of tritium radioactive decay in zhangye shijiazhuang and st petersburg large irregular increases in tritium were found in precipitation between 1985 and 2003 particularly in the early 1990s a shorter duration increase was recorded at wulumqi and a very small increase was observed in hong kong a similar effect of independent origin in tucson usa was documented as resulting from industrial emissions of tritium eastoe et al 2004 thus it appears that widespread anthropogenic emissions affected the tritium content of rain over much of china during the 1980s and 1990s in zhangye the result was an average tritium content of about 75 tu in rain between 1986 and 2001 in 2002 and 2003 the tritium decreased to an average of about 27 tu possibly signaling the end of the emissions the tritium content of present day and pre bomb groundwater in zhangye is not known at wulumuqi mean annual tritium in precipitation had decreased to 13 tu by 2002 international atomic energy agency iaea 2016 probably approaching the pre bomb level wulumuqi and zhangye lie at similar latitudes therefore a pre bomb level near 10 tu will be assumed for zhangye values of 10 20 tu are observed in present day precipitation in interior north america at similar latitudes e g the sierra nevada california harms et al 2016 and ottawa canada international atomic energy agency iaea 2016 the source of the anthropogenic tritium contamination at zhangye and shijiazhuang is not clear now the source appears to be in northern china in the area affected by westerly wind circulation and east of wulumqi where there is much less effect precipitation in south china e g hong kong where most moisture is supplied from the pacific ocean araguás araguás et al 1998 shows only a small increase in tritium in the early 1990s we note that the lop nor nuclear testing facility lies within the likely source area records of large releases of tritium there or elsewhere in north china in the 1980s and 1990s are unlikely to be available in scientific literature assuming that 1963 1964 rainwater in the hrb contained about 1000 tu it is not possible to distinguish recharge from 1963 to 1964 rainwater from rainwater recharged in 1985 2001 because both plot on the same radioactive decay trend fig 5 in zhangye the tritium content in such groundwater would be expected to range up to 70 tu in 2005 2010 in fact the highest measurements corrected to 2009 are 159 tu in deep groundwater he et al 2013 105 tu chen et al 2006 and 102 8 tu this study table 2 in shallow groundwater from piedmont plain near zhangye indicating that some recharge contained at least 1300 tu in 1963 1964 or 300 400 tu in the late 1990s in the ur tritium in rain from 2001 averaged 55 5 tu table 3 consistent with concurrent measurements in zhangye fig 5 river water corrected to 2008 or collected in 2008 2009 contained 43 3 32 0 and 29 1 tu in the ur mr and lr respectively table 3 table s1 indicating discharge of groundwater with low t into the river in the mr and lr in the irrigated area of the mr tritium in surface water was lower than that of other regions table s1 revealing discharge of pre bomb groundwater with low tritium into the river probably as a result of irrigation consistent with that suggestion no3 is higher in river water in the mr 4 3 mg l than that of the ur 2 0 mg l table 4 4 2 2 tritium concentration in groundwater and its spatial patterns spatial distributions of tritium concentration of groundwater show that there are significant differences in tritium between shallow groundwater 80m fig 6 a and deep groundwater 80m fig 6b in the hrb 4 2 2 1 shallow groundwater tritium in 10 spring and 2 deep groundwater samples in the ur varied from 26 6 tu to 57 3 tu table 2 table s2 indicating recharge of meteoric water that fell since about 1963 among 33 shallow groundwater samples in the mr 25 contain high tritium 14 1 102 8 tu all but four of these sampling sites lie close to the heihe river in the lr tritium in samples taken close to the heihe river ranged from 18 6 to 39 7 tu while tritium in shallow groundwater far from the heihe river contained 3 4 tu tritium concentration decreases gradually away from the river fig 6a the heihe river and other rivers draining the qilian mountains are therefore the dominant sources of recharge to shallow groundwater in the mr and lr samples with tritium below detection indicate recharge that occurred mainly prior to 1952 4 2 2 2 deep groundwater tritium in deep groundwater decreases gradually from the ur to the lr fig 6b table 2 tritium in deep groundwater of the piedmont plain of the mr is high 20 79 tu in both areas deep groundwater represents post bomb recharge in mr deep groundwater tritium varied from 2 tu to 9 6 tu with a mean of 2 6 tu in deep groundwater from the lr tritium content is 8 0 tu deep groundwater of the mr and lr therefore originated predominantly as pre bomb recharge in our study and related references table s2 4 2 3 relationship between tritium and δ18o evaluating the relationship between the suggested evolution of δ18o and age constraints from the tritium data fig 7 is complicated by the large amount of evaporation affecting mr and lr samples in ur samples which show little or no isotope evidence of evaporation finite tritium is present in all measured samples these have a δ18o range of 9 2 to 7 6 and correspond to the central cluster of data in fig 4a the mr samples include examples with finite tritium and tritium below detection it will be argued below section 4 4 3 on the basis of 14c data that some or all samples with δ18o 9 0 and high 14c are affected by irrigation reflux which could also have introduced tritium into pre bomb groundwater by addition of rainwater to irrigation water the mr samples with highest tritium 80 tu fig 7 all have values of δ18o near 8 the typical value for ur runoff and may indicate present day recharge of runoff from the ur fig 7 shows evidence that δ18o and d excess of recharge are increasing at the time of the tritium bomb pulse table s2 samples having δ18o 10 e g 34 39 and hx 07 contain little or no tritium samples having 10 δ18o 9 include examples with tritium 16tu e g hx 49 hx 61 and sy 29 the change in δ18o is not due to evaporation as indicated by increasing d excess table s2 however some mr shallow groundwater lr shallow and deep groundwater examples have higher δ18o values while contain little or no tritium suggesting strong evaporation occurred indicated by low d excess values table s2 4 3 14c and groundwater age 4 3 1 relationship of 14c activity with δ13c fig 8 a shows that the lowest δ13c values from 10 to 12 are found in mr samples with the highest 14c content 90 pmc table s3 the highest δ13c values are about 1 9 there is a general tendency for δ13c values to increase as pmc decreases these observations are used in correcting 14c data for dissolution of rock carbonate corrected 14c data for the mr and lr are listed in table s4 for multiple scenarios corrected ages range from post bomb many cases to about 12 ka it should be noted that the correction method suggested in section 3 4 does not apply to ur samples for which no reliable estimates of δ13ccarb and δ13crech can be made in samples that may have been affected by irrigation reflux carbon additions from soil gas would also need to be considered and the correction would become too complicated for the simple model used here it can be generally expected that addition of soil co2 formed from c3 crops with δ13c 23 to irrigation reflux will lead to smaller values of q eq 2 than values calculated using δ13crech 10 or 12 and therefore to values of a14crech larger than those presented for the samples identified as affected by irrigation reflux in table s4 4 3 2 relationship of 14c with δ18o in groundwater fig 8b shows a weak correlation between raw 14c data and δ18o using corrected 14c data instead fig 8c reveals a different relationship with a single exception mr samples having δ18o 9 contain 90 pmc most such samples are from shallow levels and have an isotope signature of evaporation fig 4b they are likely to have been affected by irrigation reflux which may also cause high 14c see section 4 4 mr samples on the evaporation trends of fig 4b span the entire range of corrected pmc from 26 to 154 zy16 the mr sample with lowest pmc will therefore be useful in constraining the time of initiation of these evaporation trends in recharge highly evaporated lr samples w43 w44 and hx16 all belong to the extreme evaporation trend of fig 4c of these w43 with lowest pmc will be useful in constraining the date of that isotope regime in runoff 4 3 3 variation 14c with depth the relationship of corrected 14c content with depth of groundwater in the mr and lr is shown in fig 9 from which a few invalid data points corrected 14c 160 pmc or q 1 table s4 have been removed groundwater in the upper 50 m has a corrected 14c range of 90 120 pmc fig 9 a much broader range of corrected 14c values 26 153 pmc is present in deeper groundwater in the mr in the lr the range of corrected 14c in deeper groundwater is 27 98 pmc shallow groundwater with high pmc represents recent recharge within the recent decades the lower limit of corrected 14c 90 pmc from fig 9 represents recharge least affected by bomb pulse 14c suggesting a possible value for a0 in eq 3 4 4 14c and tritium in groundwater 4 4 1 the relationship of 14c and tritium in groundwater comparing tritium and 14c results we identify four water groups in the mr and lr fig 10 a and b group 1 red triangle group 1 red triangle groundwater with high tritium 25 105 tu and high corrected 14c activity 90 112 pmc this groundwater type is of short residence time 60 years corresponding to recharge of post bomb precipitation this group occurs mainly in the piedmont plain both shallow and deep groundwater group 2 blue ellipse samples showing low tritium 10 tu and low corrected 14c activities 90 pmc this groundwater originated from pre bomb precipitation and mainly occurs in the deep aquifers in the mr and lr the presence of any measurable tritium in these waters is presumably a result of mixing with small amounts of younger water bulk residence times range up to 12000a bp group 3 green ellipse an intermediate group with corrected 14c values of 45 154 pmc and tritium contents of 10 25 tu principally shallow groundwaters from the lr and both shallow and deep groundwater in the mr group 4 purple ellipse samples showing very low tritium 4 tu with high corrected 14c activities 90 140pmc principally deep groundwaters from the mr and 1 shallow groundwater in the lr w44 gates et al 2008 group 4 and most group 3 samples are problematic because precipitation with high 14c activity must also have contained high tritium how such data might be explained will be discussed below 4 4 2 the role of irrigation reflux tritium and 14c the presence of tritium in samples containing 90 pmc can be explained by reflux of alkaline low pmc irrigation water that equilibrated with the atmosphere or mixed with a little bomb pulse rainwater at the surface if interaction with soil gas were limited for instance in saturated soil below a drainage canal the pmc in the reflux could remain lower than 90 greater interaction with soil gas for instance in the center of a field might explain the other set of apparently anomalous samples those with pmc 90 but little or no tritium the likelihood of irrigation reflux greatly limits the usefulness of 14c data hence the small number of samples used here for age constraints 4 4 3 age constraints on climate change tritium and 14c regime 1 recharge has been identified only in the ur all samples contain 26 tu consistent with an origin as precipitation that fell since 1960 regime 2 recharge ranges in age from about 10000 years sample zy16 to post bomb the upper limit of corrected 14c is 154 pmc which along with tritium contents up to 125 tu indicates that regime 2 runoff was infiltrating as late as the 1960s a change in δ18o from 10 to 9 appears to have occurred in regime 2 recharge since 1960 regime 3 runoff is dated on the basis of sample w43 to about 12000 years 4 4 4 management implications the body of isotope data examined here provides a framework for groundwater management in the hrb high 14c high tritium groundwater group 1 of fig 10 occurs mainly in the piedmont of the qilian mountains this area is the only part of the hrb where sustainable groundwater use seems possible elsewhere the extraction of groundwater is mining a resource that is largely being replaced slowly 5 conclusions 5 1 groundwater in the hrb largely originates as recharge from the heihe river and its tributaries 5 2 meltwater from post 1960s snow in the qilian mountains is the source of groundwater in the ur of the hrb groundwater from the mr and lr also originated as runoff from the qilian mountains but differed in isotope composition as a result of climate change in the qilian mountains 5 3 anthropogenic tritium contamination not derived from atmospheric nuclear tests appears to be present in zhangye precipitation between 1986 and 2001 5 4 between about 10 ka before present and the 1960s the o and h isotope composition of recharge in the hrb matched that of the dunde sheet 5 5 prior to 12 ka recharge in the hrb had δ18o δd near or less than 16 5 120 resembling present day precipitation from the south asian monsoon in southern tibet 5 6 the post 1960 shift in o and h isotopes in qilian mountains snow correlates in time with and may reflect the shrinking of the aral sea conflict of interest statement we declare that we do

distinguish pre and post bomb recharge the measurement of 14c in dissolved inorganic carbon dic is useful for dating groundwater with longer residence times e g 2 30 ka zuber et al 2004 eastoe et al 2010 benjamin 2015 farid et al 2015 the arid to semi arid heihe river basin hrb of 130 000 km2 is the second largest inland drainage basin of china it is a complex system of mountains agriculture and oases and a classic example of hydrological response to climate change overprinted by human activities it consists of three regions namely the upper region ur the source area in the qilian mountains the middle region mr yingluoxia to zhengyixia in fig 1 incorporating the zhangye linze gaotai basins and jiuquan and lower region lr the jinta dingxin and ejina basins both the mr and lr lack locally derived perennial surface runoff because of low rainfall and are entirely dependent on groundwater and surface water ultimately originating from the ur of the heihe river in the mr and lr large quantities of water are exploited for domestic consumption agriculture and industry and to maintain oases currently sustainable groundwater use is threatened by increasing population and expansion of irrigated agriculture and industry in the mr and lr cheng et al 2009 detailed hydrogeological information such as total resource and renewal rate of groundwater is essential for improving water resources management previous isotope studies in the hrb have addressed the sources of deep groundwater chen et al 2004 qian et al 2006 groundwater replenishment zhang et al 2004 interaction of unconfined groundwater and surface water nie et al 2005 recharge residence time and renewability of groundwater chen et al 2004 and groundwater circulation chen et al 2006 zhang et al 2005 in addition environmental factors affecting values of δ18o in precipitation wang et al 2008 zhao et al 2012a the contribution of different water sources to surface runoff wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2011 and the origin of moisture in the headwaters area of the hrb zhao et al 2011 have been reported the hrb aquifers are heterogeneous leading to different estimates of recharge rates estimation of recharge is difficult owing to temporal and spatial variability of rainfall and recharge processes recently jasechko et al 2014 suggested that winter recharge is dominant in the mr on the basis of published isotope data their analysis however is debatable because recharge originates mainly as high altitude summer precipitation in this article previously published measurements of δ18o δ2h 3h and 14c chen et al 2004 zhang et al 2005 chen et al 2006 gan et al 2008 gates et al 2008 jia et al 2008 he et al 2012 2013 are combined with new data with the aims 1 of constraining relationships between surface water and groundwater 2 determining recharge sources of unconfined groundwater above 80 m depth and confined groundwater below 80 m and 3 estimating groundwater residence times at regional scale during the course of the study a further aim emerged explaining large temporal changes in the isotope composition of recharge the results of this study have implications for dynamics of regional water resources both in the hrb and in other arid regions of northwestern china 2 study area and hydrogeological settings the hrb 96 42 to 102 04 e 37 45 to 42 40 n has an area of 130 000 km2 fig 1 the elevations of the ur mr and lr range from 5000 2000 1700 1300 and 1450 910 m above sea level respectively the principal physiographic features include the qilian mountains the ur at the southern boundary a corridor plain the mr at the foot of the qilian mountains and a broad northern plain lr bordering low mountains and the alashan plateau in the badain jaran desert and mongolia in the ur mean annual temperature is 3 0 to 4 0 c and annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 600 mm most falling in summer rivers originating in the qilian mountains are the main recharge source for groundwater in the hrb and there is little evaporative loss in the ur chen et al 2006 the mountain aquifers are mainly fractured weathered rock and in deeper structural fractured zones with direct hydraulic interaction water circulates fast through the fractures and groundwater is commonly connected with the surface water and is directly recharged from snow melt and glacial ice melt such aquifers discharge into the mountain rivers the mr and lr separated by the northern mountains and longshoushan mountains fig 1 comprise alluvial and fluvial plains underlain by unconsolidated quaternary strata about 1000 m thick in the mr and thinning gradually northwards the southern sub basin of the mr consists of alluvial fans abutting the qilian mountains and floodplains mean annual

fell from june to october international atomic energy agency iaea 2016 rain events are infrequent and insufficient to generate runoff the quaternary aquifer system of the south sub basin includes an unconfined zone in up to 1000 m of gravel and sand in the piedmont plain and a confined zone in 50 200 m of silty sand in the floodplain chen et al 2006 the lr in the jinta dingxin and ejina areas has a mean annual temperature near 8 c the mean annual precipitation is only 42 mm while mean potential evaporation is 2300 3700 mm year quaternary aquifers consist of unconsolidated eolian fluvial and lacustrine units 50 500 m thick thinning and fining gradually northwards single or multiple sand lenses are separated by clay layers the northern sub basin of the lr in the jinta dingxin and ejina areas has a mean annual temperature near 8 c the mean annual precipitation is only 42 mm relative to mean potential evaporation of 2300 3700 mm year regional quaternary aquifers consist of eolian and lacustrine deposits the aquifer system changes from an unconfined gravel zone in the south to multi layered sand and silt in the north fig 1c chen et al 2006 the depth to the water table varies from 10 to 30 m in the south part of this sub basin to 3 m near the ejina oasis groundwater flows from southwest to northeast and discharges by evaporation an underlying confined aquifer below 70 m consists of sandy gravel layers separated by discontinuous clay layers the confined aquifer is the principal aquifer to the northeast of ejina chen et al 2006 3 water sampling and analytical methods 3 1 sampling for isotope analyses 3 1 1 spring water samples spring water was sampled between october 2007 and september 2009 additional samples were collected weekly at hulugou 3020 m a s l in the ur from august 2009 to february 2010 fig 1a 3 1 2 groundwater groundwater was sampled from irrigation wells during irrigation seasons between october 2007 and september 2009 fig 1a wells were purged by a minimum of several hours of pumping prior to sampling samples for stable o and h isotopes were stored in rinsed 2 ml glass storage vials and sealed immediately with parafilm for 14c samples we performed field precipitations of dic on 25l with 3 4 repeats water samples according to the method of qi et al 2016 samples for tritium measurement were stored in sealed 500 ml glass bottles 3 1 3 precipitation samples precipitation samples were collected at yeniugou 3320 m a s l dayekou 3020 m a s l and hulugou 2700 m a s l stations in the ur fig 1b at yeniugou samples were collected for individual events from june to february 2009 and june to september 2009 at dayekou precipitation was sampled once per two hours during two precipitation periods in july and august 2009 and single event samples were collected from september to november 2008 and june 2011 to october 2014 at hulugou single event precipitation samples were collected from august to september 2009 and june 2014 to october 2014 sample collectors were designed to prevent evaporation values of δ18o δd and tritium in precipitation at zhangye in the mr are from the international atomic energy agency iaea 2016 3 1 4 river water samples at yeniugou in the ur river water samples were collected weekly in the zhamashenke river main stream from may to december 2008 and april to november 2009 river water samples were collected in the batougou branch of the zhamashenke river from july to october 2008 and july to november 2009 in addition river water samples were taken in october 2007 may and august 2008 and june 2009 across the whole hrb fig 1b 3 2 analysis of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes measurements of δ18o and δd were undertaken at the key laboratory for ecohydrology of inland river basins chinese academy of sciences lanzhou china samples taken prior to february 2009 were measured using a euro ea3000 elemental analyzer linked to a gv instruments isoprime mass spectrometer replicates of some samples were measured at nagoya university japan to confirm the accuracy of the isoprime measurements using a thermo finnigan delta plus mass spectrometer with an h2o co2 equilibrator for δ18o and with a hydrophobic platinum catalyst for δd samples taken in 2009 and 2010 were measured using a picarro l1102 i water isotope analyzer to avoid memory effects associated with continuous flow methods and assess the precision of the measurements each sample was measured five times and the first value was discarded calibration was effected using international standard vsmow and slap and two working standards qhh δd δ18o 1 8 7 1 and lzpw 67 7 8 2 the analytical precision 1σ was better than 1 0 for δd and 0 2 for δ18o in the isoprime system and 0 5 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o in the l1102 i system the detailed information δd and δ18o data of surface water samples in this study were shown in table s1 3 3 samples for radioactive isotope measurements tritium and 14c were measured at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology iheg chinese academy of geological sciences shijiazhuang china tritium was determined on electrolytically enriched water samples by liquid scintillation spectrometer quantulus 1220 the results were reported as tritium units with analytical precision of 1 tu in low tritiumsamples increasing to 4 tu at 100 tu and a detection limit of 2 tu carbon from dic was processed to benzene and counted for 14c using a liquid scintillation spectrometer qi et al 2016 analytical precision varies from about 1 pmc 1σ near 14 pmc to 2 pmc near 100 pmc ddetailed information and data for groundwater samples for this and previous studies are shown in table s2 3 4 correction of tritium concentration and 14c tritium concentrations of samples from previous studies 2001 2006 were adjusted to 2009 to compare with our samples taken in 2008 and 2009 using the equation n n 0 1 2 t t 1 2 where n0 is the measured tritium activity n is the activity t years after measurement and t½ is the half life of tritium 12 43a lucas and unterweger 2000 the procedure is a modification of the pearson method pearson and hanshaw 1970 adapted from clark and fritz 1961 p 210 using δ13c data as the basis for correction calculations the procedure provides only approximate results because the exchange of carbon isotopes between rock and groundwater is subject to kinetic processes gonfiantini and zuppi 2003 sanford 1997 that are not represented in the pearson method in recharge water 14c is commonly considered to be derived from soil gas which contains co2 formed from decomposing plant matter and has a 14c concentration similar to that of the contemporaneous atmosphere this 14c is diluted when the infiltrating water containing dissolved co2 dissolves rock calcite if the rock calcite has a consistent δ13c value δ13c carb and contains no 14c the added bicarbonate will have δ13c close to δ13ccarb and a14c content of 0 pmc a dilution factor q for the 14c may be defined as follows 1 q a14cdic a14crech 0 q 1 where the a14c terms are activities of 14c expressed for instance as pmc rech recharge using an isotope balance based on δ13c q may also be expressed as 2 q δ13cdic δ13ccarb δ13crech δ13ccarb the corrected value a14crech is then calculated from eq 1 acceptable results cannot exceed the peak pmc of seasonally averaged atmospheric co2 during the bomb spike of the 1960s approximately 190 pmc burchuladze et al 1989 acceptable results for q cannot exceed 1 the corrected age is the given by 3 age 8033 ln a14crech a0 where a0 is the 14c activity of recharge values used for a0 are discussed below if recharge occurs from the saturated bed of a large stream an alternative approach to estimating δ13crech arises saturated alluvium contains little or no soil gas in such a case δ13crech is δ13cdic dic dissolved inorganic carbon of the river water and a14crech is the typical 14c content of the river water this approach was used here and was also used by gates et al 2008 in the badain jaran desert zhu et al 2008 and chen et al 2006 on the other hand used values δ13crech based on soil gas composition assumptions for the present study include 1 that rock carbonate has been dissolved into groundwater consistent with the range of δ13cdic and ph in the samples table s3 groundwater with no dissolved rock carbonate has lower values of both δ13cdic and ph e g le gal la salle et al 2001 2 that each region of the basin is homogeneous with respect to δ13ccarb 3 that calcite in the basin fill sediments has average δ13ccarb values 1 0 correction procedures used in the hrb and neighboring basins by zhu et al 2008 and chen et al 2006 used δ13ccarb values of 0 8 and 1 5 respectively while ma et al 2010 used 2 all without explicit justification in this study we use 2 0 an unacceptable number of invalid values of q and a14crech resulted if δ13ccarb values 1 were used table s4 4 that the value of δ13crech in river water can be estimated by examining the range of δ13c in dic of groundwater as a function of 14c fig 8a the range 12 to 2 appears to be generally dependent on 14c with the lowest values in modern samples with uncorrected 14c between 90 pmc and 120 pmc and the highest values in samples with uncorrected 14c 60 pmc by this reasoning the average δ13c of infiltrating river water would be 12 or less in the mr and 10 or less in the lguo et al 2013 found that δ13c increased in a similar way from 12 in mountain headwaters to 10 in downstream basins in four rivers near xian 1130 km southeast of zhangye note that the heihe river in their study is a different river of that name gates et al 2008 based their value of δ13cdic on a very young groundwater sample with a δ13cdic value of 9 8 and containing 96 9 pmc corrected ages of pre bomb samples are calculated for three cases of 14c content in recharge 80 90 and 100 pmc table s4 results range from post bomb many cases to about 12000 years a value near 90 pmc is supported by the minimum value 90 of corrected pmc values calculation of which is independent of the pmc of recharge in shallow groundwater see section 4 3 4 if river water characteristically had lower pmc then a lower minimum value might be expected among the corrected results in environments similar to that of the hrb arid with recharge from streams into predominantly siliciclastic basin fill pmc values near 100 in infiltrating surface water have been proposed e g in the badain jaran desert gates et al 2008 and the hueco bolson basin of northern mexico eastoe et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 stable isotopes 4 1 1 precipitation δd and δ18o in the ur and mr values of δ18o and δd span broad and similar ranges in the ur and mr fig 2 the lmwl in the ur is δd 7 9δ18o 14 3 values of d deuterium excess are generally higher than 10 suggesting recycling of continental moisture into the moisture reaching the qilian mountains clark and fritz 1961 araguás araguás et al 1998 tian et al 2005 zhao et al 2011 gammons et al 2006 in the mr the lmwl is δd 7 0 δ18o 2 9 with slope and the intercept lower than those of the gmwl suggesting evaporation of falling rain mook and de vries 2000 as a result of high temperature and low humidity in the mr fig s1 the slope and intercept of the lmwl for the ur were higher than those of the mr fig 2 suggesting that stronger evaporation of falling raindrops occurs in the mr as a result of high temperature and low relative humidity fig s1 no isotope altitude effect is evident between the ur and mr despite their large differences in elevation fig 2 coplen 1993 observed that altitude effects are commonly absent on mountain ranges in continental interiors 4 1 2 river δd and δ18o in the hrb the δ18o and δd values of ur and most mr river water plot close to the lmwl of the ur but have greatly attenuated ranges relative to precipitation fig 3 demonstrating that river water originates mainly as precipitation from the ur from the ur to the lr δ18o and δd values of river water become more positive and the d excess lower consistent with progressive evaporation downstream fig 3 certain δ18o and δd values of river water sampled near zhangye linze and gaotai in the mr are lower than the average values found in the ur indicating discharge of isotopically light irrigation groundwater into heihe river 4 1 3 variations of δ18o and d excess in groundwater 4 1 3 1 upper region groundwater mainly spring water plots on or above the lmwl for the ur fig 4 a indicating that infiltration occurs without change to the isotope composition of precipitation grünberger et al 2004 montoroi et al 2002 the d excess values range from 11 3 to 26 8 table 1 most samples cluster around 8 0 and 46 0 and resemble data for 2012 2013 meltwater from snow and glacier ice at shiyi glacier approximately 38 25 n 99 85 e in the upper heihe catchment li et al 2015 this and other glaciers and high elevation snowfields of the qilian mountains are principal sources of ur groundwater 4 1 3 2 middle region shallow groundwater of the mr plots on a linear regression line of slope 5 0 and deep groundwater along a line of slope 6 4 fig 4b neither regression line contains the main cluster of ur groundwater and the trends fall above the lmwl for zhangye both trends are strongly influenced by evaporation and appear to originate at values of δ18o δd near or less than 10 70 table 1 data with d excess near 0 plot below the zhangye lmwl in the mr neither local precipitation at zhangye nor present day runoff from the qilian mountains can account for most of the mr groundwater isotope data however the origins of the trends suggest mountain derived groundwater of different isotope composition relative to present day meltwater 4 1 3 3 lower region there is no apparent isotopic distinction between deep and shallow groundwater in the lr many groundwater samples from the lr overlap the field of mr groundwater fig 4c other samples with d excess ranging down to 22 7 table s2 plot along or above a line of slope 5 intersecting the gmwl at δ18o 16 much of the lr groundwater is therefore of the same origin as mr groundwater however the water plotting along the lower line of slope 5 in fig 4c originated as precipitation with δ18o δd near or less than 16 5 120 mixing occurs between these two types of water ur groundwater and surface water differs in isotopes from mr and lr groundwater indicating that present day meltwater from the qilian mountains has not yet infiltrated mr and lr aquifers to a detectable extent the sequential isotope changes in groundwater from the mountains to the alluvial basins suggest a temporal isotope evolution in glacial meltwater in the qilian mountains evidence from radioactive isotopes presented below will be used to evaluate this suggestion 4 1 4 implication of stable o and h isotopes 4 1 4 1 runoff regimes stable o and h isotopes document large changes in the isotope composition of runoff entering the hrb over at least 12 ka the data require three regimes of runoff 1 present day runoff mainly with δ18o values near 8 0 resembling 2012 2013 meltwater from the shiyi glacier 2 earlier runoff the main source of water to the mr and lr without evaporation this kind of runoff had δ18o values of 9 0 or less 3 older runoff still encountered mainly in the lr it is preserved as an evaporation trend fig 4c originating at δ18o 16 5 and δd 120 no change in geographic source area for runoff is possible over the last 10 20 millennia rather climate change leading to a unidirectional evolution of isotopes in precipitation in the qilian mountains is indicated a discussion of when and why such changes occurred follows below 4 1 4 2 age constraints on climate change ice records regime 1 runoff resembles the isotope composition of the shiyi glacier and its meltwater in 2012 2013 ce li et al 2015 the isotope compositions of regimes 2 and 3 are also present in ice from other parts of the tibetan plateau in the dunde ice sheet 38 00 n 96 41 e ice from 12ka before present to 2002 has an isotope composition takeuchi et al 2009 thompson 2000 davis and thompson 2004 like that of unevaporated regime 2 runoff fig 4b ice and meltwater runoff matching regime 3 in isotopes accumulate at present only in southern tibet from the south asian summer monsoon tian et al 2001 an example occurs in the noijing kangsang ice sheet 29 09 n 90 20 e zhao et al 2012 the change from regime 2 to regime 1 represents a change in moisture source at some time during the last six decades before the shift meltwater in the qilian mountains had isotope compositions like those of the dunde ice sheet no similar shift at dunde ice sheet had occurred by 2002 however tian et al 2001 recorded summer precipitation with an isotope signature matching regime 1 in precipitation at nearby delingha 37 37 n 97 97 e the change from regime 3 to regime 2 represents a larger change in moisture source in the qilian mountains prior to 12ka before present near 30 n latitude most post glacial δ18o shifts in precipitation δ18oglacial δ18orecent range from 3 to 2 jasechko et al 2015 the larger shift 6 to 8 in the qilian mountains can be explained better by a change in monsoonal weather patterns the south asian summer monsoon which at present supplies precipitation with average δ18o near 16 as far north as lhasa tian et al 2001 may have penetrated as far north as the qilian mountains at some time prior to 12 ka most likely at a time of glacial retreat in the qilian mountains one such retreat is documented at about 10 ka and another prior to 20 ka by owen and dortch 2014 fig 19 4 1 4 3 possible record of human caused climate change the shift from regime 2 to regime 1 correlates in time with accelerated shrinking of the aral sea 45 0 n 59 5 e as a result of diversion of river water in the early 1960s by 2006 the surface area had declined to 26 of the original area leading to increased evaporation from the remaining lakes small et al 2001 although they lie far to the west the aral and caspian seas are likely sources of recycled continental moisture in the prevailing westerly winds in the tien shan of kyrgyzstan kreutz et al 2003 and along the north rim of the tibetan plateau owen and dortch 2014 progressive increase in δ18o and δd of residual aral sea water as a result of declining input from the mountains to the south and increasing input of local groundwater oberhänsli et al 2009 alekseeva et al 2009 may explain the recent isotope changes in precipitation the qilian mountains 4 1 4 4 summary ur groundwater and surface water differs in isotopes from mr and lr groundwater indicating that present day meltwater from the qilian mountains has not yet infiltrated mr and lr aquifers to a detectable extent the sequential isotope changes in groundwater from the mountains to the alluvial basins suggest a temporal isotope evolution in glacial meltwater in the qilian mountains evidence from radioactive isotopes presented below will be used to evaluate this suggestion 4 2 tritium 4 2 1 precipitation and river water fig 5 a and b shows available data for tritium in precipitation calculated as amount weighted annual means collected in the hrb at zhangye 38 93 n 100 45 e along with datasets for hong kong 22 28 n 114 19 e wulumuqi 43 82 n 87 60 e and shijiazhuang 38 04 n 100 45 e in china st petersburg 59 97 n 30 3 e and arkhangelsk 64 58 n 40 5 e in russia and vienna 48 25 n 16 36 e austria international atomic energy agency iaea 2016 the data for zhangye shijiazhuang and st petersburg provide discontinuous coverage between 1985 and 2003 since 1970 mean annual tritium at most stations in north america eastoe et al 2011 and at vienna and arkhangelsk decreased at rates close to those of tritium radioactive decay in zhangye shijiazhuang and st petersburg large irregular increases in tritium were found in precipitation between 1985 and 2003 particularly in the early 1990s a shorter duration increase was recorded at wulumqi and a very small increase was observed in hong kong a similar effect of independent origin in tucson usa was documented as resulting from industrial emissions of tritium eastoe et al 2004 thus it appears that widespread anthropogenic emissions affected the tritium content of rain over much of china during the 1980s and 1990s in zhangye the result was an average tritium content of about 75 tu in rain between 1986 and 2001 in 2002 and 2003 the tritium decreased to an average of about 27 tu possibly signaling the end of the emissions the tritium content of present day and pre bomb groundwater in zhangye is not known at wulumuqi mean annual tritium in precipitation had decreased to 13 tu by 2002 international atomic energy agency iaea 2016 probably approaching the pre bomb level wulumuqi and zhangye lie at similar latitudes therefore a pre bomb level near 10 tu will be assumed for zhangye values of 10 20 tu are observed in present day precipitation in interior north america at similar latitudes e g the sierra nevada california harms et al 2016 and ottawa canada international atomic energy agency iaea 2016 the source of the anthropogenic tritium contamination at zhangye and shijiazhuang is not clear now the source appears to be in northern china in the area affected by westerly wind circulation and east of wulumqi where there is much less effect precipitation in south china e g hong kong where most moisture is supplied from the pacific ocean araguás araguás et al 1998 shows only a small increase in tritium in the early 1990s we note that the lop nor nuclear testing facility lies within the likely source area records of large releases of tritium there or elsewhere in north china in the 1980s and 1990s are unlikely to be available in scientific literature assuming that 1963 1964 rainwater in the hrb contained about 1000 tu it is not possible to distinguish recharge from 1963 to 1964 rainwater from rainwater recharged in 1985 2001 because both plot on the same radioactive decay trend fig 5 in zhangye the tritium content in such groundwater would be expected to range up to 70 tu in 2005 2010 in fact the highest measurements corrected to 2009 are 159 tu in deep groundwater he et al 2013 105 tu chen et al 2006 and 102 8 tu this study table 2 in shallow groundwater from piedmont plain near zhangye indicating that some recharge contained at least 1300 tu in 1963 1964 or 300 400 tu in the late 1990s in the ur tritium in rain from 2001 averaged 55 5 tu table 3 consistent with concurrent measurements in zhangye fig 5 river water corrected to 2008 or collected in 2008 2009 contained 43 3 32 0 and 29 1 tu in the ur mr and lr respectively table 3 table s1 indicating discharge of groundwater with low t into the river in the mr and lr in the irrigated area of the mr tritium in surface water was lower than that of other regions table s1 revealing discharge of pre bomb groundwater with low tritium into the river probably as a result of irrigation consistent with that suggestion no3 is higher in river water in the mr 4 3 mg l than that of the ur 2 0 mg l table 4 4 2 2 tritium concentration in groundwater and its spatial patterns spatial distributions of tritium concentration of groundwater show that there are significant differences in tritium between shallow groundwater 80m fig 6 a and deep groundwater 80m fig 6b in the hrb 4 2 2 1 shallow groundwater tritium in 10 spring and 2 deep groundwater samples in the ur varied from 26 6 tu to 57 3 tu table 2 table s2 indicating recharge of meteoric water that fell since about 1963 among 33 shallow groundwater samples in the mr 25 contain high tritium 14 1 102 8 tu all but four of these sampling sites lie close to the heihe river in the lr tritium in samples taken close to the heihe river ranged from 18 6 to 39 7 tu while tritium in shallow groundwater far from the heihe river contained 3 4 tu tritium concentration decreases gradually away from the river fig 6a the heihe river and other rivers draining the qilian mountains are therefore the dominant sources of recharge to shallow groundwater in the mr and lr samples with tritium below detection indicate recharge that occurred mainly prior to 1952 4 2 2 2 deep groundwater tritium in deep groundwater decreases gradually from the ur to the lr fig 6b table 2 tritium in deep groundwater of the piedmont plain of the mr is high 20 79 tu in both areas deep groundwater represents post bomb recharge in mr deep groundwater tritium varied from 2 tu to 9 6 tu with a mean of 2 6 tu in deep groundwater from the lr tritium content is 8 0 tu deep groundwater of the mr and lr therefore originated predominantly as pre bomb recharge in our study and related references table s2 4 2 3 relationship between tritium and δ18o evaluating the relationship between the suggested evolution of δ18o and age constraints from the tritium data fig 7 is complicated by the large amount of evaporation affecting mr and lr samples in ur samples which show little or no isotope evidence of evaporation finite tritium is present in all measured samples these have a δ18o range of 9 2 to 7 6 and correspond to the central cluster of data in fig 4a the mr samples include examples with finite tritium and tritium below detection it will be argued below section 4 4 3 on the basis of 14c data that some or all samples with δ18o 9 0 and high 14c are affected by irrigation reflux which could also have introduced tritium into pre bomb groundwater by addition of rainwater to irrigation water the mr samples with highest tritium 80 tu fig 7 all have values of δ18o near 8 the typical value for ur runoff and may indicate present day recharge of runoff from the ur fig 7 shows evidence that δ18o and d excess of recharge are increasing at the time of the tritium bomb pulse table s2 samples having δ18o 10 e g 34 39 and hx 07 contain little or no tritium samples having 10 δ18o 9 include examples with tritium 16tu e g hx 49 hx 61 and sy 29 the change in δ18o is not due to evaporation as indicated by increasing d excess table s2 however some mr shallow groundwater lr shallow and deep groundwater examples have higher δ18o values while contain little or no tritium suggesting strong evaporation occurred indicated by low d excess values table s2 4 3 14c and groundwater age 4 3 1 relationship of 14c activity with δ13c fig 8 a shows that the lowest δ13c values from 10 to 12 are found in mr samples with the highest 14c content 90 pmc table s3 the highest δ13c values are about 1 9 there is a general tendency for δ13c values to increase as pmc decreases these observations are used in correcting 14c data for dissolution of rock carbonate corrected 14c data for the mr and lr are listed in table s4 for multiple scenarios corrected ages range from post bomb many cases to about 12 ka it should be noted that the correction method suggested in section 3 4 does not apply to ur samples for which no reliable estimates of δ13ccarb and δ13crech can be made in samples that may have been affected by irrigation reflux carbon additions from soil gas would also need to be considered and the correction would become too complicated for the simple model used here it can be generally expected that addition of soil co2 formed from c3 crops with δ13c 23 to irrigation reflux will lead to smaller values of q eq 2 than values calculated using δ13crech 10 or 12 and therefore to values of a14crech larger than those presented for the samples identified as affected by irrigation reflux in table s4 4 3 2 relationship of 14c with δ18o in groundwater fig 8b shows a weak correlation between raw 14c data and δ18o using corrected 14c data instead fig 8c reveals a different relationship with a single exception mr samples having δ18o 9 contain 90 pmc most such samples are from shallow levels and have an isotope signature of evaporation fig 4b they are likely to have been affected by irrigation reflux which may also cause high 14c see section 4 4 mr samples on the evaporation trends of fig 4b span the entire range of corrected pmc from 26 to 154 zy16 the mr sample with lowest pmc will therefore be useful in constraining the time of initiation of these evaporation trends in recharge highly evaporated lr samples w43 w44 and hx16 all belong to the extreme evaporation trend of fig 4c of these w43 with lowest pmc will be useful in constraining the date of that isotope regime in runoff 4 3 3 variation 14c with depth the relationship of corrected 14c content with depth of groundwater in the mr and lr is shown in fig 9 from which a few invalid data points corrected 14c 160 pmc or q 1 table s4 have been removed groundwater in the upper 50 m has a corrected 14c range of 90 120 pmc fig 9 a much broader range of corrected 14c values 26 153 pmc is present in deeper groundwater in the mr in the lr the range of corrected 14c in deeper groundwater is 27 98 pmc shallow groundwater with high pmc represents recent recharge within the recent decades the lower limit of corrected 14c 90 pmc from fig 9 represents recharge least affected by bomb pulse 14c suggesting a possible value for a0 in eq 3 4 4 14c and tritium in groundwater 4 4 1 the relationship of 14c and tritium in groundwater comparing tritium and 14c results we identify four water groups in the mr and lr fig 10 a and b group 1 red triangle group 1 red triangle groundwater with high tritium 25 105 tu and high corrected 14c activity 90 112 pmc this groundwater type is of short residence time 60 years corresponding to recharge of post bomb precipitation this group occurs mainly in the piedmont plain both shallow and deep groundwater group 2 blue ellipse samples showing low tritium 10 tu and low corrected 14c activities 90 pmc this groundwater originated from pre bomb precipitation and mainly occurs in the deep aquifers in the mr and lr the presence of any measurable tritium in these waters is presumably a result of mixing with small amounts of younger water bulk residence times range up to 12000a bp group 3 green ellipse an intermediate group with corrected 14c values of 45 154 pmc and tritium contents of 10 25 tu principally shallow groundwaters from the lr and both shallow and deep groundwater in the mr group 4 purple ellipse samples showing very low tritium 4 tu with high corrected 14c activities 90 140pmc principally deep groundwaters from the mr and 1 shallow groundwater in the lr w44 gates et al 2008 group 4 and most group 3 samples are problematic because precipitation with high 14c activity must also have contained high tritium how such data might be explained will be discussed below 4 4 2 the role of irrigation reflux tritium and 14c the presence of tritium in samples containing 90 pmc can be explained by reflux of alkaline low pmc irrigation water that equilibrated with the atmosphere or mixed with a little bomb pulse rainwater at the surface if interaction with soil gas were limited for instance in saturated soil below a drainage canal the pmc in the reflux could remain lower than 90 greater interaction with soil gas for instance in the center of a field might explain the other set of apparently anomalous samples those with pmc 90 but little or no tritium the likelihood of irrigation reflux greatly limits the usefulness of 14c data hence the small number of samples used here for age constraints 4 4 3 age constraints on climate change tritium and 14c regime 1 recharge has been identified only in the ur all samples contain 26 tu consistent with an origin as precipitation that fell since 1960 regime 2 recharge ranges in age from about 10000 years sample zy16 to post bomb the upper limit of corrected 14c is 154 pmc which along with tritium contents up to 125 tu indicates that regime 2 runoff was infiltrating as late as the 1960s a change in δ18o from 10 to 9 appears to have occurred in regime 2 recharge since 1960 regime 3 runoff is dated on the basis of sample w43 to about 12000 years 4 4 4 management implications the body of isotope data examined here provides a framework for groundwater management in the hrb high 14c high tritium groundwater group 1 of fig 10 occurs mainly in the piedmont of the qilian mountains this area is the only part of the hrb where sustainable groundwater use seems possible elsewhere the extraction of groundwater is mining a resource that is largely being replaced slowly 5 conclusions 5 1 groundwater in the hrb largely originates as recharge from the heihe river and its tributaries 5 2 meltwater from post 1960s snow in the qilian mountains is the source of groundwater in the ur of the hrb groundwater from the mr and lr also originated as runoff from the qilian mountains but differed in isotope composition as a result of climate change in the qilian mountains 5 3 anthropogenic tritium contamination not derived from atmospheric nuclear tests appears to be present in zhangye precipitation between 1986 and 2001 5 4 between about 10 ka before present and the 1960s the o and h isotope composition of recharge in the hrb matched that of the dunde sheet 5 5 prior to 12 ka recharge in the hrb had δ18o δd near or less than 16 5 120 resembling present day precipitation from the south asian monsoon in southern tibet 5 6 the post 1960 shift in o and h isotopes in qilian mountains snow correlates in time with and may reflect the shrinking of the aral sea conflict of interest statement we declare that we do

8502,study region the turonian coniacian aquifer system in the north of the coastal sedimentary basin southern benin west africa study focus the turonian coniacian aquifer is the major aquifer in southern benin and is the main source of water supply for the population the pressure on groundwater resources from the turonian coniacian aquifer is increasing since few artesian wells tapping into this aquifer already show decrease in their yields preventing extinction of the artesian outflows requires as a first step a thorough understanding of the groundwater flow system groundwater recharge areas downstream areas and flow directions in this study a combined hydrogeological hydrochemical and isotopic approach was applied to understand the groundwater flow within this aquifer and to develop a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model new hydrological insights for the region the piezometric results indicated three main groundwater flow directions stable isotopes results confirmed the piezometry as the most depleted and enriched values in oxygen 18 and deuterium were found respectively in downstream areas southern region and in the recharge areas northern region indicated by the piezometry similarly higher tritium contents up to 3 5 tritium unit characterize recharge areas and low tritium contents 0 12 tritium unit were found in downstream areas the combination of these results with the geologic and topographic data led to a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model shown in this paper keywords hydrochemistry isotope ouémé piezometry turonian coniacian aquifer 1 introduction groundwater is one of the world s most important natural resources in several parts of the world it happens that this vital resource is threatened both quantitatively and qualitatively the example of the great artesian basin which underlies 23 of the australia continent powel at al 2015 where several springs have dried out and several artesian wells have stopped flowing is an illustration of severe threats that occur to groundwater resources several other authors e g idris 1996 powell and fensham 2015 roberts and mitchell 1987 have reported similar threats on groundwater resources in different parts of the world in benin especially in the coastal sedimentary basin groundwater is the major source of freshwater for the population the major aquifer in this basin the turonian coniacian aquifer is artesian in some parts of the basin where artesian wells keep discharging continuously enormous quantity of groundwater to the surface the artesian wells are free flowing because they are not pipped and capped however tapping and capping artesian wells help greatly to reduce water loss and hence aquifer drawdown it is known from the literature e g powell and fensham 2015 that in some systems artesian outflows turned out to considerably diminished some natural springs have totally dried out and numerous artesian wells have stopped flowing powell et al 2015 idris 1996 powell and fensham 2015 roberts and mitchell 1987 yermani et al 2003 currently in benin part of the local population finds the free artesian outflows beneficial because efforts to manually pump groundwater is not required however the other part of the population already express concerns about the sustainability of this groundwater resource personal communication with the local population and some artesian wells already show decrease in their yields so far no study has investigated the sustainability of this vital resource and therefore groundwater recharge abstractions rates and free artesian outflow rates required for a sustainable use of this resource remain completely unclear to prevent extinction or stoppage of free artesian outflows and drying out of natural springs it is wise to investigate and identify conditions recharge and abstractions that may cause extinction of free artesian outflows and drying out of natural springs once the recharge abstraction rates and free outflow conditions are known preventive actions could be taken in a short and long term arriving at identifying the conditions that may cause artesian wells outflows to stop and springs to dry out requires as a first step a thorough understanding of the groundwater flow system groundwater recharge areas groundwater discharge areas and flow directions however the main problem is that the groundwater head data which is required for the understanding of the groundwater flow and the development of conceptual groundwater flow models bredehoeft 2005 zheng and bennett 1995 kresic and mikszewski 2013 is often quite limited in many hydrological systems barthel 2014 candela et al 2013 carter et al 1994 refstegaard et al 2010 data related to groundwater systems are limited or absent as in ungauged basins due to their inaccessibility and large costs and huge time involved in long term experimental characterization and monitoring in some hydrological systems boreholes that could allow the measurements of groundwater levels gwl do exist but they were not designed to allow such measurements even though boreholes for drinking supply could well be designed to allow both groundwater extraction and measurements of gwl aranyossy 2007 only one gwl data that was recorded during drilling operations is available for those boreholes and data recorded during drilling operation may not be reliable for those boreholes that do not allow gwl measurement the groundwater mineralization as measured through the tds total dissolved solids could still be obtained as long as groundwater abstraction remain possible from those boreholes but this raises the following question can the tds reliably inform about groundwater flow directions and lead to the development of reliable conceptual groundwater flow models groundwater mineralization has been largely investigated e g verhagen 1995 moussa et al 2009 fadili et al 2015 dieng et al 2017 gning et al 2017 but its validity in helping develop coherent conceptual groundwater flow models is unclear to some extents stable isotopes boronina et al 2005 dhaoui et al 2016 and radioactive isotopes izbicki et al 1995 szabo et al 1996 though costly are proved to provide relevant information on groundwater ages directions of groundwater flow aquifer recharge and discharge zones hence isotopes piezometric and also geologic data are often used to construct conceptual groundwater flow models dassi and tarki 2014 pétré et al 2016 fernandes et al 2016 brikic et al 2016 bicalho et al 2017 madrala et al 2017 segadelli et al 2017 based on the knowledge that hydrochemical patterns are influenced by groundwater flow stuyfzand 1999 hussein 2004 novel et al 2007 and that high and low mineralization of groundwater are usually correlated to long and short resident time respectively wilson et al 1991 huneau et al 2007 we focus on accessing the reliability of the tds in the development of conceptual groundwater flow models so the main aim of this study is to develop a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model for the research area we use this case study to access whether the groundwater mineralization as measured through the tds is a relevant element to consider when it comes to developing conceptual flow models in scarce groundwater head data environments where tds data could still be obtained in that sense we firstly focus on both piezometric and isotopes data to develop a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model using as case study the turonian coniacian aquifer system in southern benin then we use data of tritium and 14cfrom the same case study to test the reliability of groundwater mineralization with respect to conceptual flow models development 2 study area 2 1 location climate and vegetation the study area fig 1 is geographically located between latitudes 6 45 n and 7 40 n and longitudes 1 55 e and 2 50 e and covers approximately 4600 km2 it is a part of the northern coastal sedimentary basin of benin republic boukari 2007 alassane et al 2015 and is composed mainly of 3 plateaus from west to east abomey zagnanado and kétou plateaus that are separated respectively by zou river and ouémé stream the ouémé valley and an east west belt known regionally as lama depression affaton et al 1985 amajor 1991 the study area is bordered in the north by the crystalline bedrock in the south by allada and sakete plateaus in the west by couffo stream and its eastern border corresponds to the limit between benin and nigeria republics fig 1 it is worthwhile noting that the kétou plateau extends to the south western nigeria abeokuta township where similar geological formations as found in benin are encountered affaton et al 1985 the topography in the study area varies from 1 to about 270 m a s l high altitude values are observed in the northern plateaus low altitude values are found in the ouémé valley and in the lama depression the study area belongs to the sub equatorial region with a bimodal rainfall distribution fig 2 a it is characterized by two rainy seasons a main rainy season from mid march to mid august and a short rainy season from mid september to november and two dry seasons a short dry season from mid august to mid september and a main dry season from december to mid march the mean annual rainfall recorded at bohicon meteorological station from 1922 to 2009 is 1197 mm with a potential evapotranspiration of about 1500 mm year achidi et al 2012 amoussou 2005 the relative humidity is high and is comprised between 65 and 90 the annual mean temperature is 27 c but may rise up to 38 c in dry seasons and may decrease down to 19 c in rainy seasons the original vegetation of the study area is characterized by a mosaic of forest and savannas but has mostly been replaced by secondary grasslands or savannas due to human intervention however isolated semi evergreen rain forest original vegetation which are mostly protected for religious reasons can still be found adjakidje 1984 adjanohoun 1989 houndagba 2015 the vegetation in urban areas has been removed because of buildings construction and town planning 2 2 surface hydrology the surface water body is characterized by two main streams ouémé and couffo streams two main rivers zou and sô rivers four lakes azili sele tanfè and hlan lakes several springs and brooks fig 1 the ouémé couffo and zou have their origin outside the study area in the northern crystalline region moniod 1973 le barbe et al 1993 and flow into the sedimentary basin fig 1 the zou river joins up with the ouémé stream around kpokissa township which is about 100 km north of the coast of benin these streams and rivers are of permanent flow fig 2b the minimum discharges base flow occur in dry seasons with about 2 m3 s 2 5 m3 s and 5 m3 s respectively for zou river at dome ouémé stream at ahlan and ouémé stream at bonou maximum discharge values are observed in rainy seasons with values of about 140 m3 s 850 m3 s and 850 m3 s respectively for zou river at dome ouémé stream at ahlan and ouémé stream at bonou because zou and ouémé merge upstream of bonou fig 1 it would be expected that the sum of the discharges of zou river at dome and ouémé at ahlan equals the discharge of ouémé at bonou this expectation is more or less met in dry seasons in rainy seasons this expectation is however not met probably because three lakes azili sele and tanfè are fed by the ouémé stream during the rainy seasons and these lakes disconnect from the ouémé stream in dry seasons as observed during field trips the sô river has its source in the lama depression within the study area but is fed by free artesian outflow since few decades the discharges of the sô river are less than 1 m3 s to about 140 m3 s respectively in dry and rainy seasons colombani et al 1972 recent discharge records for the sô river are unavailable and could not be plotted on fig 2 lake azili lake sele salzmann and hoelzmann 2005 and lake tanfè which are refilled periodically by the floods of ouémé stream empty progressively throughout the dry season some brooks such as lougbé and visso see fig 1 constitute a constant source of water to lake azili and lake sele respectively lake hlan adite et al 2013 sossou agbo 2013 is both refilled and drained by the sô river 2 3 geology and hydrogeology geologically the study area consists of sedimentary deposits that overlay the precambrian crystalline rocks granite quartzite and gneiss these deposits have a monoclinal structure and their thickness generally increases towards the southeast slansky 1962 houessou 1974 irb 1987 they consist of detrital formations sand gravel and clay sandstone marls and limestones in total eight stratigraphic units were identified in the whole coastal sedimentary basin and extend from the upper cretaceous turonian coniacian unit i to the quaternary unit viii these eight units are described by boukari and alassane 2007 and are summarised in table 1 it is worthwhile noting that among these eight units units v to vii are not part of the area of interest also unit viii is geographically restricted to areas close to rivers hence absent in the area where the cross section shown on fig 3 is cut see both figs 1 and 3 the area of interest contains three aquifers the turonian coniacian aquifer unit i the lower palaeocene aquifer unit iib and the quaternary aquifer unit viii separated from each other by clay and marls layers bouzid 1971 the most important aquifer in terms of extent and thickness is the turonian coniacian aquifer the lower palaeocene aquifer fig 1 is poorly present at depth as it is discontinuous within the clay and marl materials form the maastrichtian and the upper palaeocene deposits a simplified hydrogeological cross section fig 3 illustrates this discontinuity a fourth aquifer which is out of focus within this research the continental terminal aquifer units v to vii exists in the south of the study area on the allada and the sakete plateaus see details on fig 1 authors such as boukari 1998 alassane 2004 and alassane et al 2015 have provided detailed knowledge concerning the continental terminal aquifer the turonian coniacian aquifer consists predominantly of sand and secondary of gravel it outcrops in the northern region and becomes deeper in the south where it is confined by clay and marl materials fig 3 these clay and marl materials outcrop in the lama depression gomez 1979 and cause the direct infiltration from rainfall to be limited in this depression houndagba 2015 the depth to the turonian coniacian aquifer varies across the area so as its thickness values of transmissivity reported by bouzid 1971 and igip 1984 are in order of 200 to 750 m2 day based on groundwater pumping tests carried out in the t c aquifer in the northern region northern abomey plateau zagnanado plateau and northern kétou plateau hand dug wells of up to 70 m depth extend into this main aquifer in the south it is impossible to exploit the t c aquifer through hand dug wells due to the overlaying thick clayey materials and due to the artesian condition that prevails for this aquifer in the south hence only deep boreholes that exploit the t c aquifer are found in the south the lower palaeocene aquifer unit iib consists of limestone and is mostly discontinuous and enclosed within the clay and marl materials its thickness is usually negligible from few meters to about 20 to 30 m the quaternary aquifer is found near rivers and streams in the ouémé valley fig 1 it consists of alluvial deposits coarse and fine sands that alternate with silt and clay materials the thickness of the quaternary deposits increases gradually from north to south boukari 2002 the turonian coniacian aquifer is the one of main interest in this study 3 materials and methods to acquire groundwater level isotopes and water quality data both piezometric surveys and water sampling campaigns were conducted 3 1 piezometric surveys two main piezometric surveys were conducted the first in november 2015 rainy season and the second in february 2017 dry season the first piezometric survey included 560 wells see the electronic supplementary material and the second included 513 wells each of the piezometric surveys was undertaken over the period of a week to ensure groundwater levels were comparable static water levels swl also referred to as the depths to water table in fig 4 were measured in the turonian coniacian aquifer across the area of study from existing hand dug wells and boreholes with a groundwater level sounder type wl500 geographic coordinates of the measurement points were recorded with a gps type garmin gps 64s the altitudes land surface elevation of the measurement points were extracted from a digital elevation model dem fig 1 of the electronic sepplementary material using arcgis software groundwater heads were determined by subtracting the static water levels from the land surface elevation i e h i e l v s w l castany 1998 see fig 4 applying the equation h i z i h p i see castany 1998 post and asmuth 2013 to determine the groundwater heads is also feasible see the electronic supplementary material however in that case the mean depths of the wells screens have to be considered as illustrated on fig 4 the common reference datum used in this study is the mean sea level the determined groundwater heads data were used to produce piezometric contour maps for the turonian coniacian aquifer using surfer software 3 2 water sampling campaigns one major water sampling campaign was conducted in september 2015 both surface water from the above mentioned rivers and streams and groundwater from the existing hand dug wells boreholes and springs were collected the sampling points are shown on fig 1 prior to sampling boreholes and dug wells were purged with a pump until stabilization of ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature in average it took about 6 min to purge the wells to make sure that the ph the ec and the temperature are stabilized it is also appropriate to pump three well volumes prior to sampling the purging until stabilization method was preferred to pumping three well volumes because the purging until stabilization method does not require any further calculation well volume calculation on the field it was not necessary to filter groundwater samples however surface water samples were filtered when turbid water samples were collected and stored in clean high density polyethylene bottles bottles of 60 ml and bottles of 500 ml with poly seal caps bottles of 60 ml were used for stable isotopes 2h and 18o analysis and bottles of 500 ml were used for tritium 3h 14c and chemical analysis major elements c a 2 m g 2 n a k c l s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 tds and nitrate n o 3 measurements such as water temperature ph ec and total alkalinity as h c o 3 were carried out onsite a calibrated hi 9828 multiparameter were used to measure ph ec and water temperature alkalinity was measured through volumetric titration using chemical available field kits model al dt the garmin gps 64s was used to record the coordinates of the sampling points for surface water sampling samples were taken from flowing parts of the rivers or streams to avoid sampling river banks waters that may not be well mixed and show effects due to evaporation or pollution ryan et al 2005 stable isotopes tritium and chemical analysis were performed at the laboratory of radio analysis and environment sfax tunisia stable isotope ratio δ 2h and δ 18o analyses were performed by using the laser absorption spectrometry measurements lgr dlt 100 penna et al 2010 analyses are reported in per mil versus vsmow standard vienna standard mean oceanic water precision of measurement for the analysis for both δ 2h and δ 18o is indicated in table 2 tritium 3h analysis were performed using the electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation spectrometry taylor 1976 and results are expressed in t u tritium unit with a precision of 0 2 t u with a detection limit of 0 5 t u major elements except h c o 3 and c o 3 2 were analyzed by ion liquid chromatography ilc equipped with columns ic pak tm cm d for cations using edta and nitric acid as eluent anions were analyzed on a metrohm chromatograph equipped with columns ci super sep using phthalic acid and acetonitric as eluent the test precision of the instrument is about 2 the total dissolved solids tds was measured by evaporating 100 ml of water sample during 24 h at 105 c the samples were filtered prior to tds measurement the test of charge balance error freeze and cherry 1979 was run to check the quality of the chemical analyses the analytical error inferred from the balance between cations and anions did not exceed 5 which means that the chemical results from lab analyses are valid for interpretation in addition to the major water sampling campaign rain waters were collected monthly at bohicon and itta rainfall stations for stable isotopes and tritium analysis rainfall is the main input in terms of recharge to the turonian coniacian aquifer hence knowing the isotopic signatures in rainfall will allow comparisons with signatures in groundwaters across the area of interest stable isotopes and tritium concerning rain water sampled at these stations were measured and the data are available at the gnip iaea wmo 2017 also to allow relative age determination four groundwater samples were taken from turonian coniacian aquifer in its artesian part for 14c and 13c analysis analysis of 14c and 13c were performed at groningen university the netherlands analysis of 14c were done using the ams method saito kokubu et al 2015 and the results are expressed in pmc percent of modern carbon with a precision of 0 3 of pmc analysis of 13c were performed using a mass spectrometer with results expressed in values relative to pee dee belemnite pdb standard with a precision of 0 3 a combination of topographic data geological data and the groundwater flow directions derived from the piezometric and isotopic data were considered to construct the conceptual flow model using the surfer software 4 results and discussion 4 1 piezometry the results from the piezometric survey november 2015 are reported in table 1 of the electronic supplementary material esm and were used to draw the piezometric map of the turonian coniacian aquifer fig 5 the flow directions for the february 2017 piezometric survey is similar to the one of november 2015 and therefore not shown in this paper the piezometric map fig 5 shows that the groundwater flow direction differ from one plateau to the other this piezometric map highlights a total of three main recharge areas which are all located in the northern parts of the plateaus the first recharge area is located in the north west of the study area the northern abomey plateau from where groundwater flows generally towards the south east with a hydraulic gradient of about 1 3 in the north west this gradient is reduced in the south east more than ten times lower 0 08 compared to the north of the abomey plateau the second recharge area is located in the north central plateau the zagnanado plateau from where groundwater flows mainly towards the south with an average gradient of 1 however groundwater diverges locally from this central plateau towards the zou river and the ouémé stream valleys the third recharge zone is located in the north east of the study area the northern kétou plateau piezometric values are high about 200 m in this area and these values gradually decrease to about 20 m towards the south west the piezometric contour line of 20 m in the south and around the ouémé stream are higher than the ouémé stream stage less than 15 m this seems to indicate that groundwater from the turonian coniacian aquifer flows into the quaternary sediments however considering that the turonian coniacian aquifer is confined and artesian in this sector because of the presence of the thick clayey layer and that the groundwater from the turonian coniacian aquifer is poor in radioactive isotopes in this sector 3h 0 t u and 14c 8 of modern carbon see details in section 4 3 it is more likely that the turonian coniacian aquifer is disconnected from the quaternary sediments and surface waters in this sector three groundwater divides were derived from the flow pattern of this aquifer the first is in the west the second is in the east and the third is on the central plateau as shown on fig 5 4 2 groundwater flow evaluation using stable isotopes the stable isotopes 18o and 2h are part of water molecules and do not interact with the aquifer material sidle 1998 ette et al 2017 they are referred to as the dna of water molecules ette et al 2017 in some groundwater flow systems groundwater in recharge areas is more enriched in stable isotopes while in downstream areas it tends to be more depleted in stable isotopes rozanski 1985 iaea 2008 dhaoui et al 2016 sánchez murillo et al 2017 stable isotopes can help identify groundwater recharge zones montalvan et al 2017 hence stable isotopes have been used in this study to evaluate the groundwater flow pattern of the turonian coniacian aquifer derived from piezometric surveys the results from lab analysis chemical stable isotopes and tritium data performed on the water samples collected in the framework of this study are presented in table 2 we have reported all stable isotopes results from rainfall surface and groundwater on the δ 2h versus δ 18o diagram where we plotted the bohicon meteoric water line bmwl equation 2h 7 2 18o 9 the bmwl was derived from the monthly stable isotope data obtained from monthly rainfall samples analysis using the least square fit linear regression celle jeanton et al 2001 fig 6 on this diagram the weighted mean annual composition of rainfall in stable isotopes is presented see mwsi on fig 6 three main different groups a b and c can be distinguished on fig 6 one group group a characterized by the most depleted stable isotopes signatures which become more enriched as one moves to the second group group b and then to the third group group c the blue square mwsi represents the weighted mean annual composition of rainfall in stable isotopes belongs to group c which is a confirmation that the samples from group c are related to modern recharge group a fig 6 is composed only of samples from artesian wells samples 01 05 07 and 08 and shows the most depleted values in stable isotopes δ 18o ranging from 5 2 to 4 4 and δ 2h ranging from 27 to 23 this group corresponds to stable isotopes signatures of the turonian coniacian aquifer downstream in the vicinity of bonou afame and dasso townships see fig 1 for their geographic location group b fig 6 is composed of water samples from few 02 artesian wells samples 11 and 68 boreholes 12 60 67 and surface water 06 48 samples from hand dug wells are totally absent in group b this group b shows more enriched values in stable isotopes δ 18o and δ 2h ranging from 4 to 3 5 and from 22 to 17 respectively the absence of samples from hand dug wells in group b is an indication that the sampling locations corresponding to group b are not a predominant rainfall infiltration zone to the turonian coniacian aquifer however the presence of some samples from surface water in this group suggests that the corresponding sampling areas are intermediate between downstream zone of no or insignificant rainfall infiltration to the t c aquifer and upstream zone of predominant rainfall infiltration to the t c aquifer where surface groundwater interactions remain possible group c shows the most enriched stable isotopes composition δ 18o and δ 2h ranging from 3 5 to 2 2 and from 23 to 12 respectively all the samples from hand dug wells are presented in group c hence confirming that the t c aquifer gets recharged predominantly in the corresponding areas northern plateaus to this samples where the local population use hand dug wells to tap into the t c aquifer according to previous studies e g dhaoui et al 2016 ge et al 2016 only the most isotopically enriched points of the aquifer system could present a process of current or modern recharge so samples in group c most enriched samples being mostly geographically located in the northern plateaus and samples in group a most depleted being located towards the south validate the flow patterns indicated by the piezometry stable isotopes are in agreement with the piezometry so logically if the tds could be useful in developing conceptual flow models in any region characterized by scarce groundwater head data then the tds should follow or confirm as well the piezometry the validation of the piezometry by the tds is accessed in the next paragraphs the evaluation of the groundwater flow by stable isotopes performed above is in fact valid only if the stable isotopes compositions are not affected by human activities and by isotope fractionation to evaluate the effect of human activities on stable isotopes compositions we removed 24 samples that are contaminated samples with high c l and n o 3 contents i e sample no 1 2 4 6 15 21 22 24 25 27 30 39 41 43 45 49 51 52 54 and 58 details in section 4 4 this has led to fig 7 which displays the same trend in stable isotopes behaviour from the recharge to downstream areas this confirms that the interpretations derived from fig 6 remains valid isotopes compositions could be in some cases affected due to isotopes fractionation mook 2000 which can occur during evaporation prior to infiltration or after infiltration figs 6 and 7 show that some of the samples from the turonian coniacian aquifer slightly deviate from the local meteoric water line meaning that there may be some possible slight evaporation influence in some samples from the turonian coniacian aquifer mayr et al 2007 kpegli et al 2015 as such the evaluation of the groundwater flow by the stable isotopes needs therefore further validations as suggested by previous studies faye et al 2005 madioune et al 2014 the evaluation of the groundwater flow by stable isotopes is hence cross checked in the next paragraph using radioactive isotopes 4 3 groundwater flow evaluation using radioactive isotopes to validate the piezometry radioactive tracers tritium and carbone 14 were used fig 8 shows the tritium content versus δ 18o for rainfall surface water and groundwater sampled from hand dug wells boreholes natural springs and artesian wells actually young and old groundwater should be found respectively in the recharge area and the discharge area as groundwater moves from its recharge zone to its discharge one craig and thomas 2008 having an indication of the location of young and old groundwater in an aquifer system could help validate or invalidate the flow pattern suggested by the piezometry tritium 3h and radioactive carbon 14c are useful tracers in groundwater dating iaea 2008 and according to dhaoui et al 2016 groundwater samples with no tritium are groundwater that the residence time inside the aquifer is pre 1950 s in other words groundwater samples characterized by no tritium content are groundwater that got recharged prior to 1950 that is the time from which water infiltrates into the soil and got isolated from the atmosphere the behaviour of water samples collected in the study area is summarized on fig 8 from fig 8 it can be stated that waters presenting tritium contents greater than 1 t u tritium unit originate from recent precipitations see the limit of tritium content i e the red dash on fig 8 this statement is justified because no rainfall sample displays a tritium content below 1 t u hence groundwater samples that fall in the domain 1 as indicated on fig 8 are the most recent water in the turonian coniacian aquifer system domain 1 being the domain of precipitation and surface waters groundwater samples that fall in this domain 1 are only from hand dug wells boreholes and springs none of them is from artesian wells moreover they are geographically mostly located in the northern plateaus samples 23 26 27 28 29 33 40 42 43 44 49 50 52 53 and 54 this is an indication that the corresponding areas to this samples are predominant recharge zones of the turonian coniacian aquifer which is hence in agreement with the piezometry also surface water samples belong to domain 1 fig 8 and are totally absent from domain 3 domain of relatively older water with tritium content less than 0 12 t u the lowest concentration obtained it appears that samples from the artesian wells fall mainly in domain 3 fig 8 this suggests that surface water may communicate with the turonian coniacian aquifer in the northern around alahe and dovi townships see fig 1 for their geographic location but this communication is lost downstream around bonou dasso and massi townships as samples from artesian wells 05 07 08 and 63 in the vicinity of these townships are with low or no tritium content domain 2 is intermediate between recharge zones modern groundwaters and downstream areas relatively older water area tritium contents being high in the turonian coniacian aquifer in its recharge areas and low or absent downstream is a confirmation of the groundwater flow pattern indicated by the piezometry tritium contents hence appears to be in agreement with the piezometry previous investigations from dray et al 1989 and the present study allow comparison of 14c activities at one site sample 68 in a time scale of three decades comparison at this site see table 3 reveals a slight increase in radiocarbon content in the turonian coniacian aquifer system meaning that a shorter groundwater resident time occurs in some part of this aquifer system a shorter groundwater resident time implies that relatively younger water is found in some parts of the system nowadays compared to 1989 this is a translation that groundwater abstraction may it be natural free flows from artesian wells or not has caused younger water to be captured within three decades in at least part of the system according to al faitouri and sanford 2015 pumping out younger water could be strongly correlated to lowering of the potentiometric surface in contrary a decrease in radiocarbon activity i e pumping out older water could be observed in other systems celle jeanton et al 2009 which could mean that older groundwater have moved up gradient probably under the influence of over abstraction of the aquifer 14c activity measured within this study show a decreasing trend from site 8 to site 7 see fig 1 for geographic location of these sites an order of sites 8 7 is well in line with the flow directions indicated by the piezometry because site 8 and 7 are respectively around the contour lines 30 m and 20 m see figs 1 and 5 for details 14c activity being the lowest 8 59 pcm compare to others in table 3 around site 7 reflects the absence of modern water in the turonian coniacian aquifer in this sector hence confirms again that rivers in the vicinity of site 7 bonou township are totally disconnected from the turonian coniacian aquifer hence interaction between surface waters and the turonian coniacian aquifer should not be allowed in any groundwater flow modeling exercises in this sector 4 4 assessment of the suitability of hydrochemistry in revealing groundwater flow directions under groundwater head data scarce environments from the flow pattern indicated by the piezometry which is supported by stable and radioactive isotopes one would expect a gradual increase in groundwater mineralization from recharge to downstream areas in fact the tds of groundwater normally increases depending on several factors e g geology and resident time along a given groundwater flow path novel et al 2007 in the case of the present case study one would expect a gradual evolution of groundwater mineralization from mainly dug wells samples type towards artesian wells samples type dug wells being in the recharge area see fig 5 this expected mineralization trend is not observed fig 9 as some of the samples from artesian wells are of low mineralization compared to samples from dug wells this is further confirmed by fig 10 which shows that both recent and relatively older groundwater from the turonian coniacian aquifer are of low mineralization based on craig and thomas 2008 iaea 2008 dhaoui et al 2016 younger groundwater meaning groundwater samples mainly from hand dug wells were expected to display low tds values and were expected to fall in or around the circle of younger water see fig 10 likewise relatively older groundwater especially from artesian wells were expected to display higher tds values and fall in or around the circle old water see fig 10 fig 10 rather shows that many samples from artesian wells are characterized by low tds values just like groundwater samples from hand dug wells and rivers it hence appears that groundwater mineralization level does not help discriminate most recent and relatively older water in other words the level of groundwater mineralization does not help to clearly discriminate recharge areas from discharge areas which means that it does not always follow the piezometry apparently depending on the aquifer matrix which is mainly sandy in this case study the distance between the recharge and the downstream areas may be a key factor to allow discrimination between modern and relatively older groundwater when using the tds the implication of this is that the level of mineralization tds appears not to be a suitable candidate or indicator in developing conceptual groundwater flow models under groundwater head data scarce environments probably insufficient information on well structures may partly explain this finding in some hydrologic systems anthropogenic activities may influence the natural mineralization and may result in variations of natural nitrate and chloride ions apello and postma 2005 from the piper diagram of the study area fig 11 it appears that some extra chloride and nitrate from human activities at a local scale may be influencing the tds and these pollution indicators are more reflected in superficial zones less than 60 m depth as shown on fig 12 hence supporting that some extra anthropogenic sources of mainly nitrate could be present disregarding these possible extra ions sources from the natural groundwater mineralization i e tds n o 3 and c l see fig 13 has not however lead to different conclusions so definitely the tds can only mislead with regard to the development of conceptual groundwater flow models in sandy systems similar to the case of the turonian coniacian aquifer system this could be because the groundwater resident time in this type of aquifer is not long enough to increase the mineralization possibly the available information on wells structure may also have not been sufficient however within karstic systems novel et al 2007 where groundwater flows mainly along conduits or underground channels the mineralization can still provide relevant information regarding the main flow directions 4 5 groundwater conceptual flow model of the turonian coniacian aquifer the results from the present investigations hydrogeological and various isotopes as presented in previous sections of this paper has allowed to derive a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model which is summarized on the diagram fig 14 this derived conceptual groundwater flow model for the t c aquifer is in line with results from previous studies e g geological cross section presented in fig 3 irb 1987 and dray et al 1989 as indicated on the diagram fig 14 the t c aquifer directly overlays the crystalline bedrocks and outcrops in the northern research area this aquifer gets recharged by rainfall predominantly in the northern study area since in the northern part groundwater samples from the t c aquifer display isotopic signatures that are in range of those of rainfall samples from the northern recharge areas groundwater flows generally towards the south with local deviations to the south east or to the south west in the northern regions interactions between surface waters zou river and ouémé stream and the t c aquifer is effective fig 14 in the south the t c aquifer is overlaid by clay and marl materials that are sufficiently low permeable to confine this aquifer artesian condition prevails in this southern region for the t c aquifer where the samples from the t c aquifer are depleted in both stable and radioactive isotopes compared to the recharge areas direct recharge from rainfall in the southern region to this aquifer is hence not feasible also in this southern region the t c aquifer is hydraulically disconnected from the surface waters sô river and ouémé stream and the quaternary aquifer fig 14 in fact the clay and marl materials constitute a hydraulic barrier between these two any numerical model for flow and or transport modeling should be designed accordingly and treated as such no or only very limited leakage river infiltration could be allowed through these clay and marl materials the transition between the northern part of t c aquifer that is connected to the quaternary aquifer and surface waters and its southern part that is disconnected from them is gradual actually between the most enriched samples in isotopic contents that characterized the recharge area of the t c aquifer and the most depleted samples in downstream areas there appears a group of intermediate isotopic contents fig 5 that represents both surface water boreholes and hand dug wells this illustrates that the transition is not abrupt but more gradual no evaporation effect was observed in the t c aquifer flow system as confirmed by stable isotopes signatures finally three groundwater divides are detected in this aquifer system 5 conclusion in this study a combined piezometric hydrochemical and isotopic approach has been used to derive a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model for the turonian coniacian aquifer in southern benin also this approach has been used to access the ability of the groundwater mineralization as measured through the tds to develop conceptual groundwater flow models under scarce groundwater head data systems the obtained piezometric maps from the conducted hydrogeological investigations revealed three main groundwater flow directions in the turonian coniacian aquifer a main northwest to southeast flow direction is indicated in the western research area while in the eastern research area a northeast to southwest flow direction is denoted in the central research area a north to south flow direction is identified these results are well confirmed by isotopic techniques precisely stable isotopes displayed more enriched values in recharges areas and more depleted values in downstream areas indicated by the piezometry similarly higher tritium concentrations were observed in recharge areas and low tritium concentrations were found in downstream areas indicated by the piezometry in addition the 14c concentrations were shown to decrease from the mentioned recharged to downstream areas it means that results from hydrogeological and isotopic investigations coherently support each other hence a conceptual groundwater flow model for the turonian coniacian aquifer system has been derived however the groundwater mineralization as measured through the total dissolved solids tds does not support both the piezometric and isotopic results as expected as a result the tds is not a good candidate in developing conceptual groundwater flow models in environment characterized by scarce groundwater head data the conceptual groundwater flow model derived from this study is expected to serve as foundation for further research especially with respect to hydrogeological modeling exercises which are essential for the sustainable management and preservation of groundwater resources of this aquifer which is generally of good quality nowadays especially at depth beyond 60 m this paper has also provided insight on how the existence of interaction between surface and groundwater in hydrological systems could be detected using isotope techniques finally this study has demonstrated that it could be tricky to rely only on the tds in mainly sandy head data scarce systems when it comes to a conceptual understanding of the groundwater flow in general we recommend that new boreholes that will be drilled for drinking purposes be systematically designed to allow both groundwater abstraction and groundwater level measurements especially in rural areas this way an increase in the number of boreholes will be positively correlated with available head data and the possibility to acquire fresh head data when needed in the area that served as case study it is recommended that the turonian coniacian aquifer be periodically monitored especially in its artesian parts to track changes occurring over time delaration of interest none acknowledgements this research was carried out as part of a phd research and was funded by the international foundation for science ifs grant

8502,study region the turonian coniacian aquifer system in the north of the coastal sedimentary basin southern benin west africa study focus the turonian coniacian aquifer is the major aquifer in southern benin and is the main source of water supply for the population the pressure on groundwater resources from the turonian coniacian aquifer is increasing since few artesian wells tapping into this aquifer already show decrease in their yields preventing extinction of the artesian outflows requires as a first step a thorough understanding of the groundwater flow system groundwater recharge areas downstream areas and flow directions in this study a combined hydrogeological hydrochemical and isotopic approach was applied to understand the groundwater flow within this aquifer and to develop a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model new hydrological insights for the region the piezometric results indicated three main groundwater flow directions stable isotopes results confirmed the piezometry as the most depleted and enriched values in oxygen 18 and deuterium were found respectively in downstream areas southern region and in the recharge areas northern region indicated by the piezometry similarly higher tritium contents up to 3 5 tritium unit characterize recharge areas and low tritium contents 0 12 tritium unit were found in downstream areas the combination of these results with the geologic and topographic data led to a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model shown in this paper keywords hydrochemistry isotope ouémé piezometry turonian coniacian aquifer 1 introduction groundwater is one of the world s most important natural resources in several parts of the world it happens that this vital resource is threatened both quantitatively and qualitatively the example of the great artesian basin which underlies 23 of the australia continent powel at al 2015 where several springs have dried out and several artesian wells have stopped flowing is an illustration of severe threats that occur to groundwater resources several other authors e g idris 1996 powell and fensham 2015 roberts and mitchell 1987 have reported similar threats on groundwater resources in different parts of the world in benin especially in the coastal sedimentary basin groundwater is the major source of freshwater for the population the major aquifer in this basin the turonian coniacian aquifer is artesian in some parts of the basin where artesian wells keep discharging continuously enormous quantity of groundwater to the surface the artesian wells are free flowing because they are not pipped and capped however tapping and capping artesian wells help greatly to reduce water loss and hence aquifer drawdown it is known from the literature e g powell and fensham 2015 that in some systems artesian outflows turned out to considerably diminished some natural springs have totally dried out and numerous artesian wells have stopped flowing powell et al 2015 idris 1996 powell and fensham 2015 roberts and mitchell 1987 yermani et al 2003 currently in benin part of the local population finds the free artesian outflows beneficial because efforts to manually pump groundwater is not required however the other part of the population already express concerns about the sustainability of this groundwater resource personal communication with the local population and some artesian wells already show decrease in their yields so far no study has investigated the sustainability of this vital resource and therefore groundwater recharge abstractions rates and free artesian outflow rates required for a sustainable use of this resource remain completely unclear to prevent extinction or stoppage of free artesian outflows and drying out of natural springs it is wise to investigate and identify conditions recharge and abstractions that may cause extinction of free artesian outflows and drying out of natural springs once the recharge abstraction rates and free outflow conditions are known preventive actions could be taken in a short and long term arriving at identifying the conditions that may cause artesian wells outflows to stop and springs to dry out requires as a first step a thorough understanding of the groundwater flow system groundwater recharge areas groundwater discharge areas and flow directions however the main problem is that the groundwater head data which is required for the understanding of the groundwater flow and the development of conceptual groundwater flow models bredehoeft 2005 zheng and bennett 1995 kresic and mikszewski 2013 is often quite limited in many hydrological systems barthel 2014 candela et al 2013 carter et al 1994 refstegaard et al 2010 data related to groundwater systems are limited or absent as in ungauged basins due to their inaccessibility and large costs and huge time involved in long term experimental characterization and monitoring in some hydrological systems boreholes that could allow the measurements of groundwater levels gwl do exist but they were not designed to allow such measurements even though boreholes for drinking supply could well be designed to allow both groundwater extraction and measurements of gwl aranyossy 2007 only one gwl data that was recorded during drilling operations is available for those boreholes and data recorded during drilling operation may not be reliable for those boreholes that do not allow gwl measurement the groundwater mineralization as measured through the tds total dissolved solids could still be obtained as long as groundwater abstraction remain possible from those boreholes but this raises the following question can the tds reliably inform about groundwater flow directions and lead to the development of reliable conceptual groundwater flow models groundwater mineralization has been largely investigated e g verhagen 1995 moussa et al 2009 fadili et al 2015 dieng et al 2017 gning et al 2017 but its validity in helping develop coherent conceptual groundwater flow models is unclear to some extents stable isotopes boronina et al 2005 dhaoui et al 2016 and radioactive isotopes izbicki et al 1995 szabo et al 1996 though costly are proved to provide relevant information on groundwater ages directions of groundwater flow aquifer recharge and discharge zones hence isotopes piezometric and also geologic data are often used to construct conceptual groundwater flow models dassi and tarki 2014 pétré et al 2016 fernandes et al 2016 brikic et al 2016 bicalho et al 2017 madrala et al 2017 segadelli et al 2017 based on the knowledge that hydrochemical patterns are influenced by groundwater flow stuyfzand 1999 hussein 2004 novel et al 2007 and that high and low mineralization of groundwater are usually correlated to long and short resident time respectively wilson et al 1991 huneau et al 2007 we focus on accessing the reliability of the tds in the development of conceptual groundwater flow models so the main aim of this study is to develop a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model for the research area we use this case study to access whether the groundwater mineralization as measured through the tds is a relevant element to consider when it comes to developing conceptual flow models in scarce groundwater head data environments where tds data could still be obtained in that sense we firstly focus on both piezometric and isotopes data to develop a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model using as case study the turonian coniacian aquifer system in southern benin then we use data of tritium and 14cfrom the same case study to test the reliability of groundwater mineralization with respect to conceptual flow models development 2 study area 2 1 location climate and vegetation the study area fig 1 is geographically located between latitudes 6 45 n and 7 40 n and longitudes 1 55 e and 2 50 e and covers approximately 4600 km2 it is a part of the northern coastal sedimentary basin of benin republic boukari 2007 alassane et al 2015 and is composed mainly of 3 plateaus from west to east abomey zagnanado and kétou plateaus that are separated respectively by zou river and ouémé stream the ouémé valley and an east west belt known regionally as lama depression affaton et al 1985 amajor 1991 the study area is bordered in the north by the crystalline bedrock in the south by allada and sakete plateaus in the west by couffo stream and its eastern border corresponds to the limit between benin and nigeria republics fig 1 it is worthwhile noting that the kétou plateau extends to the south western nigeria abeokuta township where similar geological formations as found in benin are encountered affaton et al 1985 the topography in the study area varies from 1 to about 270 m a s l high altitude values are observed in the northern plateaus low altitude values are found in the ouémé valley and in the lama depression the study area belongs to the sub equatorial region with a bimodal rainfall distribution fig 2 a it is characterized by two rainy seasons a main rainy season from mid march to mid august and a short rainy season from mid september to november and two dry seasons a short dry season from mid august to mid september and a main dry season from december to mid march the mean annual rainfall recorded at bohicon meteorological station from 1922 to 2009 is 1197 mm with a potential evapotranspiration of about 1500 mm year achidi et al 2012 amoussou 2005 the relative humidity is high and is comprised between 65 and 90 the annual mean temperature is 27 c but may rise up to 38 c in dry seasons and may decrease down to 19 c in rainy seasons the original vegetation of the study area is characterized by a mosaic of forest and savannas but has mostly been replaced by secondary grasslands or savannas due to human intervention however isolated semi evergreen rain forest original vegetation which are mostly protected for religious reasons can still be found adjakidje 1984 adjanohoun 1989 houndagba 2015 the vegetation in urban areas has been removed because of buildings construction and town planning 2 2 surface hydrology the surface water body is characterized by two main streams ouémé and couffo streams two main rivers zou and sô rivers four lakes azili sele tanfè and hlan lakes several springs and brooks fig 1 the ouémé couffo and zou have their origin outside the study area in the northern crystalline region moniod 1973 le barbe et al 1993 and flow into the sedimentary basin fig 1 the zou river joins up with the ouémé stream around kpokissa township which is about 100 km north of the coast of benin these streams and rivers are of permanent flow fig 2b the minimum discharges base flow occur in dry seasons with about 2 m3 s 2 5 m3 s and 5 m3 s respectively for zou river at dome ouémé stream at ahlan and ouémé stream at bonou maximum discharge values are observed in rainy seasons with values of about 140 m3 s 850 m3 s and 850 m3 s respectively for zou river at dome ouémé stream at ahlan and ouémé stream at bonou because zou and ouémé merge upstream of bonou fig 1 it would be expected that the sum of the discharges of zou river at dome and ouémé at ahlan equals the discharge of ouémé at bonou this expectation is more or less met in dry seasons in rainy seasons this expectation is however not met probably because three lakes azili sele and tanfè are fed by the ouémé stream during the rainy seasons and these lakes disconnect from the ouémé stream in dry seasons as observed during field trips the sô river has its source in the lama depression within the study area but is fed by free artesian outflow since few decades the discharges of the sô river are less than 1 m3 s to about 140 m3 s respectively in dry and rainy seasons colombani et al 1972 recent discharge records for the sô river are unavailable and could not be plotted on fig 2 lake azili lake sele salzmann and hoelzmann 2005 and lake tanfè which are refilled periodically by the floods of ouémé stream empty progressively throughout the dry season some brooks such as lougbé and visso see fig 1 constitute a constant source of water to lake azili and lake sele respectively lake hlan adite et al 2013 sossou agbo 2013 is both refilled and drained by the sô river 2 3 geology and hydrogeology geologically the study area consists of sedimentary deposits that overlay the precambrian crystalline rocks granite quartzite and gneiss these deposits have a monoclinal structure and their thickness generally increases towards the southeast slansky 1962 houessou 1974 irb 1987 they consist of detrital formations sand gravel and clay sandstone marls and limestones in total eight stratigraphic units were identified in the whole coastal sedimentary basin and extend from the upper cretaceous turonian coniacian unit i to the quaternary unit viii these eight units are described by boukari and alassane 2007 and are summarised in table 1 it is worthwhile noting that among these eight units units v to vii are not part of the area of interest also unit viii is geographically restricted to areas close to rivers hence absent in the area where the cross section shown on fig 3 is cut see both figs 1 and 3 the area of interest contains three aquifers the turonian coniacian aquifer unit i the lower palaeocene aquifer unit iib and the quaternary aquifer unit viii separated from each other by clay and marls layers bouzid 1971 the most important aquifer in terms of extent and thickness is the turonian coniacian aquifer the lower palaeocene aquifer fig 1 is poorly present at depth as it is discontinuous within the clay and marl materials form the maastrichtian and the upper palaeocene deposits a simplified hydrogeological cross section fig 3 illustrates this discontinuity a fourth aquifer which is out of focus within this research the continental terminal aquifer units v to vii exists in the south of the study area on the allada and the sakete plateaus see details on fig 1 authors such as boukari 1998 alassane 2004 and alassane et al 2015 have provided detailed knowledge concerning the continental terminal aquifer the turonian coniacian aquifer consists predominantly of sand and secondary of gravel it outcrops in the northern region and becomes deeper in the south where it is confined by clay and marl materials fig 3 these clay and marl materials outcrop in the lama depression gomez 1979 and cause the direct infiltration from rainfall to be limited in this depression houndagba 2015 the depth to the turonian coniacian aquifer varies across the area so as its thickness values of transmissivity reported by bouzid 1971 and igip 1984 are in order of 200 to 750 m2 day based on groundwater pumping tests carried out in the t c aquifer in the northern region northern abomey plateau zagnanado plateau and northern kétou plateau hand dug wells of up to 70 m depth extend into this main aquifer in the south it is impossible to exploit the t c aquifer through hand dug wells due to the overlaying thick clayey materials and due to the artesian condition that prevails for this aquifer in the south hence only deep boreholes that exploit the t c aquifer are found in the south the lower palaeocene aquifer unit iib consists of limestone and is mostly discontinuous and enclosed within the clay and marl materials its thickness is usually negligible from few meters to about 20 to 30 m the quaternary aquifer is found near rivers and streams in the ouémé valley fig 1 it consists of alluvial deposits coarse and fine sands that alternate with silt and clay materials the thickness of the quaternary deposits increases gradually from north to south boukari 2002 the turonian coniacian aquifer is the one of main interest in this study 3 materials and methods to acquire groundwater level isotopes and water quality data both piezometric surveys and water sampling campaigns were conducted 3 1 piezometric surveys two main piezometric surveys were conducted the first in november 2015 rainy season and the second in february 2017 dry season the first piezometric survey included 560 wells see the electronic supplementary material and the second included 513 wells each of the piezometric surveys was undertaken over the period of a week to ensure groundwater levels were comparable static water levels swl also referred to as the depths to water table in fig 4 were measured in the turonian coniacian aquifer across the area of study from existing hand dug wells and boreholes with a groundwater level sounder type wl500 geographic coordinates of the measurement points were recorded with a gps type garmin gps 64s the altitudes land surface elevation of the measurement points were extracted from a digital elevation model dem fig 1 of the electronic sepplementary material using arcgis software groundwater heads were determined by subtracting the static water levels from the land surface elevation i e h i e l v s w l castany 1998 see fig 4 applying the equation h i z i h p i see castany 1998 post and asmuth 2013 to determine the groundwater heads is also feasible see the electronic supplementary material however in that case the mean depths of the wells screens have to be considered as illustrated on fig 4 the common reference datum used in this study is the mean sea level the determined groundwater heads data were used to produce piezometric contour maps for the turonian coniacian aquifer using surfer software 3 2 water sampling campaigns one major water sampling campaign was conducted in september 2015 both surface water from the above mentioned rivers and streams and groundwater from the existing hand dug wells boreholes and springs were collected the sampling points are shown on fig 1 prior to sampling boreholes and dug wells were purged with a pump until stabilization of ph electrical conductivity ec and temperature in average it took about 6 min to purge the wells to make sure that the ph the ec and the temperature are stabilized it is also appropriate to pump three well volumes prior to sampling the purging until stabilization method was preferred to pumping three well volumes because the purging until stabilization method does not require any further calculation well volume calculation on the field it was not necessary to filter groundwater samples however surface water samples were filtered when turbid water samples were collected and stored in clean high density polyethylene bottles bottles of 60 ml and bottles of 500 ml with poly seal caps bottles of 60 ml were used for stable isotopes 2h and 18o analysis and bottles of 500 ml were used for tritium 3h 14c and chemical analysis major elements c a 2 m g 2 n a k c l s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 2 tds and nitrate n o 3 measurements such as water temperature ph ec and total alkalinity as h c o 3 were carried out onsite a calibrated hi 9828 multiparameter were used to measure ph ec and water temperature alkalinity was measured through volumetric titration using chemical available field kits model al dt the garmin gps 64s was used to record the coordinates of the sampling points for surface water sampling samples were taken from flowing parts of the rivers or streams to avoid sampling river banks waters that may not be well mixed and show effects due to evaporation or pollution ryan et al 2005 stable isotopes tritium and chemical analysis were performed at the laboratory of radio analysis and environment sfax tunisia stable isotope ratio δ 2h and δ 18o analyses were performed by using the laser absorption spectrometry measurements lgr dlt 100 penna et al 2010 analyses are reported in per mil versus vsmow standard vienna standard mean oceanic water precision of measurement for the analysis for both δ 2h and δ 18o is indicated in table 2 tritium 3h analysis were performed using the electrolytic enrichment and liquid scintillation spectrometry taylor 1976 and results are expressed in t u tritium unit with a precision of 0 2 t u with a detection limit of 0 5 t u major elements except h c o 3 and c o 3 2 were analyzed by ion liquid chromatography ilc equipped with columns ic pak tm cm d for cations using edta and nitric acid as eluent anions were analyzed on a metrohm chromatograph equipped with columns ci super sep using phthalic acid and acetonitric as eluent the test precision of the instrument is about 2 the total dissolved solids tds was measured by evaporating 100 ml of water sample during 24 h at 105 c the samples were filtered prior to tds measurement the test of charge balance error freeze and cherry 1979 was run to check the quality of the chemical analyses the analytical error inferred from the balance between cations and anions did not exceed 5 which means that the chemical results from lab analyses are valid for interpretation in addition to the major water sampling campaign rain waters were collected monthly at bohicon and itta rainfall stations for stable isotopes and tritium analysis rainfall is the main input in terms of recharge to the turonian coniacian aquifer hence knowing the isotopic signatures in rainfall will allow comparisons with signatures in groundwaters across the area of interest stable isotopes and tritium concerning rain water sampled at these stations were measured and the data are available at the gnip iaea wmo 2017 also to allow relative age determination four groundwater samples were taken from turonian coniacian aquifer in its artesian part for 14c and 13c analysis analysis of 14c and 13c were performed at groningen university the netherlands analysis of 14c were done using the ams method saito kokubu et al 2015 and the results are expressed in pmc percent of modern carbon with a precision of 0 3 of pmc analysis of 13c were performed using a mass spectrometer with results expressed in values relative to pee dee belemnite pdb standard with a precision of 0 3 a combination of topographic data geological data and the groundwater flow directions derived from the piezometric and isotopic data were considered to construct the conceptual flow model using the surfer software 4 results and discussion 4 1 piezometry the results from the piezometric survey november 2015 are reported in table 1 of the electronic supplementary material esm and were used to draw the piezometric map of the turonian coniacian aquifer fig 5 the flow directions for the february 2017 piezometric survey is similar to the one of november 2015 and therefore not shown in this paper the piezometric map fig 5 shows that the groundwater flow direction differ from one plateau to the other this piezometric map highlights a total of three main recharge areas which are all located in the northern parts of the plateaus the first recharge area is located in the north west of the study area the northern abomey plateau from where groundwater flows generally towards the south east with a hydraulic gradient of about 1 3 in the north west this gradient is reduced in the south east more than ten times lower 0 08 compared to the north of the abomey plateau the second recharge area is located in the north central plateau the zagnanado plateau from where groundwater flows mainly towards the south with an average gradient of 1 however groundwater diverges locally from this central plateau towards the zou river and the ouémé stream valleys the third recharge zone is located in the north east of the study area the northern kétou plateau piezometric values are high about 200 m in this area and these values gradually decrease to about 20 m towards the south west the piezometric contour line of 20 m in the south and around the ouémé stream are higher than the ouémé stream stage less than 15 m this seems to indicate that groundwater from the turonian coniacian aquifer flows into the quaternary sediments however considering that the turonian coniacian aquifer is confined and artesian in this sector because of the presence of the thick clayey layer and that the groundwater from the turonian coniacian aquifer is poor in radioactive isotopes in this sector 3h 0 t u and 14c 8 of modern carbon see details in section 4 3 it is more likely that the turonian coniacian aquifer is disconnected from the quaternary sediments and surface waters in this sector three groundwater divides were derived from the flow pattern of this aquifer the first is in the west the second is in the east and the third is on the central plateau as shown on fig 5 4 2 groundwater flow evaluation using stable isotopes the stable isotopes 18o and 2h are part of water molecules and do not interact with the aquifer material sidle 1998 ette et al 2017 they are referred to as the dna of water molecules ette et al 2017 in some groundwater flow systems groundwater in recharge areas is more enriched in stable isotopes while in downstream areas it tends to be more depleted in stable isotopes rozanski 1985 iaea 2008 dhaoui et al 2016 sánchez murillo et al 2017 stable isotopes can help identify groundwater recharge zones montalvan et al 2017 hence stable isotopes have been used in this study to evaluate the groundwater flow pattern of the turonian coniacian aquifer derived from piezometric surveys the results from lab analysis chemical stable isotopes and tritium data performed on the water samples collected in the framework of this study are presented in table 2 we have reported all stable isotopes results from rainfall surface and groundwater on the δ 2h versus δ 18o diagram where we plotted the bohicon meteoric water line bmwl equation 2h 7 2 18o 9 the bmwl was derived from the monthly stable isotope data obtained from monthly rainfall samples analysis using the least square fit linear regression celle jeanton et al 2001 fig 6 on this diagram the weighted mean annual composition of rainfall in stable isotopes is presented see mwsi on fig 6 three main different groups a b and c can be distinguished on fig 6 one group group a characterized by the most depleted stable isotopes signatures which become more enriched as one moves to the second group group b and then to the third group group c the blue square mwsi represents the weighted mean annual composition of rainfall in stable isotopes belongs to group c which is a confirmation that the samples from group c are related to modern recharge group a fig 6 is composed only of samples from artesian wells samples 01 05 07 and 08 and shows the most depleted values in stable isotopes δ 18o ranging from 5 2 to 4 4 and δ 2h ranging from 27 to 23 this group corresponds to stable isotopes signatures of the turonian coniacian aquifer downstream in the vicinity of bonou afame and dasso townships see fig 1 for their geographic location group b fig 6 is composed of water samples from few 02 artesian wells samples 11 and 68 boreholes 12 60 67 and surface water 06 48 samples from hand dug wells are totally absent in group b this group b shows more enriched values in stable isotopes δ 18o and δ 2h ranging from 4 to 3 5 and from 22 to 17 respectively the absence of samples from hand dug wells in group b is an indication that the sampling locations corresponding to group b are not a predominant rainfall infiltration zone to the turonian coniacian aquifer however the presence of some samples from surface water in this group suggests that the corresponding sampling areas are intermediate between downstream zone of no or insignificant rainfall infiltration to the t c aquifer and upstream zone of predominant rainfall infiltration to the t c aquifer where surface groundwater interactions remain possible group c shows the most enriched stable isotopes composition δ 18o and δ 2h ranging from 3 5 to 2 2 and from 23 to 12 respectively all the samples from hand dug wells are presented in group c hence confirming that the t c aquifer gets recharged predominantly in the corresponding areas northern plateaus to this samples where the local population use hand dug wells to tap into the t c aquifer according to previous studies e g dhaoui et al 2016 ge et al 2016 only the most isotopically enriched points of the aquifer system could present a process of current or modern recharge so samples in group c most enriched samples being mostly geographically located in the northern plateaus and samples in group a most depleted being located towards the south validate the flow patterns indicated by the piezometry stable isotopes are in agreement with the piezometry so logically if the tds could be useful in developing conceptual flow models in any region characterized by scarce groundwater head data then the tds should follow or confirm as well the piezometry the validation of the piezometry by the tds is accessed in the next paragraphs the evaluation of the groundwater flow by stable isotopes performed above is in fact valid only if the stable isotopes compositions are not affected by human activities and by isotope fractionation to evaluate the effect of human activities on stable isotopes compositions we removed 24 samples that are contaminated samples with high c l and n o 3 contents i e sample no 1 2 4 6 15 21 22 24 25 27 30 39 41 43 45 49 51 52 54 and 58 details in section 4 4 this has led to fig 7 which displays the same trend in stable isotopes behaviour from the recharge to downstream areas this confirms that the interpretations derived from fig 6 remains valid isotopes compositions could be in some cases affected due to isotopes fractionation mook 2000 which can occur during evaporation prior to infiltration or after infiltration figs 6 and 7 show that some of the samples from the turonian coniacian aquifer slightly deviate from the local meteoric water line meaning that there may be some possible slight evaporation influence in some samples from the turonian coniacian aquifer mayr et al 2007 kpegli et al 2015 as such the evaluation of the groundwater flow by the stable isotopes needs therefore further validations as suggested by previous studies faye et al 2005 madioune et al 2014 the evaluation of the groundwater flow by stable isotopes is hence cross checked in the next paragraph using radioactive isotopes 4 3 groundwater flow evaluation using radioactive isotopes to validate the piezometry radioactive tracers tritium and carbone 14 were used fig 8 shows the tritium content versus δ 18o for rainfall surface water and groundwater sampled from hand dug wells boreholes natural springs and artesian wells actually young and old groundwater should be found respectively in the recharge area and the discharge area as groundwater moves from its recharge zone to its discharge one craig and thomas 2008 having an indication of the location of young and old groundwater in an aquifer system could help validate or invalidate the flow pattern suggested by the piezometry tritium 3h and radioactive carbon 14c are useful tracers in groundwater dating iaea 2008 and according to dhaoui et al 2016 groundwater samples with no tritium are groundwater that the residence time inside the aquifer is pre 1950 s in other words groundwater samples characterized by no tritium content are groundwater that got recharged prior to 1950 that is the time from which water infiltrates into the soil and got isolated from the atmosphere the behaviour of water samples collected in the study area is summarized on fig 8 from fig 8 it can be stated that waters presenting tritium contents greater than 1 t u tritium unit originate from recent precipitations see the limit of tritium content i e the red dash on fig 8 this statement is justified because no rainfall sample displays a tritium content below 1 t u hence groundwater samples that fall in the domain 1 as indicated on fig 8 are the most recent water in the turonian coniacian aquifer system domain 1 being the domain of precipitation and surface waters groundwater samples that fall in this domain 1 are only from hand dug wells boreholes and springs none of them is from artesian wells moreover they are geographically mostly located in the northern plateaus samples 23 26 27 28 29 33 40 42 43 44 49 50 52 53 and 54 this is an indication that the corresponding areas to this samples are predominant recharge zones of the turonian coniacian aquifer which is hence in agreement with the piezometry also surface water samples belong to domain 1 fig 8 and are totally absent from domain 3 domain of relatively older water with tritium content less than 0 12 t u the lowest concentration obtained it appears that samples from the artesian wells fall mainly in domain 3 fig 8 this suggests that surface water may communicate with the turonian coniacian aquifer in the northern around alahe and dovi townships see fig 1 for their geographic location but this communication is lost downstream around bonou dasso and massi townships as samples from artesian wells 05 07 08 and 63 in the vicinity of these townships are with low or no tritium content domain 2 is intermediate between recharge zones modern groundwaters and downstream areas relatively older water area tritium contents being high in the turonian coniacian aquifer in its recharge areas and low or absent downstream is a confirmation of the groundwater flow pattern indicated by the piezometry tritium contents hence appears to be in agreement with the piezometry previous investigations from dray et al 1989 and the present study allow comparison of 14c activities at one site sample 68 in a time scale of three decades comparison at this site see table 3 reveals a slight increase in radiocarbon content in the turonian coniacian aquifer system meaning that a shorter groundwater resident time occurs in some part of this aquifer system a shorter groundwater resident time implies that relatively younger water is found in some parts of the system nowadays compared to 1989 this is a translation that groundwater abstraction may it be natural free flows from artesian wells or not has caused younger water to be captured within three decades in at least part of the system according to al faitouri and sanford 2015 pumping out younger water could be strongly correlated to lowering of the potentiometric surface in contrary a decrease in radiocarbon activity i e pumping out older water could be observed in other systems celle jeanton et al 2009 which could mean that older groundwater have moved up gradient probably under the influence of over abstraction of the aquifer 14c activity measured within this study show a decreasing trend from site 8 to site 7 see fig 1 for geographic location of these sites an order of sites 8 7 is well in line with the flow directions indicated by the piezometry because site 8 and 7 are respectively around the contour lines 30 m and 20 m see figs 1 and 5 for details 14c activity being the lowest 8 59 pcm compare to others in table 3 around site 7 reflects the absence of modern water in the turonian coniacian aquifer in this sector hence confirms again that rivers in the vicinity of site 7 bonou township are totally disconnected from the turonian coniacian aquifer hence interaction between surface waters and the turonian coniacian aquifer should not be allowed in any groundwater flow modeling exercises in this sector 4 4 assessment of the suitability of hydrochemistry in revealing groundwater flow directions under groundwater head data scarce environments from the flow pattern indicated by the piezometry which is supported by stable and radioactive isotopes one would expect a gradual increase in groundwater mineralization from recharge to downstream areas in fact the tds of groundwater normally increases depending on several factors e g geology and resident time along a given groundwater flow path novel et al 2007 in the case of the present case study one would expect a gradual evolution of groundwater mineralization from mainly dug wells samples type towards artesian wells samples type dug wells being in the recharge area see fig 5 this expected mineralization trend is not observed fig 9 as some of the samples from artesian wells are of low mineralization compared to samples from dug wells this is further confirmed by fig 10 which shows that both recent and relatively older groundwater from the turonian coniacian aquifer are of low mineralization based on craig and thomas 2008 iaea 2008 dhaoui et al 2016 younger groundwater meaning groundwater samples mainly from hand dug wells were expected to display low tds values and were expected to fall in or around the circle of younger water see fig 10 likewise relatively older groundwater especially from artesian wells were expected to display higher tds values and fall in or around the circle old water see fig 10 fig 10 rather shows that many samples from artesian wells are characterized by low tds values just like groundwater samples from hand dug wells and rivers it hence appears that groundwater mineralization level does not help discriminate most recent and relatively older water in other words the level of groundwater mineralization does not help to clearly discriminate recharge areas from discharge areas which means that it does not always follow the piezometry apparently depending on the aquifer matrix which is mainly sandy in this case study the distance between the recharge and the downstream areas may be a key factor to allow discrimination between modern and relatively older groundwater when using the tds the implication of this is that the level of mineralization tds appears not to be a suitable candidate or indicator in developing conceptual groundwater flow models under groundwater head data scarce environments probably insufficient information on well structures may partly explain this finding in some hydrologic systems anthropogenic activities may influence the natural mineralization and may result in variations of natural nitrate and chloride ions apello and postma 2005 from the piper diagram of the study area fig 11 it appears that some extra chloride and nitrate from human activities at a local scale may be influencing the tds and these pollution indicators are more reflected in superficial zones less than 60 m depth as shown on fig 12 hence supporting that some extra anthropogenic sources of mainly nitrate could be present disregarding these possible extra ions sources from the natural groundwater mineralization i e tds n o 3 and c l see fig 13 has not however lead to different conclusions so definitely the tds can only mislead with regard to the development of conceptual groundwater flow models in sandy systems similar to the case of the turonian coniacian aquifer system this could be because the groundwater resident time in this type of aquifer is not long enough to increase the mineralization possibly the available information on wells structure may also have not been sufficient however within karstic systems novel et al 2007 where groundwater flows mainly along conduits or underground channels the mineralization can still provide relevant information regarding the main flow directions 4 5 groundwater conceptual flow model of the turonian coniacian aquifer the results from the present investigations hydrogeological and various isotopes as presented in previous sections of this paper has allowed to derive a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model which is summarized on the diagram fig 14 this derived conceptual groundwater flow model for the t c aquifer is in line with results from previous studies e g geological cross section presented in fig 3 irb 1987 and dray et al 1989 as indicated on the diagram fig 14 the t c aquifer directly overlays the crystalline bedrocks and outcrops in the northern research area this aquifer gets recharged by rainfall predominantly in the northern study area since in the northern part groundwater samples from the t c aquifer display isotopic signatures that are in range of those of rainfall samples from the northern recharge areas groundwater flows generally towards the south with local deviations to the south east or to the south west in the northern regions interactions between surface waters zou river and ouémé stream and the t c aquifer is effective fig 14 in the south the t c aquifer is overlaid by clay and marl materials that are sufficiently low permeable to confine this aquifer artesian condition prevails in this southern region for the t c aquifer where the samples from the t c aquifer are depleted in both stable and radioactive isotopes compared to the recharge areas direct recharge from rainfall in the southern region to this aquifer is hence not feasible also in this southern region the t c aquifer is hydraulically disconnected from the surface waters sô river and ouémé stream and the quaternary aquifer fig 14 in fact the clay and marl materials constitute a hydraulic barrier between these two any numerical model for flow and or transport modeling should be designed accordingly and treated as such no or only very limited leakage river infiltration could be allowed through these clay and marl materials the transition between the northern part of t c aquifer that is connected to the quaternary aquifer and surface waters and its southern part that is disconnected from them is gradual actually between the most enriched samples in isotopic contents that characterized the recharge area of the t c aquifer and the most depleted samples in downstream areas there appears a group of intermediate isotopic contents fig 5 that represents both surface water boreholes and hand dug wells this illustrates that the transition is not abrupt but more gradual no evaporation effect was observed in the t c aquifer flow system as confirmed by stable isotopes signatures finally three groundwater divides are detected in this aquifer system 5 conclusion in this study a combined piezometric hydrochemical and isotopic approach has been used to derive a coherent conceptual groundwater flow model for the turonian coniacian aquifer in southern benin also this approach has been used to access the ability of the groundwater mineralization as measured through the tds to develop conceptual groundwater flow models under scarce groundwater head data systems the obtained piezometric maps from the conducted hydrogeological investigations revealed three main groundwater flow directions in the turonian coniacian aquifer a main northwest to southeast flow direction is indicated in the western research area while in the eastern research area a northeast to southwest flow direction is denoted in the central research area a north to south flow direction is identified these results are well confirmed by isotopic techniques precisely stable isotopes displayed more enriched values in recharges areas and more depleted values in downstream areas indicated by the piezometry similarly higher tritium concentrations were observed in recharge areas and low tritium concentrations were found in downstream areas indicated by the piezometry in addition the 14c concentrations were shown to decrease from the mentioned recharged to downstream areas it means that results from hydrogeological and isotopic investigations coherently support each other hence a conceptual groundwater flow model for the turonian coniacian aquifer system has been derived however the groundwater mineralization as measured through the total dissolved solids tds does not support both the piezometric and isotopic results as expected as a result the tds is not a good candidate in developing conceptual groundwater flow models in environment characterized by scarce groundwater head data the conceptual groundwater flow model derived from this study is expected to serve as foundation for further research especially with respect to hydrogeological modeling exercises which are essential for the sustainable management and preservation of groundwater resources of this aquifer which is generally of good quality nowadays especially at depth beyond 60 m this paper has also provided insight on how the existence of interaction between surface and groundwater in hydrological systems could be detected using isotope techniques finally this study has demonstrated that it could be tricky to rely only on the tds in mainly sandy head data scarce systems when it comes to a conceptual understanding of the groundwater flow in general we recommend that new boreholes that will be drilled for drinking purposes be systematically designed to allow both groundwater abstraction and groundwater level measurements especially in rural areas this way an increase in the number of boreholes will be positively correlated with available head data and the possibility to acquire fresh head data when needed in the area that served as case study it is recommended that the turonian coniacian aquifer be periodically monitored especially in its artesian parts to track changes occurring over time delaration of interest none acknowledgements this research was carried out as part of a phd research and was funded by the international foundation for science ifs grant

8503,study region the swat model was used to estimate the combined effects of changing land cover climate and clean air act caaa related atmospheric nitrogen n deposition to watershed nitrogen fate and transport for two watersheds in north carolina usa study focus two different model simulation scenarios were applied one included caaa related atmospheric n deposition climate and land cover caad c l and the other only included caaa related n deposition caad in simulation new hydrological insights for the region results show both scenarios generated overall decreasing trends for nearly all n outputs between 2010 and 2070 which resulted primarily from caaa related reductions in oxidized n deposition in both watersheds including climate and land cover change in simulation resulted in a relative 30 higher no3 load 30 higher denitrification 10 higher organic n load and a 20 smaller level of plant n uptake in year 2070 compared to not including climate and landcover changes in simulation the increases in n transport for both watersheds indicates the combined impacts from climate and land cover change may offset benefits provided by the caaa regulations however future no3 loads for the little river watershed were small relative to current n loading rates conversely the increasing no3 and organic n loads for the nearby nahunta watershed were significant compared to current rates demonstrating that watershed nutrient responses to climate and land cover changes may vary significantly over relatively small spatial scales keywords gcm climate change nitrogen land

significant disruptions from climate change of particular concern are impacts to ecosystem function and expansion of anoxic regions in oceans that is further confounded by uncertainties inprojected climate change showstack 2014 currently there is a relatively large literature base concerning impacts of climate and land cover change on watershed hydrology and water supply however water quality and upland biogeochemical responses have been studied much less in this context tu 2009 han et al 2009 kundzewicz 2010 park et al 2010 2011 dayyani et al 2012 chiang et al 2012 johnson et al 2012 van

ecosystem damage associated with low ph acid deposition in the eastern us and eastern canada butler et al 2001 investigations combining climate land cover and atmospheric nitrogen deposition change into one modeling framework to evaluate long term projections in ecosystem nutrient dynamics are limited in number and scope civerolo et al 2008 cambell et al 2009 pan et al 2009 shi et al 2011 bussi et al 2016 largely because of difficulties in linking various data sources and biogeochemical modeling components climate land cover use and atmospheric deposition represent primary factors affecting global water quality and nutrient balance williamson et al 2008 park et al 2010 churkina et al 2010 therefore modeling investigations including these factors could provide a comprehensive evaluation of the broad spectrum of global influence which can lead to more accurate predictions of water quality and better management of natural resources a previous study by this research group showed that the decrease in caaa related atmospheric nitrogen deposition from 1990 to 2010 over the neuse river basin region correlates with a decrease in nitrogen discharges from the little river and nahunta watersheds gabriel et al 2014b in a separate climate and land cover change investigation gabriel et al 2016 separately tested the influence of climate and land cover changes to determine the relative sensitivity of climate and land cover on nitrogen discharges for years 2010 2070 they showed nitrogen watershed discharges increase with increasing ambient co2 decrease with land cover urbanization and have a mixed response to precipitation and ambient temperature fluctuations this study also showed nitrogen watershed discharges were much more sensitive to the combined effects of precipitation and temperature than co2 and land cover changes the purpose of the study presented here is to further build this recent work by gabriel et al by combining climate land cover and caaa related changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition into one modeling framework to reveal the combined influence of all three on nitrogen fate and transport for these in these two watersheds little river and nahunta in north carolina usa we also ran a series of simulations that do not contain climate and land cover changes only caaa related changes in atmospheric deposition were included this was completed to determine the relative influence of climate and land cover changes on the system because over the long term the benefits of caaa regulations on nitrogen discharges may be offset or further enhanced with the advancement of climate and land cover changes civerolo et al 2008 for this study we once again used the soil and water assessment tool swat watershed model for all watershed simulations and extracted output data for nitrogen no3 and organic nitrogen stream river discharge upland denitrification and plant nitrogen uptake we chose nitrogen discharge denitrification and plant nitrogen uptake as the response variables because each are primary pathways for watershed nitrogen removal nitrogen discharges are a final product of the interaction between upland biogeochemistry atmosphere surface exchange hydrology land cover change land management practices and are the focus of many pollution abatement programs e g total maximum daily loads denitrification is a difficult process to experimentally measure as it occurs in small anaerobic pockets in soil and depends on no3 availability carbon availability temperature and substrate composition donner et al 2004 and can vary dramatically with climate variation groffman et al 2009 therefore model simulations that provide estimates of denitrification including plant uptake are particularly valuable the climate data used in this study involves ambient co2 precipitation and temperature co2 data were obtained from estimates determined by the international panel on climate change ipcc and future estimates for precipitation and temperature were obtained from two statistically downscaled global circulation models gcms land cover change predictions were obtained from the us environmental protection agencies usepa integrated climate and land use change iclus project and the usepa s community multi scale air quality cmaq model was used to obtain future estimates for atmospheric nitrogen deposition the study presented here is essentially a single scope scenario analysis since we consider one atmospheric deposition projection scenario beyond 2010 one climate and one land use land cover change scenario a2 business as usual scenario therefore the results presented are one of many possible future outcomes however we do examine two extreme climate scenarios wet cold and dry warm including the predominant projected land cover conversion agricultural and forested to urban for the studied region the novelty of this study partly lies in the exercise of linking three complex datasets into a swat model framework climate land cover and caaa related atmospheric deposition we rely on the findings discussed in gabriel et al 2014a 2014b 2016 to dissect and analyze the modeling results presented in this manuscript part of the motivation for developing these past studies was to build a knowledge base and an appropriate modeling platform in order to evaluate the combined effects from changing climate

et al 2010 johnson et al 2012 to be consistent with co2 projections we considered a single future land cover land use change scenario representative of the ipcc a2 greenhouse emission storyline iclus data were separately obtained for both watersheds iclus projects these watersheds will undergo substantial conversion to urban cover according to the a2 storyline by 2030 iclus projects 69 of the little river watershed and 22 of the nahunta watershed will have converted to urban cover to incorporate projected land cover changes we modified the reference land cover areas provided by the nlcd files relative to iclus projections see gabriel et al 2016 for more information 3 2 2 co2 future projections for ambient co2 were obtained from estimates provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 gabriel et al 2016 ambient co2 an important driver of climate change was included in the assessment because of its direct impacts to water balance and vegetation growth in the swat model as in any natural system the projected co2 levels used here are representative of the a2 greenhouse gas storyline which assumes a heterogeneous world of self reliance and preservation of local identity high energy use medium to high rates of land cover change and fertility patterns across regions that converge very slowly resulting in a continuously increasing global population the a2 storyline is commonly referred to as a business as usual case since it reflects socio economic and industrial emissions conditions comparable to the current time period intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 the simulated response of water quality quantity to climate and land use change depends heavily on the ipcc storyline used in simulation wilson and weng 2011 therefore results for this research are only relevant to future conditions that reflect the a2 storyline for the reference co2 condition a constant value of 380 ppm current conditions was used which represents current global conditions in this study potential evapotranspiration pet was determined using the penman monteith equation where co2 directly affects pet and subsequently et through modification of leaf stomatal conductance and the leaf area index lai et is a primary determinant for surface runoff in swat neitsch et al 2005 3 2 3 precipitation and ambient temperature model projections for precipitation and ambient temperature were based on bias corrected and statistically downscaled data from the echo hamburg atmosphere ocean coupled circulation model and ccsm3 community climate system model models these data were obtained from the 12 km conus daily downscaled climate projections developed by katherine hayhoe and others at the u s geological survey see usgs data portal at www cida usgs gov climate gdp we chose the echo and ccsm3 cgms because they present climactic contrasts for the north and south carolina region conrads et al 2012 echo predicts drier warmer conditions and ccsm3 predicts wetter cooler conditions see gabriel et al 2016 similarly to the co2 and land cover criteria echo and ccsm3 data predictions are representative of the a2 greenhouse emission storyline see section 3 2 4 for a description on how reference precipitation and temperature data were developed even though ambient temperature has a major impact on all ecohydrologic processes namely evapotranspiration chemical reaction kinetics and microbial mediated processes whitehead and crossman 2012 precipitation and temperature were combined as one treatment because in a previous study by these authors ambient temperature had minor impacts on nitrogen discharge compared to precipitation for these watersheds gabriel et al 2014a 3 2 4 reference data development for precipitation and temperature reference data was developed for precipitation and temperature as was done for co2 and land cover the reference precipitation and temperature data sets were developed by de trending creating zero slopes gcm data for gcm precipitation there were no long term daily trends but there were trends for individual months over the 60 year period e g all januaries from 2005 to 2070 see section 3 2 3 reference precipitation data was developed by subtracting the product of monthly slopes and number of years from the daily data eq 1 this de trended increasing and decreasing monthly slopes for daily temperature eq 2 both data sets showed statistically significantly p 0 001 positive increases and were de trended to create zero slopes this was done for both daily minimum and maximum temperature data gcm in these equations refers to echo and ccsm3 since we developed separate reference data for both models 1

used to obtain monthly atmospheric nitrogen deposition data byun and schere 2006 u s environmental protection agency usepa 2012a 2012b cmaq is a publicly available peer reviewed state of the science model that simulates multiple chemical and physical processes important to understanding atmospheric trace gas transformations and distributions the atmospheric nitrogen deposition data obtained from cmaq reflect expected emissions measures implemented since 1990 to comply with rules promulgated through september 2005 while allowing for changes in population and economic activity including emissions attributable to economic and population growth u s environmental protection agency usepa 2011 the following caaa program controls are modeled in cmaq 1 title i voc and nox reasonably available control technology requirements in ozone nonattainment areas 2 title ii on road vehicle and nonroad engine vehicle provisions 3 title iii national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants 4 title iv acid rain programs focused on emissions from egus and 5 additional egu regulations such as the clean air interstate rule the clean air mercury rule and the clean air visibility rule types of emission sources considered were egus electricity production non egus e g industrial boilers cement kilns on road motor vehicles e g buses cars trucks non road engines vehicles e g aircraft construction and lawn garden equipment and area sources e g dry cleaners wildfires climate or land cover changes were not considered in cmaq but we incorporate these using the iclus ipcc and gcm data as previously described for discussion on model qaqc uncertainties and assumptions for cmaq data refer to benefits and costs of the clean air act from 1990 to 2020 u s environmental protection agency usepa 2011 at the time of this study cmaq simulations were generated for 36 km or 12 km grid sizes the 36 km grid data was used for this study the cmaq nitrogen deposition data used in this study was obtained from a collaborating agency in support of generating results for this report table 2 shows annual summaries of the cmaq data all trends from 2000 to 2020 increased at various rates except for oxidized nitrogen these trends are clear since caaa only targets oxidized nitrogen and does not regulate nh3 emissions which are projected to increase dennis et al 2010 due to growing demand for food paulot et al 2013 reduced nitrogen is larger for the nahunta watershed because of a relatively high concentration of confined animal feeding operations cafo in the nahunta watershed regional area nh3 emissions are high in cases of fertilizer application and animal feeding operations civerolo et al 2010 wet deposition concentration data agrees well with national atmospheric deposition program data up through 2010 http nadp sws uiuc edu stations nc41 nc35 gabriel et al 2014a there were significant contrasts in magnitude and trends between cmaq and castnet another commonly used us dry wet deposition data set wet and dry fluxes because 1 castnet data are estimates using a different multi layer dry deposition model 2 cmaq uses a repeated precipitation year 2002 in simulations and 3 castnet does not include many nitrogen species e g nh3 pan no2 and no that are included in cmaq simulation to develop monthly deposition and concentration data beyond year 2020 we first developed linear trends for each nitrogen specie between years 2010 and 2020 then applied these trends to generate data up to year 2050 see figs 1 and 2 extending these trends to 2050 and zero trending thereafter is similar to modeled data for nhx nh3 nh4 and noy nox no3 2n2o5 hono ho2no2 organic nitrates nox no no2 determined by paulot et al 2013 paulot et al 2013 provide a broad assessment of projected deposition for various reactive nitrogen species in two us national parks among other locations using the geos chem global chemical transport model and current air regulation information in this paulot study trends for nhx and noy between 2000 and 2010 are similar to the cmaq data in this study however there are contrasts in nitrogen levels because of differing study locations as shown in fig 2 oxidized nitrogen trends curve as the data approaches year 2050 because of averaging over several years that contain high monthly variability 4 results and discussion 4 1 trends and spatiotemporal variations in nitrogen outputs figs 3 and 4 show swat model simulation results for upland denitrification denit plant nitrogen uptake n uptake sub basin nitrate no3 and organic nitrogen org n loading there are two different simulation scenarios the first scenario included caaa related changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition climate and land cover in swat simulation caad c l and the second scenario only included caaa related changes in nitrogen deposition caad reference data see section 3 2 4 was used in place of the climate and land cover change data for the caad scenario a visible feature for nearly all plots in figs 3 and 4 are the decreasing trends for no3 org n denit and n uptake in both watersheds the cause for the decreasing trends in both scenarios is largely decreasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition fig 2 because decreasing trends are present even with de trended precipitation p ambient temperature t co2 and constant land cover percentages in the caad scenario the strong influence of atmospheric deposition is reinforced in tables 3 and 4 correlations were completed for the caad c l scenario only gabriel et al 2014b found that the oxidized component of atmospheric nitrogen had the largest influence on nitrogen discharges this is also evident in this study since oxidized nitrogen is the only specie that decreases over time fig 2 org n discharge in both watersheds shows the most irregular unique trends for nahunta there is a zero slope trend and a unimodal trend for little river with the mode around year 2027 fig 3 this zero slope trend for nahunta is surprising since atmospheric nitrogen deposition p t do not have a zero slope trend see section 3 2 3 however in gabriel et al 2016 when precipitation and temperature pt act alone on org n it causes an increase in org n loading and atmospheric nitrogen deposition causes a decrease in org n this study their combined effect in simulation likely causes the zero slope trend the unimodal trend for org n in little river is consistent with a drop in pt around year 2027 gabriel et al 2016 further reinforcing the large combined influence of p and atmospheric nitrogen deposition on nitrogen discharges the decreasing trend for no3 particularly for little river in the caad c l scenario is encouraging figs 3 and 4 and indicates that when combined with caaa regulations climate and land cover changes did not cause an increase in no3 loading over time however that is not the case in a relative mass loading context which will be scrutinized in the next section the inter quartile ranges for all outputs in nahunta are much greater than little river which is connected to greater variety of soil classes and land cover types which generates greater variability in nitrogen fate and transport results figs 3 and 4 the magnitudes for nahunta output values are more than twice as large for n uptake and denit and an order of magnitude greater for no3 and org n which is due to greater fertilizer applications manure and pure nitrogen agricultural lands and urea urban lands over the simulation period for nahunta avg 45 0 kg ha yr than little river avg 1 5 kg ha yr we parameterized fertilizer applications in swat using a fixed schedule and amount for each crop each year this was done to provide more controlled conditions so as to clearly reveal the combined impacts of climate change land cover change and caaa related changes in n deposition for each year the highly skewed data distributions for n uptake in little river are due to hay land cover which on average took up an order of magnitude more nitrogen than all other land covers and has a large surface area table 1 for nahunta the distributions are skewed toward the later years because n uptake is higher for soybean corn cotton hay and spring wheat these land covers have the largest surface areas for this watershed and decreased in very little in coverage over time with projected land cover changes see gabriel et al 2014b for a detailed presentation and discussion of how n transport no3 org n n uptake denit differs as a function of multiple land cover types in both watersheds 4 2 relative influence of climate and land cover change on nitrogen transport in fig 5 there are visible differences in results between the caad c l and caad scenarios indicating that under this modeling set up the combined effects of climate and land cover changes will generate gradual increases in no3 loading and denit a decrease n uptake and have a mixed response for org n loading percent errors differences were calculated with data used in figs 3 and 4 percent error values above zero indicate higher org n denit n uptake and or no3 levels with climate and land cover change vice versa for values below zero the steady increase in percent changes indicate that climate and land cover change become important over time to nitrogen transport as atmospheric nitrogen deposition decreases as a result of caaa regulations fig 5 it is also important to note that while no3 loading is approximately 30 greater in year 2070 under the caad c l scenario climate and land cover changes factored in for both watersheds the loads are minimal compared to present no3 loading rates for little river in contrast for nahunta the advancement of climate and land cover change caad c l scenario may generate more noticeable increases in no3 and org n loading figs 3 and 4 the sensitivity analysis conducted by gabriel et al 2016 can help determine which forcing function parameter s p t co2 etc is most responsible for the change in nitrogen transport under the caad c l scenario gabriel et al 2016 showed no3 and org n loadings increase with increasing co2 have an overall decrease with land cover change conversion from agricultural and forests lands to urban and a mixed response for pt changes increase in loading for nahunta and no trend for little river in addition no3 and org n had 10 x more sensitivity to pt changes than land cover and co2 change and land cover and co2 had roughly equal levels of influence on nitrogen discharges in this study the only parameters that could cause the observed increase in no3 loading in both watersheds are co2 p and t because urbanization causes a decrease in no3 loading for these watersheds co2 can increase nitrogen loading through changes in plant stomatal conductance swat models co2 effects on plant growth based on research by morrison 1987 and easterling et al 1992 who found that increased atmospheric co2 lowers stomatal conductance because plants transpire a smaller amount of water to obtain the co2 they need for growth thereby reducing transpiration and overall evapotranspiration et a reduction in et creates a shift in upland water balance toward increased soil water content and plant water efficiency leading to increased runoff and increased no3 loading betts et al 2007 wu et al 2012 as mentioned we found co2 had minimal impacts in nitrogen loading compared to pt even though an increase in co2 alone causes an increase in nitrogen loading also seen by wu et al 2012 and butcher et al 2014 the inverse correlation between co2 and no3 tables 3 and 4 is expected because of the overwhelming influence of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in swat there are no atmospheric related interactions between ambient co2 p and t therefore this can be ruled out as a secondary influence lastly a simple comparison of the profiles for no3 percent increase fig 5 and no3 loading under the pt sensitivity analysis gabriel et al 2016 reveals stark similarity therefore we estimate that the primary cause for the steady increase in no3 for the caaa c l scenario is from combined pt changes mainly p however since gabriel et al 2014a showed t had minimal impacts on nitrogen fate and transport compared to p for these watersheds the changes in percent error for org n in both watersheds are also primarily from p for the same reasons as no3 this is evident by observing the similar profiles between percent changes and absolute org n loads acting under pt gabriel et al 2016 denit and n uptake also show clearly visible percent error differences between both scenarios fig 5 in swat relevant model terms variables that increase denit are soil nitrate concentration moisture and temperature n uptake is a product of plant biomass production soil nitrogen and heat unit regulation see swat model theoretical documentation at http swat tamu edu documentation for details the latter two terms are a functions of precipitation temperature and atmospheric nitrogen deposition plant biomass production is a function of the plant type nitrogen plant uptake is calculated as the difference between the actual concentration of nitrogen in the plant and the optimal concentration in the case of legumes e g alfalfa if the soil cannot meet the daily nitrogen demand the deficit is attributed to nitrogen fixation varanou et al 2002 no3 uptake by plants increases with temperature pourmokhtarian et al 2012 since we previously did not conduct a sensitivity analysis on denit and n uptake as was done for org n and no3 it is challenging to pinpoint the exact parameter s that is most important to the change of denit and n uptake under the caaa c l scenario denit however shows a very similar response to no3 loading fig 5 the increase in denit over time was not from soil nitrogen levels which decreased over time with a decrease in atmospheric oxidized nitrogen deposition therefore the increase in denit was from an increase in ambient temperature see section 3 2 3 and or soil moisture from the gradual increase in precipitation soil moisture levels increased in both watersheds for example under the caaa c l scenario combining echo and ccsm3 gcm data average soil water content levels in little river rose 5 2 by year 2070 n uptake is unique in that it shows a consistent decline in the caaa c l scenario since p and t increase over time the only parameters that could have caused the reduction in n uptake are the rising co2 and land cover conversion urbanization as mentioned increasing co2 decreases et which creates a shift in upland water balance toward increased soil water content and plant water efficiency therefore requiring less nitrogen for growth thereby decreasing n uptake overtime adding to this the reduction profile for n uptake is more similar to co2 than urbanization gabriel et al 2016 therefore it is likely co2 was the parameter primarily responsible for the decrease in n uptake for the caaa c l scenario 5 implications for changes in watershed nitrogen discharge loading under future climate land cover and caaa change these modeling results show that the combined effects from climate and land cover change may offset the benefits caaa regulations have on reducing no3 and org n loadings to receiving waters within the neuse river basin both watersheds show a median 30 higher no3 load in 2070 fig 5 under climate and land cover change conditions as delivered by the a2 scenario the relative impacts of climate and land cover change appear to be more dramatic for nahunta which is the more agricultural based watershed in nahunta certain crop types show continued release of elevated no3 because 1 atmospheric deposition of oxidized nitrogen decreased at a slower rate over nahunta and 2 there was a greater percentage of crop types that took up and released higher nitrogen loads specifically soybean corn hay and cotton org n also showed an appreciable load increase 10 15 higher in 2070 for nahunta however loading was much more variable in little river due to a shift in precipitation impacts around year 2027 gabriel et al 2016 increases in nitrogen loading with climate and land cover change over time could have substantial implications for primary production and ecosystem services in the neuse river basin and estuary eutrophication has been a water quality problem in the neuse estuary since post world war ii due to agricultural activities urbanization and frequent hurricanes paerl et al 2006a this basin has a longstanding history of stress from hypoxia conditions fear et al 2004 u s environmental protection agency usepa 2012a and any additional increases in loading could pose deleterious impacts to fisheries and dissolved oxygen levels paerl et al 2006a b as previously pointed out while a 30 increase in nitrogen loading to receiving waters could be a major issue for nahunta the 30 increase for little river may not because the loads by 2070 are only a fraction e g one tenth of current loading levels as such the severity of projected climate and land cover impacts may be highly variable on a watershed basis within the neuse river basin and climate and land cover changes may have minimal impacts on nitrogen delivery assuming air regulations remain in place these climate change impact results are unique very commonly watershed modeling investigations indicate changing climate will generate negative even cataclysmic environmental conditions over time this study s modeling results for the little river watershed contrast that by showing changing climate will increase nitrogen loads however on a potentially trivial or negligible level the key to further reductions in nitrogen loading is to ensure caaa regulations do not erode or lessen over time our statistical and modeling scenario analyses show that the combination of atmospheric nitrogen deposition and precipitation have the largest influence on nitrogen fate and transport in these watersheds changes in co2 and land cover have a minor role for land cover this was largely because of the type of conversion that occurred urbanization therefore based on these modeling results we suggest any future efforts made to improve and or sustain ecosystem structure in the neuse river basin from a nitrogen management standpoint may be better achieved through investigation of current and or planned air regulations and climate related increases in precipitation for example valuable watershed nitrogen fate and transport investigations could include determining impacts of 1 various atmospheric chemistry and nitrogen deposition conditions that reflect with current and projected air regulations and 2 climate related changes in precipitation

8503,study region the swat model was used to estimate the combined effects of changing land cover climate and clean air act caaa related atmospheric nitrogen n deposition to watershed nitrogen fate and transport for two watersheds in north carolina usa study focus two different model simulation scenarios were applied one included caaa related atmospheric n deposition climate and land cover caad c l and the other only included caaa related n deposition caad in simulation new hydrological insights for the region results show both scenarios generated overall decreasing trends for nearly all n outputs between 2010 and 2070 which resulted primarily from caaa related reductions in oxidized n deposition in both watersheds including climate and land cover change in simulation resulted in a relative 30 higher no3 load 30 higher denitrification 10 higher organic n load and a 20 smaller level of plant n uptake in year 2070 compared to not including climate and landcover changes in simulation the increases in n transport for both watersheds indicates the combined impacts from climate and land cover change may offset benefits provided by the caaa regulations however future no3 loads for the little river watershed were small relative to current n loading rates conversely the increasing no3 and organic n loads for the nearby nahunta watershed were significant compared to current rates demonstrating that watershed nutrient responses to climate and land cover changes may vary significantly over relatively small spatial scales keywords gcm climate change nitrogen land

climate change showstack 2014 currently there is a relatively large literature base concerning impacts of climate and land cover change on watershed hydrology and water supply however water quality

ecosystem damage associated with low ph acid deposition in the eastern us and eastern canada butler et al 2001 investigations combining climate land cover and atmospheric nitrogen deposition change into one modeling framework to evaluate long term projections in ecosystem nutrient dynamics are limited in number and scope civerolo et al 2008 cambell et al 2009 pan et al 2009 shi et al 2011 bussi et al 2016 largely because of difficulties in linking various data sources and biogeochemical modeling components climate land cover use and atmospheric deposition represent primary factors affecting global water quality and nutrient balance williamson et al 2008 park et al 2010 churkina et al 2010 therefore modeling investigations including these factors could provide a comprehensive evaluation of the broad spectrum of global influence which can lead to more accurate predictions of water quality and better management of natural resources a previous study by this research group showed that the decrease in caaa related atmospheric nitrogen deposition from 1990 to 2010 over the neuse river basin region correlates with a decrease in nitrogen discharges from the little river and nahunta watersheds gabriel et al 2014b in a separate climate and land cover change investigation gabriel et al 2016 separately tested the influence of climate and land cover changes to determine the relative sensitivity of climate and land cover on nitrogen discharges for years 2010 2070 they showed nitrogen watershed discharges increase with increasing ambient co2 decrease with land cover urbanization and have a mixed response to precipitation and ambient temperature fluctuations this study also showed nitrogen watershed discharges were much more sensitive to the combined effects of precipitation and temperature than co2 and land cover changes the purpose of the study presented here is to further build this recent work by gabriel et al by combining climate land cover and caaa related changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition into one modeling framework to reveal the combined influence of all three on nitrogen fate and transport for these in these two watersheds little river and nahunta in north carolina usa we also ran a series of simulations that do not contain climate and land cover changes only caaa related changes in atmospheric deposition were included this was completed to determine the relative influence of climate and land cover changes on the system because over the long term the benefits of caaa regulations on nitrogen discharges may be offset or further enhanced with the advancement of climate and land cover changes civerolo et al 2008 for this study we once again used the soil and water assessment tool swat watershed model for all watershed simulations and extracted output data for nitrogen no3 and organic nitrogen stream river discharge upland denitrification and plant nitrogen uptake we chose nitrogen discharge denitrification and plant nitrogen uptake as the response variables because each are primary pathways for watershed nitrogen removal nitrogen discharges are a final product of the interaction between upland biogeochemistry atmosphere surface exchange hydrology land cover change land management practices and are the focus of many pollution abatement programs e g total maximum daily loads denitrification is a difficult process to experimentally measure as it occurs in small anaerobic pockets in soil and depends on no3 availability carbon availability temperature and substrate composition donner et al 2004 and can vary dramatically with climate variation groffman et al 2009 therefore model simulations that provide estimates of denitrification including plant uptake are particularly valuable the climate data used in this study involves ambient co2 precipitation and temperature co2 data were obtained from estimates determined by the international panel on climate change ipcc and future estimates for precipitation and temperature were obtained from two statistically downscaled global circulation models gcms land cover change predictions were obtained from the us environmental protection agencies usepa integrated climate and land use change iclus project and the usepa s community multi scale air quality cmaq model was used to obtain future estimates for atmospheric nitrogen deposition the study presented here is essentially a single scope scenario analysis since we consider one atmospheric deposition projection scenario beyond 2010 one climate and one land use land cover change scenario a2 business as usual scenario therefore the results presented are one of many possible future outcomes however we do examine two extreme climate scenarios wet cold and dry warm including the predominant projected land cover conversion agricultural and forested to urban for the studied region the novelty of this study partly lies in the exercise of linking three complex datasets into a swat model framework climate land cover and caaa related atmospheric deposition we rely on the findings discussed in gabriel et al 2014a 2014b 2016 to dissect and analyze the modeling results presented in this manuscript part of the motivation for developing these past studies was to build a knowledge base and an appropriate modeling platform in order to evaluate the combined effects from changing climate land cover and atmospheric nitrogen deposition in swat simulation for the study watersheds presented in this manuscript 2 study area description we performed this modeling investigation in two hydrologic unit code huc 10 watersheds located within the neuse watershed of north carolina usa the little river and the nahunta the little river watershed drains an area of 202 5 km2 at usgs gauging station 208521324 little river at sr1461 near orange factory nc 36 142 lat 78 919 long the nahunta watershed drains an area of 207 2 km2 at usgs flow gauging station 2091000 nahunta swamp near shine nc 35 489 lat 77 806 long little river is located in the piedmont region and nahunta is in the atlantic coastal plain these watersheds were selected because of contrasting land cover characteristics location in the neuse and availability of observed data flow and nitrate for calibration purposes physiographic information for each watershed is provided in table 1 see gabriel et al 2014a for more details on the study watersheds 3 model data and methods 3 1 model application the swat watershed model was used for this investigation a revised version of the swat 2009 code 477 dated 4 15 13 was developed for this study to allow entry and computation of spatio temporal varying on a sub basin and monthly basis atmospheric nitrogen deposition and ambient co2 swat was chosen for this modeling framework because of its wide user base for hydrologic and nutrient simulations and its appropriate application for the selected watersheds which are largely agricultural and forest based for information on the simulation of nitrogen cycles in swat data input and processing and model sensitivity analysis refer to the supporting information section 3 2 land cover and climate change data 3 2 1 land cover the land cover change data was obtained from usepa s integrated climate and land use change research program iclus http www epa gov ncea global iclus iclus produces national scale change scenarios for urban and residential development underlying different ipcc greenhouse gas emission storylines the scenarios use a demographics model to estimate population through 2100 for the conterminous us which is then allocated to 1 ha pixels the final spatial dataset provides projections for housing density and impervious surface cover every five years from 2000 through 2100 bierwagen et al 2010 johnson et al 2012 to be consistent with co2 projections we considered a single future land cover land use change scenario representative of the ipcc a2 greenhouse emission storyline iclus data were separately obtained for both watersheds iclus projects these watersheds will undergo substantial conversion to urban cover according to the a2 storyline by 2030 iclus projects 69 of the little river watershed and 22 of the nahunta watershed will have converted to urban cover to incorporate projected land cover changes we modified the reference land cover areas provided by the nlcd files relative to iclus projections see gabriel et al 2016 for more information 3 2 2 co2 future projections for ambient co2 were obtained from estimates provided by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 gabriel et al 2016 ambient co2 an important driver of climate change was included in the assessment because of its direct impacts to water balance and vegetation growth in the swat model as in any natural system the projected co2 levels used here are representative of the a2 greenhouse gas storyline which assumes a heterogeneous world of self reliance and preservation of local identity high energy use medium to high rates of land cover change and fertility patterns across regions that converge very slowly resulting in a continuously increasing global population the a2 storyline is commonly referred to as a business as usual case since it reflects socio economic and industrial emissions conditions comparable to the current time period intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 the simulated response of water quality quantity to climate and land use change depends heavily on the ipcc storyline used in simulation wilson and weng 2011 therefore results for this research are only relevant to future conditions that reflect the a2 storyline for the reference co2 condition a constant value of 380 ppm current conditions was used which represents current global conditions in this study potential evapotranspiration pet was determined using the penman monteith equation where co2 directly affects pet and subsequently et through modification of leaf stomatal conductance and the leaf area index lai et is a primary determinant for surface runoff in swat neitsch et al 2005 3 2 3 precipitation and ambient temperature model projections for precipitation and ambient temperature were based on bias corrected and statistically downscaled data from the echo hamburg atmosphere ocean coupled circulation model and ccsm3 community climate system model models these data were obtained from the 12 km conus daily downscaled climate projections developed by katherine hayhoe and others at the u s geological survey see usgs data portal at www cida usgs gov climate gdp we chose the echo and ccsm3 cgms because they present climactic contrasts for the north and south carolina region conrads et al 2012 echo predicts drier warmer conditions and ccsm3 predicts wetter cooler conditions see gabriel et al 2016 similarly to the co2 and land cover criteria echo and ccsm3 data predictions are representative of the a2 greenhouse emission storyline see section 3 2 4 for a description on how reference precipitation and temperature data were developed even though ambient temperature has a major impact on all ecohydrologic processes namely evapotranspiration chemical reaction kinetics and microbial mediated processes whitehead and crossman 2012 precipitation and temperature were combined as one treatment because in a previous study by these authors ambient temperature had minor impacts on nitrogen discharge compared to precipitation for these watersheds gabriel et al 2014a 3 2 4 reference data development for precipitation and temperature reference data was developed for precipitation and temperature as was done for co2 and land cover the reference precipitation and temperature data sets were developed by de trending creating zero slopes gcm data for gcm precipitation there were no long term daily trends but there were trends for individual months over the 60 year period e g all januaries from 2005 to 2070 see section 3 2 3 reference precipitation data was developed by subtracting the product of monthly slopes and number of years from the daily data eq 1 this de trended increasing and decreasing monthly slopes for daily temperature eq 2 both data sets showed statistically significantly p 0 001 positive increases and were de trended to create zero slopes this was done for both daily minimum and maximum temperature data gcm in these equations refers to echo and ccsm3 since we developed separate reference data for both models 1

used to obtain monthly atmospheric nitrogen deposition data byun and schere 2006 u s environmental protection agency usepa 2012a 2012b cmaq is a publicly available peer reviewed state of the science model that simulates multiple chemical and physical processes important to understanding atmospheric trace gas transformations and distributions the atmospheric nitrogen deposition data obtained from cmaq reflect expected emissions measures implemented since 1990 to comply with rules promulgated through september 2005 while allowing for changes in population and economic activity including emissions attributable to economic and population growth u s environmental protection agency usepa 2011 the following caaa program controls are modeled in cmaq 1 title i voc and nox reasonably available control technology requirements in ozone nonattainment areas 2 title ii on road vehicle and nonroad engine vehicle provisions 3 title iii national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants 4 title iv acid rain programs focused on emissions from egus and 5 additional egu regulations such as the clean air interstate rule the clean air mercury rule and the clean air visibility rule types of emission sources considered were egus electricity production non egus e g industrial boilers cement kilns on road motor vehicles e g buses cars trucks non road engines vehicles e g aircraft construction and lawn garden equipment and area sources e g dry cleaners wildfires climate or land cover changes were not considered in cmaq but we incorporate these using the iclus ipcc and gcm data as previously described for discussion on model qaqc uncertainties and assumptions for cmaq data refer to benefits and costs of the clean air act from 1990 to 2020 u s environmental protection agency usepa 2011 at the time of this study cmaq simulations were generated for 36 km or 12 km grid sizes the 36 km grid data was used for this study the cmaq nitrogen deposition data used in this study was obtained from a collaborating agency in support of generating results for this report table 2 shows annual summaries of the cmaq data all trends from 2000 to 2020 increased at various rates except for oxidized nitrogen these trends are clear since caaa only targets oxidized nitrogen and does not regulate nh3 emissions which are projected to increase dennis et al 2010 due to growing demand for food paulot et al 2013 reduced nitrogen is larger for the nahunta watershed because of a relatively high concentration of confined animal feeding operations cafo in the nahunta watershed regional area nh3 emissions are high in cases of fertilizer application and animal feeding operations civerolo et al 2010 wet deposition concentration data agrees well with national atmospheric deposition program data up through 2010 http nadp sws uiuc edu stations nc41 nc35 gabriel et al 2014a there were significant contrasts in magnitude and trends between cmaq and castnet another commonly used us dry wet deposition data set wet and dry fluxes because 1 castnet data are estimates using a different multi layer dry deposition model 2 cmaq uses a repeated precipitation year 2002 in simulations and 3 castnet does not include many nitrogen species e g nh3 pan no2 and no that are included in cmaq simulation to develop monthly deposition and concentration data beyond year 2020 we first developed linear trends for each nitrogen specie between years 2010 and 2020 then applied these trends to generate data up to year 2050 see figs 1 and 2 extending these trends to 2050 and zero trending thereafter is similar to modeled data for nhx nh3 nh4 and noy nox no3 2n2o5 hono ho2no2 organic nitrates nox no no2 determined by paulot et al 2013 paulot et al 2013 provide a broad assessment of projected deposition for various reactive nitrogen species in two us national parks among other locations using the geos chem global chemical transport model and current air regulation information in this paulot study trends for nhx and noy between 2000 and 2010 are similar to the cmaq data in this study however there are contrasts in nitrogen levels because of differing study locations as shown in fig 2 oxidized nitrogen trends curve as the data approaches year 2050 because of averaging over several years that contain high monthly variability 4 results and discussion 4 1 trends and spatiotemporal variations in nitrogen outputs figs 3 and 4 show swat model simulation results for upland denitrification denit plant nitrogen uptake n uptake sub basin nitrate no3 and organic nitrogen org n loading there are two different simulation scenarios the first scenario included caaa related changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition climate and land cover in swat simulation caad c l and the second scenario only included caaa related changes in nitrogen deposition caad reference data see section 3 2 4 was used in place of the climate and land cover change data for the caad scenario a visible feature for nearly all plots in figs 3 and 4 are the decreasing trends for no3 org n denit and n uptake in both watersheds the cause for the decreasing trends in both scenarios is largely decreasing atmospheric nitrogen deposition fig 2 because decreasing trends are present even with de trended precipitation p ambient temperature t co2 and constant land cover percentages in the caad scenario the strong influence of atmospheric deposition is reinforced in tables 3 and 4 correlations were completed for the caad c l scenario only gabriel et al 2014b found that the oxidized component of atmospheric nitrogen had the largest influence on nitrogen discharges this is also evident in this study since oxidized nitrogen is the only specie that decreases over time fig 2 org n discharge in both watersheds shows the most irregular unique trends for nahunta there is a zero slope trend and a unimodal trend for little river with the mode around year 2027 fig 3 this zero slope trend for nahunta is surprising since atmospheric nitrogen deposition p t do not have a zero slope trend see section 3 2 3 however in gabriel et al 2016 when precipitation and temperature pt act alone on org n it causes an increase in org n loading and atmospheric nitrogen deposition causes a decrease in org n this study their combined effect in simulation likely causes the zero slope trend the unimodal trend for org n in little river is consistent with a drop in pt around year 2027 gabriel et al 2016 further reinforcing the large combined influence of p and atmospheric nitrogen deposition on nitrogen discharges the decreasing trend for no3 particularly for little river in the caad c l scenario is encouraging figs 3 and 4 and indicates that when combined with caaa regulations climate and land cover changes did not cause an increase in no3 loading over time however that is not the case in a relative mass loading context which will be scrutinized in the next section the inter quartile ranges for all outputs in nahunta are much greater than little river which is connected to greater variety of soil classes and land cover types which generates greater variability in nitrogen fate and transport results figs 3 and 4 the magnitudes for nahunta output values are more than twice as large for n uptake and denit and an order of magnitude greater for no3 and org n which is due to greater fertilizer applications manure and pure nitrogen agricultural lands and urea urban lands over the simulation period for nahunta avg 45 0 kg ha yr than little river avg 1 5 kg ha yr we parameterized fertilizer applications in swat using a fixed schedule and amount for each crop each year this was done to provide more controlled conditions so as to clearly reveal the combined impacts of climate change land cover change and caaa related changes in n deposition for each year the highly skewed data distributions for n uptake in little river are due to hay land cover which on average took up an order of magnitude more nitrogen than all other land covers and has a large surface area table 1 for nahunta the distributions are skewed toward the later years because n uptake is higher for soybean corn cotton hay and spring wheat these land covers have the largest surface areas for this watershed and decreased in very little in coverage over time with projected land cover changes see gabriel et al 2014b for a detailed presentation and discussion of how n transport no3 org n n uptake denit differs as a function of multiple land cover types in both watersheds 4 2 relative influence of climate and land cover change on nitrogen transport in fig 5 there are visible differences in results between the caad c l and caad scenarios indicating that under this modeling set up the combined effects of climate and land cover changes will generate gradual increases in no3 loading and denit a decrease n uptake and have a mixed response for org n loading percent errors differences were calculated with data used in figs 3 and 4 percent error values above zero indicate higher org n denit n uptake and or no3 levels with climate and land cover change vice versa for values below zero the steady increase in percent changes indicate that climate and land cover change become important over time to nitrogen transport as atmospheric nitrogen deposition decreases as a result of caaa regulations fig 5 it is also important to note that while no3 loading is approximately 30 greater in year 2070 under the caad c l scenario climate and land cover changes factored in for both watersheds the loads are minimal compared to present no3 loading rates for little river in contrast for nahunta the advancement of climate and land cover change caad c l scenario may generate more noticeable increases in no3 and org n loading figs 3 and 4 the sensitivity analysis conducted by gabriel et al 2016 can help determine which forcing function parameter s p t co2 etc is most responsible for the change in nitrogen transport under the caad c l scenario gabriel et al 2016 showed no3 and org n loadings increase with increasing co2 have an overall decrease with land cover change conversion from agricultural and forests lands to urban and a mixed response for pt changes increase in loading for nahunta and no trend for little river in addition no3 and org n had 10 x more sensitivity to pt changes than land cover and co2 change and land cover and co2 had roughly equal levels of influence on nitrogen discharges in this study the only parameters that could cause the observed increase in no3 loading in both watersheds are co2 p and t because urbanization causes a decrease in no3 loading for these watersheds co2 can increase nitrogen loading through changes in plant stomatal conductance swat models co2 effects on plant growth based on research by morrison 1987 and easterling et al 1992 who found that increased atmospheric co2 lowers stomatal conductance because plants transpire a smaller amount of water to obtain the co2 they need for growth thereby reducing transpiration and overall evapotranspiration et a reduction in et creates a shift in upland water balance toward increased soil water content and plant water efficiency leading to increased runoff and increased no3 loading betts et al 2007 wu et al 2012 as mentioned we found co2 had minimal impacts in nitrogen loading compared to pt even though an increase in co2 alone causes an increase in nitrogen loading also seen by wu et al 2012 and butcher et al 2014 the inverse correlation between co2 and no3 tables 3 and 4 is expected because of the overwhelming influence of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in swat there are no atmospheric related interactions between ambient co2 p and t therefore this can be ruled out as a secondary influence lastly a simple comparison of the profiles for no3 percent increase fig 5 and no3 loading under the pt sensitivity analysis gabriel et al 2016 reveals stark similarity therefore we estimate that the primary cause for the steady increase in no3 for the caaa c l scenario is from combined pt changes mainly p however since gabriel et al 2014a showed t had minimal impacts on nitrogen fate and transport compared to p for these watersheds the changes in percent error for org n in both watersheds are also primarily from p for the same reasons as no3 this is evident by observing the similar profiles between percent changes and absolute org n loads acting under pt gabriel et al 2016 denit and n uptake also show clearly visible percent error differences between both scenarios fig 5 in swat relevant model terms variables that increase denit are soil nitrate concentration moisture and temperature n uptake is a product of plant biomass production soil nitrogen and heat unit regulation see swat model theoretical documentation at http swat tamu edu documentation for details the latter two terms are a functions of precipitation temperature and atmospheric nitrogen deposition plant biomass production is a function of the plant type nitrogen plant uptake is calculated as the difference between the actual concentration of nitrogen in the plant and the optimal concentration in the case of legumes e g alfalfa if the soil cannot meet the daily nitrogen demand the deficit is attributed to nitrogen fixation varanou et al 2002 no3 uptake by plants increases with temperature pourmokhtarian et al 2012 since we previously did not conduct a sensitivity analysis on denit and n uptake as was done for org n and no3 it is challenging to pinpoint the exact parameter s that is most important to the change of denit and n uptake under the caaa c l scenario denit however shows a very similar response to no3 loading fig 5 the increase in denit over time was not from soil nitrogen levels which decreased over time with a decrease in atmospheric oxidized nitrogen deposition therefore the increase in denit was from an increase in ambient temperature see section 3 2 3 and or soil moisture from the gradual increase in precipitation soil moisture levels increased in both watersheds for example under the caaa c l scenario combining echo and ccsm3 gcm data average soil water content levels in little river rose 5 2 by year 2070 n uptake is unique in that it shows a consistent decline in the caaa c l scenario since p and t increase over time the only parameters that could have caused the reduction in n uptake are the rising co2 and land cover conversion urbanization as mentioned increasing co2 decreases et which creates a shift in upland water balance toward increased soil water content and plant water efficiency therefore requiring less nitrogen for growth thereby decreasing n uptake overtime adding to this the reduction profile for n uptake is more similar to co2 than urbanization gabriel et al 2016 therefore it is likely co2 was the parameter primarily responsible for the decrease in n uptake for the caaa c l scenario 5 implications for changes in watershed nitrogen discharge loading under future climate land cover and caaa change these modeling results show that the combined effects from climate and land cover change may offset the benefits caaa regulations have on reducing no3 and org n loadings to receiving waters within the neuse river basin both watersheds show a median 30 higher no3 load in 2070 fig 5 under climate and land cover change conditions as delivered by the a2 scenario the relative impacts of climate and land cover change appear to be more dramatic for nahunta which is the more agricultural based watershed in nahunta certain crop types show continued release of elevated no3 because 1 atmospheric deposition of oxidized nitrogen decreased at a slower rate over nahunta and 2 there was a greater percentage of crop types that took up and released higher nitrogen loads specifically soybean corn hay and cotton org n also showed an appreciable load increase 10 15 higher in 2070 for nahunta however loading was much more variable in little river due to a shift in precipitation impacts around year 2027 gabriel et al 2016 increases in nitrogen loading with climate and land cover change over time could have substantial implications for primary production and ecosystem services in the neuse river basin and estuary eutrophication has been a water quality problem in the neuse estuary since post world war ii due to agricultural activities urbanization and frequent hurricanes paerl et al 2006a this basin has a longstanding history of stress from hypoxia conditions fear et al 2004 u s environmental protection agency usepa 2012a and any additional increases in loading could pose deleterious impacts to fisheries and dissolved oxygen levels paerl et al 2006a b as previously pointed out while a 30 increase in nitrogen loading to receiving waters could be a major issue for nahunta the 30 increase for little river may not because the loads by 2070 are only a fraction e g one tenth of current loading levels as such the severity of projected climate and land cover impacts may be highly variable on a watershed basis within the neuse river basin and climate and land cover changes may have minimal impacts on nitrogen delivery assuming air regulations remain in place these climate change impact results are unique very commonly watershed modeling investigations indicate changing climate will generate negative even cataclysmic environmental conditions over time this study s modeling results for the little river watershed contrast that by showing changing climate will increase nitrogen loads however on a potentially trivial or negligible level the key to further reductions in nitrogen loading is to ensure caaa regulations do not erode or lessen over time our statistical and modeling scenario analyses show that the combination of atmospheric nitrogen deposition and precipitation have the largest influence on nitrogen fate and transport in these watersheds changes in co2 and land cover have a minor role for land cover this was largely because of the type of conversion that occurred urbanization therefore based on these modeling results we suggest any future efforts made to improve and or sustain ecosystem structure in the neuse river basin from a nitrogen management standpoint may be better achieved through investigation of current and or planned air regulations and climate related increases in precipitation for example valuable watershed nitrogen fate and transport investigations could include determining impacts of 1 various atmospheric chemistry and nitrogen deposition conditions that reflect with current and projected air regulations and 2 climate related changes in precipitation

8504,study region the nebraska sand hills consisting of four major land cover types 1 lakes and wetlands 5 for both 2 subirrigated meadows 10 3 dry valleys 20 and 4 upland dunes 65 study focus examination of surface energy and water balances on multiple temporal scales with primary focus on latent heat flux λe and evapotranspiration et to gain a better understanding of the annual seasonal and diel properties of surface energy partitioning among different sand hills ecosystems to improve regional water resource management new hydrological insights for the region based on surface energy and water balance measurements using bowen ratio energy balance systems at three locations during 2004 we find a strong spatial gradient between sites in latent λe and sensible h heat flux due to differences in topography soils and plant community composition on all timescales seasonally all land covers show the greatest λe in summer our results show that subirrigated meadows dry valleys and upland dunes allocate roughly 81 50 and 41 of available energy to λe respectively during the growing season the subirrigated meadow was the only cover type where cumulative annual et surpassed cumulative annual precipitation i e net loss of water to the atmosphere therefore the dry valleys and upland dunes are where net groundwater recharge to the high plains aquifer is occurring keywords nebraska high plains aquifer evapotranspiration energy balance bowen ratio 1 introduction fresh water is vital for human society and proper management of this resource will continue to gain importance in areas where scarcity is increasing it is a fundamental necessity for consumption by municipalities irrigation for agriculture and natural ecosystem function that requires careful consideration in both short and long term management strategies short term benefits include sustaining ample drinking water ensuring abundant food supplies flood control and habitat for plants and wildlife long term benefits include sustainable resource management and adaptive capacity in the context of climate change one of the most valuable sources of fresh water that supports human populations and agricultural production is groundwater stored in aquifers in the united states the high plains ogallala aquifer hpa supports more than one fourth of the nation s agricultural production mcmahon et al 2007 as this immense hydrologic feature underlies roughly 448 000 km2 of land extending from south dakota to texas mcguire et al 2000 the primary region of recharge to the hpa is in the semi arid sand hills region

projections indicate that if current rates of extraction continue to exceed recharge parts of the high plains will face exhausted groundwater supplies within the next 100 years tidwell et al 2016 united states department of homeland security usdhs 2015 in fact the southern hpa has already experienced significant depletion and it is estimated that roughly 35 of the southern high plains may not be able to sustain irrigation within the next 30 years if current extraction rates continue haacker et al 2015 scanlon et al 2012 the nebraska sand hills region consists of four major land cover types

affect connections between plant communities and groundwater gosselin et al 1999 2006 understanding hydrologic connections between groundwater soils vegetation and the atmosphere is critical for water resource managers that rely on the hpa improved seasonal and diel estimates of water s role in energy partitioning among dominant land cover types in this region will benefit estimates of the regional

connections are often climate dependent rodriguez iturbe 2000 and are especially important to agricultural producers in areas prone to drought like the semi arid sand hills region of nebraska sridhar

occurs as a combination of evaporation e and transpiration t collectively referred to as evapotranspiration et regional climatology determines the energy and water available for λe that in turn influences the rate of recharge to the hpa although previous research has investigated regional scale satellite remote sensing estimates of et in the sand hills region szilagyi and jozsa 2013 szilagyi et al 2011 healey et al 2011 these analyses were restricted spatially and or temporally in this research we focus on the following research question that has not yet been addressed how does the surface energy balance at three of the four major land cover types in the nebraska sand hills region differ across timescales from diel to seasonal to annual the objective of this study is to expand the findings of healey et al 2011 and billesbach and arkebauer 2012 to establish a new understanding of how the dominant land cover types in the sand hills of nebraska partition available energy with primary focus on energy consumed in the processes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration on diel seasonal and growing season timescales we aim for our results to inform rangeland managers about differences in hydrologic characteristics of the major regional land cover types on different time scales to improve determination of the best land use practices i e grazing rotations grazing capacity planting and harvest timing of crops such as hay etc this research also aims to expand on results from modeling efforts by sridhar and wedin 2009 on upland dune ecosystems in the nebraska sand hills while providing new insight into energy partitioning in dry valley and subirrigated meadows on different temporal scales initiated by sridhar 2007 and healey et al 2011 these previous studies 1 provided remote sensing estimations of et from high resolution satellite imagery representing snapshots of energy partitioning at the times of satellite overpasses and 2 implemented statistical models to interpolate et estimations between sites in the sand hills this current study provides in situ observations at three of the four dominant ecosystems in the sand hills that have not been closely examined at different timescales thus extending beyond instantaneous estimations of et and utilizing observations instead of spatial interpolation to better understand the hydrologic behavior of the sand hills region 2 site description the regional climate of the nebraska sand hills is semi arid with a significant precipitation gradient from about 450 mm yr 1 in the west to over 650 mm yr 1 in the east szilagyi et al 2003 based on the 30 year climatology for this mid latitude region high plains regional climate center hprcc 2010 maximum precipitation normally occurs during the month of june 105 mm in general the area can be characterized as a continental climate hot summers and contrastingly cold winters with most precipitation falling in the summer season over the growing season april october the mean air temperature is 15 8 c with an average low temperature of 8 6 c and average high temperature of 22 9 c annual maximum temperatures typically occur in july the gudmundsen sand hills research laboratory gsrl is a 52 km2 multidisciplinary research facility located in the heart of the sand hills region near whitman nebraska latitude 42 06 n longitude 101 52 w elevation 1098 m a s l and the laboratory also serves as a livestock ranch fig 1 at gsrl three micrometeorological bowen ratio energy balance breb stations were established in 2002 and 2003 at an interdunal subirrigated meadow a dry shortgrass valley and an upland dune ecosystem the subirrigated meadow at gsrl roughly 6 5 km long and 800 m wide is flanked by dunes to the north and south that discharge soil water to the meadow gosselin et al 2006 where the water table often rises to the soil surface hay is harvested from the meadow to feed winter cattle and supplement dormant season grazing on dry valley and upland range sites the dry valley at gsrl roughly 4 km long and about 600 m wide is a flow through area where ground water typically flows parallel to the land surface and groundwater is typically between one to ten meters from the surface gosselin et al 2006 the upland dune site at gsrl where the water table is often located more than ten meters from the surface exhibits pronounced topographic undulations and an abundance of exposed soil sand with high hydraulic conductivity table 1 describes the soil properties for each of the three land cover types plant community composition varies at each site largely determined by soil moisture and texture differences the subirrigated meadow contains a dense canopy where the maximum growing season leaf area index lai is near three healey et al 2011 this site supports a mix of mosses shallow rooted 0 30 cm deep c3 grasses and deeper 30 cm rooted c4 grasses forbs and sedges e g medicago sativa bromus inermis leyss poa pratensis l spartina pectinata calamagrostis spp numerous carex spp cyperus spp scirpus spp and eleocharis spp in spring the abundant c3 grasses and sedges in the subirrigated meadow optimally photosynthesize when leaf temperatures reach 20 30 c although yamori et al 2014 determined a much broader range of optimal temperatures for c3 species 10 35 c leaf temperatures are often 1 10 c above below air temperature when air temperature is below above optimum depending on leaf level thermodynamics related to ambient wind speed vapor pressure deficit and solar irradiance campbell and norman 1998 the dry valley supports a sparser canopy with a maximum growing season lai of just over one healey et al 2011 and a higher proportion of c4 grasses and forbs with deeper root systems albertson 1937 found that c4 tallgrass prairie species can have root systems that extend over two meters into the soil profile the upland dune ecosystem has a very sparse canopy with a maximum growing season lai 0 3 consisting mostly of deep rooted c4 grasses and with the exception of species like yucca glauca shallow rooted crassulacean acid metabolism cam plants and some isolated forbs succulents and shrubs e g andropogon scoparius calamovilfa longifolia andropogon hallii panicum virgatum l eragrostis trichoides bouteloua gracillis and opuntia fragilis this site is a grass stabilized upland sand dune ecosystem where soil water holding capacity is increasingly limited due to increased infiltration potential i e high permeability heightened aridity coarse sandy soils and no upward vertical flow of groundwater thus these species must be opportunistic in capturing soil water that travels quickly through the sandy soil horizon previous research shows that the species distribution from the dry valley bottom to the upland dunes differs based on the topography pool 1914 barnes and harrison 1982 soil texture burzlaff 1962 and most importantly the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture tolstead 1942 3 materials and methods the surface energy balance at each of the three land cover types was calculated using breb systems using instrumentation described in table 2 at each of the three sites data were logged by campbell cr23x data loggers using campbell scientific am25 t solid state multiplexers to provide additional analog input channels observations were made once per second and 30 minute averages were recorded because a psychrometer exchanging mechanism was not available inherent biases between the individual temperature relative humidity sensors were removed by calibrating them using a precision platinum resistance thermometer and a reference dew point hygrometer for validation calculated energy fluxes were compared to values obtained from eddy covariance instrumentation installed at the dry valley site the procedure was also tested against eddy covariance instrumentation in a fallow oklahoma wheat field where flux system errors are estimated to be 15 w m 2 billesbach et al 2004 bowen ratio energy fluxes in this study were estimated to be within about 10 of the eddy covariance observations and positive negative flux values denote movement of matter or energy away from toward the land surface thus the overall surface energy balance can be written as 1 r n λ e h g where λe is the latent heat flux rn is net radiation h is the sensible heat flux g is the surface heat flux and all units are in w m 2 the bowen ratio bowen 1926 is then computed as 2 β h λ e to calculate et we divide λe by λρw where ρw is the density of water kg m 3 in this study we report fluxes of both λe and et in terms of energy w m 2 and water mm day 1 respectively reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 asce ewri 2005 using grass as the reference crop for growing season analyses we examined the snow free period from april october for seasonal analyses we defined spring as extending from april may summer as june august and fall as september october using daytime values of λe and et only we show a filtered time series of energy balance components for each of the three sites using a 7 day running mean to reduce noise associated with synoptic weather variability focusing instead on the seasonal variability all data were checked against a set of quality control criteria for validity data were flagged if the measured or calculated 30 minute breb values fall outside a set of limits for daily data questionable values were replaced by the arithmetic mean of the preceding and proceeding acceptable values when calculating totals for longer periods monthly or growing season the same procedure was applied for single missing days but linear interpolation was used for multiple missing days 4 results and discussion 4 1 growing season energy partitioning with the highest net radiation precipitation and soil moisture the subirrigated meadow exhibited the highest growing season average λe 216 w m 2 and total accumulated evaporative water loss total et 763 mm in fact the total et was nearly double that of precipitation 399 mm fig 2 indicating that the soil receives a regular replenishment of water from local groundwater sources even when precipitation is lacking as noted by gosselin et al 2006 this site is characterized by groundwater flow that has seasonally sustained upward vertical gradients and discharge with consistent replenishment by flow into the meadow from the north and south we estimated that the subirrigated meadow produced a growing season average et of 3 5 1 6 mm day 1 with the maximum rate of 6 4 mm day 1 occurring on june 14 which compares closely with results from burba et al 1999a 1999b who estimated et rates of 3 8 4 1 mm day 1 for open water in north central nebraska as well as lenters et al 2011 who measured et to equal 4 4 mm day 1 for a riparian wetland in central nebraska gosselin et al 2006 described the dry valley as an area where groundwater flows laterally and when vertical gradients of flow exist here they are typically downward dry valleys have a stronger dependence on precipitation to recharge soil moisture in the root zone and support λe rather than supplemental groundwater connections here accumulated precipitation 359 mm surpassed the annual cumulative et 276 mm fig 2 average growing season λe in the dry valley was 127 w m 2 et of 2 0 1 4 mm day 1 and the maximum rate of et 5 9 mm day 1 occurred a month later july 14 than in the subirrigated meadow these results are similar to a study by christie 1981 in an australian semi arid grassland who found growing season et to average around 2 7 mm day 1 the upland dune site is slightly windier hotter and less humid on average than the subirrigated meadow and dry valley table 3 despite the higher evaporative demand at this site higher air temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speed the upland dune produced the lowest growing season average λe of 89 w m 2 et of 1 4 0 8 mm day 1 with a maximum et rate of 3 8 mm day 1 occurring on july 9 accumulated precipitation in the upland dune site totaled 371 mm and accumulated et 213 mm was lowest among the three sites fig 2 however sensible heat flux h was higher and the average 2004 growing season ta was also warmest at this site by 0 2 c from april october energy partitioning gradients are noticeable among sites where the subirrigated meadow dry valley and upland dune sites partitioned 81 3 4 1 6 mm day 1 of et 50 2 0 1 4 mm day 1 of et and 41 1 4 0 8 mm day 1 of et of available energy to λe and 19 50 and 59 to h respectively when combining the growing season et with the precipitation in 2004 the subirrigated meadow system represents a net loss i e p et of 364 mm of water while the dry valley and upland dune represent net gains of 83 mm and 158 mm of water respectively scaled up according to the fraction of areal coverage for the different land cover types in the sand hills region 10 subirrigated meadows 20 dry valley and 65 upland dunes the overall net recharge of water to the hpa is found to be 87 3 mm in 2004 4 2 seasonal variability 4 2 1 spring in the transition from winter to spring ample soil water throughout the soil column and root zone fig 3 a of the subirrigated meadow allows for commencement of noticeable et increase as opposed to the dry valley and upland dune sites fig 2 in fact et increased by 39 at this time even though precipitation decreased by roughly 50 although measurements of noticeable et in spring are primarily a reflection of ample soil moisture in the top 10 25 cm fig 2 3 during spring in the subirrigated meadow 217 w m 2 3 5 mm day 1 or 77 of available energy 282 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 65 w m 2 or 23 to h figs 4 and 5 soil moisture in the dry valley is at or above field capacity throughout the top 1 m of soil until the end of spring fig 3b indicating that a large portion of et at this time is evaporation from the soil rather than transpiration via photosynthesis this is also evident in the difference between eto and et fig 2 during spring 120 w m 2 1 9 mm day 1 or 46 of available energy 261 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 141 w m 2 or 54 to h fig 4 5 being the most arid of the three sites the upland dune area shows minimal et accumulation in spring rapid increases in soil moisture within the top 10 cm occur shortly after sporadic spring precipitation events fig 3c transpiration is driven by these rapid pulses of precipitation because soil water quickly migrates to depths deeper than 1 m or beyond the root zone although seasonal precipitation events provide water for et the coarse sandy soils and assumed depth to groundwater requires plant species to 1 rapidly take advantage of limited soil water in the topmost layers of the soil profile with shallow root systems e g cam or 2 extend roots deeper in order to endure dry periods e g c4 to increase transpiration rates although soil moisture in the top 10 cm is at field capacity in spring likely due to snowmelt all other layers are at or near the permanent wilting point thus et in spring is 84 below the eto value which implies moisture stress in the root zone and or species that are not physiologically active at this time in the spring only 77 w m 2 1 2 mm day 1 or 35 of available energy 217 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 140 w m 2 or 65 to h fig 4 5 4 2 2 summer sustained soil moisture in the root zone and a consistently wet surface make evaporative losses at the subirrigated meadow energy limited so peak et occurred in july due to high net radiation during summer months table 1 fig 3a the groundwater table in the subirrigated meadow can decrease by roughly 0 8 1 3 m between late july and late september gosselin et al 1999 2006 although ample soil water in the root zone determines that et is energy limited at this site in early summer during our study period shallow soil depths 0 50 cm remain at field capacity throughout the growing season fig 3a on average 268 w m 2 4 3 mm day 1 or 85 of available energy 316 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 48 w m 2 or 15 to h over summer fig 4 5 by summer cumulative et in the dry valley has caught up to and nearly surpassed precipitation fig 2 due to high soil evaporation from shallow soil water fig 3b and 3 the topographic position of the station valley bottom where soil water may collect and maintain high soil moisture soil moisture in the 10 and 25 cm depths was near field capacity from summer until the end of the year fig 3b but more drying events occurred when compared to the subirrigated meadow fig 3a in the dry valley high summer et is due to and ample soil moisture and maximum seasonal energy availability here 180 w m 2 2 9 mm day 1 or 60 of available energy 300 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 120 w m 2 or 40 to h fig 4 5 at the upland dune site the greatest water loss also occurs at the height of the summer when available energy is at a maximum and water is available though not abundant relative to the other two sites in the upland dunes 124 w m 2 2 0 mm day 1 or 48 of available energy 258 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 134 w m 2 or 52 to h fig 4 5 soil moisture in the top 50 cm of the soil profile reached field capacity periodically after precipitation events but rapidly reduced to the wilting point during summer due to the abundance of the highly permeable coarse sand substrate the dry soil surface and near surface that existed most of the time during the summer at this site would also decrease soil evaporation 4 2 3 autumn in the fall 138 w m 2 2 2 mm day 1 or 76 of available energy 181 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 43 w m 2 or 24 to h in the subirrigated meadow fig 4 5 similar to spring and summer fall energy partitioning is still dominated by λe due to the dense plant cover utilizing easily accessible soil moisture near the surface soil layer however the difference between et and eto increases in the fall as photoperiod i e day length diminishes and air temperatures decrease in fall available energy is increasingly limited which results in a reduction of et at the dry valley site even though substantial precipitation occurred at this time virtually all precipitation either briefly replenishes soil moisture or infiltrates the soil profile to greater depths than were measured potentially adding groundwater to the hpa this is important in understanding how groundwater recharge is distributed both spatially and temporally in the hpa region in the dry valley 64 w m 2 1 0 mm day 1 or 38 of available energy 169 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 105 w m 2 or 62 to h fig 4 5 these seasonal results are comparable to a study conducted at another tallgrass prairie overlying the hpa in north central oklahoma who found an et estimate of 1 5 mm day 1 burba and verma 2001 in early fall a greater fraction of precipitation rapidly infiltrates the upland dunes whereby water quickly moves through the root zone without being lost as evaporation from the soil or used in transpiration at this time only 40 w m 2 0 6 mm day 1 or 27 of available energy 147 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 107 w m 2 or 73 to h fig 4 5 although substantial precipitation occurred in the fall season local topography and soil properties allow for greater infiltration causing less water to be lost to the atmosphere and the potential for more water to recharge the hpa therefore since the upland dunes represent 70 of the sand hills land cover the spring and fall seasons represent the time periods with the greatest potential for recharge to the hpa 4 3 diel variability on diel time scales fig 6 λe remains the dominant component of energy partitioning in subirrigated meadows fig 6a with a maximum value of 343 w m 2 at 1500 h cst roughly one hour after the time of peak rn at sunrise total water potential within the vegetation is closer to equilibrium with soil moisture content than at any other time of the day tiaz and zeiger 2006 because there is virtually no water limitation in the subirrigated meadow 89 of available energy is partitioned to λe over the course of the day leaving only 11 partitioned to h fig 6a average hourly g is only slightly positive in the afternoon and evening 1300 2100 h cst and overall is quite minimal at this site maximum of 16 w m 2 at 1600 h on a diel basis thus the subirrigated meadow partitions nearly all available energy to λe acting as a constant source of atmospheric moisture throughout the day as long as rn is positive at the dry valley partitioning of λe and h on diel timescales is nearly balanced maximums of 266 and 233 w m 2 respectively throughout an average day with partitions of 45 and 55 of available energy respectively fig 6b daily maximum λe and h occur around the same hour as maximum rn equal partitioning between λe and h is an indication that this site is more water limited and that h plays a larger role in the daily energy budget compared to the energy limited subirrigated meadow g was slightly higher at the dry valley with an hourly average maximum of 25 w m 2 occurring at 1600 h cst the fact that λe is reduced on a diel basis compared to the subirrigated meadow is indicative of increased soil water limitation on an average day during the growing season 68 of available energy in the upland dune site is partitioned to h maximum of 225 w m 2 while only 32 is partitioned to λe maximum of 118 w m 2 fig 6c interestingly peak λe occurs one hour before maximum rn here due to the abundance of exposed soil g utilizes 18 75 w m 2 of available energy at the expense of λe throughout the day compared to the dry valley site the diel cycle of h is nearly identical at the upland dune site 5 conclusions and future research this research has investigated the surface energy partitioning of three of the four major ecosystems in the nebraska sand hills region evapotranspiration is not uniform among our three sites because of varying microclimate and land cover type i e vegetation cover soil moisture availability and topography which were found to have a large influence on how water moves through the soil plant atmosphere continuum our results support the findings by sridhar et al 2006 in that precipitation and soil moisture availability are critical controlling factors in determining et and thus the hydrologic cycle of the nebraska sand hills region using our findings we can now investigate the regional water budget with a better understanding of this semi arid region s hydrologic behavior the largest regional evaporative losses occur in the subirrigated meadows where groundwater is naturally discharged from the hpa although it is limited in spatial extent 10 of regional land cover the main reason why the nebraska sand hills is the main location for net recharge to the hpa is that the majority of the region s land cover 85 is comprised of dry valleys and upland dunes where groundwater recharge is occurring and et is lowest results from our energy balance elucidate intricate differences in how the plants at each site partition energy in order to utilize water most effectively with different soil moisture limitations after combining annual precipitation with et the subirrigated meadows represent a net loss of water on the order of 364 mm of water while the dry valleys and upland dunes represent net gains 83 mm and 158 mm respectively to soil moisture and potential recharge to the hpa overall we conclude that the overall recharge potential to the hpa was 87 3 mm in 2004 seasonal estimates of et can be roughly calculated using regional climate modeling if sufficient input parameters are available but this study provides in situ observations that do not rely on assumptions that are inherently embedded in hydrological models this research provides a new understanding of the hydrologic behavior of the sand hills region on different time scales that can be utilized in future modeling efforts that examine how the seasonality of energy partitioning impacts regional hydrology if climate change alters the intensity and frequency of precipitation events for example a major finding from our study is that the greatest seasonal λe occurred during the summer primarily due to varying limitations of soil moisture where the subirrigated meadows partition 85 while the dry valleys and upland dunes partition 60 and 48 of available summer energy respectively to λe on a diel basis the vast majority of energy is partitioned to λe in the subirrigated meadows while λe and h are nearly balanced at the dry valleys and h dominates energy partitioning in the upland dunes on a diel basis the upland dunes and the dry valleys begin to shift energy partitioning away from λe and to h one hour prior to peak daily net radiation where the subirrigated meadows make this shift one hour after peak net radiation this is a direct reflection of 1 the variation in soil moisture limitation and 2 assumed differences in transpiration by the different plant communities subirrigated meadow c3 c4 mix dry valley c4 upland dune c4 cam mix present at each site plants in the subirrigated meadows utilize ample soil water throughout the day while those in the dry valleys and upland dunes likely decrease photosynthetic rates earlier in the day because of soil water limitation not because radiation is lacking therefore measurements of leaf level gas exchange photosynthesis and respiration of control plots at each breb study site would advance our findings about how c3 c4 and cam species behave on the different time scales in the context of energy partitioning in this study however our results provide detailed information about connections between soil water availability and energy partitioning that will refine future modeling of plant physiological behavior on varying time scales which in turn impacts various land use practices ex irrigation scheduling to planting and harvest timing to grazing capacity that rely on accurate estimations of regional hydrology and plant water relationships although a groundwater well is present at the subirrigated meadow and in various locations throughout the upland areas at gsrl future research on this subject would be assisted by installation of groundwater wells to accompany the breb stations at each of the study sites this would provide direct means to investigate connections between groundwater depth fluctuations and the soil moisture available to plant communities present without the need for modeling our findings show that soil moisture dynamics in the nebraska sand hills region are one of the most critical aspects to the organization of hydrology plant community structure and composition and resulting energy partitioning crop models that simulate growth development and water consumption by different species present in the sand hills such as prairie grasses could potentially benefit from the estimates of et outlined in this research future estimates of groundwater recharge to the hpa will benefit from this research since it provides insight into how the regional water budget behaves which is commonly difficult to determine accurately by other less direct means conflicts of interest the authors of this research have no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgements the authors of this research would like to thank the managers of the gudmundsen sandhills research laboratory for maintenance and upkeep of the facility we also appreciate the independent peer reviews this research was supported by internal

8504,study region the nebraska sand hills consisting of four major land cover types 1 lakes and wetlands 5 for both 2 subirrigated meadows 10 3 dry valleys 20 and 4 upland dunes 65 study focus examination of surface energy and water balances on multiple temporal scales with primary focus on latent heat flux λe and evapotranspiration et to gain a better understanding of the annual seasonal and diel properties of surface energy partitioning among different sand hills ecosystems to improve regional water resource management new hydrological insights for the region based on surface energy and water balance measurements using bowen ratio energy balance systems at three locations during 2004 we find a strong spatial gradient between sites in latent λe and sensible h heat flux due to differences in topography soils and plant community composition on all timescales seasonally all land covers show the greatest λe in summer our results show that subirrigated meadows dry valleys and upland dunes allocate roughly 81 50 and 41 of available energy to λe respectively during the growing season the subirrigated meadow was the only cover type where cumulative annual et surpassed cumulative annual precipitation i e net loss of water to the atmosphere therefore the dry valleys and upland dunes are where net groundwater recharge to the high plains aquifer is occurring keywords nebraska high plains aquifer evapotranspiration energy balance bowen ratio 1 introduction fresh water is vital for human society and proper management of this resource will continue to gain importance in areas where scarcity is increasing it is a fundamental necessity for consumption by municipalities irrigation for agriculture and natural ecosystem function that requires careful consideration in both short and long term management strategies short term benefits include sustaining ample drinking water ensuring abundant food supplies flood control and habitat for plants and wildlife long term benefits include sustainable resource management and adaptive capacity in the context of climate change one of the most valuable sources of fresh water that supports human populations and agricultural

resource managers that rely on the hpa improved seasonal and diel estimates of water s role in energy partitioning among dominant land cover types in this region will benefit estimates of the regional

connections are often climate dependent rodriguez iturbe 2000 and are especially important to agricultural producers in areas prone to drought like the semi arid sand hills region of nebraska sridhar

occurs as a combination of evaporation e and transpiration t collectively referred to as evapotranspiration et regional climatology determines the energy and water available for λe that in turn influences the rate of recharge to the hpa although previous research has investigated regional scale satellite remote sensing estimates of et in the sand hills region szilagyi and jozsa 2013 szilagyi et al 2011 healey et al 2011 these analyses were restricted spatially and or temporally in this research we focus on the following research question that has not yet been addressed how does the surface energy balance at three of the four major land cover types in the nebraska sand hills region differ across timescales from diel to seasonal to annual the objective of this study is to expand the findings of healey et al 2011 and billesbach and arkebauer 2012 to establish a new understanding of how the dominant land cover types in the sand hills of nebraska partition available energy with primary focus on energy consumed in the processes of soil evaporation and plant transpiration on diel seasonal and growing season timescales we aim for our results to inform rangeland managers about differences in hydrologic characteristics of the major regional land cover types on different time scales to improve determination of the best land use practices i e grazing rotations grazing capacity planting and harvest timing of crops such as hay etc this research also aims to expand on results from modeling efforts by sridhar and wedin 2009 on upland dune ecosystems in the nebraska sand hills while providing new insight into energy partitioning in dry valley and subirrigated meadows on different temporal scales initiated by sridhar 2007 and healey et al 2011 these previous studies 1 provided remote sensing estimations of et from high resolution satellite imagery representing snapshots of energy partitioning at the times of satellite overpasses and 2 implemented statistical models to interpolate et estimations between sites in the sand hills this current study provides in situ observations at three of the four dominant ecosystems in the sand hills that have not been closely examined at different timescales thus extending beyond instantaneous estimations of et and utilizing observations instead of spatial interpolation to better understand the hydrologic behavior of the sand hills region 2 site description the regional climate of the nebraska sand hills is semi arid with a significant precipitation gradient from about 450 mm yr 1 in the west to over 650 mm yr 1 in the east szilagyi et al 2003 based on the 30 year climatology for this mid latitude region high plains regional climate center hprcc 2010 maximum precipitation normally occurs during the month of june 105 mm in general the area can be characterized as a continental climate hot summers and contrastingly cold winters with most precipitation falling in the summer season over the growing season april october the mean air temperature is 15 8 c with an average low temperature of 8 6 c and average high temperature of 22 9 c annual maximum temperatures typically occur in july the gudmundsen sand hills research laboratory gsrl is a 52 km2 multidisciplinary research facility located in the heart of the sand hills region near whitman nebraska latitude 42 06 n longitude 101 52 w elevation 1098 m a s l and the laboratory also serves as a livestock ranch fig 1 at gsrl three micrometeorological bowen ratio energy balance breb stations were established in 2002 and 2003 at an interdunal subirrigated meadow a dry shortgrass valley and an upland dune ecosystem the subirrigated meadow at gsrl roughly 6 5 km long and 800 m wide is flanked by dunes to the north and south that discharge soil water to the meadow gosselin et al 2006 where the water table often rises to the soil surface hay is harvested from the meadow to feed winter cattle and supplement dormant season grazing on dry valley and upland range sites the dry valley at gsrl roughly 4 km long and about 600 m wide is a flow through area where ground water typically flows parallel to the land surface and groundwater is typically between one to ten meters from the surface gosselin et al 2006 the upland dune site at gsrl where the water table is often located more than ten meters from the surface exhibits pronounced topographic undulations and an abundance of exposed soil sand with high hydraulic conductivity table 1 describes the soil properties for each of the three land cover types plant community composition varies at each site largely determined by soil moisture and texture differences the subirrigated meadow contains a dense canopy where the maximum growing season leaf area index lai is near three healey et al 2011 this site supports a mix of mosses shallow rooted 0 30 cm deep c3 grasses and deeper 30 cm rooted c4 grasses forbs and sedges e g medicago sativa bromus inermis leyss poa pratensis l spartina pectinata calamagrostis spp numerous carex spp cyperus spp scirpus spp and eleocharis spp in spring the abundant c3 grasses and sedges in the subirrigated meadow optimally photosynthesize when leaf temperatures reach 20 30 c although yamori et al 2014 determined a much broader range of optimal temperatures for c3 species 10 35 c leaf temperatures are often 1 10 c above below air temperature when air temperature is below above optimum depending on leaf level thermodynamics related to ambient wind speed vapor pressure deficit and solar irradiance campbell and norman 1998 the dry valley supports a sparser canopy with a maximum growing season lai of just over one healey et al 2011 and a higher proportion of c4 grasses and forbs with deeper root systems albertson 1937 found that c4 tallgrass prairie species can have root systems that extend over two meters into the soil profile the upland dune ecosystem has a very sparse canopy with a maximum growing season lai 0 3 consisting mostly of deep rooted c4 grasses and with the exception of species like yucca glauca shallow rooted crassulacean acid metabolism cam plants and some isolated forbs succulents and shrubs e g andropogon scoparius calamovilfa longifolia andropogon hallii panicum virgatum l eragrostis trichoides bouteloua gracillis and opuntia fragilis this site is a grass stabilized upland sand dune ecosystem where soil water holding capacity is increasingly limited due to increased infiltration potential i e high permeability heightened aridity coarse sandy soils and no upward vertical flow of groundwater thus these species must be opportunistic in capturing soil water that travels quickly through the sandy soil horizon previous research shows that the species distribution from the dry valley bottom to the upland dunes differs based on the topography pool 1914 barnes and harrison 1982 soil texture burzlaff 1962 and most importantly the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture tolstead 1942 3 materials and methods the surface energy balance at each of the three land cover types was calculated using breb systems using instrumentation described in table 2 at each of the three sites data were logged by campbell cr23x data loggers using campbell scientific am25 t solid state multiplexers to provide additional analog input channels observations were made once per second and 30 minute averages were recorded because a psychrometer exchanging mechanism was not available inherent biases between the individual temperature relative humidity sensors were removed by calibrating them using a precision platinum resistance thermometer and a reference dew point hygrometer for validation calculated energy fluxes were compared to values obtained from eddy covariance instrumentation installed at the dry valley site the procedure was also tested against eddy covariance instrumentation in a fallow oklahoma wheat field where flux system errors are estimated to be 15 w m 2 billesbach et al 2004 bowen ratio energy fluxes in this study were estimated to be within about 10 of the eddy covariance observations and positive negative flux values denote movement of matter or energy away from toward the land surface thus the overall surface energy balance can be written as 1 r n λ e h g where λe is the latent heat flux rn is net radiation h is the sensible heat flux g is the surface heat flux and all units are in w m 2 the bowen ratio bowen 1926 is then computed as 2 β h λ e to calculate et we divide λe by λρw where ρw is the density of water kg m 3 in this study we report fluxes of both λe and et in terms of energy w m 2 and water mm day 1 respectively reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated using the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 asce ewri 2005 using grass as the reference crop for growing season analyses we examined the snow free period from april october for seasonal analyses we defined spring as extending from april may summer as june august and fall as september october using daytime values of λe and et only we show a filtered time series of energy balance components for each of the three sites using a 7 day running mean to reduce noise associated with synoptic weather variability focusing instead on the seasonal variability all data were checked against a set of quality control criteria for validity data were flagged if the measured or calculated 30 minute breb values fall outside a set of limits for daily data questionable values were replaced by the arithmetic mean of the preceding and proceeding acceptable values when calculating totals for longer periods monthly or growing season the same procedure was applied for single missing days but linear interpolation was used for multiple missing days 4 results and discussion 4 1 growing season energy partitioning with the highest net radiation precipitation and soil moisture the subirrigated meadow exhibited the highest growing season average λe 216 w m 2 and total accumulated evaporative water loss total et 763 mm in fact the total et was nearly double that of precipitation 399 mm fig 2 indicating that the soil receives a regular replenishment of water from local groundwater sources even when precipitation is lacking as noted by gosselin et al 2006 this site is characterized by groundwater flow that has seasonally sustained upward vertical gradients and discharge with consistent replenishment by flow into the meadow from the north and south we estimated that the subirrigated meadow produced a growing season average et of 3 5 1 6 mm day 1 with the maximum rate of 6 4 mm day 1 occurring on june 14 which compares closely with results from burba et al 1999a 1999b who estimated et rates of 3 8 4 1 mm day 1 for open water in north central nebraska as well as lenters et al 2011 who measured et to equal 4 4 mm day 1 for a riparian wetland in central nebraska gosselin et al 2006 described the dry valley as an area where groundwater flows laterally and when vertical gradients of flow exist here they are typically downward dry valleys have a stronger dependence on precipitation to recharge soil moisture in the root zone and support λe rather than supplemental groundwater connections here accumulated precipitation 359 mm surpassed the annual cumulative et 276 mm fig 2 average growing season λe in the dry valley was 127 w m 2 et of 2 0 1 4 mm day 1 and the maximum rate of et 5 9 mm day 1 occurred a month later july 14 than in the subirrigated meadow these results are similar to a study by christie 1981 in an australian semi arid grassland who found growing season et to average around 2 7 mm day 1 the upland dune site is slightly windier hotter and less humid on average than the subirrigated meadow and dry valley table 3 despite the higher evaporative demand at this site higher air temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speed the upland dune produced the lowest growing season average λe of 89 w m 2 et of 1 4 0 8 mm day 1 with a maximum et rate of 3 8 mm day 1 occurring on july 9 accumulated precipitation in the upland dune site totaled 371 mm and accumulated et 213 mm was lowest among the three sites fig 2 however sensible heat flux h was higher and the average 2004 growing season ta was also warmest at this site by 0 2 c from april october energy partitioning gradients are noticeable among sites where the subirrigated meadow dry valley and upland dune sites partitioned 81 3 4 1 6 mm day 1 of et 50 2 0 1 4 mm day 1 of et and 41 1 4 0 8 mm day 1 of et of available energy to λe and 19 50 and 59 to h respectively when combining the growing season et with the precipitation in 2004 the subirrigated meadow system represents a net loss i e p et of 364 mm of water while the dry valley and upland dune represent net gains of 83 mm and 158 mm of water respectively scaled up according to the fraction of areal coverage for the different land cover types in the sand hills region 10 subirrigated meadows 20 dry valley and 65 upland dunes the overall net recharge of water to the hpa is found to be 87 3 mm in 2004 4 2 seasonal variability 4 2 1 spring in the transition from winter to spring ample soil water throughout the soil column and root zone fig 3 a of the subirrigated meadow allows for commencement of noticeable et increase as opposed to the dry valley and upland dune sites fig 2 in fact et increased by 39 at this time even though precipitation decreased by roughly 50 although measurements of noticeable et in spring are primarily a reflection of ample soil moisture in the top 10 25 cm fig 2 3 during spring in the subirrigated meadow 217 w m 2 3 5 mm day 1 or 77 of available energy 282 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 65 w m 2 or 23 to h figs 4 and 5 soil moisture in the dry valley is at or above field capacity throughout the top 1 m of soil until the end of spring fig 3b indicating that a large portion of et at this time is evaporation from the soil rather than transpiration via photosynthesis this is also evident in the difference between eto and et fig 2 during spring 120 w m 2 1 9 mm day 1 or 46 of available energy 261 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 141 w m 2 or 54 to h fig 4 5 being the most arid of the three sites the upland dune area shows minimal et accumulation in spring rapid increases in soil moisture within the top 10 cm occur shortly after sporadic spring precipitation events fig 3c transpiration is driven by these rapid pulses of precipitation because soil water quickly migrates to depths deeper than 1 m or beyond the root zone although seasonal precipitation events provide water for et the coarse sandy soils and assumed depth to groundwater requires plant species to 1 rapidly take advantage of limited soil water in the topmost layers of the soil profile with shallow root systems e g cam or 2 extend roots deeper in order to endure dry periods e g c4 to increase transpiration rates although soil moisture in the top 10 cm is at field capacity in spring likely due to snowmelt all other layers are at or near the permanent wilting point thus et in spring is 84 below the eto value which implies moisture stress in the root zone and or species that are not physiologically active at this time in the spring only 77 w m 2 1 2 mm day 1 or 35 of available energy 217 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 140 w m 2 or 65 to h fig 4 5 4 2 2 summer sustained soil moisture in the root zone and a consistently wet surface make evaporative losses at the subirrigated meadow energy limited so peak et occurred in july due to high net radiation during summer months table 1 fig 3a the groundwater table in the subirrigated meadow can decrease by roughly 0 8 1 3 m between late july and late september gosselin et al 1999 2006 although ample soil water in the root zone determines that et is energy limited at this site in early summer during our study period shallow soil depths 0 50 cm remain at field capacity throughout the growing season fig 3a on average 268 w m 2 4 3 mm day 1 or 85 of available energy 316 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 48 w m 2 or 15 to h over summer fig 4 5 by summer cumulative et in the dry valley has caught up to and nearly surpassed precipitation fig 2 due to high soil evaporation from shallow soil water fig 3b and 3 the topographic position of the station valley bottom where soil water may collect and maintain high soil moisture soil moisture in the 10 and 25 cm depths was near field capacity from summer until the end of the year fig 3b but more drying events occurred when compared to the subirrigated meadow fig 3a in the dry valley high summer et is due to and ample soil moisture and maximum seasonal energy availability here 180 w m 2 2 9 mm day 1 or 60 of available energy 300 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 120 w m 2 or 40 to h fig 4 5 at the upland dune site the greatest water loss also occurs at the height of the summer when available energy is at a maximum and water is available though not abundant relative to the other two sites in the upland dunes 124 w m 2 2 0 mm day 1 or 48 of available energy 258 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 134 w m 2 or 52 to h fig 4 5 soil moisture in the top 50 cm of the soil profile reached field capacity periodically after precipitation events but rapidly reduced to the wilting point during summer due to the abundance of the highly permeable coarse sand substrate the dry soil surface and near surface that existed most of the time during the summer at this site would also decrease soil evaporation 4 2 3 autumn in the fall 138 w m 2 2 2 mm day 1 or 76 of available energy 181 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 43 w m 2 or 24 to h in the subirrigated meadow fig 4 5 similar to spring and summer fall energy partitioning is still dominated by λe due to the dense plant cover utilizing easily accessible soil moisture near the surface soil layer however the difference between et and eto increases in the fall as photoperiod i e day length diminishes and air temperatures decrease in fall available energy is increasingly limited which results in a reduction of et at the dry valley site even though substantial precipitation occurred at this time virtually all precipitation either briefly replenishes soil moisture or infiltrates the soil profile to greater depths than were measured potentially adding groundwater to the hpa this is important in understanding how groundwater recharge is distributed both spatially and temporally in the hpa region in the dry valley 64 w m 2 1 0 mm day 1 or 38 of available energy 169 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 105 w m 2 or 62 to h fig 4 5 these seasonal results are comparable to a study conducted at another tallgrass prairie overlying the hpa in north central oklahoma who found an et estimate of 1 5 mm day 1 burba and verma 2001 in early fall a greater fraction of precipitation rapidly infiltrates the upland dunes whereby water quickly moves through the root zone without being lost as evaporation from the soil or used in transpiration at this time only 40 w m 2 0 6 mm day 1 or 27 of available energy 147 w m 2 is partitioned to λe and 107 w m 2 or 73 to h fig 4 5 although substantial precipitation occurred in the fall season local topography and soil properties allow for greater infiltration causing less water to be lost to the atmosphere and the potential for more water to recharge the hpa therefore since the upland dunes represent 70 of the sand hills land cover the spring and fall seasons represent the time periods with the greatest potential for recharge to the hpa 4 3 diel variability on diel time scales fig 6 λe remains the dominant component of energy partitioning in subirrigated meadows fig 6a with a maximum value of 343 w m 2 at 1500 h cst roughly one hour after the time of peak rn at sunrise total water potential within the vegetation is closer to equilibrium with soil moisture content than at any other time of the day tiaz and zeiger 2006 because there is virtually no water limitation in the subirrigated meadow 89 of available energy is partitioned to λe over the course of the day leaving only 11 partitioned to h fig 6a average hourly g is only slightly positive in the afternoon and evening 1300 2100 h cst and overall is quite minimal at this site maximum of 16 w m 2 at 1600 h on a diel basis thus the subirrigated meadow partitions nearly all available energy to λe acting as a constant source of atmospheric moisture throughout the day as long as rn is positive at the dry valley partitioning of λe and h on diel timescales is nearly balanced maximums of 266 and 233 w m 2 respectively throughout an average day with partitions of 45 and 55 of available energy respectively fig 6b daily maximum λe and h occur around the same hour as maximum rn equal partitioning between λe and h is an indication that this site is more water limited and that h plays a larger role in the daily energy budget compared to the energy limited subirrigated meadow g was slightly higher at the dry valley with an hourly average maximum of 25 w m 2 occurring at 1600 h cst the fact that λe is reduced on a diel basis compared to the subirrigated meadow is indicative of increased soil water limitation on an average day during the growing season 68 of available energy in the upland dune site is partitioned to h maximum of 225 w m 2 while only 32 is partitioned to λe maximum of 118 w m 2 fig 6c interestingly peak λe occurs one hour before maximum rn here due to the abundance of exposed soil g utilizes 18 75 w m 2 of available energy at the expense of λe throughout the day compared to the dry valley site the diel cycle of h is nearly identical at the upland dune site 5 conclusions and future research this research has investigated the surface energy partitioning of three of the four major ecosystems in the nebraska sand hills region evapotranspiration is not uniform among our three sites because of varying microclimate and land cover type i e vegetation cover soil moisture availability and topography which were found to have a large influence on how water moves through the soil plant atmosphere continuum our results support the findings by sridhar et al 2006 in that precipitation and soil moisture availability are critical controlling factors in determining et and thus the hydrologic cycle of the nebraska sand hills region using our findings we can now investigate the regional water budget with a better understanding of this semi arid region s hydrologic behavior the largest regional evaporative losses occur in the subirrigated meadows where groundwater is naturally discharged from the hpa although it is limited in spatial extent 10 of regional land cover the main reason why the nebraska sand hills is the main location for net recharge to the hpa is that the majority of the region s land cover 85 is comprised of dry valleys and upland dunes where groundwater recharge is occurring and et is lowest results from our energy balance elucidate intricate differences in how the plants at each site partition energy in order to utilize water most effectively with different soil moisture limitations after combining annual precipitation with et the subirrigated meadows represent a net loss of water on the order of 364 mm of water while the dry valleys and upland dunes represent net gains 83 mm and 158 mm respectively to soil moisture and potential recharge to the hpa overall we conclude that the overall recharge potential to the hpa was 87 3 mm in 2004 seasonal estimates of et can be roughly calculated using regional climate modeling if sufficient input parameters are available but this study provides in situ observations that do not rely on assumptions that are inherently embedded in hydrological models this research provides a new understanding of the hydrologic behavior of the sand hills region on different time scales that can be utilized in future modeling efforts that examine how the seasonality of energy partitioning impacts regional hydrology if climate change alters the intensity and frequency of precipitation events for example a major finding from our study is that the greatest seasonal λe occurred during the summer primarily due to varying limitations of soil moisture where the subirrigated meadows partition 85 while the dry valleys and upland dunes partition 60 and 48 of available summer energy respectively to λe on a diel basis the vast majority of energy is partitioned to λe in the subirrigated meadows while λe and h are nearly balanced at the dry valleys and h dominates energy partitioning in the upland dunes on a diel basis the upland dunes and the dry valleys begin to shift energy partitioning away from λe and to h one hour prior to peak daily net radiation where the subirrigated meadows make this shift one hour after peak net radiation this is a direct reflection of 1 the variation in soil moisture limitation and 2 assumed differences in transpiration by the different plant communities subirrigated meadow c3 c4 mix dry valley c4 upland dune c4 cam mix present at each site plants in the subirrigated meadows utilize ample soil water throughout the day while those in the dry valleys and upland dunes likely decrease photosynthetic rates earlier in the day because of soil water limitation not because radiation is lacking therefore measurements of leaf level gas exchange photosynthesis and respiration of control plots at each breb study site would advance our findings about how c3 c4 and cam species behave on the different time scales in the context of energy partitioning in this study however our results provide detailed information about connections between soil water availability and energy partitioning that will refine future modeling of plant physiological behavior on varying time scales which in turn impacts various land use practices ex irrigation scheduling to planting and harvest timing to grazing capacity that rely on accurate estimations of regional hydrology and plant water relationships although a groundwater well is present at the subirrigated meadow and in various locations throughout the upland areas at gsrl future research on this subject would be assisted by installation of groundwater wells to accompany the breb stations at each of the study sites this would provide direct means to investigate connections between groundwater depth fluctuations and the soil moisture available to plant communities present without the need for modeling our findings show that soil moisture dynamics in the nebraska sand hills region are one of the most critical aspects to the organization of hydrology plant community structure and composition and resulting energy partitioning crop models that simulate growth development and water consumption by different species present in the sand hills such as prairie grasses could potentially benefit from the estimates of et outlined in this research future estimates of groundwater recharge to the hpa will benefit from this research since it provides insight into how the regional water budget behaves which is commonly difficult to determine accurately by other less direct means conflicts of interest the authors of this research have no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgements the authors of this research would like to
