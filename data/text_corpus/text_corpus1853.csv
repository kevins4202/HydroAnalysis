9265,water shortage problems have received wide attention since the past decades as the global environment and climate continue to change to tackle with this escalating challenge generations of study has been conducted in the research for water utilization efficiency reclaimed water has been widely used in many countries for industry agriculture and landscape despite the economic value and environmental benefits the reclaimed water brings contents such as heavy metal ions organic pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms may enter the soil plant atmosphere system thus posing potential environmental health risks therefore many laws guidelines and standards have been published to maintain the security of irrigation with reclaimed water this paper compares the standards of irrigation with reclaimed water among different organizations and countries by analyzing the similarities and differences from different types of classification and water quality parameters requirements in which their advantages and limitations are demonstrated finally some suggestions are provided for future development and modification of the relevant standards in this field keywords reclaimed water agricultural irrigation green space irrigation water quality international standards data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction with global climate and environmental changes water stress and shortage are increasing in 2018 there were 2 3 billion people living in countries with water shortages with 721 million of them in countries with high or critical levels of water stress undp 2021 in the coming decades the global demand for water resources will increase significantly agriculture consumes more than 70 of water resources and the demand for water resources for industry and energy production will also climb significantly unesco 2017 recycling part of the water resources and improving the water utilization efficiency can help alleviate the water shortage problem reclaimed water is already widely used in many countries in industrial agricultural municipal and landscape applications yang et al 2013 fan et al 2016 according to statistical information from the food and agriculture organization fao and united nations un the actual global irrigated area is 2 75 million km2 aquastat 2014 the wastewater used and generated by agricultural irrigation cannot be ignored municipal wastewater is the main source of wastewater used directly in agriculture with 11 of global water withdrawals from municipalities of which 8 is discharged as wastewater i e about 330 km3 of municipal wastewater may be used to irrigate 40 million hm2 of agricultural land per year wastewater use of about 8000 m3 hm2 mateo sagasta et al 2015 representing 15 of the total irrigated area municipal wastewater reuse including agricultural irrigation is common in regions and countries such as the middle east north africa the mediterranean region australia aus china mexico and the united states usa unesco 2017 in addition to agricultural irrigation reclaimed water can also be used for landscape and green space irrigation within municipality such as irrigation in parks highway green belts landscapes around houses golf courses etc epa 2004 compared with untreated wastewater irrigation the pollution risk of reclaimed water irrigation is much lower and the reclaimed water contains nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus potassium and organic matters that may contribute to plant growth reclaimed water irrigation can also reduce pollutant emissions in the water environment reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and improve soil quality thereby producing certain environmental benefits chen et al 2014 feng et al 2003 the use of reclaimed water helps to reduce the self cleaning pressure on environmental waters thus helping to promote a virtuous cycle between irrigation water and environmental waters and irrigation with reclaimed water also has certain economic benefits the recovery of by products such as salt nitrogen and phosphorus from the production of reclaimed water helps to reduce treatment and operating costs and includes the assessment of environmental benefits and the promotion of recycled water for the community which helps to increase the willingness of the government and the public to invest and consume it li et al 2014a 2014b unesco 2017 it can be seen that in the field of agricultural and green space irrigation reclaimed water irrigation has great application potential at the same time studies have confirmed that the reclaimed water may contain a variety of toxic trace substances such as organic pollutants heavy metal ions etc and pathogenic microorganisms these pollutants will enter the soil vegetation and groundwater with irrigation and accumulate which may harm the soil plant ecosystem cause certain pollution to groundwater and then threaten human health ofori et al 2021 wang et al 2017 lyu et al 2022 therefore reclaimed water irrigation needs to be regulated by certain laws and regulations as well as some standard guidelines some organizations such as the world health organization who the european union eu and the un have closely followed the issue of reclaimed water and have published relevant documents who 2006 ep and ceu 2018 ep and ceu 2020 unesco 2017 however there are still many shortcomings for instance the sustainable development goal target 6 3 of un un sgd 6 3 which related to wastewater reuse and water quality still lacks wastewater data for many countries who and unhabitat 2018 other relevant international regional and civil society organizations are still scarce and relevant regional or global research exchanges surveys and statistics and information disclosure still need to be strengthened it has been reported that the area irrigated with unsafe wastewater may be ten times the area irrigated with treated wastewater even more scott et al 2010 therefore addressing the issue of reclaimed water and regulating its use can help reduce the environmental and health risks associated with water pollution even the current widely required level of secondary treatment can already largely remove biodegradable organic matters from wastewater with considerable environmental and social benefits li et al 2014a 2014b unesco 2017 based on the above background this paper compares and analyzes the guidelines and standards related to irrigation with reclaimed water from different countries and organizations around the world reviews the development history and characteristics of different types of classification analyzes the similarities and differences in water quality parameters as well as advantages and disadvantages of them it is expected to provide some common references and update suggestions for related standards 2 overview of reclaimed water irrigation standards 2 1 standards related to water reuse worldwide many organizations and countries have promulgated laws regulations guidelines and standards for irrigation with reclaimed water the world health organization published who guidelines for the safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater in 2006 who 2006 in 2002 2007 and 2010 china issued the gb t 18919 2002 the reuse of urban recycling water classified standard gb 20922 2007 the reuse of urban recycling water quality of farmland irrigation water and gb t 25499 2010 the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for green space irrigation aqsiq 2002a aqsiq 2007 aqsiq 2010 in 2020 gb t 18920 the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for urban miscellaneous use replaced the 2002 version aqsiq 2002b aqsiq 2020 the industry standard sl368 2006 standards of reclaimed water quality was also released in 2006 mwrc 2007 the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan also formulated guidelines for the reuse of treated wastewater in 2005 mlit 2005 in 2004 the usa environmental protection agency issued guidelines for water reuse which was revised in 2012 epa 2004 epa 2012 at the same time some states in the united states have also issued relevant legal provisions such as the california water recycling criteria in california the guidelines titled reuse of treated wastewater guidance manual in pennsylvania and new hampshire s land treatment and disposal of reclaimed wastewater in new hampshire epa 2004 epa 2012 aus published australian guidelines for water recycling managing health and environmental risks in 2006 ephca 2006 russia enacted sanpin 2 1 7 573 96 hygienic requirements to wastewater and sewage sludge use for land irrigation and fertilization in 1996 mhr 1996 in 2010 israel enacted the public health ordinance effluent quality standards and rules for sewage treatment it replaces 1992 regulations on wastewater treatment from public health ordinance wai 2010 wai 1992 although the eu has long begun to control wastewater reuse it is mostly in the form of legal provisions the eu has also been exploring uniform standards and regulations in 2018 it issued a draft regulation of regulation of the european parliament and of the council on minimum requirements for water reuse and issued an official document in 2020 ep and ceu 2018 ep and ceu 2020 many eu countries have also issued relevant standards for example cyprus issued no 106 1 2002 the water pollution control act 2002 in 2002 on this basis decree no 296 03 06 05 general conditions for disposing of waste from municipal wastewater treatment plants was introduced in 2005 manrec 2002 manrec 2005 france issued regulations on the reuse of irrigation water for agriculture and green space in 2010 and amended them in 2014 msaphf 2010 msaphf 2014 greece issued kya673 400 199 no 5673 400 measures and conditions for processing municipal wastewater in 2002 and fek b 354 08 03 2011 decisions no co 145116 determination of measures conditions and procedures for the reuse of treated wastewater and other provisions in 2011 meeccg 2002 meeccg 2011 in italy the regulating technical standards for wastewater reuse was issued in 2003 mei 2003 and in 2006 portugal issued the guidelines for good practice of water reuse for irrigation portuguese standard np 4434 iqp 2005 spain issued spanish regulations for water reuse royal decree 1620 2007 in 2007 asersa 2007 etc jordan was introduced js 893 2006 water reclaimed domestic wastewater in 2006 replacing js 893 2002 water reclaimed wastewater ismj 2006 ismj 2002 saudi arabia enacted treated sanitary wastewater and its reuse regulations in 2000 mowe 2000 2 2 classification of reclaimed water irrigation uses for the recycling of wastewater there is no unified guideline document in the international arena li et al 2009a li et al 2009b li et al 2014a 2014b parameters and values of reclaimed water quality standards are related to their classifications based on irrigation purposes crop types and irrigation methods the standard classifications of various organizations and countries combine some local characteristics li et al 2014a 2014b table 1 summarizes the classifications of reclaimed water irrigation standards of some organizations and countries the purposes of reclaimed water irrigation will involve farmland irrigation and green space or landscape irrigation irrigation of farmland is the most widely involved such as the standards of us china spain and saudi arabia epa 2012 aqsiq 2007 asersa 2007 mowe 2000 the european union aus france greece portugal and jordan have more specific agricultural or other uses ep and ceu 2020 ephca 2006 msaphf 2014 meeccg 2011 iqp 2005 jism 2006 green space or landscape irrigation are often used as a subordinate branch of municipal miscellaneous uses such as american and spanish standards epa 2012 asersa 2007 but they are also separately classified as an important use in countries such as china greece and japan aqsiq 2010 meeccg 2011 mlit 2005 landscape irrigation is also listed separately in the australian guidelines ephca 2006 when reclaimed water is used for agricultural irrigation it needs to be differentiated according to the type of crop different crop types imply different crop usages crop characteristics and exposure risks of people exposed to crop organizations and countries such as eu usa aus cyprus france greece portugal and spain divide edible crops into food crops processed edible crops and unprocessed processed commercial food crops to eat ep and ceu 2020 epa 2012 ephca 2006 manrec 2005 msaphf 2014 meeccg 2011 iqp 2005 asersa 2007 the standard of jordan is not allowed to use reclaimed water to irrigate vegetables that are eaten raw and irrigation must be stopped two weeks before harvesting the crop when using reclaimed water for the purposes of irrigating fruit trees with the exclusion of fallen fruits that are in contact with the soil ismj 2006 china divides it into dryland cereal and oil crops wheat soybean corn etc which rely on natural precipitation and artificial irrigation in arid and semi arid areas and paddy fields cereals rice etc which should grow in deep and fertile soil and maintain a certain water layer of cereal crops and open field vegetables except greenhouse vegetables that need to be processed cooked and peeled aqsiq 2007 cereals and oil crops are also specified in portuguese and spanish standards france portugal and spain have classifications that take into account vegetables and fruit trees iqp 2005 asersa 2007 msaphf 2014 for inedible crops eu aus cyprus greece portugal spain etc all consider fodder crops ep and ceu 2020 ephca 2006 manrec 2005 meeccg 2011 iqp 2005 asersa 2007 chinese standards consider fiber crops cotton jute flax and other crops that produce plant fiber aqsiq 2007 and portugal also considers crops for textile iqp 2005 the division of countries such as the us is only based on whether it is edible or need to be processed which is more inclined to consider from the perspective of consumers however for the division of dryland and paddy fields in china aqsiq 2007 and the subdivision of crop types in france portugal and spain more factors were considered such as the textile and edible purposes the difference in the growth environment of dryland and paddy crops processing methods oil extraction cooking and peeling in which not only the consumers demands but also the perspectives of producers are considered msaphf 2014 iqp 2005 asersa 2007 who china usa israel cyprus greece portugal spain saudi arabia all have unrestricted irrigation and restricted irrigation divisions who 2006 aqsiq 2010 epa 2012 wai 2010 manrec 2005 meeccg 2011 iqp 2005 asersa 2007 jism 2006 the unrestricted irrigation defined by who mainly refers to the freedom of contact between crops and consumers who 2006 the definitions of restricted and unrestricted irrigation in other standards are similar but they will be described in more detail on specific occasions such as urban reuse of reclaimed water in the us has unrestricted irrigation and restricted irrigation two categories description of unrestricted irrigation is the use of reclaimed water for nonpotable applications in municipal settings where public access is not restricted and description of restricted irrigation is the use of reclaimed water for nonpotable applications in municipal settings where public access is controlled or restricted by physical or institutional barriers such as fencing advisory signage or temporal access restriction the above urban uses refer to the irrigation of places or areas such as recreational field golf course landscape parks and recreation centers athletic fields school yards and playing fields epa 2012 the reuse of urban recycling water in china divides green space irrigation into unrestricted green space and restricted green space similar to that of the united states unrestricted green space refers to green space that is completely open to the public such as parks residential areas and campus green space etc restricted green space refers to green space that restricts public access such as highway green belts cemeteries and other green space aqsiq 2010 compared with agricultural irrigation which still has laws to follow the division of green landscape is more chaotic in addition to the common municipal reuse branches green space irrigation such as gardens or green belts and landscape irrigation china discusses reclaimed water forestry reuse alongside agricultural and pasture reuse referring to forestry and ornamental plant irrigation planting and raising seedlings mwrc 2006 sprinkling water in japanese standards refers to irrigate trees plants and lawns or flush roads mlit 2005 greece counts golf irrigation as urban uses and periurban green meeccg 2011 spain defines golf course irrigation as recreational uses asersa 2007 the french spanish and jordanian standards all take into account horticultural uses such as nurseries floral crops cut flowers and ornamental crops msaphf 2014 asersa 2007 ismj 2006 in terms of irrigation methods who considers that it can be moderately relaxed under drip irrigation conditions who 2006 the eu also imposes restrictions on drip irrigation or other irrigation methods that avoid direct contact with edible parts for food crops processed food crops and non food crops ep and ceu 2020 the urban reuse of the greek standard also takes into account the prohibition of sprinkler forms of irrigation that it can be moderately relaxed under drip irrigation conditions meeccg 2011 the spanish standard calls for broader turbidity limits when drip or micro sprinkler irrigation is used in table 6 asersa 2007 jordanian standards require that sprinkler irrigation is prohibited except for golf course irrigation which must be done at night ismj 2006 with the development and popularization of various irrigation methods the formulation of reclaimed water irrigation standards should pay more attention to taking irrigation methods into consideration in addition jordan divides the standards into standard groups and guidelines the former is used to require the implementation of strict compliance with the basic water quality parameters limit values the latter is used to guide the implementation of the control of heavy metals and other meticulous water quality parameters ismj 2006 chinese reclaimed water agriculture and greening reuse standards divide the parameters into two major categories basic control items and selective control items aqsiq 2007 aqsiq 2010 united nations environment programme global environment monitoring system for freshwater also divided into 1 level simple water quality parameters and 2 level parameters unep 2021 this grouping method not only ensures the comprehensiveness and basic security of the measurement indicators but also has a certain flexibility of execution table 2 the russian standard mainly distinguishes between sewage reuse and sludge reuse mhr 1996 israeli wastewater treatment standards are relatively strict according to soil sensitivity it is divided into unrestricted irrigation and river water replenishment while ensuring that it is almost harmless to the soil and water sources wai 2010 although the italian standard does not provide a more detailed classification of uses and occasions it gives many reference indicators mei 2003 some eu countries have more detailed classification of reclaimed water standards in terms of specific uses which is more meaningful for countries with higher water quality treatment levels cyprus france portugal and jordan divide the quality of reclaimed water into different grades and the corresponding grades of irrigation water can be selected for different purposes manrec 2005 msaphf 2014 iqp 2005 ismj 2006 this classification method may become a trend after the refinement and development of reclaimed water irrigation 3 reclaimed water quality parameters 3 1 organic and nutrient parameters the parameters of organic and nutrients mainly include biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do anionic surfactants las total phenol tph volatile phenol vph pentachlorophenol pcp chloral tetrachloroethylene perc total chlorinated solvents tcs total aldehydes tal acrolein formaldehyde formald trichloromethane sum of concentrations tthm total aromatic solvents tas benzo a pyrene b a p benzene total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 totail organic nitrogen solvents tons fat oil and grease fog petroleum petro and pesticides etc most countries have given bod limit values and parameters such as cod do las nitrogen and phosphorus are also involved constantly bod cod and do are comprehensive parameters of organic pollution in water bodies higher bod values indicate higher organic content and more serious pollution in water zhang and yang 2011 xu and wang 2018 cod measures the level of organic pollution in a water body by the oxygen produced from the oxidation of organic matter by strong chemical oxidants wang and wang 2022 the content of do can reflect the quality of water and its self purification ability wu and zhu 2020 bod focuses on reflecting organic pollutants that can be degraded by microorganisms cod focuses on measuring the organic compound oxidized by the oxidant do focuses on the oxygen content in the water itself due to the difficulty of degradation of organic pollutants in water bodies and the strong dependence on biochemical degradation bod organic pollution has a strong comprehensive measurement effect currently many standards mostly use five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and cod and do can be considered as additional parameters to supplement the measurement of organic pollution common nitrogen and phosphorus parameters include tn kjeldahl nitrogen nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 elemental phosphorus tp etc as important nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus play an important role in the growth and development of crops nitrogen promotes plant growth under long term effects liang et al 2021 phosphorus plays a role in photosynthetic reactions cells energy transfer and respiration marschner 2011 fernandes et al 2015 excessive intake of nitrogen and phosphorus will also have certain adverse effects on crops such as affecting the population structure of cotton fields leading to premature aging of hybrid bolls and reduced yield of hybrid cotton yang et al 2020 the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in normal wastewater treatment results are basically within the controllable range but for some special cases such as in sandy soils with low phosphorus content and high mobility saentho et al 2022 and acidic soils where high nitrogen content tends to exacerbate soil acidification tian and niu 2015 therefore it is recommended to select appropriate nitrogen and phosphorus parameters and limit values according to the results of water quality treatment and the requirements of soil types in the current water quality monitoring results of most countries the pollution of las basically feet the water quality standards and occasionally exceeds the standard in some months and water bodies the washing liquid washing powder and detergent commonly used in people s life belong to las therefore the catering industry car washing and road construction are easy to become the main sources of las pollution rural areas have little contact with their pollution sources so this parameter can be disregarded for urban irrigation whether to set relevant limit values can be considered according to the water source the las limit values in some current reclaimed water irrigation standards are outdated and overly conservative when compared to actual test data tang et al 2016 mao et al 2021 uning et al 2022 if this parameter is considered to be retained it is suggested to reduce the limit values especially for urban reclaimed water irrigation petroleum phenols chloral benzene etc are mainly due to industrial pollution the exposure to reclaimed water is limited but as the types involved are still increasing with technological development more research and evaluation is needed 3 2 inorganic parameters the parameters of inorganic mainly include total dissolved solids tds chloride cl chlorine residual cl2 res boron b fluoride f ph sulfide adsorption ration sar total water hardness twh calculated as caco3 electrical conductance ec magnesium mg calcium ca sodium na phosphide p include po4 sulfide s hydrogen sulfide h2s sulfur trioxide so3 sulfate so4 2 hydrogen carbonate hco4 selenium se aluminum al lithium li and cyanide cn among them the comprehensive parameters are tds ph sar total water hardness and ec tds and ec are proportional to the ion content and reflect the cleanliness of the water body ph reflects the acidity of water and has a great impact on both crop growth and metabolism and soil microbial activity different standards give slightly different ph limits for example 6 0 9 0 in the us japan and china are closer around 5 5 8 5 and 6 5 8 5 in israel ph limits should be stricter considering the potential salinization of soil brought about by long term irrigation with reclaimed water and the relevance of ph to the concentration of heavy metals or other substances epa 2012 sar and total water hardness mainly measures the content of ca2 and mg2 the increase of irrigation water hardness may cause pipe blockage and affect work efficiency and equipment life tamiru and bekele 2020 jia et al 2020 also it may cause environmental problems such as an increase in groundwater hardness hardness may be related to heavy metal plasma content and there may be some seasonal fluctuations yesilnacar and gulluoglu 2008 tamiru and bekele i̇lhan et al 2020 2021 currently there are few studies on the risk assessment of hardness in reclaimed water irrigation relevant research should be strengthened and strict supervision should be carried out in areas with high hardness for stable water quality areas chloride pollution fluoride pollution and sulfide pollution mainly from the chemical industry mining industry etc and limited contact with irrigation water can be ignored water treatment often use chlorine or chlorine dioxide disinfection residual chlorine exceeds the standard will have a significant irritating smell bringing users an intuitive sense of unpleasantness and will react with other organic substances in the water causing harm to human health so the residual chlorine limit is very necessary for crops the range of reasonable b concentrations is very narrow in arid semi arid or coastal areas b often exceeds crop requirements due to poor drainage or intrusion of seawater with high b content and diffusion of seawater aerosols landi et al 2019 although b is involved in many crop metabolic processes some studies believe that the effect of boron on vascular plants has been completely overturned lewis 2019 so a new round of confirmation research and evaluation should be carried out on the toxicity of boron to crops therefore it is necessary for many countries to specify b limits in their water quality standards for reclaimed water irrigation at low concentrations se has a positive effect on abiotic stress regulation kaur et al 2014 so for reclaimed water irrigation perhaps selenium deserves further attention al and li are also metals that are easily accessible in daily life the aluminum 5 mg l and lithium 2 5 mg l given by israel are good reference objects 3 3 heavy metal parameters some countries give a variety of heavy metal pollutant parameters such as arsenic as hydrargyrum mercury or hg chromium cr nickel ni lead pb cadmium cd zinc zn iron fe copper cu manganese mn molybdenum mo vanadium v beryllium be cobalt co barium ba stannum sn and titanium ti u heavy metals are widely used in agriculture chemical industry pharmaceutical industry and other fields bringing certain risks to the environment and human health and have always attracted people s attention tiwari et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to control the content of heavy metal pollutants in reclaimed water heavy metals and their compounds are used in a wide variety of industries and are highly toxic so they are distinguished from other inorganic and organic parameters and are discussed separately in this section heavy metal pollutants often have a major impact on human health such as as cr and cd which can cause genomic instability and high doses of hg and lead pb which can induce severe complications such as kidney failure abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea balali mood et al 2021 bernhoft 2012 tsai et al 2017 as co cr and ni exhibit the highest toxicity in water bodies vinod et al 2019 although the comprehensive parameters such as tds and hardness will change when the heavy metal content is too high it is still necessary to be selective about the heavy metal items when it comes to more specific monitoring and tracing according to the list of carcinogens published by the who class i carcinogens include as inorganic arsenic compounds be beryllium compounds cd cadmium compounds chromium ⅵ compounds nickel compounds et al class ii carcinogens include co cobalt compounds cobalt metal without tungsten carbide cobalt sulfate and other soluble cobalt ii salts pb molybdenum trioxide ni and nickel alloys et al class ⅲ carcinogens include arsenobetaine and other organic arsenic compounds that are not metabolized in humans chromium ⅲ compounds implanted foreign bodies of metallic chromium or titanium and of cobalt based chromium based and titanium based alloys stainless steel and depleted uranium hematite lead compounds organic maneb hg and mercury inorganic compounds et al carcinogen categories can inform the selection of heavy metal pollutant indices and in addition factors such as local industrial structure and geography are necessary to consider for example some studies have found that the content of fe and mn in surface water of china is relatively high the average values of mn co as and ni exceed the maximum allowable values for drinking water stipulated by the us epa and the average values of ni cd and cr in us surface water are also higher than the drinking water values recommended by who 2017 and usepa 2009 so localities should reasonably select heavy metal parameters according to the survey and statistical results vinod et al 2019 it can be seen from the table that the limits of cu mo and co in china are 0 5 1 0 mg l 0 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l which are relatively loose compared with other countries especially for mo and co co at 0 1 1 0 mg l will be toxic to most crops feed crops grown from soils with high mo content may be toxic to livestock it is recommended to moderately lower the mo and co limits ayers and westcot 1985 pb parameters in the usa are also high compared to other countries be parameter of china restrictions are also too harsh jordan and saudi arabia have more lenient regulations for zn at 5 mg l and 4 mg l respectively heavy metal parameters for reclaimed water irrigation often refer to other types of water quality standards or guidelines that are older most of the standards have references to criteria of fao ayers and westcot 1985 some of the limits in this criteria are lack of relevant data for example the limit value for cr is stated as toxicological data are not available and conservative limits are recommended and the limit value for pb is stated as plant cell growth is inhibited at very high concentrations moreover the criteria is originally intended to guide irrigation water and perhaps more caution should be exercised for reclaimed water because of the possible synergistic effects of multiple contaminants 3 4 hygiene and sensory parameters hygiene and sensory parameters are the top priority of reclaimed water quality requirements who and other organizations or countries still give e coli and worm egg indicator requirements although there are no clear requirements for other types of indicators the parameters of hygiene and sensory parameters mainly include escherichia coliform e coli fecal coliform salmonellae legionella spp ascaris lumbricoides eggs taenia saginata and taenia solium eggs helminth eggs chromaticity turbidity stink total suspended solids tss and exterior e coli fecal coliforms ascaris lumbricoides eggs and helminth eggs are pathogenic biological parameters common water bacteriological parameter bacteria include total coliforms fecal coliforms and e coli total coliform is a group of bacteria with certain characteristics related to fecal contamination and fecal coliform which is part of total coliform can reflect the degree of fecal contamination of water more closely than total coliform e coli is the main species of total coliforms and fecal coliforms salmonella is a pathogenic bacterium excreted in feces by human and animal patients or carriers sepac 2002 chen and yang 2020 currently e coli is used as parameter bacteria in many countries around the world aqsiq 2020 and the definitions of total coliform and fecal coliform often need to be changed with taxonomic updates many of which are not related to fecal contamination especially total coliform salmonella appears in water with great variability and the isolation technique has limitations in sensitivity and selectivity compared to e coli which is more accurate in indicating fecal contamination so it can be considered in preference to e coli tallon 2005 sepac 2002 khan and gupta 2020 helminths are also a collective term for a group of pathogens that in low income and lower middle income countries are burdened by helminthic diseases caused by wastewater use ascaris lumbricoides is often used as the primary parameter due to the long survival time of eggs and low infectivity compared to other parasites bacteria and viruses however the main factor for helminths egg removal is settling so the efficiency of egg removal should be based on the type of worm egg with the lowest settling rate studies have shown that in clean water ascaris lumbricoides eggs settle slowly in low quality water ascaris lumbricoides eggs settle the fastest so ascaris lumbricoides as a representative parameter is also inappropriate therefore it is necessary to carry out further research on the more accurate parameter of worm eggs and it is necessary to distinguish the types of helminths eggs in the determination and detection of water quality feachem et al 1983 sengupta et al 2011 chromaticity turbidity stink tss and exterior are from the color turbidity level smell and other appearance of the performance of the visual response to the cleanliness of the water body for water body appearance parameters tss can be used as a comprehensive measure visual parameters and olfactory parameters can also be added in according to the demand 4 discussion through the previous review we found that the reclaimed water laws guidelines or standards of many organizations or countries have a long history but a considerable number of them have not been updated for many years the variability in the parameters chosen in different documents is also significant and the potential lag of the standards relative to the current urban and agricultural development is unavoidable for some developed countries due to the advanced technology and research emphasis the classification of reclaimed water will be more detailed or more parameters were selected to constrain the application which can be tough for developing countries for example the newater of singapore directly treats reclaimed water to exceed the who drinking water standard level lee and tan 2016 who 2011 which is lack of reference for the vast majority of countries and regions that only need to meet general irrigation and recreational activities due to the problem of water shortage some developing countries were forced to start using reclaimed water for irrigation very early and many of them have not been effectively monitored and demonstrated with economic globalization and industrial adjustment the problem of reclaimed water in developing countries may be more severe and urgent unesco 2017 through the comparison and analysis above we make the following recommendations based on the classification and parameters that appear in most of the standards and the necessity of the parameters we recommend that the reclaimed water parameters should be at least divided into two categories restricted irrigation and unrestricted irrigation or agricultural irrigation and urban green space or landscape irrigation needing to formulate and adjust the specific applicable scenarios and crops of each category according to the actual situation if the consideration is more detailed it is more recommended to divide the recycled water quality into different levels various uses can match the corresponding level of irrigation water at the same time we selected some comprehensive parameters and parameters that need to be strictly controlled and divided them into first class parameters and second class parameters as recommendations for first class parameters the organic and nutrient parameters we selected the comprehensive parameter bod5 to measure the overall pollution level for the inorganic parameter we chose three comprehensive parameters of tds ph and twh to measure the cleanliness of the water body and ensure the safety of transportation and water uses at the same time we also selected the method of control residual chlorine to control the effect of wastewater treatment for hygiene and sensory parameters we selected e coli and helminth eggs to reflect the content of pathogenic organisms in the water body meanwhile we selected stink and tss to ensure good water quality from both intuitive perception and comprehensive parameter limits for second class parameters we choose cod nh4 las sar ec ascaris lumbricoides eggs fecal coliforms li al se b and fluoride to measure the pollution levels of organic and nutrients inorganic and pathogenic microorganisms and then to ensure the crop safety heavy metal parameters present in most current standards such as as hg cr ni pb cd zn fe cu mn mo v be and co are still retained 5 conclusions in this paper we compiled and analyzed the literature on reclaimed water irrigation laws regulations guidelines and standards from who eu china usa aus russia israel jordan and etc it was found that most of the standards are more inclined to consumer point of view to consider the edibility of the crop and whether it is processed and need to consider more about aspects such as crop type and irrigation method the method of classifying reclaimed water quality in countries such as jordan france cyprus and portugal may become a trend the division of reclaimed water quality parameters into strict control groups and selective guidance control groups in jordan and china help to widely adapt to different regions of water quality parameters needs we recommend that reclaimed water irrigation parameters be divided into at least restricted and unrestricted irrigation or agricultural irrigation and green or landscape irrigation from the perspective of pollutant types this paper divides the reclaimed water irrigation parameters into four categories organic and nutrient parameters inorganic parameters heavy metal parameters and hygiene and sensory parameters it is recommended to keep bod5 tds ph e coli helminth eggs etc as the first class parameters for strict control and cod nh4 las sar ec b as hg

9265,water shortage problems have received wide attention since the past decades as the global environment and climate continue to change to tackle with this escalating challenge generations of study has been conducted in the research for water utilization efficiency reclaimed water has been widely used in many countries for industry agriculture and landscape despite the economic value and environmental benefits the reclaimed water brings contents such as heavy metal ions organic pollutants and pathogenic microorganisms may enter the soil plant atmosphere system thus posing potential environmental health risks therefore many laws guidelines and standards have been published to maintain the security of irrigation with reclaimed water this paper compares the standards of irrigation with reclaimed water among different organizations and countries by analyzing the similarities and differences from different types of classification and water quality parameters requirements in which their advantages and limitations are demonstrated finally some suggestions are provided for future development and modification of the relevant standards in this field keywords reclaimed water agricultural irrigation green space irrigation water quality international standards data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction with global climate and environmental changes water stress and shortage are increasing in 2018 there were 2 3 billion people living in countries with water shortages with 721 million of them in countries with high or critical levels of water stress undp 2021 in the coming decades the global demand for water resources will increase significantly agriculture consumes more than 70 of water resources and the demand for water resources for industry and energy production will also climb significantly unesco 2017 recycling part of the water resources and improving the water utilization efficiency can help alleviate the water shortage problem reclaimed water is already widely used in many countries in industrial agricultural municipal and landscape applications yang et al 2013 fan et al 2016 according to statistical information from the food and agriculture organization fao and united nations un the actual global irrigated area is 2 75 million km2 aquastat 2014 the wastewater used and generated by agricultural irrigation cannot be ignored municipal wastewater is the main source of wastewater used directly in agriculture with 11 of global water withdrawals from municipalities of which 8 is discharged as wastewater i e about 330 km3 of municipal wastewater may be used to irrigate 40 million hm2 of agricultural land per year wastewater use of about 8000 m3 hm2 mateo sagasta et al 2015 representing 15 of the total irrigated area municipal wastewater reuse including agricultural irrigation is common in regions and countries such as the middle east north africa the mediterranean region australia aus china mexico and the united states usa unesco 2017 in addition to agricultural irrigation reclaimed water can also be used for landscape and green space irrigation within municipality such as irrigation in parks highway green belts landscapes around houses golf courses etc epa 2004 compared with untreated wastewater irrigation the pollution risk of reclaimed water irrigation is much lower and the reclaimed water contains nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus potassium and organic matters that may contribute to plant growth reclaimed water irrigation can also reduce pollutant emissions in the water environment reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and improve soil quality thereby producing certain environmental benefits chen et al 2014 feng et al 2003 the use of reclaimed water helps to reduce the self cleaning pressure on environmental waters thus helping to promote a virtuous cycle between irrigation water and environmental waters and irrigation with reclaimed water also has certain economic benefits the recovery of by products such as salt nitrogen and phosphorus from the production of reclaimed water helps to reduce treatment and operating costs and includes the assessment of environmental benefits and the promotion of recycled water for the community which helps to increase the willingness of the government and the public to invest and consume it li et al 2014a 2014b unesco 2017 it can be seen that in the field of agricultural and green space irrigation reclaimed water irrigation has great application potential at the same time studies have confirmed that the reclaimed water may contain a variety of toxic trace substances such as organic pollutants heavy metal ions etc and pathogenic microorganisms these pollutants will enter the soil vegetation and groundwater with irrigation and accumulate which may harm the soil plant ecosystem cause certain pollution to groundwater and then threaten human health ofori et al 2021 wang et al 2017 lyu et al 2022 therefore reclaimed water irrigation needs to be regulated by certain laws and regulations as well as some standard guidelines some organizations such as the world health organization who the european union eu and the un have closely followed the issue of reclaimed water and have published relevant documents who 2006 ep and ceu 2018 ep and ceu 2020 unesco 2017 however there are still many shortcomings for instance the sustainable development goal target 6 3 of un un sgd 6 3 which related to wastewater reuse and water quality still lacks wastewater data for many countries who and unhabitat 2018 other relevant international regional and civil society organizations are still scarce and relevant regional or global research exchanges surveys and statistics and information disclosure still need to be strengthened it has been reported that the area irrigated with unsafe wastewater may be ten times the area irrigated with treated wastewater even more scott et al 2010 therefore addressing the issue of reclaimed water and regulating its use can help reduce the environmental and health risks associated with water pollution even the current widely required level of secondary treatment can already largely remove biodegradable organic matters from wastewater with considerable environmental and social benefits li et al 2014a 2014b unesco 2017 based on the above background this paper compares and analyzes the guidelines and standards related to irrigation with reclaimed water from different countries and organizations around the world reviews the development history and characteristics of different types of classification analyzes the similarities and differences in water quality parameters as well as advantages and disadvantages of them it is expected to provide some common references and update suggestions for related standards 2 overview of reclaimed water irrigation standards 2 1 standards related to water reuse worldwide many organizations and countries have promulgated laws regulations guidelines and standards for irrigation with reclaimed water the world health organization published who guidelines for the safe use of wastewater excreta and greywater in 2006 who 2006 in 2002 2007 and 2010 china issued the gb t 18919 2002 the reuse of urban recycling water classified standard gb 20922 2007 the reuse of urban recycling water quality of farmland irrigation water and gb t 25499 2010 the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for green space irrigation aqsiq 2002a aqsiq 2007 aqsiq 2010 in 2020 gb t 18920 the reuse of urban recycling water water quality standard for urban miscellaneous use replaced the 2002 version aqsiq 2002b aqsiq 2020 the industry standard sl368 2006 standards of reclaimed water quality was also released in 2006 mwrc 2007 the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan also formulated guidelines for the reuse of treated wastewater in 2005 mlit 2005 in 2004 the usa environmental protection agency issued guidelines for water reuse which was revised in 2012 epa 2004 epa 2012 at the same time some states in the united states have also issued relevant legal provisions such as the california water recycling criteria in california the guidelines titled reuse of treated wastewater guidance manual in pennsylvania and new hampshire s land treatment and disposal of reclaimed wastewater in new hampshire epa 2004 epa 2012 aus published australian guidelines for water recycling managing health and environmental risks in 2006 ephca 2006 russia enacted sanpin 2 1 7 573 96 hygienic requirements to wastewater and sewage sludge use for land irrigation and fertilization in 1996 mhr 1996 in 2010 israel enacted the public health ordinance effluent quality standards and rules for sewage treatment it replaces 1992 regulations on wastewater treatment from public health ordinance wai 2010 wai 1992 although the eu has long begun to control wastewater reuse it is mostly in the form of legal provisions the eu has also been exploring uniform standards and regulations in 2018 it issued a draft regulation of regulation of the european parliament and of the council on minimum requirements for water reuse and issued an official document in 2020 ep and ceu 2018 ep and ceu 2020 many eu countries have also issued relevant standards for example cyprus issued no 106 1 2002 the water pollution control act 2002 in 2002 on this basis decree no 296 03 06 05 general conditions for disposing of waste from municipal wastewater treatment plants was introduced in 2005 manrec 2002 manrec 2005 france issued regulations on the reuse of irrigation water for agriculture and green space in 2010 and amended them in 2014 msaphf 2010 msaphf 2014 greece issued kya673 400 199 no 5673 400 measures and conditions for processing municipal wastewater in 2002 and fek b 354 08 03 2011 decisions no co 145116 determination of measures conditions and procedures for the reuse of treated wastewater and other provisions in 2011 meeccg 2002 meeccg 2011 in italy the regulating technical standards for wastewater reuse was issued in 2003 mei 2003 and in 2006 portugal issued the guidelines for good practice of water reuse for irrigation portuguese standard np 4434 iqp 2005 spain issued spanish regulations for water reuse royal decree 1620 2007 in 2007 asersa 2007 etc jordan was introduced js 893 2006 water reclaimed domestic wastewater in 2006 replacing js 893 2002 water reclaimed wastewater ismj 2006 ismj 2002 saudi arabia enacted treated sanitary wastewater and its reuse regulations in 2000 mowe 2000 2 2 classification of reclaimed water irrigation uses for the recycling of wastewater there is no unified guideline document in the international arena li et al 2009a li et al 2009b li et al 2014a 2014b parameters and values of reclaimed water quality standards are related to their classifications based on irrigation purposes crop types and irrigation methods the standard classifications of various organizations and countries combine some local characteristics li et al 2014a 2014b table 1 summarizes the classifications of reclaimed water irrigation standards of some organizations and countries the purposes of reclaimed water irrigation will involve farmland irrigation and green space or landscape irrigation irrigation of farmland is the most widely involved such as the standards of us china spain and saudi arabia epa 2012 aqsiq 2007 asersa 2007 mowe 2000 the european union aus france greece portugal and jordan have more specific agricultural or other uses ep and ceu 2020 ephca 2006 msaphf 2014 meeccg 2011 iqp 2005 jism 2006 green space or landscape irrigation are often used as a subordinate branch of municipal miscellaneous uses such as american and spanish standards epa 2012 asersa 2007 but they are also separately classified as an important use in countries such as china greece and japan aqsiq 2010 meeccg 2011 mlit 2005 landscape irrigation is also listed separately in the australian guidelines ephca 2006 when reclaimed water is used for agricultural irrigation it needs to be differentiated according to the type of crop different crop types imply different crop usages crop characteristics and exposure risks of people exposed to crop organizations and countries such as eu usa aus cyprus france greece portugal and spain divide edible crops into food crops processed edible crops and unprocessed processed commercial food crops to eat ep and ceu 2020 epa 2012 ephca 2006 manrec 2005 msaphf 2014 meeccg 2011 iqp 2005 asersa 2007 the standard of jordan is not allowed to use reclaimed water to irrigate vegetables that are eaten raw and irrigation must be stopped two weeks before harvesting the crop when using reclaimed water for the purposes of irrigating fruit trees with the exclusion of fallen fruits that are in contact with the soil ismj 2006 china divides it into dryland cereal and oil crops wheat soybean corn etc which rely on natural precipitation and artificial irrigation in arid and semi arid areas and paddy fields cereals rice etc which should grow in deep and fertile soil and maintain a certain water layer of cereal crops and open field vegetables except greenhouse vegetables that need to be processed cooked and peeled aqsiq 2007 cereals and oil crops are also specified in portuguese and spanish standards france portugal and spain have classifications that take into account vegetables and fruit trees iqp 2005 asersa 2007 msaphf 2014 for inedible crops eu aus cyprus greece portugal spain etc all consider fodder crops ep and ceu 2020 ephca 2006 manrec 2005 meeccg 2011 iqp 2005 asersa 2007 chinese standards consider fiber crops cotton jute flax and other crops that produce plant fiber aqsiq 2007 and portugal also considers crops for textile iqp 2005 the division of countries such as the us is only based on whether it is edible or need to be processed which is more inclined to consider from the perspective of consumers however for the division of dryland and paddy fields in china aqsiq 2007 and the subdivision of crop types in france portugal and spain more factors were considered such as the textile and edible purposes the difference in the growth environment of dryland and paddy crops processing methods oil extraction cooking and peeling in which not only the consumers demands but also the perspectives of producers are considered msaphf 2014 iqp 2005 asersa 2007 who china usa israel cyprus greece portugal spain saudi arabia all have unrestricted irrigation and restricted irrigation divisions who 2006 aqsiq 2010 epa 2012 wai 2010 manrec 2005 meeccg 2011 iqp 2005 asersa 2007 jism 2006 the unrestricted irrigation defined by who mainly refers to the freedom of contact between crops and consumers who 2006 the definitions of restricted and unrestricted irrigation in other standards are similar but they will be described in more detail on specific occasions such as urban reuse of reclaimed water in the us has unrestricted irrigation and restricted irrigation two categories description of unrestricted irrigation is the use of reclaimed water for nonpotable applications in municipal settings where public access is not restricted and description of restricted irrigation is the use of reclaimed water for nonpotable applications in municipal settings where public access is controlled or restricted by physical or institutional barriers such as fencing advisory signage or temporal access restriction the above urban uses refer to the irrigation of places or areas such as recreational field golf course landscape parks and recreation centers athletic fields school yards and playing fields epa 2012 the reuse of urban recycling water in china divides green space irrigation into unrestricted green space and restricted green space similar to that of the united states unrestricted green space refers to green space that is completely open to the public such as parks residential areas and campus green space etc restricted green space refers to green space that restricts public access such as highway green belts cemeteries and other green space aqsiq 2010 compared with agricultural irrigation which still has laws to follow the division of green landscape is more chaotic in addition to the common municipal reuse branches green space irrigation such as gardens or green belts and landscape irrigation china discusses reclaimed water forestry reuse alongside agricultural and pasture reuse referring to forestry and ornamental plant irrigation planting and raising seedlings mwrc 2006 sprinkling water in japanese standards refers to irrigate trees plants and lawns or flush roads mlit 2005 greece counts golf irrigation as urban uses and periurban green meeccg 2011 spain defines golf course irrigation as recreational uses asersa 2007 the french spanish and jordanian standards all take into account horticultural uses such as nurseries floral crops cut flowers and ornamental crops msaphf 2014 asersa 2007 ismj 2006 in terms of irrigation methods who considers that it can be moderately relaxed under drip irrigation conditions who 2006 the eu also imposes restrictions on drip irrigation or other irrigation methods that avoid direct contact with edible parts for food crops processed food crops and non food crops ep and ceu 2020 the urban reuse of the greek standard also takes into account the prohibition of sprinkler forms of irrigation that it can be moderately relaxed under drip irrigation conditions meeccg 2011 the spanish standard calls for broader turbidity limits when drip or micro sprinkler irrigation is used in table 6 asersa 2007 jordanian standards require that sprinkler irrigation is prohibited except for golf course irrigation which must be done at night ismj 2006 with the development and popularization of various irrigation methods the formulation of reclaimed water irrigation standards should pay more attention to taking irrigation methods into consideration in addition jordan divides the standards into standard groups and guidelines the former is used to require the implementation of strict compliance with the basic water quality parameters limit values the latter is used to guide the implementation of the control of heavy metals and other meticulous water quality parameters ismj 2006 chinese reclaimed water agriculture and greening reuse standards divide the parameters into two major categories basic control items and selective control items aqsiq 2007 aqsiq 2010 united nations environment programme global environment monitoring system for freshwater also divided into 1 level simple water quality parameters and 2 level parameters unep 2021 this grouping method not only ensures the comprehensiveness and basic security of the measurement indicators but also has a certain flexibility of execution table 2 the russian standard mainly distinguishes between sewage reuse and sludge reuse mhr 1996 israeli wastewater treatment standards are relatively strict according to soil sensitivity it is divided into unrestricted irrigation and river water replenishment while ensuring that it is almost harmless to the soil and water sources wai 2010 although the italian standard does not provide a more detailed classification of uses and occasions it gives many reference indicators mei 2003 some eu countries have more detailed classification of reclaimed water standards in terms of specific uses which is more meaningful for countries with higher water quality treatment levels cyprus france portugal and jordan divide the quality of reclaimed water into different grades and the corresponding grades of irrigation water can be selected for different purposes manrec 2005 msaphf 2014 iqp 2005 ismj 2006 this classification method may become a trend after the refinement and development of reclaimed water irrigation 3 reclaimed water quality parameters 3 1 organic and nutrient parameters the parameters of organic and nutrients mainly include biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved oxygen do anionic surfactants las total phenol tph volatile phenol vph pentachlorophenol pcp chloral tetrachloroethylene perc total chlorinated solvents tcs total aldehydes tal acrolein formaldehyde formald trichloromethane sum of concentrations tthm total aromatic solvents tas benzo a pyrene b a p benzene total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh4 totail organic nitrogen solvents tons fat oil and grease fog petroleum petro and pesticides etc most countries have given bod limit values and parameters such as cod do las nitrogen and phosphorus are also involved constantly bod cod and do are comprehensive parameters of organic pollution in water bodies higher bod values indicate higher organic content and more serious pollution in water zhang and yang 2011 xu and wang 2018 cod measures the level of organic pollution in a water body by the oxygen produced from the oxidation of organic matter by strong chemical oxidants wang and wang 2022 the content of do can reflect the quality of water and its self purification ability wu and zhu 2020 bod focuses on reflecting organic pollutants that can be degraded by microorganisms cod focuses on measuring the organic compound oxidized by the oxidant do focuses on the oxygen content in the water itself due to the difficulty of degradation of organic pollutants in water bodies and the strong dependence on biochemical degradation bod organic pollution has a strong comprehensive measurement effect currently many standards mostly use five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 and cod and do can be considered as additional parameters to supplement the measurement of organic pollution common nitrogen and phosphorus parameters include tn kjeldahl nitrogen nh4 nitrate nitrogen no3 elemental phosphorus tp etc as important nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus play an important role in the growth and development of crops nitrogen promotes plant growth under long term effects liang et al 2021 phosphorus plays a role in photosynthetic reactions cells energy transfer and respiration marschner 2011 fernandes et al 2015 excessive intake of nitrogen and phosphorus will also have certain adverse effects on crops such as affecting the population structure of cotton fields leading to premature aging of hybrid bolls and reduced yield of hybrid cotton yang et al 2020 the nitrogen and phosphorus levels in normal wastewater treatment results are basically within the controllable range but for some special cases such as in sandy soils with low phosphorus content and high mobility saentho et al 2022 and acidic soils where high nitrogen content tends to exacerbate soil acidification tian and niu 2015 therefore it is recommended to select appropriate nitrogen and phosphorus parameters and limit values according to the results of water quality treatment and the requirements of soil types in the current water quality monitoring results of most countries the pollution of las basically feet the water quality standards and occasionally exceeds the standard in some months and water bodies the washing liquid washing powder and detergent commonly used in people s life belong to las therefore the catering industry car washing and road construction are easy to become the main sources of las pollution rural areas have little contact with their pollution sources so this parameter can be disregarded for urban irrigation whether to set relevant limit values can be considered according to the water source the las limit values in some current reclaimed water irrigation standards are outdated and overly conservative when compared to actual test data tang et al 2016 mao et al 2021 uning et al 2022 if this parameter is considered to be retained it is suggested to reduce the limit values especially for urban reclaimed water irrigation petroleum phenols chloral benzene etc are mainly due to industrial pollution the exposure to reclaimed water is limited but as the types involved are still increasing with technological development more research and evaluation is needed 3 2 inorganic parameters the parameters of inorganic mainly include total dissolved solids tds chloride cl chlorine residual cl2 res boron b fluoride f ph sulfide adsorption ration sar total water hardness twh calculated as caco3 electrical conductance ec magnesium mg calcium ca sodium na phosphide p include po4 sulfide s hydrogen sulfide h2s sulfur trioxide so3 sulfate so4 2 hydrogen carbonate hco4 selenium se aluminum al lithium li and cyanide cn among them the comprehensive parameters are tds ph sar total water hardness and ec tds and ec are proportional to the ion content and reflect the cleanliness of the water body ph reflects the acidity of water and has a great impact on both crop growth and metabolism and soil microbial activity different standards give slightly different ph limits for example 6 0 9 0 in the us japan and china are closer around 5 5 8 5 and 6 5 8 5 in israel ph limits should be stricter considering the potential salinization of soil brought about by long term irrigation with reclaimed water and the relevance of ph to the concentration of heavy metals or other substances epa 2012 sar and total water hardness mainly measures the content of ca2 and mg2 the increase of irrigation water hardness may cause pipe blockage and affect work efficiency and equipment life tamiru and bekele 2020 jia et al 2020 also it may cause environmental problems such as an increase in groundwater hardness hardness may be related to heavy metal plasma content and there may be some seasonal fluctuations yesilnacar and gulluoglu 2008 tamiru and bekele i̇lhan et al 2020 2021 currently there are few studies on the risk assessment of hardness in reclaimed water irrigation relevant research should be strengthened and strict supervision should be carried out in areas with high hardness for stable water quality areas chloride pollution fluoride pollution and sulfide pollution mainly from the chemical industry mining industry etc and limited contact with irrigation water can be ignored water treatment often use chlorine or chlorine dioxide disinfection residual chlorine exceeds the standard will have a significant irritating smell bringing users an intuitive sense of unpleasantness and will react with other organic substances in the water causing harm to human health so the residual chlorine limit is very necessary for crops the range of reasonable b concentrations is very narrow in arid semi arid or coastal areas b often exceeds crop requirements due to poor drainage or intrusion of seawater with high b content and diffusion of seawater aerosols landi et al 2019 although b is involved in many crop metabolic processes some studies believe that the effect of boron on vascular plants has been completely overturned lewis 2019 so a new round of confirmation research and evaluation should be carried out on the toxicity of boron to crops therefore it is necessary for many countries to specify b limits in their water quality standards for reclaimed water irrigation at low concentrations se has a positive effect on abiotic stress regulation kaur et al 2014 so for reclaimed water irrigation perhaps selenium deserves further attention al and li are also metals that are easily accessible in daily life the aluminum 5 mg l and lithium 2 5 mg l given by israel are good reference objects 3 3 heavy metal parameters some countries give a variety of heavy metal pollutant parameters such as arsenic as hydrargyrum mercury or hg chromium cr nickel ni lead pb cadmium cd zinc zn iron fe copper cu manganese mn molybdenum mo vanadium v beryllium be cobalt co barium ba stannum sn and titanium ti u heavy metals are widely used in agriculture chemical industry pharmaceutical industry and other fields bringing certain risks to the environment and human health and have always attracted people s attention tiwari et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to control the content of heavy metal pollutants in reclaimed water heavy metals and their compounds are used in a wide variety of industries and are highly toxic so they are distinguished from other inorganic and organic parameters and are discussed separately in this section heavy metal pollutants often have a major impact on human health such as as cr and cd which can cause genomic instability and high doses of hg and lead pb which can induce severe complications such as kidney failure abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea balali mood et al 2021 bernhoft 2012 tsai et al 2017 as co cr and ni exhibit the highest toxicity in water bodies vinod et al 2019 although the comprehensive parameters such as tds and hardness will change when the heavy metal content is too high it is still necessary to be selective about the heavy metal items when it comes to more specific monitoring and tracing according to the list of carcinogens published by the who class i carcinogens include as inorganic arsenic compounds be beryllium compounds cd cadmium compounds chromium ⅵ compounds nickel compounds et al class ii carcinogens include co cobalt compounds cobalt metal without tungsten carbide cobalt sulfate and other soluble cobalt ii salts pb molybdenum trioxide ni and nickel alloys et al class ⅲ carcinogens include arsenobetaine and other organic arsenic compounds that are not metabolized in humans chromium ⅲ compounds implanted foreign bodies of metallic chromium or titanium and of cobalt based chromium based and titanium based alloys stainless steel and depleted uranium hematite lead compounds organic maneb hg and mercury inorganic compounds et al carcinogen categories can inform the selection of heavy metal pollutant indices and in addition factors such as local industrial structure and geography are necessary to consider for example some studies have found that the content of fe and mn in surface water of china is relatively high the average values of mn co as and ni exceed the maximum allowable values for drinking water stipulated by the us epa and the average values of ni cd and cr in us surface water are also higher than the drinking water values recommended by who 2017 and usepa 2009 so localities should reasonably select heavy metal parameters according to the survey and statistical results vinod et al 2019 it can be seen from the table that the limits of cu mo and co in china are 0 5 1 0 mg l 0 5 mg l and 1 0 mg l which are relatively loose compared with other countries especially for mo and co co at 0 1 1 0 mg l will be toxic to most crops feed crops grown from soils with high mo content may be toxic to livestock it is recommended to moderately lower the mo and co limits ayers and westcot 1985 pb parameters in the usa are also high compared to other countries be parameter of china restrictions are also too harsh jordan and saudi arabia have more lenient regulations for zn at 5 mg l and 4 mg l respectively heavy metal parameters for reclaimed water irrigation often refer to other types of water quality standards or guidelines that are older most of the standards have references to criteria of fao ayers and westcot 1985 some of the limits in this criteria are lack of relevant data for example the limit value for cr is stated as toxicological data are not available and conservative limits are recommended and the limit value for pb is stated as plant cell growth is inhibited at very high concentrations moreover the criteria is originally intended to guide irrigation water and perhaps more caution should be exercised for reclaimed water because of the possible synergistic effects of multiple contaminants 3 4 hygiene and sensory parameters hygiene and sensory parameters are the top priority of reclaimed water quality requirements who and other organizations or countries still give e coli and worm egg indicator requirements although there are no clear requirements for other types of indicators the parameters of hygiene and sensory parameters mainly include escherichia coliform e coli fecal coliform salmonellae legionella spp ascaris lumbricoides eggs taenia saginata and taenia solium eggs helminth eggs chromaticity turbidity stink total suspended solids tss and exterior e coli fecal coliforms ascaris lumbricoides eggs and helminth eggs are pathogenic biological parameters common water bacteriological parameter bacteria include total coliforms fecal coliforms and e coli total coliform is a group of bacteria with certain characteristics related to fecal contamination and fecal coliform which is part of total coliform can reflect the degree of fecal contamination of water more closely than total coliform e coli is the main species of total coliforms and fecal coliforms salmonella is a pathogenic bacterium excreted in feces by human and animal patients or carriers sepac 2002 chen and yang 2020 currently e coli is used as parameter bacteria in many countries around the world aqsiq 2020 and the definitions of total coliform and fecal coliform often need to be changed with taxonomic updates many of which are not related to fecal contamination especially total coliform salmonella appears in water with great variability and the isolation technique has limitations in sensitivity and selectivity compared to e coli which is more accurate in indicating fecal contamination so it can be considered in preference to e coli tallon 2005 sepac 2002 khan and gupta 2020 helminths are also a collective term for a group of pathogens that in low income and lower middle income countries are burdened by helminthic diseases caused by wastewater use ascaris lumbricoides is often used as the primary parameter due to the long survival time of eggs and low infectivity compared to other parasites bacteria and viruses however the main factor for helminths egg removal is settling so the efficiency of egg removal should be based on the type of worm egg with the lowest settling rate studies have shown that in clean water ascaris lumbricoides eggs settle slowly in low quality water ascaris lumbricoides eggs settle the fastest so ascaris lumbricoides as a representative parameter is also inappropriate therefore it is necessary to carry out further research on the more accurate parameter of worm eggs and it is necessary to distinguish the types of helminths eggs in the determination and detection of water quality feachem et al 1983 sengupta et al 2011 chromaticity turbidity stink tss and exterior are from the color turbidity level smell and other appearance of the performance of the visual response to the cleanliness of the water body for water body appearance parameters tss can be used as a comprehensive measure visual parameters and olfactory parameters can also be added in according to the demand 4 discussion through the previous review we found that the reclaimed water laws guidelines or standards of many organizations or countries have a long history but a considerable number of them have not been updated for many years the variability in the parameters chosen in different documents is also significant and the potential lag of the standards relative to the current urban and agricultural development is unavoidable for some developed countries due to the advanced technology and research emphasis the classification of reclaimed water will be more detailed or more parameters were selected to constrain the application which can be tough for developing countries for example the newater of singapore directly treats reclaimed water to exceed the who drinking water standard level lee and tan 2016 who 2011 which is lack of reference for the vast majority of countries and regions that only need to meet general irrigation and recreational activities due to the problem of water shortage some developing countries were forced to start using reclaimed water for irrigation very early and many of them have not been effectively monitored and demonstrated with economic globalization and industrial adjustment the problem of reclaimed water in developing countries may be more severe and urgent unesco 2017 through the comparison and analysis above we make the following recommendations based on the classification and parameters that appear in most of the standards and the necessity of the parameters we recommend that the reclaimed water parameters should be at least divided into two categories restricted irrigation and unrestricted irrigation or agricultural irrigation and urban green space or landscape irrigation needing to formulate and adjust the specific applicable scenarios and crops of each category according to the actual situation if the consideration is more detailed it is more recommended to divide the recycled water quality into different levels various uses can match the corresponding level of irrigation water at the same time we selected some comprehensive parameters and parameters that need to be strictly controlled and divided them into first class parameters and second class parameters as recommendations for first class parameters the organic and nutrient parameters we selected the comprehensive parameter bod5 to measure the overall pollution level for the inorganic parameter we chose three comprehensive parameters of tds ph and twh to measure the cleanliness of the water body and ensure the safety of transportation and water uses at the same time we also selected the method of control residual chlorine to control the effect of wastewater treatment for hygiene and sensory parameters we selected e coli and helminth eggs to reflect the content of pathogenic organisms in the water body meanwhile we selected stink and tss to ensure good water quality from both intuitive perception and comprehensive parameter limits for second class parameters we choose cod nh4 las sar ec ascaris lumbricoides eggs fecal coliforms li al se b and fluoride to measure the pollution levels of organic and nutrients inorganic and pathogenic microorganisms and then to ensure the crop safety heavy metal parameters present in most current standards such as as hg cr ni pb cd zn fe cu mn mo v be and co are still retained 5 conclusions in this paper we compiled and analyzed the literature on reclaimed water irrigation laws regulations guidelines and standards from who eu china usa aus russia israel jordan and etc it was found that most of the standards are more inclined to consumer point of view to consider the edibility of the crop and whether it is processed and need to consider more about aspects such as crop type and irrigation method the method of classifying reclaimed water quality in countries such as jordan france cyprus and portugal may become a trend the division of reclaimed water quality parameters into strict control groups and selective guidance control groups in jordan and china help to widely adapt to different regions of water quality parameters needs we recommend that reclaimed water irrigation parameters be divided into at least restricted and unrestricted irrigation or agricultural irrigation and green or landscape irrigation from the perspective of pollutant types this paper divides the reclaimed water irrigation parameters into four categories organic and nutrient parameters inorganic parameters

9266,the deep placement of urea fertilizer is considered an effective strategy for crop growth and yield formation how crop root morphology and resource utilization respond to altered rainfall amount and deep urea fertilizer placement is still not fully understood thus we conducted a two year field experiment in the semi humid region to assess the effects of different urea fertilizer placement depths of 5 cm d5 conventional surface fertilization 15 cm d15 25 cm d25 and 35 cm d35 under three rainfall conditions dry year 125 mm p125 normal year 200 mm p200 wet year 275 mm p275 on root distribution resource utilization and yield of wheat deep urea placement significantly increased root length density and root weight density in the 20 60 cm soil layer which caused a significant increase in wheat nitrogen n uptake compared with d5 deep urea placement significantly increased the crop n uptake 10 4 27 6 grain n content 1 2 18 7 n recovery efficiency nre 0 9 16 7 and n partial

moderate deep urea placement according to variable precipitation conditions can be an effective fertilizer management strategy for sustainable wheat development graphical abstract ga1 keywords deep fertilization depth root distribution nitrate leaching productivity semi humid area data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the global food crisis triggered by continued population growth foley et al 2011 requires further development of the wheat industry but the total output can only be promoted by enhancing the unit yield despite the difficulty of increasing the area of arable land liu et al 2014 nitrogen is the basic material required as an input for ensuring and improving wheat yields however due to unreasonable nitrogen application practices 50 of the n fertilizer is lost through ammonia volatilization nitrate leaching soil no3 n and nitrous oxide emissions chen et al 2014 lynch 2019 yan et al 2021 thereby decreasing the n available for absorption by wheat and failing to satisfy the n demand required to synthesize plant materials omonode et al 2017 wang et al 2019 and limiting wheat yield cossani et al 2012 therefore there is an urgent need to optimize fertilizer management reduce nitrate leaching and improve wheat n absorption and n use efficiency to ensure further increases in grain yield the morphological characteristics and distribution of the roots greatly determine the ability of crops to obtain nutrients and are significantly shaped by soil nutrient environment guo et al 2019 peng et al 2010 rogers and benfey 2015 in particular the roots in the 0 60 cm soil layer play important roles in n absorption by crops regulating aboveground growth and yield formation peng et al 2010 the root distribution in deeper soil layers is positively correlated with the acquisition of deep soil moisture and nitrogen wiesler and horst 1994 however conventional fertilizer application in semi humid area is surface application resulting in a mismatch between soil available nutrients and root distribution as nutrients patches are mainly in the surface layer wu et al 2022b regulating root growth through optimize fertilization management and nourishing the roots rather than the soil may provide an effective method for achieving high efficiency crop water and nitrogen utilization the deep placement of n fertilizer has been shown to be effective in improving crop nutrient uptake and yield nkebiwe et al 2016 this technique can extend the availability of fertilizer and match the effectiveness of soil inorganic n acquisition with the spatiotemporal growth of root to promote crop growth cheng et al 2020 lu et al 2021 deep fertilizer placement applies in coarse sandy soil could significantly promote the root system in deep soil and increase rice yield by 21 while performs not well in sandy loam soil baral et al 2021 moreover in the case of low soil moisture content the promotion effect of deep n fertilizer application on crop production is more obvious trapeznikov et al 2003 in the semi humid area with annual rainfall about 550 mm fertilizer placement at a deeper depth 25 cm could increase the root length density and improve wp and yield of maize wu et al 2022b however in subtropical area with abundant rainfall deep fertilizer placement at a shallower layer 5 cm could effectively enhance yield hou et al 2021 additionally the drought tolerant variety in wheat can form larger and deeper root systems than drought sensitive variety under deep fertilizer placement application which facilitates improved wp and yield formation kang et al 2014 however the opposite result was obtained in rice cultivation during rainy season baral et al 2020 it could be observed that the optimal depth and effects of deep fertilization placement may vary by the differences in soil texture climate and crop variety changing the depth in deep fertilizer placement may lead to no3 n content with different sizes in the soil profile thereby modifying the root spatial configuration additionally deep buried n fertilizer its movement and distribution in the soil profile also be altered with rainfall zhou et al 2016 thus the response of root morphology traits and distribution to the improved soil inorganic n environment caused by changing n fertilization depth may also vary depending on the soil water availability ke et al 2018 although plants are able to modulate root morphological characteristics to cope with nutrient patches it is not known how root growth and distribution in the soil under different fertilization depth to variable rainfall conditions and whether the root morphological change induced by deep n placement can enhance water n resource utilization and productivity of crop largely remain to be elucidated we hypothesized that placement urea n fertilizer at a suitable depth under varying rainfall scenarios could enhance water n resource utilization and growth of wheat by matching and inducing root growth through regulating the soil spatial nutrient distribution thus in the present study we simulated different rainfall levels and urea application depths during the growth period of winter wheat the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the response in terms of soil no3 n content root growth and distribution to different urea application depths and rainfall amounts 2 explore the effect of the urea placement depth on the water nitrogen resource utilization and yield of wheat under different rainfall levels 3 clarify the mechanisms by which different urea application depths under variable rainfall levels can regulate water productivity and nitrogen utilization in wheat and 4 identify the most appropriate fertilization strategy for improving wheat production in different precipitation levels this collective knowledge can provide theoretical and technical guidance for efficient water and nitrogen utilization and yield improvement of wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this study was conducted at the institute of water saving agriculture in arid areas of china iwsa northwest a f university yangling shaanxi china

conducted for two winter wheat growing seasons october to june next year from 2019 to 2021 over the trial plot there was an electronically controlled rainout shelter 3 m height 15 m width 32 m length the rainout shelter was operated in rainy and snowy weather to prevent precipitation from entering the plots and it was closed in non rainy and snowy weather the shelter had a transparent canopy and four open sides the canopy of the rainout shelter was made of transparent plastic material which could ensure light transmittance when in operation the experiment was laid out in the randomized complete block design with three replicates and the plot area was 6 7 m2 3 17 m 2 15 m each plot of the experimental field was surrounded by border ridges this experiment consisted of three precipitation levels 125 mm dry year p125 200 mm normal year p200 and 275 mm wet year p275 during the winter wheat growth period and five nitrogen fertilization placement depths 5 cm d5 conventional surface fertilizer application depth for agricultural farming in semi humid area 15 cm d15 25 cm d25 35 cm d35 and an unfertilized plot d0 d0 was prepared for each precipitation level to calculate the n use efficiency 2 2 2 experimental setup practice the three simulated precipitation levels were derived from the precipitation data during the wheat growth period in the semi humid regions of northern china from 1966 to 2014 60 of the 48 years was about 200 mm 125 mm in 20 and 275 mm in 20 as described in a previous study ali et al 2018 the distribution of simulated rainfall events was determined based on the spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall in the semi humid regions of northern china during the wheat growth period over 48 year 1966 2014 as shown in table 1 each plot was equipped with an irrigation control system and the simulated rainfall amount was controlled by the system to ensure the timely and uniform application of simulated rainfall the applied mineral fertilizers were urea n 46 150 kg n ha 1 and superphosphate p 7 39 kg p ha 1 as basal fertilizer we did not apply potassium fertilizer because there was no shortage of potassium in this area before sowing the soil was uniformly loosened to a depth of 35 cm urea fertilizer was uniformly applied to the bands at the depths set for the deep placement application and mulched followed by uniform application of p fertilizer to the depth of 5 cm below the soil the soil was back filled after fertilizer application p fertilizer was banded at a depth of 5 cm for all treatments the winter wheat cultivar was xinong 979 sown in early october and harvested in mid june during the next year the sowing rate was 225 plants m 2 and the interrow spacing was 20 cm the soil water storage was uniformly adjusted to about 450 mm in the 0 2 m soil layer in both experiment years weeding and pest control were applied at various growth stages throughout the winter wheat growing period along with other management practices to ensure consistency with local fields 2 3 measurements and calculations 2 3 1 biomass and grain yield wheat plants from an area of 0 2 m2 0 2 m wide 1 m long were sampled in the seedling tillering jointing anthesis and maturity stages in each plot and dried to a constant weight at 80 c wu et al 2022b zhang et al 2022 after the wheat reached physiological maturation wheat

kjeldahl analyzer sommer et al 1992 2 4 2 4 statistical analysis spss 21 0 was used for variance analysis anova differences between treatments were verified by anova and means were compared at a probability level of 0 05 to calculate the least significant difference lsd spearman s correlation was used to determine the relationship between the studied parameters response surface methodology was used to visualize and fit grain n content wp and yield 3 results 3 1 soil no3 n concentration over the two seasons significant variation in soil no3 n occurred in the corresponding soil layer after the deep urea placement to different precipitation levels during the anthesis stage of the winter wheat when compared with conventional surface fertilization p 0 05 fig 1 compared with d5 deep urea placement increased the soil no3 n in the 0 100 cm layer especially under the larger depth treatments and the difference was most obvious in the 60 100 cm specifically the soil no3 n concentrations in the 0 20 cm layer were higher in urea placement at the shallow layer treatments d5 and d15 i e significantly higher than those in d25 and d35 by 22 7 42 1 in 2020 and 22 0 41 6 in 2021 p 0 05 under three precipitation levels in dry year the soil no3 n concentration in the 20 60 cm layer followed the order of d35 d25 d15 d5 those in deep urea placement treatments were significantly higher than d5 by 5 85 41 04 in 2020 and 15 2 52 57 in 2021 p 0 05 the soil no3 n concentration in the 20 60 cm layer under normal and wet years were highest at d25 and significantly higher than d15 and d5 respectively p 0 05 and not significantly different from d35 increasing the rainfall amount improved the soil no3 n in 0 100 cm layer during the two seasons which generally differed significantly between all precipitation scenarios p 0 05 increase in rainfall amount significantly contributed to soil no3 n in 0 100 cm layer under all four urea fertilizer placement depth treatments p 0 05 3 2 root weight density and root length density of winter wheat winter wheat root growth and its spatial distribution in the soil profile were altered by the urea placement depths and precipitation levels during the two growing seasons particularly at anthesis figs 2 3 s1 in particular rwd and rld showed no significant differences in the 0 20 cm soil layer between d5 and d15 and d5 was higher than other treatments by 5 6 31 7 rwd and 3 0 5 4 rld in 2020 respectively and 10 8 42 2 and 3 7 8 1 in 2021 among three precipitation levels compared with d5 the rld and rwd values in 20 60 cm layer under deep urea placement were significantly higher in dry year in both seasons there were no significant differences in rld and rwd between d15 and d5 and d15 was higher than other treatments by 1 5 9 2 rld and 6 0 13 4 rwd under wet year during two seasons in normal year d5 decreased the rld and rwd in the 20 60 cm layer by 0 32 12 78 and 7 02 42 92 than d15 and d25 while with no significant differences between d5 and d35 in both seasons compared with d5 deep urea placement increased the rwd and rld values in the 60 100 cm soil layer regardless of precipitations especially under the larger depth treatment more obviously in 2020 in most cases as the rainfall amount increased the rwd and rld values of the 0 100 cm layer were promoted under four fertilizer depth treatments in both seasons 3 3 resource utilization of winter wheat the most effective fertilization depth among variable rainfall conditions increased the n uptake by plant and grain n content in maturity and promoted the n translocation after the anthesis during the two seasons table 2 compared with d5 d35 increased namaturity nagrain and n translocation during 2019 2021 by 13 6 18 5 15 4 23 0 and 30 4 40 3 in dry year and d25 in normal year increased those by 9 9 29 0 11 3 11 3 12 3 13 8 than d5 respectively p 0 05 in wet year there was no significant difference in those between d5 and d15 in both seasons and d15 significantly increased those by 4 8 10 8 3 8 11 3 and 8 2 19 4 than d25 and d35 respectively p 0 05 in most cases the n accumulation of winter wheat increased as the amount of rainfall increased under four fertilizer depth treatments table 2 in particular d25 in normal year increased n uptake 2 87 10 06 than in wet year while the difference between d25 in normal and wet year was not significant in both seasons suitable deep urea placement enhanced the pfpn nre and wp table 2 in dry and normal years the highest nre pfpn and wp were obtained in p125d35 and p200d25 in both seasons respectively when compared with d5 the nre pfpn and wp were significantly increased by 39 1 43 6 19 9 20 4 11 8 15 8 in d35 under dry year and 30 7 32 5 14 6 16 9 9 5 10 0 in d25 under normal year p 0 05 in wet year the differences in pfpn nre and wp between d5 and d15 were not significant in both seasons and d15 significantly increased pfpn nre and wp by 20 9 38 4 7 9 14 9 and 4 7 10 5 than other treatments respectively 3 4 relationship between root growth and n accumulation during 2019 2021 the rld and rwd in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layer was positively correlated with the accumulated n in the anthesis and maturity grain n content and n translocation p 0 05 fig 4 compared with the 0 20 cm soil layer the rld and rwd values in the 20 60 cm soil layer was more strongly correlated with the n accumulated by wheat in the anthesis and maturity grain n content and n translocation in addition the rld and rwd values in the 20 60 cm soil layer were more strongly correlated with the plant n accumulation r2 0 80 in the maturity stage than anthesis r2 0 66 and thus the correlation with n translocation was lower r2 0 53 3 5 winter wheat growth and grain yield the aboveground biomass values at seedling and tillering stages were higher than other deeper urea placement treatments under d5 and d15 and the promotion effect of deep urea placement on aboveground biomass was mainly observed in late growth stage and varied as rainfall conditions among the two growing seasons fig 5 the deep urea placement and rainfall level had significant effect on the wheat aboveground biomass and yield p 0 05 the accumulated dry matter in maturity in d25 was higher than d5 and d15 among dry and normal years p 0 05 slightly lower than that in d35 under dry year but significantly higher than d35 in normal year p 0 05 in wet year there was no significant difference in the aboveground biomass in maturity between d5 and d15 and d15 was higher by 7 3 13 1 in 2020 and 16 5 18 7 in 2021 than other treatments respectively p 0 05 the effect of the deep urea placement under three rainfall conditions on the aboveground biomass and grain yield in maturity were consistent during 2019 2021 increasing the rainfall amount improved the wheat growth and yield during 2019 2021 table 2 and fig 5 in most cases as the rainfall amount increased the aboveground biomass and grain yield at maturity were significantly promoted under four fertilizer depth treatments in particular d25 under normal year obtained higher aboveground biomass 2 87 10 06 and grain yield 1 33 8 0 than in wet year however there was no significant difference in the accumulated dry matter and yield of d25 between normal and wet year 3 6 optimization of deep urea placement under different rainfall levels on grain yield grain n accumulation and wp the change in the wheat yield grain n content and wp of different treatments were investigated by response surface analysis table 3 fig 6 considering the r2 values were 0 81 0 88 and 0 69 p 0 01 the regression equation intuitively represented the effects of the rainfall amount and deep urea placement on the wheat yield grain n content and wp the fitting results indicated that applying urea fertilizer at a depth of 28 cm 20 7 cm and 12 6 cm under dry normal and wet years could maximize the yield at 5 3 t ha 1 6 6 t ha 1 and 7 3 t ha 1 moreover applying urea fertilizer at a depth of 30 0 cm 21 6 cm and 13 1 cm may obtain the highest grain n content of 134 4 kg ha 1 151 2 kg ha 1 and 162 1 kg ha 1 while at 29 1 cm 20 7 cm and 12 3 cm can optimize wp to 1 8 kg m 3 2 0 kg m 3 and 2 0 kg m 3 in dry normal and wet year it is not possible to maximize the yield grain n content and wp with urea placement at the same soil depth but different rainfall amounts based on the 95 confidence intervals obtained the regression equation we found that applying urea at soil depths of 28 0 30 0 cm 20 7 21 6 cm and 12 3 13 1 cm could optimize the yield grain n content and wp in dry normal and wet year respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effect of deep urea placement on root growth under different rainfall amounts the root morphology and distribution may vary when the soil physical and chemical properties are different hodge 2005 lynch 2011 in the present study the soil was loosened to the same depth of 35 cm before adding the fertilizer for all treatments and thus the soil disturbance was consistent therefore the morphology traits differences in the plant root system among treatments were mainly due to differences in the temporal and spatial availability of soil moisture and inorganic n with different urea placement depths and rainfall amounts the root morphology and distribution play a key role in the root growth and root system development li et al 2021a which is mainly determined by the soil no3 n concentration guo et al 2019 ke et al 2018 yan et al 2021 previous studies have shown that deep fertilization placement can effectively promote root extension and stimulate root proliferation in deeper layer cheng et al 2020 wu et al 2022b we also obtained similar results because deep urea placement significantly promoted the root morphology traits rld and rwd especially in deeper layer 60 100 cm figs 2 3 s1 our study further suggested that it was possible that the promoted effect of suitable deep urea placement on the accumulation of soil no3 n in the corresponding layer resulted in the root system extension was most evident in the 20 60 cm layer especially at anthesis figs 1 3 and fig s1 hodge 2004 liu et al 2022 despite the positive relationship between deep urea placement to root system development we also found that not all placement depths were equally advanced for main root growth conventional surface application allowed soil no3 n to accumulate at the surface layer 0 20 cm in early stage fig 1 which promoted shallow root system growth before the jointing stage compared with deep urea placement fig s1 although root system grew vigorously in the 60 100 cm soil layer under d35 in normal and wet year the total rld and rwd was reduced than conventional surface fertilization in the 0 60 cm soil layer under d35 these results can be explained by the higher nitrate leaching into the deeper soil layer 60 100 cm under d35 compared with the other placement depths fig 1 the soil no3 n concentration could have been excessively low in the layer containing main roots which could be detrimental to the growth of shallow root in early growth moreover from our field experiment we provided compelling trial evidence that precipitation amount significantly promoted the total wheat root growth and the soil no3 n accumulation 0 100 cm fig 1 and similar results were obtained in previous studies li et al 2021a qi et al 2019 in addition our results further revealed that root system of deeper urea placement treatments d25 and d35 was more vigorous in the 60 100 cm soil layer under wet year compared with normal year however the total root weight of that was lower in the 0 60 cm layer owing to the increased amount of rainfall increasing the soil nitrate leaching in the deeper layer under deep urea placement compared with normal year fig 1 an insufficient supply of nutrients in the surface soil layer may inhibit the absorption and utilization by the wheat roots before the jointing stage wu et al 2022a however the root system responded to the soil no3 n concentration in the deep layer during the later growth stage thereby resulting in redundant root growth in the deeper soil layer fig s1 finally our research highlights the moderating effect of precipitation type on the effectiveness of deep urea placement on root distribution and growth 4 2 effects of deep urea placement on crop water nitrogen utilization under different rainfall amounts previous studies suggest that deep fertilization application significantly affects the crop n absorption and water productivity liedgens et al 2000 liu et al 2017 we obtained similar results where suitable deep urea fertilization significantly advanced n uptake as well as n use efficiency especially in dry and normal years table 2 our motivation was to explore the mechanism of improving crop water n utilization through deep urea fertilization and further investigate the response of the mentioned mechanisms to different placement depths and precipitation for improving crop production we hypothesized that localized n concentration resulting from urea fertilizer deep placement can stimulate root spatial configuration thereby increasing n and water resource utilization in particular we found a positive link between the root traits rld and rwd in the 20 60 cm soil layer and plant n accumulation under all precipitation amounts fig 4 this mechanism highlights that deep urea placement could promote root growth in the 20 60 cm soil layer expanding the contact space between the root system and the deeper soil to increase the n accumulation of wheat and nue in particular we found no contribution to the improvement of n uptake and n use efficiency in wheat of deeper urea placement d25 and d35 under wet year table 2 possibly due to increased rainfall that exacerbated nitrate leaching into deeper layer 60 100 cm fig 1 resulting a thinner root system in 20 60 cm layer thereby decreasing the n uptake by wheat and nue figs 2 3 still root growth was effectively promoted in the 0 60 cm soil layer under a suitable depth in deep urea placement d15 and the n absorption of wheat under d15 was higher compared with the conventional surface fertilization application thus we proposed that suitable urea fertilizer placement could obtain the highest n accumulation and n utilization efficiency by enhancing root traits rld and rwd in the 20 60 cm layer one should note that while the optimal depth of deep urea fertilizer application is tailored to rainfall amount it is of importance to maximize the production per unit water consumption in semi humid areas with limited rainfall and this shall be achieved by establishing an appropriate fertilization system wu et al 2022b our results showed that moderate deep urea placement was effective in improving wp compared to conventional surface fertilization especially in dry and normal years table 2 deep n placement can improve plant root morphology configuration through localized n concentrations adjuration to increase nutrient capture and in turn increased plant n uptake will further promote deeper root growth zhang et al 2022 higher wp in deep urea placement may due to the vigorous root system of wheat in deeper soil figs 2 3 s1 resulting in promotion of the water absorption from the deeper soil layer wu et al 2022b however we found that the effect of deep urea fertilization on improving wp in wet year was not as pronounced as in normal and dry years it is well known that wp changed according to the changes in grain yield fernández et al 2020 excessive water supply in wet year may have caused nitrate leaching thereby decreasing the n available for absorption by wheat especially under deep urea placement fig 1 that may reduce n uptake and thus reduce wheat yield table 2 zou et al 2020 our research highlights that deep urea placement is an effective agricultural efficient water measure within limited water supply especially in semi humid areas 4 3 effects of deep urea placement on wheat growth and grain yield under different rainfall amounts the fertilizer application depth has different effects on the aboveground biomass in various growth stages han et al 2015 yan et al 2021 our results showed that the accumulated dry matter was higher under d5 and d15 in the seedling stage and tillering stage fig 5 however the promotion effect of deep urea placement on dry matter accumulation was mainly demonstrated after jointing stage which was consistent with the results obtained in maize wu et al 2022a and the more severe the soil water scarcity the greater the effect of deep urea placement on accumulated dry matter enhancement fig 5 these results can be explained by the shallow root system before jointing stage mainly absorbing nutrients from the 0 20 cm soil layer li et al 2022 the deeper urea placement treatments had a lower shallow root system than the conventional surface application fig s1 which may affect the wheat aboveground biomass in the early growth of wheat wheat entered the vigorous vegetative growth jointing and anthesis stages and the root system extended into deeper soil layer containing fertilizer n fig s1 with a rapid nutrient compensation effect li et al 2021a 2022 thus the root system may exhibit rapid growth under deep urea placement treatments absorb large amounts of water and nutrients the aboveground biomass could increase rapidly from the jointing stage and higher under deep urea placement in anthesis and maturity wu et al 2022b deep n placement could increase the dry matter and yield of crop in maturity compared with the conventional surface fertilizer application li et al 2021b wu et al 2022a in particular we provided solid evidence that deep urea placement can be highly advantageous but the benefits may vary with depth and rainfall amounts the highest aboveground biomass in maturity occurred in deep urea placement at deeper depth in dry and normal years than wet year in wet year urea placement at a deeper depth was not conducive to dry matter accumulation fig 5 this can be attributed to the intensification of soil nitrate leaching in 60 100 cm under d25 and d35 in wet year thus the nutrient supply in the root layer at anthesis was insufficient fig 1 thereby decreasing the aboveground biomass in late growth and thus the yield wu et al 2022a therefore in semi humid region within low water supply deep urea placement in a deeper depth can be an effective measure to maintain higher aboveground biomass in the later growth stages and ensure further increases in grain yield without a fertilizer rate increase 4 4 comprehensive effects of deep urea placement to different rainfall amounts on wheat yield grain n content and crop water productivity agricultural management practices have a key role in improving crop yield nutrient uptake and wp although the quantitative relationships between fertilizer management irrigation or cultivation methods with the crop yield grain n content and wp have been widely reported wang et al 2019 yan et al 2021 yang et al 2017 zou et al 2020 the basic attributes of nutrients have largely been ignored particularly in placement in the present study the three dimensional relationships of grain yield grain n content and wp against rainfall and deep urea placement exhibited an upward convex shape fig 6 these three indexes generally first increased and then decreased as placement depth increased which illustrated that effective fertilization practices were included in the treatments designed in this study optimizing the grain yield grain n content and wp within the limited rainfall and n fertilizer rate and the optimal depth of urea placement for the three indexes was deeper in dry year which further confirmed that under low water supply the greater the effect of deep urea placement the predicted yield under deep urea placement was ultimately higher by 0 03 wet year 0 93 t ha 1 dry year compared with the conventional surface fertilization mainly grain n content required more nutrient n than yield maximization average internal n nutrient efficiency is estimated at 40 1 kg grain kg 1 for wheat and the quefts model suggests nutrient contents of 24 6 kg n per 1000 kg of grain with a linear increase in grain yields liu et al 2006 the maximum grain n content occurred at a deeper depth application than that of yield within the same fertilizer rate and rainfall in our study that indicated that deep urea placement can meet the nitrogen demand of wheat growth by deepening the depth without increasing the n fertilizer rate overall we propose that suitable deep urea fertilization placement management can increase wheat production without more water and fertilizer consumption in semi humid area 5 conclusion deep urea placement at suitable depth under all precipitation levels in semi humid region indirectly improved the nitrogen nutrient status of wheat plants by spatially adjusting the soil nitrate nitrogen content and enhancing root characteristics in the deeper soil layer due to the positive correlation between wheat n uptake and root growth deep urea placement facilitated raised water productivity and nitrogen resource utilization in deeper soil by providing the robust deep root system and ultimately increasing yield as well as maintaining the soil no3 n concentration at a low level with more pronounced effects in dry and normal years our study highlights that urea placement at 28 0 30 0 cm 20 7 21 6 cm and 12 3 13 1 cm in the dry year normal year and wet year can be recommended as a more reasonable alternative to conventional surface fertilization in semi humid regions however the overall response rules of wheat growth among different cultivars along wide various climate regions to deep urea fertilization placement especially in humid and arid regions are still lacking multiple years of field studies would

9266,the deep placement of urea fertilizer is considered an effective strategy for crop growth and yield formation how crop root morphology and resource utilization respond to altered rainfall amount and deep urea fertilizer placement is still not fully understood thus we conducted a two year field experiment in the semi humid region to assess the effects of different urea fertilizer placement depths of 5 cm d5 conventional surface fertilization 15 cm d15 25 cm d25 and 35 cm d35 under three rainfall conditions dry year 125 mm p125 normal year 200 mm p200 wet year 275 mm p275 on root distribution resource utilization and yield of wheat deep urea placement significantly increased root length density and root weight density in the 20 60 cm soil layer which caused a significant increase in wheat nitrogen n uptake compared with d5 deep urea placement significantly increased the crop n uptake 10 4 27 6 grain n content 1 2 18 7 n recovery efficiency nre 0 9 16 7 and n partial productivity pfpn 1 1 20 0 in dry and normal years and d15 promoted those by 0 9 1 3 3 7 and 1 1 over d5 under wet year additionally compared with d5 deep urea placement increased crop water productivity wp and yield by 9 6 23 9 and 3 2 20 0 under dry and normal years and d15 increased those by 1 1 and 0 5 in wet year the accumulated nitrate contents in the 0 100 cm soil layer was 4 7 14

moderate deep urea placement according to variable precipitation conditions can be an effective fertilizer management strategy for sustainable wheat development graphical abstract ga1 keywords deep fertilization depth root distribution nitrate leaching productivity semi humid area data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the global food crisis triggered by continued population growth foley et al 2011 requires further development of the wheat industry but the total output can only be promoted by enhancing the unit yield despite the difficulty of increasing the area of arable land liu et al 2014 nitrogen is the basic material required as an input for ensuring and improving wheat yields however due to unreasonable nitrogen application practices 50 of the n fertilizer is lost through ammonia volatilization nitrate leaching soil no3 n and nitrous oxide emissions chen et al 2014 lynch 2019 yan et al 2021 thereby decreasing the n available for absorption by wheat and failing to satisfy the n demand required to synthesize plant materials omonode et al 2017 wang et al 2019 and limiting wheat yield cossani et al 2012 therefore there is an urgent need to optimize fertilizer management reduce nitrate leaching and improve wheat n absorption and n use efficiency to ensure further increases in grain yield the morphological characteristics and distribution of the roots greatly determine the ability of crops to obtain nutrients and are significantly shaped by soil nutrient environment guo et al 2019 peng et al 2010 rogers and benfey 2015 in particular the roots in the 0 60 cm soil layer play important roles in n absorption by crops regulating aboveground growth and yield formation peng et al 2010 the root distribution in deeper soil layers is positively correlated with the acquisition of deep soil moisture and nitrogen wiesler and horst 1994 however conventional fertilizer application in semi humid area is surface application resulting in a mismatch between soil available nutrients and root distribution as nutrients patches are mainly in the surface layer wu et al 2022b regulating root growth through optimize fertilization management and nourishing the roots rather than the soil may provide an effective method for achieving high efficiency crop water and nitrogen utilization the deep placement of n fertilizer has been shown to be effective in improving crop nutrient uptake and yield nkebiwe et al 2016 this technique can extend the availability of fertilizer and match the effectiveness of soil inorganic n acquisition with the spatiotemporal growth of root to promote crop growth cheng et al 2020 lu et al 2021 deep fertilizer placement applies in coarse sandy soil could significantly promote the root system in deep soil and increase rice yield by 21 while performs not well in sandy loam soil baral et al 2021 moreover in the case of low soil moisture content the promotion effect of deep n fertilizer application on crop production is more obvious trapeznikov et al 2003 in the semi humid area with annual rainfall about 550 mm fertilizer placement at a deeper depth 25 cm could increase the root length density and improve wp and yield of maize wu et al 2022b however in subtropical area with abundant rainfall deep fertilizer placement at a shallower layer 5 cm could effectively enhance yield hou et al 2021 additionally the drought tolerant variety in wheat can form larger and deeper root systems than drought sensitive variety under deep fertilizer placement application which facilitates improved wp and yield formation kang et al 2014 however the opposite result was obtained in rice cultivation during rainy season baral et al 2020 it could be observed that the optimal depth and effects of deep fertilization placement may vary by the differences in soil texture climate and crop variety changing the depth in deep fertilizer placement may lead to no3 n content with different sizes in the soil profile thereby modifying the root spatial configuration additionally deep buried n fertilizer its movement and distribution in the soil profile also be altered with rainfall zhou et al 2016 thus the response of root morphology traits and distribution to the improved soil inorganic n environment caused by changing n fertilization depth may also vary depending on the soil water availability ke et al 2018 although plants are able to modulate root morphological characteristics to cope with nutrient patches it is not known how root growth and distribution in the soil under different fertilization depth to variable rainfall conditions and whether the root morphological change induced by deep n placement can enhance water n resource utilization and productivity of crop largely remain to be elucidated we hypothesized that placement urea n fertilizer at a suitable depth under varying rainfall scenarios could enhance water n resource utilization and growth of wheat by matching and inducing root growth through regulating the soil spatial nutrient distribution thus in the present study we simulated different rainfall levels and urea application depths during the growth period of winter wheat the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the response in terms of soil no3 n content root growth and distribution to different urea application depths and rainfall amounts 2 explore the effect of the urea placement depth on the water nitrogen resource utilization and yield of wheat under different rainfall levels 3 clarify the mechanisms by which different urea application depths under variable rainfall levels can regulate water productivity and nitrogen utilization in wheat and 4 identify the most appropriate fertilization strategy for improving wheat production in different precipitation levels this collective knowledge can provide theoretical and technical guidance for efficient water and nitrogen utilization and yield improvement

conducted for two winter wheat growing seasons october to june next year from 2019 to 2021 over the trial plot there was an electronically controlled rainout shelter 3 m height 15 m width 32 m length the rainout shelter was operated in rainy and snowy weather to prevent precipitation from entering the plots and it was closed in non rainy and snowy weather the shelter had a transparent canopy and four open sides the canopy of the rainout shelter was made of transparent plastic material which could ensure light transmittance when in operation the experiment was laid out in the randomized complete block design with three replicates and the plot area was 6 7 m2 3 17 m 2 15 m each plot of the experimental field was surrounded by border ridges this experiment consisted of three precipitation levels 125 mm dry year p125 200 mm normal year p200 and 275 mm wet year p275 during the winter wheat growth period and five nitrogen fertilization placement depths 5 cm d5 conventional surface fertilizer application depth for agricultural farming in semi humid area 15 cm d15 25 cm d25 35 cm d35 and an unfertilized plot d0 d0 was prepared for each precipitation level to calculate the n use efficiency 2 2 2 experimental setup practice the three simulated precipitation levels were derived from the precipitation data during the wheat growth period in the semi humid regions of northern china from 1966 to 2014 60 of the 48 years was about 200 mm 125 mm in 20 and 275 mm in 20 as described in a previous study ali et al 2018 the distribution of simulated rainfall events was determined based on the spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall in the semi humid regions of northern china during the wheat growth period over 48 year 1966 2014 as shown in table 1 each plot was equipped with an irrigation control system and the simulated rainfall amount was controlled by the system to ensure the timely and uniform application of simulated rainfall the applied mineral fertilizers were urea n 46 150 kg n ha 1 and superphosphate p 7 39 kg p ha 1 as basal fertilizer we did not apply potassium fertilizer because there was no shortage of potassium in this area before sowing the soil was uniformly loosened to a depth of 35 cm urea fertilizer was uniformly applied to the bands at the depths set for the deep placement application and mulched followed by uniform application of p fertilizer to the depth of 5 cm below the soil the soil was back filled after fertilizer application p fertilizer was banded at a depth of 5 cm for all treatments the winter wheat cultivar was xinong 979 sown in early october and harvested in mid june during the next year the sowing rate was 225 plants m 2 and the interrow spacing was 20 cm the soil water storage was uniformly adjusted to about 450 mm in the 0 2 m soil layer in both experiment years weeding and pest control were applied at various growth stages throughout the winter wheat growing period along with other management practices to ensure consistency with local fields 2 3 measurements and calculations 2 3 1 biomass and grain yield wheat plants from an area of 0 2 m2 0 2 m wide 1 m long were sampled in the seedling tillering jointing anthesis and maturity stages in each plot and dried to a constant weight at 80 c wu et al 2022b zhang et al 2022 after the wheat reached physiological maturation wheat plants were collected from an area of 1 m2 in each plot and divided into different parts before drying to a constant weight at 80 c the grain yield was measured at a moisture content of 14 2 3 2 root traits in the jointing anthesis and maturity stages root samples were collected using core sampler between the plants and rows at intervals of 20 cm from the 0 100 cm soil layer in each plot the root samples were mixed in a nylon mesh bag and subsequently rinsed using water and the soil and impurities remaining on the roots were finally separated manually and the clean roots were then collected the processed root systems were scanned epson perfection v700 photo epson china co ltd china and the root length was analyzed using winrhizo pro image software régent instruments québec canada finally the roots were dried to a constant weight the root length density rld cm m 3 is defined as the length of the root system per unit volume of soil the rld was calculated as follows 1 rld l v where l is

intervals then the soil water content was calculated using the drying method the soil water storage was calculated as follows 6 s w s n i 1 c i b d h i 10 100 where sws is the soil water storage mm ci is the gravimetric water content bd is the bulk density g cm 3 hi is thickness of the i th soil layer cm n refers to the number of the soil profile and i 1 2 10 during the winter wheat growth period no water was provided except for precipitation so the evapotranspiration was calculated using the soil water balance equation wei et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 as follows 7 et p drainage runoff sws sow

sow and sws hav are soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil layer before wheat sowing and at harvest mm the groundwater level was approximately 80 m below the soil surface wei et al 2018 and no runoff occurred at the study site during the trial period because the field was flat and each plot was surrounded by ridges thus drainage and runoff were taken as zero crop water productivity was calculated as follows fernández et al 2020 8 wp gy et 10 where wp is the crop water productivity kg m 3 2 3 5 soil no3 n concentration soil samples were collected at intervals of 20 cm from the 0 100 cm soil layer at anthesis of winter wheat in each plot roots stones and other impurities were removed samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve and the no3 n concentration was determined with a standard kjeldahl analyzer sommer et al 1992 2 4 2 4 statistical analysis spss 21 0 was used for variance analysis anova differences between treatments were verified by anova and means were compared at a probability level of 0 05 to calculate the least significant difference lsd spearman s correlation was used to determine the relationship between the studied parameters response surface methodology was used to visualize and fit grain n content wp and yield 3 results 3 1 soil no3 n concentration over the two seasons significant variation in soil no3 n occurred in the corresponding soil layer after the deep urea placement to different precipitation levels during the anthesis stage of the winter wheat when compared with conventional surface fertilization p 0 05 fig 1 compared with d5 deep urea placement increased the soil no3 n in the 0 100 cm layer especially under the larger depth treatments and the difference was most obvious in the 60 100 cm specifically the soil no3 n concentrations in the 0 20 cm layer were higher in urea placement at the shallow layer treatments d5 and d15 i e significantly higher than those in d25 and d35 by 22 7 42 1 in 2020 and 22 0 41 6 in 2021 p 0 05 under three precipitation levels in dry year the soil no3 n concentration in the 20 60 cm layer followed the order of d35 d25 d15 d5 those in deep urea placement treatments were significantly higher than d5 by 5 85 41 04 in 2020 and 15 2 52 57 in 2021 p 0 05 the soil no3 n concentration in the 20 60 cm layer under normal and wet years were highest at d25 and significantly higher than d15 and d5 respectively p 0 05 and not significantly different from d35 increasing the rainfall amount improved the soil no3 n in 0 100 cm layer during the two seasons which generally differed significantly between all precipitation scenarios p 0 05 increase in rainfall amount significantly contributed to soil no3 n in 0 100 cm layer under all four urea fertilizer placement depth treatments p 0 05 3 2 root weight density and root length density of winter wheat winter wheat root growth and its spatial distribution in the soil profile were altered by the urea placement depths and precipitation levels during the two growing seasons particularly at anthesis figs 2 3 s1 in particular rwd and rld showed no significant differences in the 0 20 cm soil layer between d5 and d15 and d5 was higher than other treatments by 5 6 31 7 rwd and 3 0 5 4 rld in 2020 respectively and 10 8 42 2 and 3 7 8 1 in 2021 among three precipitation levels compared with d5 the rld and rwd values in 20 60 cm layer under deep urea placement were significantly higher in dry year in both seasons there were no significant differences in rld and rwd between d15 and d5 and d15 was higher than other treatments by 1 5 9 2 rld and 6 0 13 4 rwd under wet year during two seasons in normal year d5 decreased the rld and rwd in the 20 60 cm layer by 0 32 12 78 and 7 02 42 92 than d15 and d25 while with no significant differences between d5 and d35 in both seasons compared with d5 deep urea placement increased the rwd and rld values in the 60 100 cm soil layer regardless of precipitations especially under the larger depth treatment more obviously in 2020 in most cases as the rainfall amount increased the rwd and rld values of the 0 100 cm layer were promoted under four fertilizer depth treatments in both seasons 3 3 resource utilization of winter wheat the most effective fertilization depth among variable rainfall conditions increased the n uptake by plant and grain n content in maturity and promoted the n translocation after the anthesis during the two seasons table 2 compared with d5 d35 increased namaturity nagrain and n translocation during 2019 2021 by 13 6 18 5 15 4 23 0 and 30 4 40 3 in dry year and d25 in normal year increased those by 9 9 29 0 11 3 11 3 12 3 13 8 than d5 respectively p 0 05 in wet year there was no significant difference in those between d5 and d15 in both seasons and d15 significantly increased those by 4 8 10 8 3 8 11 3 and 8 2 19 4 than d25 and d35 respectively p 0 05 in most cases the n accumulation of winter wheat increased as the amount of rainfall increased under four fertilizer depth treatments table 2 in particular d25 in normal year increased n uptake 2 87 10 06 than in wet year while the difference between d25 in normal and wet year was not significant in both seasons suitable deep urea placement enhanced the pfpn nre and wp table 2 in dry and normal years the highest nre pfpn and wp were obtained in p125d35 and p200d25 in both seasons respectively when compared with d5 the nre pfpn and wp were significantly increased by 39 1 43 6 19 9 20 4 11 8 15 8 in d35 under dry year and 30 7 32 5 14 6 16 9 9 5 10 0 in d25 under normal year p 0 05 in wet year the differences in pfpn nre and wp between d5 and d15 were not significant in both seasons and d15 significantly increased pfpn nre and wp by 20 9 38 4 7 9 14 9 and 4 7 10 5 than other treatments respectively 3 4 relationship between root growth and n accumulation during 2019 2021 the rld and rwd in the 0 20 cm and 20 60 cm soil layer was positively correlated with the accumulated n in the anthesis and maturity grain n content and n translocation p 0 05 fig 4 compared with the 0 20 cm soil layer the rld and rwd values in the 20 60 cm soil layer was more strongly correlated with the n accumulated by wheat in the anthesis and maturity grain n content and n translocation in addition the rld and rwd values in the 20 60 cm soil layer were more strongly correlated with the plant n accumulation r2 0 80 in the maturity stage than anthesis r2 0 66 and thus the correlation with n translocation was lower r2 0 53 3 5 winter wheat growth and grain yield the aboveground biomass values at seedling and tillering stages were higher than other deeper urea placement treatments under d5 and d15 and the promotion effect of deep urea placement on aboveground biomass was mainly observed in late growth stage and varied as rainfall conditions among the two growing seasons fig 5 the deep urea placement and rainfall level had significant effect on the wheat aboveground biomass and yield p 0 05 the accumulated dry matter in maturity in d25 was higher than d5 and d15 among dry and normal years p 0 05 slightly lower than that in d35 under dry year but significantly higher than d35 in normal year p 0 05 in wet year there was no significant difference in the aboveground biomass in maturity between d5 and d15 and d15 was higher by 7 3 13 1 in 2020 and 16 5 18 7 in 2021 than other treatments respectively p 0 05 the effect of the deep urea placement under three rainfall conditions on the aboveground biomass and grain yield in maturity were consistent during 2019 2021 increasing the rainfall amount improved the wheat growth and yield during 2019 2021 table 2 and fig 5 in most cases as the rainfall amount increased the aboveground biomass and grain yield at maturity were significantly promoted under four fertilizer depth treatments in particular d25 under normal year obtained higher aboveground biomass 2 87 10 06 and grain yield 1 33 8 0 than in wet year however there was no significant difference in the accumulated dry matter and yield of d25 between normal and wet year 3 6 optimization of deep urea placement under different rainfall levels on grain yield grain n accumulation and wp the change in the wheat yield grain n content and wp of different treatments were investigated by response surface analysis table 3 fig 6 considering the r2 values were 0 81 0 88 and 0 69 p 0 01 the regression equation intuitively represented the effects of the rainfall amount and deep urea placement on the wheat yield grain n content and wp the fitting results indicated that applying urea fertilizer at a depth of 28 cm 20 7 cm and 12 6 cm under dry normal and wet years could maximize the yield at 5 3 t ha 1 6 6 t ha 1 and 7 3 t ha 1 moreover applying urea fertilizer at a depth of 30 0 cm 21 6 cm and 13 1 cm may obtain the highest grain n content of 134 4 kg ha 1 151 2 kg ha 1 and 162 1 kg ha 1 while at 29 1 cm 20 7 cm and 12 3 cm can optimize wp to 1 8 kg m 3 2 0 kg m 3 and 2 0 kg m 3 in dry normal and wet year it is not possible to maximize the yield grain n content and wp with urea placement at the same soil depth but different rainfall amounts based on the 95 confidence intervals obtained the regression equation we found that applying urea at soil depths of 28 0 30 0 cm 20 7 21 6 cm and 12 3 13 1 cm could optimize the yield grain n content and wp in dry normal and wet year respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effect of deep urea placement on root growth under different rainfall amounts the root morphology and distribution may vary when the soil physical and chemical properties are different hodge 2005 lynch 2011 in the present study the soil was loosened to the same depth of 35 cm before adding the fertilizer for all treatments and thus the soil disturbance was consistent therefore the morphology traits differences in the plant root system among treatments were mainly due to differences in the temporal and spatial availability of soil moisture and inorganic n with different urea placement depths and rainfall amounts the root morphology and distribution play a key role in the root growth and root system development li et al 2021a which is mainly determined by the soil no3 n concentration guo et al 2019 ke et al 2018 yan et al 2021 previous studies have shown that deep fertilization placement can effectively promote root extension and stimulate root proliferation in deeper layer cheng et al 2020 wu et al 2022b we also obtained similar results because deep urea placement significantly promoted the root morphology traits rld and rwd especially in deeper layer 60 100 cm figs 2 3 s1 our study further suggested that it was possible that the promoted effect of suitable deep urea placement on the accumulation of soil no3 n in the corresponding layer resulted in the root system extension was most evident in the 20 60 cm layer especially at anthesis figs 1 3 and fig s1 hodge 2004 liu et al 2022 despite the positive relationship between deep urea placement to root system development we also found that not all placement depths were equally advanced for main root growth conventional surface application allowed soil no3 n to accumulate at the surface layer 0 20 cm in early stage fig 1 which promoted shallow root system growth before the jointing stage compared with deep urea placement fig s1 although root system grew vigorously in the 60 100 cm soil layer under d35 in normal and wet year the total rld and rwd was reduced than conventional surface fertilization in the 0 60 cm soil layer under d35 these results can be explained by the higher nitrate leaching into the deeper soil layer 60 100 cm under d35 compared with the other placement depths fig 1 the soil no3 n concentration could have been excessively low in the layer containing main roots which could be detrimental to the growth of shallow root in early growth moreover from our field experiment we provided compelling trial evidence that precipitation amount significantly promoted the total wheat root growth and the soil no3 n accumulation 0 100 cm fig 1 and similar results were obtained in previous studies li et al 2021a qi et al 2019 in addition our results further revealed that root system of deeper urea placement treatments d25 and d35 was more vigorous in the 60 100 cm soil layer under wet year compared with normal year however the total root weight of that was lower in the 0 60 cm layer owing to the increased amount of rainfall increasing the soil nitrate leaching in the deeper layer under deep urea placement compared with normal year fig 1 an insufficient supply of nutrients in the surface soil layer may inhibit the absorption and utilization by the wheat roots before the jointing stage wu et al 2022a however the root system responded to the soil no3 n concentration in the deep layer during the later growth stage thereby resulting in redundant root growth in the deeper soil layer fig s1 finally our research highlights the moderating effect of precipitation type on the effectiveness of deep urea placement on root distribution and growth 4 2 effects of deep urea placement on crop water nitrogen utilization under different rainfall amounts previous studies suggest that deep fertilization application significantly affects the crop n absorption and water productivity liedgens et al 2000 liu et al 2017 we obtained similar results where suitable deep urea fertilization significantly advanced n uptake as well as n use efficiency especially in dry and normal years table 2 our motivation was to explore the mechanism of improving crop water n utilization through deep urea fertilization and further investigate the response of the mentioned mechanisms to different placement depths and precipitation for improving crop production we hypothesized that localized n concentration resulting from urea fertilizer deep placement can stimulate root spatial configuration thereby increasing n and water resource utilization in particular we found a positive link between the root traits rld and rwd in the 20 60 cm soil layer and plant n accumulation under all precipitation amounts fig 4 this mechanism highlights that deep urea placement could promote root growth in the 20 60 cm soil layer expanding the contact space between the root system and the deeper soil to increase the n accumulation of wheat and nue in particular we found no contribution to the improvement of n uptake and n use efficiency in wheat of deeper urea placement d25 and d35 under wet year table 2 possibly due to increased rainfall that exacerbated nitrate leaching into deeper layer 60 100 cm fig 1 resulting a thinner root system in 20 60 cm layer thereby decreasing the n uptake by wheat and nue figs 2 3 still root growth was effectively promoted in the 0 60 cm soil layer under a suitable depth in deep urea placement d15 and the n absorption of wheat under d15 was higher compared with the conventional surface fertilization application thus we proposed that suitable urea fertilizer placement could obtain the highest n accumulation and n utilization efficiency by enhancing root traits rld and rwd in the 20 60 cm layer one should note that while the optimal depth of deep urea fertilizer application is tailored to rainfall amount it is of importance to maximize the production per unit water consumption in semi humid areas with limited rainfall and this shall be achieved by establishing an appropriate fertilization system wu et al 2022b our results showed that moderate deep urea placement was effective in improving wp compared to conventional surface fertilization especially in dry and normal years table 2 deep n placement can improve plant root morphology configuration through localized n concentrations adjuration to increase nutrient capture and in turn increased plant n uptake will further promote deeper root growth zhang et al 2022 higher wp in deep urea placement may due to the vigorous root system of wheat in deeper soil figs 2 3 s1 resulting in promotion of the water absorption from the deeper soil layer wu et al 2022b however we found that the effect of deep urea fertilization on improving wp in wet year was not as pronounced as in normal and dry years it is well known that wp changed according to the changes in grain yield fernández et al 2020 excessive water supply in wet year may have caused nitrate leaching thereby decreasing the n available for absorption by wheat especially under deep urea placement fig 1 that may reduce n uptake and thus reduce wheat yield table 2 zou et al 2020 our research highlights that deep urea placement is an effective agricultural efficient water measure within limited water supply especially in semi humid areas 4 3 effects of deep urea placement on wheat growth and grain yield under different rainfall amounts the fertilizer application depth has different effects on the aboveground biomass in various growth stages han et al 2015 yan et al 2021 our results showed that the accumulated dry matter was higher under d5 and d15 in the seedling stage and tillering stage fig 5 however the promotion effect of deep urea placement on dry matter accumulation was mainly demonstrated after jointing stage which was consistent with the results obtained in maize wu et al 2022a and the more severe the soil water scarcity the greater the effect of deep urea placement on accumulated dry matter enhancement fig 5 these results can be explained by the shallow root system before jointing stage mainly absorbing nutrients from the 0 20 cm soil layer li et al 2022 the deeper urea placement treatments had a lower shallow root system than the conventional surface application fig s1 which may affect the wheat aboveground biomass in the early growth of wheat wheat entered the vigorous vegetative growth jointing and anthesis stages and the root system extended into deeper soil layer containing fertilizer n fig s1 with a rapid nutrient compensation effect li et al 2021a 2022 thus the root system may exhibit rapid growth under deep urea placement treatments absorb large amounts of water and nutrients the aboveground biomass could increase rapidly from the jointing stage and higher under deep urea placement in anthesis and maturity wu et al 2022b deep n placement could increase the dry matter and yield of crop in maturity compared with the conventional surface fertilizer application li et al 2021b wu et al 2022a in particular we provided solid evidence that deep urea placement can be highly advantageous but the benefits may vary with depth and rainfall amounts the highest aboveground biomass in maturity occurred in deep urea placement at deeper depth in dry and normal years than wet year in wet year urea placement at a deeper depth was not conducive to dry matter accumulation fig 5 this can be attributed to the intensification of soil nitrate leaching in 60 100 cm under d25 and d35 in wet year thus the nutrient supply in the root layer at anthesis was insufficient fig 1 thereby decreasing the aboveground biomass in late growth and thus the yield wu et al 2022a therefore in semi humid region within low water supply deep urea placement in a deeper depth can be an effective measure to maintain higher aboveground biomass in the later growth stages and ensure further increases in grain yield without a fertilizer rate increase 4 4 comprehensive effects of deep urea placement to different rainfall amounts on wheat yield grain n content and crop water productivity agricultural management practices have a key role in improving crop yield nutrient uptake and wp although the quantitative relationships between fertilizer management irrigation or cultivation methods with the crop yield grain n content and wp have been widely reported wang et al 2019 yan et al 2021 yang et al 2017 zou et al 2020 the basic attributes of nutrients have largely been ignored particularly in placement in the present study the three dimensional relationships of grain yield grain n content and wp against rainfall and deep urea placement exhibited an upward convex shape fig 6 these three indexes generally first increased and then decreased as placement depth increased which illustrated that effective fertilization practices were included in the treatments designed in this study optimizing the grain yield grain n content and wp within the limited rainfall and n fertilizer rate and the optimal depth of urea placement for the three indexes was deeper in dry year which further confirmed that under low water supply the greater the effect of deep urea placement the predicted yield under deep urea placement was ultimately higher by 0 03 wet year 0 93 t ha 1 dry year compared with the conventional surface fertilization mainly grain n content required more nutrient n than yield maximization average internal n nutrient efficiency is estimated at 40 1 kg grain kg 1 for wheat and the quefts model suggests nutrient contents of 24 6 kg n per 1000 kg of grain with a linear increase in grain yields liu et al 2006 the maximum grain n content occurred at a deeper depth application than that of yield within the same fertilizer rate and rainfall in our study that indicated that deep urea placement can meet the nitrogen demand of wheat growth by deepening the depth without increasing the n fertilizer rate overall we propose that suitable deep urea fertilization placement management can increase wheat production without more water and fertilizer consumption in semi humid area 5 conclusion deep urea placement at suitable depth under all precipitation levels in semi humid region indirectly improved the nitrogen nutrient status of wheat plants by spatially adjusting the soil nitrate nitrogen content and enhancing root characteristics in the deeper soil layer due to the positive correlation between wheat n uptake and root growth deep urea placement facilitated raised water productivity and nitrogen resource utilization in deeper soil by providing the robust deep root system and ultimately increasing yield as well as maintaining the soil no3 n concentration at a low level with more pronounced effects in dry and normal years our study highlights that urea placement at 28 0 30 0 cm 20 7 21 6 cm and 12 3 13 1 cm in the dry year normal year and wet year can be recommended as a more reasonable alternative to conventional surface fertilization in semi humid regions however the overall response rules of wheat growth among different cultivars along wide various climate regions to deep urea fertilization placement especially in humid and arid regions are still lacking multiple years of field studies would

9267,under the current water scarcity scenario the promotion of water saving strategies is essential for improving the sustainability of the irrigated agriculture in particular high resolution irrigated area maps are required for better understanding water uses and supporting water management authorities the main purpose of this study was to provide a stand alone remote sensing rs methodology for mapping irrigated areas specifically an unsupervised classification approach on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data was coupled with the optical trapezoid model optram for detecting actual irrigated areas without the use of any reference data the proposed methodology was firstly applied and validated at the marchfeld cropland region austria during the irrigation season 2021 showing a good agreement with an overall accuracy of 70 secondly it was applied at the irrigation district quota 102 50 italy for the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 the results of the latter were instead compared with the data declared by the reclamation consortium finding an overestimation of irrigated areas of 21 in conclusion this study suggests an easy to use approach eventually independent of reference data such as agricultural statistical surveys or records and replicable under different agricultural settings in continental or mediterranean climates to support stakeholders for regular estimation of irrigated areas in different growing years or detecting eventual unauthorized water uses however some uncertainties should be considered needing further analyses for improving the accuracy of the proposed approach keywords satellite images rainfall unsupervised classification ndvi water content data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction water scarcity represents a global risk in terms of potential impact on the sustainable development of human society mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 moreover under climate change conditions prolonged droughts are expected to occur in the future with an increasing of crop dependency on water supply scanlon et al 2012 irrigated agriculture is the principal consumer of freshwater resources its role is essential for increasing crop production and ensuring the global food yield cai and rosegrant 2002 jin et al 2016 due to the global population growth and the discrepancy between crop water requirements and the actual irrigation applied a better agricultural water management is required in order to fulfil the increasing demand for food production gao et al 2018 in this context detailed spatial information on the irrigated areas is essential for supporting agriculture water management ambika et al 2016 in particular accurate mapping of irrigated areas could allow a better understanding of water use and food production patterns supporting stakeholders to formulate more suitable water management strategies to achieve higher crop water productivity chance et al 2017 however the accurate extent and distribution of many irrigated areas remains often unknown despite the significant impact of irrigation on food security and water resources bazzi et al 2019b cai et al 2017 in fact even though huge efforts have been made in the last years in this regard there is a general lack of accurate and current maps about irrigated areas avoiding the full implementation and compliance of the water framework directive wfd bolognesi et al 2020 magidi et al 2021 in italy the national institute of agricultural economics inea has contributed to design the irrigation water policy by supporting the italian ministry of agricultural food and forestry policies mipaaf since the 1960 s inea has conducted the census of irrigated areas producing the map of irrigation in italy currently the most complete and updated database that supports governmental institutions is the national information system for water management in agriculture sigrian https sigrian crea gov it which collect the information coming from water management authorities i e reclamation consortia and other irrigation agencies nevertheless the level of detail of the sigrian database is often not enough accurate for a proper evaluation of irrigation water uses in austria farm structure surveys are conducted as i full survey census on the basis of eu legislation every 10 years and ii sample survey at regular intervals 3 4 years by austria s federal statistical office statistics austria farm structure surveys conducted by questionnaires also comprise features with respect to irrigation particularly the total irrigable area of an agricultural operation or the actual irrigated area of areas with field vegetables however overall the data situation with respect to actual irrigated areas requires improvement especially with respect to the time gaps within the surveys that might miss particularly dry years with high irrigation needs since the 1980 s remote sensing rs has been used to map land cover and agricultural areas at different spatial and temporal scales pareeth et al 2019 one of the main methods implemented to derive this information is based on the use of satellite based optical data single date imagery acquired during the peak of the crop growing season can be used for classifying the irrigated areas although the use of multi temporal imagery approach is preferred as it covers the different phenology stages of the crops ghassemi et al 2022 vuolo et al 2018 a common approach is based on the analysis of the ndvi time series due to its ability to show a considerable difference between irrigated and non irrigated pixels ozdogan et al 2006 2010 the use of ndvi as an indicator of vegetation phenology provides a simple proxy for classifying complex landscapes chance et al 2017 in particular ndvi is considered a sufficiently good indicator of irrigation presence ozdogan et al 2006 thanks to its capability to measure green biomass and the existing strong correlation between green biomass and the available moisture for vegetation pervez and brown 2010 for instance bolognesi et al 2020 applied this approach for mapping the actual extent of irrigated areas in italy in semi arid conditions in their study rainfed areas and irrigated areas were classified on the basis of the analysis of ndvi time series and accumulated rainfall data however this approach highlights some limitations especially in areas where the same crop type is grown with and without irrigation during the same growing season in these areas in fact as suggested by ozdogan et al 2010 the temporal ndvi profiles of both irrigated and non irrigated crops may show an identical pattern emphasizing the need for a more sensitive index to make this distinction additionally optical rs applications depend on atmospheric conditions for areas with frequent cloud cover these methods may not be adaptable gao et al 2018 the use of microwave rs offers a good alternative to optical rs for mapping irrigated areas also under cloudy conditions due to the ability of microwaves to penetrate through vegetation canopy and underlying soil especially at lower frequencies where measurements are not impeded by clouds or darkness sadeghi et al 2015 2017 specifically microwave domain measurements can be used to estimate soil moisture dynamics because the pronounced contrast between the dielectric constant values of the wet and dry soils baghdadi and zribi 2016 lakhankar et al 2009 kumar et al 2015 investigated the capability of several microwave remotely sensed soil moisture products including ascat advanced scatterometer amsr e advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system esa cci sm european space agency climate change initiative soil moisture smos soil moisture and ocean salinity while lawston et al 2017 showed the capability of the enhanced version of smap soil moisture active passive to detect the irrigation signal although these products have shown greater potential for monitoring soil moisture dynamics they consider both rainfall and irrigation effects on soil moisture karthikeyan et al 2020 and may require calibrations to account for surface roughness which causes perturbation of the microwave signal shi et al 2006 additionally the application of microwave based retrieval of soil moisture is not well suited for small scale applications because the very coarse resolution especially when compared with the higher spatial resolution outputs of optical methods sadeghi et al 2017 yue et al 2019 more recently several authors bazzi et al 2019a b gao et al 2018 exploited instead sentinel 1 sar synthetic aperture radar time series to map irrigated fields specifically based on the multi temporal analysis of backscatter time series using vertical vertical vv and vertical horizontal vh polarizations their studies showed that vv resulted more sensitive for characterizing the soil moisture conditions while vh was more sensitive for monitoring the vegetation status however more studies exploiting this approach are required dari et al 2021 commonly both optical and microwave rs data are used as inputs for mapping the irrigated areas and for distinguishing the different classes by applying supervised classification approaches because these approaches require ground reference data to build rule based classifiers their transferability in time and space is not always guaranteed especially under different climate conditions ragettli et al 2018 pageot et al 2020 recently sadeghi et al 2017 proposed the physically based optram specifically this methodology is based on the pixel distribution within the ndvi and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance str space for estimating the soil moisture by using only optical data in the last years optram has been successfully applied for mapping the soil moisture at high resolution in rainfed and irrigated fields ambrosone et al 2020 babaeian et al 2019 the promising results obtained in these studies highlight the possibility of using optram also for discriminating between irrigated and non irrigated areas in fact besides the visible vis and near infrared nir bands of ndvi it introduces additional information on the short wave infrared swir with the str index which provides high sensitivity to soil moisture variation sadeghi et al 2015 in this context the aims of this study were to develop a stand alone optical rs method able to detect the irrigated areas based on the combined use of the unsupervised classification and optram to validate and test the proposed method at different spatial level i e field and district level respectively under different climate conditions hence the study would provide an easy to use method not dependent on ground reference data and replicable under different contexts aiming at supporting the stakeholders for monitoring and reporting the irrigated areas this will allow the promotion of efficient water saving strategies and the accomplishment of the requirements of water related policies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at 2 different test sites fig 1 the irrigation district quota 102 50 in italy 2019 2020 and the marchfeld cropland region in austria 2021 the irrigation district quota 102 50 managed by the reclamation consortium sicilia orientale is located in eastern sicily lat 37 44 n 37 54 n long 14 85 e 15 05 e wgs84 fig 1a the district is characterized by a total area of 5050 ha and an irrigated area of about 2300 ha that is mainly cultivated with citrus olive and fruit groves the irrigation season is generally from mid may to mid october depending on the weather conditions the climate is hot summer mediterranean csa under the köppen geiger classification according to beck et al 2018 during the study period the average annual precipitation values were of 597 and 656 mm for 2019 and 2020 respectively with values of 201 and 202 mm recorded during the 2019 20 irrigation seasons the cropland area of marchfeld is located in lower austria lat 48 10 n 48 50 n long 16 40 e 17 00 e wgs84 fig 1b it covers an agricultural surface of about 60 000 ha with an irrigated surface of about 21 000 ha the main cultivated crops are vegetables sugar beet potatoes and winter cereals immitzer et al 2016 the irrigation season is from mid april to mid july deissenberger 2021 conventionally the area is characterised by a warm summer humid continental climate dfb beck et al 2018 however it is the driest region of austria with an average annual precipitation of 500 mm for the study period 2021 with 109 mm during the irrigation season 2 2 detection of the irrigated areas fig 2 shows a flow chart of the proposed methodological approach specifically the detection of the irrigated areas was performed by combining a preliminary unsupervised classification on a seasonal ndvi time series for identifying the potentially irrigated clusters and the subsequent application of the optram model on these clusters for more specifically distinguishing the irrigated pixels from the non irrigated pixels during the dry period of the irrigation season the entire process required two types of data sources at the initial stage i e sentinel 2 satellite images and rainfall values and then the soil parameters i e wilting point wp and field capacity fc for applying optram approach only clear sky satellite images covering the test areas within the reference study periods were used for the austrian test site a pre processing of the images for removing cloudy pixels was necessary due the unavailability of images with perfect clear sky conditions a preliminary analysis of rainfall values was conducted in order to identify the dry periods during the irrigation seasons specifically these dry periods were characterised by a cumulated rainfall value during the 10 previous days of 0 mm at the irrigation district quota 102 50 and lower than 4 mm at marchfeld cropland a sub dataset of satellite images was created within the dry periods for dates with a daily rainfall value of 0 mm tab s1 finally ndvi and str values were calculated for each pixel of the potentially irrigated clusters representing the input for the optram approach application 2 2 1 dataset input in this study the multispectral images from sentinel 2 european space agency s esa satellite https sentinel esa int web sentinel missions sentinel 2 were used the satellite is equipped with an opto electronic multispectral sensor msi for imaging the earth surface with a spatial resolution of 10 60 m in the vis nir and swir spectral zones the temporal resolution of each single sentinel 2 satellite sentinel 2 a and b is 10 days leading to a revisit time of 5 days with two satellites in operation a total of 158 sentinel 2 images were collected at the study areas 65 and 62 images for the irrigation district quota 102 50 during the years 2019 2020 respectively t33svb tile fig 1 and 31 images for marchfeld cropland region during the year 2021 t33uxp tile fig 1 for each dataset a time series ndvi stack layer was created using all the available images rainfall data were collected from the closest ground based automatic meteorological stations to the two test sites i e 4 weather stations distant between 10 and 31 km from the irrigation district quota 102 50 figs s1a and 4 weather stations distant between 18 and 36 km from the marchfeld cropland region fig s1b managed respectively by the sicilian agro meteorological information service sias www sias regione sicilia it and the central institute for meteorology and geodynamics zamg www zamg ac at in fig 3 the observed daily rainfall values and the identified dry periods during the irrigation season were reported in the supplementary material section table s1 reports the sentinel 2 images used in the study for the two test sites for each image the type of sentinel satellite a or b the daily rainfall value mm and the cumulated rainfall value mm in the previous 10 days are reported the dry dates selected during the irrigation season for applying optram are also indicated 2 2 2 unsupervised classification as reported in fig 2 the application of the unsupervised classification on the ndvi time series represented the first main step of the proposed methodological approach with the aim to grouping similar ndvi patterns in unlabelled clusters as reported by bolognesi et al 2020 and chance et al 2017 the presence of green and healthy vegetation during the dry season when no precipitation events are observed can be attributed to irrigation water applications in this context the following first hypothesis can be applied during the irrigation season low and decreasing temporal ndvi profiles could refer to non irrigated areas whereas high and increasing temporal ndvi profiles could refer to irrigated areas according to this hypothesis clusters can be labelled as non irrigated or potentially irrigated depending on the ndvi trends observed during the irrigation season a value of 0 3 was set as ndvi threshold for distinguishing the high and low ndvi temporal profiles in fact according to campoy et al 2020 gonzález gómez et al 2018 and lobell et al 2013 this value represents the green up of vegetation the algorithm used in this study was the isodata ball and hall 1965 requiring only the raster and the number of clusters as input the number of clusters was decided to minimize the standard deviation in terms of ndvi of each one in order to have clusters as clear as possible specifically a number of 20 clusters was used from which temporal average patterns of ndvi were extracted during the irrigation seasons at the two test sites clusters were labelled as i non irrigated when ndvi trends were lower than 0 3 or decreasing and ii potentially irrigated when ndvi trends were higher than 0 3 or increasing pixels representing non agricultural lands such as water negative ndvi values and built up ndvi values ranging from 0 0 to 0 1 were removed by using the ndvi temporal profile analysis 2 2 3 optical trapezoid model in a second step the clusters labelled as potentially irrigated were further analysed to better discriminate between irrigated and non irrigated pixels through the use of the optram with additional information based on the vis nir and swir bands optram is based on the pixel distribution within the ndvi str space assuming a linear relationship between soil and vegetation water content the str ndvi feature space forms a trapezoid shape sadeghi et al 2017 the upper and the lower sides of the str ndvi feature space indicating the wet and the dry edges respectively were used to solve the water content w for each pixel as a function of ndvi and str 1 w i d s d ndvi str i d i w s d s w ndvi where id sd and iw sw parameters are respectively the intercept and the slope of the dry and wet edges of the str ndvi feature space by using cluster specific linear parametrizations of optram and introducing a threshold value based on the soil water content swc status well watered vegetation and stressed vegetation can be discriminated on the str ndvi feature space during the irrigation season under dry conditions e g 10 days with no precipitation events recorded in fact thresholds of swc indicate the water availability for crop consumption and their identification ensure the maintenance of soil moisture conditions that avoid physiological stress datta et al 2017 thompson et al 2007 according to several authors jabro et al 2020 lozoya et al 2014 wp is that threshold at which plants cannot longer adsorb water from the soil and start to wilt specifically at wp threshold transpiration and all the other processes vital to plant survival come to stop causing a significant reduction in crop growth if swc remains below the wp for an extended period crops will eventually die datta et al 2017 thus the second hypothesis of the proposed approach was the following during the irrigation season in absence of precipitation events for an extended period if w is greater than wp there is available water in the soil due to the irrigation practice and vegetation may be well watered whereas if w is lower than wp there is no available water and vegetation may be under stress conditions on the basis of this second hypothesis pixels were classified as irrigated or non irrigated when w calculated as a function of ndvi str by applying optram exceeded or not the wp respectively fig 4 in this study optram was applied for each date of the dry period during the irrigation season in order to determine w for the pixels of each cluster considering only potentially irrigated clusters the w values were converted into swc values through a linear regression analysis performed using the wp and the fc data retrieved by the european soil database https esdac jrc ec europa eu resource type european soil database soil properties the wp threshold values were of 23 27 and 11 85 for the marchfeld cropland region and the irrigation district quota 102 50 respectively for each test site and irrigation season the differences between swc and wp values were calculated for the pixels of the selected sentinel 2 satellite images i e 4 images for the marchfeld cropland region during 2021 and 7 images for the irrigation district quota 102 50 during both 2019 2020 the final label was assigned by considering an average value of the difference swc wp on the several dates as follows i irrigated when the average of the differences swc wp 0 ii non irrigated when the average of the differences swc wp 0 at the marchfeld cropland region in order to validate the proposed methodological approach at field level a crop mask https geometadatensuche inspire gv at was used for separating the single fields each field was finally labelled by considering the most frequent pixel values irrigated or non irrigated on the other hand at the irrigation district quota 102 50 no crop mask was employed and each pixel was finally labelled as irrigated or non irrigated however a sub districts mask provided by the reclamation consortium was used fig s4 and only pixels within this mask were considered in order to validate at district level 2 3 statistical assessment the validation of the results obtained in the study was performed at two different levels i accuracy assessment of the detection of the irrigated areas at field level for the marchfeld cropland region ii evaluation of the estimated irrigated areas surface at district level for the irrigation district quota 102 50 specifically the accuracy assessment at the marchfeld cropland region was performed using a binary confusion matrix between the estimated irrigated non irrigated areas with the methodological approach and the reference data collected during a campaign in the framework of another study bml 2022 a total of 2560 reference fields were used of which 160 irrigated and 2400 non irrigated the campaign aimed at putting together a comprehensive database of georeferenced observation of the irrigation status of several fields in order to take account growing seasons and harvest dates of different crop types the campaign was running during three months in summer 2021 for each observation the following information was documented i observation data and time ii crop type iii type of irrigation system iv irrigation ongoing or turned off a quality check was also performed on the reference database e g with respect to the correct georeferencing of the collected points this was done using field photos taken alongside the data collection all points with unclear georeference were excluded from further analyses while the irrigated fields were observed during the measurements campaign and thus considered very reliable an uncertainty degree should be contemplated for the non irrigated fields since they were derived from a database where farms register their fields and attributes in order to quantitatively evaluate the goodness of the results several metrics including accuracy acc eq 2 precision ppv eq 3 recall tpr eq 4 and f1 score f1 eq 5 were calculated by the confusion matrix as follow 2 acc tp tn tp tn fp fn 3 ppv tp tp fp 4 tpr tp tp fn 5 f 1 2 tp 2 tp fp fn where tp tn fp and fn indicate respectively the true positive true negative false positive and false negative however when the dataset is unbalanced the previous metrics can be misleading in order to overcome this issue relative values were calculated normalizing by the number of elements in each class e g tp and fn were divided by the sum of the reference irrigated areas tp fn whereas fp and tn were divided by the sum of the reference non irrigated areas fp tn in fact the normalization taking into account the unbalanced availability of the classes of the binary confusion matrix allows a better interpretation of the results since the final results could be sensitive to the value of wp a sensitivity analysis was also performed varying the wp threshold in the range of 10 15 20 25 30 35 and the same metrics were determined on the other hand for the irrigation district quota 102 50 the total surface of the irrigated areas ha obtained by applying the proposed approach was compared to the data declared by the consortium 3 results 3 1 marchfeld cropland fig 5 shows the temporal ndvi profiles of the 20 clusters obtained by applying the isodata classification on the study area for the year 2021 cluster 1 was forthwith excluded because it represents water bodies negative ndvi values during the irrigation season ndvi trends were decreasing or constant and lower than 0 3 for the clusters 2 3 5 6 7 10 11 17 and 18 considering the first hypothesis they were labelled as non irrigated on the other hand ndvi trends were constant and higher than 0 3 or increasing for the clusters 4 8 9 12 13 14 15 16 19 and 20 and they were labelled as potentially irrigated in order to facilitate the interpretation of fig 5 the labels assigned for each cluster are reported in table 1 fig s2 shows instead the preliminary map of the potentially irrigated areas at the marchfeld cropland region a cluster specific linear parametrization of optram on potentially irrigated clusters was performed in order to derive the wet and dry edges specifically pixels of potentially irrigated clusters were distributed within the str ndvi feature space of optram fig 6 where the wet and dry edges were determined by a visual inspection as suggested by sadeghi et al 2017 in fact the authors showed as this approach is better than least square regression since oversatured or shadowed pixels scattered around the main point cloud of each trapezoid can be omitted the obtained optram parameters i e id sd iw sw are reported in tab s2 by using optram parameters of tab s2 w values were calculated for each pixel of the selected clusters and then converted into swc values by calculating the difference between the average swc value and the wp and applying the second hypothesis agricultural lands were labelled as irrigated or non irrigated the final map of the irrigated areas obtained for the test site is reported in fig 7 as shown in this figure there is a prevalence of non irrigated areas at marchfeld region during the irrigation season of 2021 in fact the surfaces of the non irrigated areas and the irrigated areas were of 64 and 36 respectively of the total surface of the agricultural lands fig 8 shows the binary confusion matrix between the estimated and the reference irrigated non irrigated areas an overall acc of 71 was obtained with ppv tpr f1 values of 72 68 and 70 respectively fig 9 finally fig 9 shows the sensitivity of metrics by varying the original wp threshold 23 in the range of 10 15 20 25 30 35 acc tpr and f1 values decreased from 74 to 58 from 80 to 26 and from 76 to 39 respectively in the wp range of 10 15 20 25 30 35 ppv values instead increased from 71 to 75 respectively in the range of 10 15 20 25 30 35 3 2 irrigation district quota 102 50 figs 10 and 11 show the temporal ndvi profiles of the 20 clusters obtained by applying the isodata classification to the study area for the year 2019 and 2020 respectively cluster 1 was excluded for both the years because it represents built up ndvi values ranging from 0 0 to 0 1 decreasing or constant and lower than 0 3 ndvi trends were observed for clusters 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 11 and 12 during the irrigation season 2019 and for clusters 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 11 and 13 during the irrigation season 2020 labelling them as non irrigated otherwise constant and higher than 0 3 or increasing ndvi trends were observed for clusters 10 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 during the irrigation season 2019 and for clusters 8 9 12 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 during the irrigation season 2020 these clusters were labelled as potentially irrigated table 2 reports the labels assigned for each cluster fig s3 shows instead the preliminary maps of the potentially irrigated areas at the irrigation district quota 102 50 pixels of potentially irrigated clusters were distributed within the str ndvi feature space of optram figs 12 and 13 and the wet and dry edges were determined by a visual inspection obtaining the parameters id sd iw sw reported in tab s3 note that the w values were calculated and then converted into swc values for the pixels of the selected clusters for all the selected dates of the dry period during the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 using the parameters reported in tab s3 the final maps of the irrigated areas obtained by applying the second hypothesis and labelling the agricultural lands as irrigated or non irrigated are showed in fig 14 for the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 the surfaces of the irrigated areas were of 61 and 60 on the total surface for the years 2019 and 2020 respectively additionally fig s1 shows for each sub district of the quota 102 50 the irrigated surface variation between 2019 and 2020 this variation was calculated as ratio between the difference of irrigated surface on the two irrigation seasons and the total surface of the sub district table 3 shows the comparison between the estimated irrigated areas and the declared irrigated areas by the reclamation consortium an overestimation was observed for both the years showing that the irrigated areas estimated with the proposed approach were grater of 20 98 and 21 16 compared to the declared irrigated areas for the seasons 2019 and 2020 respectively 4 discussion in the current water scarcity scenario the need of up to date and accurate maps of the irrigated areas is essential for supporting stakeholders to formulate suitable water management strategies in the last years many studies have demonstrated the potential of vegetation indices derived from optical rs to detect irrigated areas bolognesi et al 2020 htitiou et al 2019 magidi et al 2021 zurqani et al 2021 htitiou et al 2019 applied an approach based on phenological metrics derived separately from landsat 8 and sentinel 2 ndvi time series using with random forest rf classification for identifying and mapping irrigated crops in semi arid conditions the best performances were obtained for sentinel 2 data with an overall accuracy of 93 in the same climate conditions bolognesi et al 2020 proposed a machine learning classification based approach based on ndvi time series derived from harmonized landsat 8 and sentinel 2 images by comparing six different types of classifiers the authors obtained the best performance with rf reaching an overall accuracy of about 90 in detecting irrigated areas recently magidi et al 2021 proposed an approach for classifying irrigated areas under temperate and subtropical climate conditions they applied rf in conjunction with google earth engine gee platform using landsat 8 and sentinel 2 ndvi time series and other static input data obtaining an overall accuracy of 88 similarly zurqani et al 2021 developed a framework for mapping and quantifying irrigated areas in humid and subtropical climate conditions based on the use of several sentinel 2 spectral indices and other rs datasets on gee platform specifically they produced irrigated and non irrigated land cover maps by applying rf supervised classification for three years with an overall accuracy of 83 73 86 18 and 84 55 for the years 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively despite the high accuracies obtained the approaches proposed by these studies require training process and rules on decision tree structures additionally they did not analyse the case when the same crop type is grown with and without irrigation in the same growing season which could mean similar temporal ndvi profiles as suggested by ozdogan et al 2010 for instance ozdogan and gutman 2008 mapping irrigated areas in central nebraska showed temporal ndvi profiles of irrigated and non irrigated corn fields with a very similar pattern therefore the authors suggested the use of a more sensitive index to make this distinction in this study a new stand alone optical rs approach to map irrigated areas was proposed compared to previous studies it does not require any training and is easily replicable in different contexts using only satellite images rainfall data and wp and fc data moreover when no ground measurements are available for deriving rainfall values alternative data sources such as the climate reanalysis could be used for example as suggested by longo minnolo et al 2022 era5 land reanalysis offers valid rainfall estimates with high probability of detection of the precipitation events in order to map the irrigated areas without using reference data a preliminary clustering classification was used thus crop type is not directly considered the unsupervised classification has been widely adopted for irrigated area mapping although never in fully automated schemes for instance ragettli et al 2018 proposed a method implemented on gee based on unsupervised classification and multi temporal satellite image analysis which made it possible to obtain irrigation maps at 30 m of resolution with an accuracy of 77 96 from 2000 to 2017 specifically they applied the unsupervised classification for creating samples to use as input for rf in the study herein proposed for recognizing the non irrigated and the potentially irrigated areas we used the unsupervised classification and the analysis of the temporal ndvi profiles and the rainfall events thus for each cluster of the unsupervised classification labelled as potentially irrigated which basically represents one or more crop types with the same phenology and green biomass conditions optram was applied for deriving the moisture variation and detecting the actual irrigated areas the resulting map for the austrian site during the irrigation season 2021 was reasonable accurate with an overall accuracy of 70 and a precision for detecting the actual irrigated areas of 71 showing quite lower performances compared to the previous studies that use supervised classification algorithms it should be noticed that the effects of imbalance on performance metrics was faced by normalizing the classes of the confusion matrix luque et al 2019 a similar accuracy about 78 was obtained by dari et al 2021 by applying an approach based only on the use of k means algorithm rs soil moisture products and a land surface model but obtaining maps with lower resolution the maps for the italian site instead showed an overestimation of irrigated areas of about 21 during both the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 with respect to the data declared by the reclamation consortium the overestimation may be in part due to the presence of non declared irrigated areas since several farmers could use own water sources in sicily in fact autonomous irrigation managed by private consortia or owner of single farms is quite widespread and prevails in many areas compared with collective irrigation with abstraction of water from small reservoirs and or wells zucaro et al 2014 some uncertainties in the methodology should be also considered a first source of errors could come from inaccuracies of the unsupervised classification which does not allow a clear crop type distinction affecting optram parameters id sd iw sw in this sense the use of a detailed crop type map derived by supervised approaches could guarantee higher accuracy since optram method would be specifically applied for each crop allowing a better discrimination between irrigated and non irrigated classes this approach was however not tested in this study despite this the use of a ground truth dataset should be taken into account secondly the visual inspection for determining the wet and dry edges of optram suggested by sadeghi et al 2017 could introduce user related bias leading to some degree of uncertainty of model outputs however as demonstrated by babaeian et al 2018 performing a sensitivity analysis by varying the visually fitted parameters the visual inspection results in acceptable soil moisture estimates despite the its perceived user bias in fact optram outputs are not highly sensitive to the dry and wet edge model parameters additionally the reliability of wp and fc of the european soil database used for calibrating w calculated by optram is undefined in fact due the coarse resolution 1 km these products could be not representative of the study areas affecting the swc values as a consequence the use of a not accurate wp as threshold value in the second hypothesis we presented could lead to a not proper estimation of irrigated area affecting the final irrigation maps as showed by the sensibility analysis lastly since soil moisture is highly influenced by rainfall acharya et al 2022 the accuracy and resolution of the rainfall dataset used in the selection of the dry periods could affect swc values calculated by optram these limitations clearly need further investigations in order to enhance the methodological approach proposed additionally since the mapping of irrigated areas at large spatial scales is still a great challenge the enhanced method could be tested at bigger scale recently zhang et al 2022 proposed an approach based on the integrate use of remote sensing irrigation suitability and irrigated area statistics for developing an irrigated cropland map in mainland china despite the good results the authors highlight the heavy dependence of their method on irrigated area statistics and the subjectivity of irrigation suitability analysis as well as the lack of sufficient ground truth data thus the stand alone rs approach presented in this study could provide a valuable contribute to the scientific community regarding irrigation mapping even in the large spatial domain 5 conclusion this paper introduces a new approach for mapping irrigated areas at high resolution under different climate conditions based on the use of the unsupervised classification on ndvi time series and optram the main advantage of this methodology is the requirement of only few input data i e cloud free optical satellite images rainfall values and soil water parameters without needing any reference crop type data and thus allowing its transferability in time and space the approach was applied and tested in marchfeld cropland region in austria under a dfb climate obtaining a map of the irrigated areas for the irrigation season 2021 with an overall accuracy of 70 and a capability in detecting the actual irrigated areas of 71 the proposed approach was also applied in the irrigation district quota 102 50 in italy under csa climate where the results were compared with the irrigation data of the reclamation consortium finding an overestimation by rs of irrigated areas of 21 during the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 despite the lower accuracy compared to studies that use supervised classification approaches these results demonstrate the potential of using optram for irrigation purposes future research could enhance the methodology by studying in detail how crop types affect optram performances and how to solve the main uncertainties related to the soil water parameters additionally all the enhanced framework could be implemented on gee platform or similar cloud computing for larger scale applications in conclusion this approach could allow the promotion of data driven decision for water use and allocation leading to efficient water saving strategies and improving the sustainability of the irrigated agriculture it could be used as an operational monitoring system by water management authorities for regular reporting of irrigated areas

9267,under the current water scarcity scenario the promotion of water saving strategies is essential for improving the sustainability of the irrigated agriculture in particular high resolution irrigated area maps are required for better understanding water uses and supporting water management authorities the main purpose of this study was to provide a stand alone remote sensing rs methodology for mapping irrigated areas specifically an unsupervised classification approach on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data was coupled with the optical trapezoid model optram for detecting actual irrigated areas without the use of any reference data the proposed methodology was firstly applied and validated at the marchfeld cropland region austria during the irrigation season 2021 showing a good agreement with an overall accuracy of 70 secondly it was applied at the irrigation district quota 102 50 italy for the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 the results of the latter were instead compared with the data declared by the reclamation consortium finding an overestimation of irrigated areas of 21 in conclusion this study suggests an easy to use approach eventually independent of reference data such as agricultural statistical surveys or records and replicable under different agricultural settings in continental or mediterranean climates to support stakeholders for regular estimation of irrigated areas in different growing years or detecting eventual unauthorized water uses however some uncertainties should be considered needing further analyses for improving the accuracy of the proposed approach keywords satellite images rainfall unsupervised classification ndvi water content data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction water scarcity represents a global risk in terms of potential impact on the sustainable development of human society mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 moreover under climate change conditions prolonged droughts are expected to occur in the future with an increasing of crop dependency on water supply scanlon et al 2012 irrigated agriculture is the principal consumer of freshwater resources its role is essential for increasing crop production and ensuring the global food yield cai and rosegrant 2002 jin et al 2016 due to the global population growth and the discrepancy between crop water requirements and the actual irrigation applied a better agricultural water management is required in order to fulfil the increasing demand for food production gao et al 2018 in this context detailed spatial information on the irrigated areas is essential for supporting agriculture water management ambika et al 2016 in particular accurate mapping of irrigated areas could allow a better understanding of water use and food production patterns supporting stakeholders to formulate more suitable water management strategies to achieve higher crop water productivity chance et al 2017 however the accurate extent and distribution of many irrigated areas remains often unknown despite the significant impact of irrigation on food security and water resources bazzi et al 2019b cai et al 2017 in fact even though huge efforts have been made in the last years in this regard there is a general lack of accurate and current maps about irrigated areas avoiding the full implementation and compliance of the water framework directive wfd bolognesi et al 2020 magidi et al 2021 in italy the national institute of agricultural economics inea has contributed to design the irrigation water policy by supporting the italian ministry of agricultural food and forestry policies mipaaf since the 1960 s inea has conducted the census of irrigated areas producing the map of irrigation in italy currently the most complete and updated database that supports governmental institutions is the national information system for water management in agriculture sigrian https sigrian crea gov it which collect the information coming from water management authorities i e reclamation consortia and other irrigation agencies nevertheless the level of detail of the sigrian database is often not enough accurate for a proper evaluation of irrigation water uses in austria farm structure surveys are conducted as i full survey census on the basis of eu legislation every 10 years and ii sample survey at regular intervals 3 4 years by austria s federal statistical office statistics austria farm structure surveys conducted by questionnaires also comprise features with respect to irrigation particularly the total irrigable area of an agricultural operation or the actual irrigated area of areas with field vegetables however overall the data situation with respect to actual irrigated areas requires improvement especially with respect to the time gaps within the surveys that might miss particularly dry years with high irrigation needs since the 1980 s remote sensing rs has been used to map land cover and agricultural areas at different spatial and temporal scales pareeth et al 2019 one of the main methods implemented to derive this information is based on the use of satellite based optical data single date imagery acquired during the peak of the crop growing season can be used for classifying the irrigated areas although the use of multi temporal imagery approach is preferred as it covers the different phenology stages of the crops ghassemi et al 2022 vuolo et al 2018 a common approach is based on the analysis of the ndvi time series due to its ability to show a considerable difference between irrigated and non irrigated pixels ozdogan et al 2006 2010 the use of ndvi as an indicator of vegetation phenology provides a simple proxy for classifying complex landscapes chance et al 2017 in particular ndvi is considered a sufficiently good indicator of irrigation presence ozdogan et al 2006 thanks to its capability to measure green biomass and the existing strong correlation between green biomass and the available moisture for vegetation pervez and brown 2010 for instance bolognesi et al 2020 applied this approach for mapping the actual extent of irrigated areas in italy in semi arid conditions in their study rainfed areas and irrigated areas were classified on the basis of the analysis of ndvi time series and accumulated rainfall data however this approach highlights some limitations especially in areas where the same crop type is grown with and without irrigation during the same growing season in these areas in fact as suggested by ozdogan et al 2010 the temporal ndvi profiles of both irrigated and non irrigated crops may show an identical pattern emphasizing the need for a more sensitive index to make this distinction additionally optical rs applications depend on atmospheric conditions for areas with frequent cloud cover these methods may not be adaptable gao et al 2018 the use of microwave rs offers a good alternative to optical rs for mapping irrigated areas also under cloudy conditions due to the ability of microwaves to penetrate through vegetation canopy and underlying soil especially at lower frequencies where measurements are not impeded by clouds or darkness sadeghi et al 2015 2017 specifically microwave domain measurements can be used to estimate soil moisture dynamics because the pronounced contrast between the dielectric constant values of the wet and dry soils baghdadi and zribi 2016 lakhankar et al 2009 kumar et al 2015 investigated the capability of several microwave remotely sensed soil moisture products including ascat advanced scatterometer amsr e advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system esa cci sm european space agency climate change initiative soil moisture smos soil moisture and ocean salinity while lawston et al 2017 showed the capability of the enhanced version of smap soil moisture active passive to detect the irrigation signal although these products have shown greater potential for monitoring soil moisture dynamics they consider both rainfall and irrigation effects on soil moisture karthikeyan et al 2020 and may require calibrations to account for surface roughness which causes perturbation of the microwave signal shi et al 2006 additionally the application of microwave based retrieval of soil moisture is not well suited for small scale applications because the very coarse resolution especially when compared with the higher spatial resolution outputs of optical methods sadeghi et al 2017 yue et al 2019 more recently several authors bazzi et al 2019a b gao et al 2018 exploited instead sentinel 1 sar synthetic aperture radar time series to map irrigated fields specifically based on the multi temporal analysis of backscatter time series using vertical vertical vv and vertical horizontal vh polarizations their studies showed that vv resulted more sensitive for characterizing the soil moisture conditions while vh was more sensitive for monitoring the vegetation status however more studies exploiting this approach are required dari et al 2021 commonly both optical and microwave rs data are used as inputs for mapping the irrigated areas and for distinguishing the different classes by applying supervised classification approaches because these approaches require ground reference data to build rule based classifiers their transferability in time and space is not always guaranteed especially under different climate conditions ragettli et al 2018 pageot et al 2020 recently sadeghi et al 2017 proposed the physically based optram specifically this methodology is based on the pixel distribution within the ndvi and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance str space for estimating the soil moisture by using only optical data in the last years optram has been successfully applied for mapping the soil moisture at high resolution in rainfed and irrigated fields ambrosone et al 2020 babaeian et al 2019 the promising results obtained in these studies highlight the possibility of using optram also for discriminating between irrigated and non irrigated areas in fact besides the visible vis and near infrared nir bands of ndvi it introduces additional information on the short wave infrared swir with the str index which provides high sensitivity to soil moisture variation sadeghi et al 2015 in this context the aims of this study were to develop a stand alone optical rs method able to detect the irrigated areas based on the combined use of the unsupervised classification and optram to validate and test the proposed method at different spatial level i e field and district level respectively under different climate conditions hence the study would provide an easy to use method not dependent on ground reference data and replicable under different contexts aiming at supporting the stakeholders for monitoring and reporting the irrigated areas this will allow the promotion of efficient water saving strategies and the accomplishment of the requirements of water related policies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at 2 different test sites fig 1 the irrigation district quota 102 50 in italy 2019 2020 and the marchfeld cropland region in austria 2021 the irrigation district quota 102 50 managed by the reclamation consortium sicilia orientale is located in eastern sicily lat 37 44 n 37 54 n long 14 85 e 15 05 e wgs84 fig 1a the district is characterized by a total area of 5050 ha and an irrigated area of about 2300 ha that is mainly cultivated with citrus olive and fruit groves the irrigation season is generally from mid may to mid october depending on the weather conditions the climate is hot summer mediterranean csa under the köppen geiger classification according to beck et al 2018 during the study period the average annual precipitation values were of 597 and 656 mm for 2019 and 2020 respectively with values of 201 and 202 mm recorded during the 2019 20 irrigation seasons the cropland area of marchfeld is located in lower austria lat 48 10 n 48 50 n long 16 40 e 17 00 e wgs84 fig 1b it covers an agricultural surface of about 60 000 ha with an irrigated surface of about 21 000 ha the main cultivated crops are vegetables sugar beet potatoes and winter cereals immitzer et al 2016 the irrigation season is from mid april to mid july deissenberger 2021 conventionally the area is characterised by a warm summer humid continental climate dfb beck et al 2018 however it is the driest region of austria with an average annual precipitation of 500 mm for the study period 2021 with 109 mm during the irrigation season 2 2 detection of the irrigated areas fig 2 shows a flow chart of the proposed methodological approach specifically the detection of the irrigated areas was performed by combining a preliminary unsupervised classification on a seasonal ndvi time series for identifying the potentially irrigated clusters and the subsequent application of the optram model on these clusters for more specifically distinguishing the irrigated pixels from the non irrigated pixels during the dry period of the irrigation season the entire process required two types of data sources at the initial stage i e sentinel 2 satellite images and rainfall values and then the soil parameters i e wilting point wp and field capacity fc for applying optram approach only clear sky satellite images covering the test areas within the reference study periods were used for the austrian test site a pre processing of the images for removing cloudy pixels was necessary due the unavailability of images with perfect clear sky conditions a preliminary analysis of rainfall values was conducted in order to identify the dry periods during the irrigation seasons specifically these dry periods were characterised by a cumulated rainfall value during the 10 previous days of 0 mm at the irrigation district quota 102 50 and lower than 4 mm at marchfeld cropland a sub dataset of satellite images was created within the dry periods for dates with a daily rainfall value of 0 mm tab s1 finally ndvi and str values were calculated for each pixel of the potentially irrigated clusters representing the input for the optram approach application 2 2 1 dataset input in this study the multispectral images from sentinel 2 european space agency s esa satellite https sentinel esa int web sentinel missions sentinel 2 were used the satellite is equipped with an opto electronic multispectral sensor msi for imaging the earth surface with a spatial resolution of 10 60 m in the vis nir and swir spectral zones the temporal resolution of each single sentinel 2 satellite sentinel 2 a and b is 10 days leading to a revisit time of 5 days with two satellites in operation a total of 158 sentinel 2 images were collected at the study areas 65 and 62 images for the irrigation district quota 102 50 during the years 2019 2020 respectively t33svb tile fig 1 and 31 images for marchfeld cropland region during the year 2021 t33uxp tile fig 1 for each dataset a time series ndvi stack layer was created using all the available images rainfall data were collected from the closest ground based automatic meteorological stations to the two test sites i e 4 weather stations distant between 10 and 31 km from the irrigation district quota 102 50 figs s1a and 4 weather stations distant between 18 and 36 km from the marchfeld cropland region fig s1b managed respectively by the sicilian agro meteorological information service sias www sias regione sicilia it and the central institute for meteorology and geodynamics zamg www zamg ac at in fig 3 the observed daily rainfall values and the identified dry periods during the irrigation season were reported in the supplementary material section table s1 reports the sentinel 2 images used in the study for the two test sites for each image the type of sentinel satellite a or b the daily rainfall value mm and the cumulated rainfall value mm in the previous 10 days are reported the dry dates selected during the irrigation season for applying optram are also indicated 2 2 2 unsupervised classification as reported in fig 2 the application of the unsupervised classification on the ndvi time series represented the first main step of the proposed methodological approach with the aim to grouping similar ndvi patterns in unlabelled clusters as reported by bolognesi et al 2020 and chance et al 2017 the presence of green and healthy vegetation during the dry season when no precipitation events are observed can be attributed to irrigation water applications in this context the following first hypothesis can be applied during the irrigation season low and decreasing temporal ndvi profiles could refer to non irrigated areas whereas high and increasing temporal ndvi profiles could refer to irrigated areas according to this hypothesis clusters can be labelled as non irrigated or potentially irrigated depending on the ndvi trends observed during the irrigation season a value of 0 3 was set as ndvi threshold for distinguishing the high and low ndvi temporal profiles in fact according to campoy et al 2020 gonzález gómez et al 2018 and lobell et al 2013 this value represents the green up of vegetation the algorithm used in this study was the isodata ball and hall 1965 requiring only the raster and the number of clusters as input the number of clusters was decided to minimize the standard deviation in terms of ndvi of each one in order to have clusters as clear as possible specifically a number of 20 clusters was used from which temporal average patterns of ndvi were extracted during the irrigation seasons at the two test sites clusters were labelled as i non irrigated when ndvi trends were lower than 0 3 or decreasing and ii potentially irrigated when ndvi trends were higher than 0 3 or increasing pixels representing non agricultural lands such as water negative ndvi values and built up ndvi values ranging from 0 0 to 0 1 were removed by using the ndvi temporal profile analysis 2 2 3 optical trapezoid model in a second step the clusters labelled as potentially irrigated were further analysed to better discriminate between irrigated and non irrigated pixels through the use of the optram with additional information based on the vis nir and swir bands optram is based on the pixel distribution within the ndvi str space assuming a linear relationship between soil and vegetation water content the str ndvi feature space forms a trapezoid shape sadeghi et al 2017 the upper and the lower sides of the str ndvi feature space indicating the wet and the dry edges respectively were used to solve the water content w for each pixel as a function of ndvi and str 1 w i d s d ndvi str i d i w s d s w ndvi where id sd and iw sw parameters are respectively the intercept and the slope of the dry and wet edges of the str ndvi feature space by using cluster specific linear parametrizations of optram and introducing a threshold value based on the soil water content swc status well watered vegetation and stressed vegetation can be discriminated on the str ndvi feature space during the irrigation season under dry conditions e g 10 days with no precipitation events recorded in fact thresholds of swc indicate the water availability for crop consumption and their identification ensure the maintenance of soil moisture conditions that avoid physiological stress datta et al 2017 thompson et al 2007 according to several authors jabro et al 2020 lozoya et al 2014 wp is that threshold at which plants cannot longer adsorb water from the soil and start to wilt specifically at wp threshold transpiration and all the other processes vital to plant survival come to stop causing a significant reduction in crop growth if swc remains below the wp for an extended period crops will eventually die datta et al 2017 thus the second hypothesis of the proposed approach was the following during the irrigation season in absence of precipitation events for an extended period if w is greater than wp there is available water in the soil due to the irrigation practice and vegetation may be well watered whereas if w is lower than wp there is no available water and vegetation may be under stress conditions on the basis of this second hypothesis pixels were classified as irrigated or non irrigated when w calculated as a function of ndvi str by applying optram exceeded or not the wp respectively fig 4 in this study optram was applied for each date of the dry period during the irrigation season in order to determine w for the pixels of each cluster considering only potentially irrigated clusters the w values were converted into swc values through a linear regression analysis performed using the wp and the fc data retrieved by the european soil database https esdac jrc ec europa eu resource type european soil database soil properties the wp threshold values were of 23 27 and 11 85 for the marchfeld cropland region and the irrigation district quota 102 50 respectively for each test site and irrigation season the differences between swc and wp values were calculated for the pixels of the selected sentinel 2 satellite images i e 4 images for the marchfeld cropland region during 2021 and 7 images for the irrigation district quota 102 50 during both 2019 2020 the final label was assigned by considering an average value of the difference swc wp on the several dates as follows i irrigated when the average of the differences swc wp 0 ii non irrigated when the average of the differences swc wp 0 at the marchfeld cropland region in order to validate the proposed methodological approach at field level a crop mask https geometadatensuche inspire gv at was used for separating the single fields each field was finally labelled by considering the most frequent pixel values irrigated or non irrigated on the other hand at the irrigation district quota 102 50 no crop mask was employed and each pixel was finally labelled as irrigated or non irrigated however a sub districts mask provided by the reclamation consortium was used fig s4 and only pixels within this mask were considered in order to validate at district level 2 3 statistical assessment the validation of the results obtained in the study was performed at two different levels i accuracy assessment of the detection of the irrigated areas at field level for the marchfeld cropland region ii evaluation of the estimated irrigated areas surface at district level for the irrigation district quota 102 50 specifically the accuracy assessment at the marchfeld cropland region was performed using a binary confusion matrix between the estimated irrigated non irrigated areas with the methodological approach and the reference data collected during a campaign in the framework of another study bml 2022 a total of 2560 reference fields were used of which 160 irrigated and 2400 non irrigated the campaign aimed at putting together a comprehensive database of georeferenced observation of the irrigation status of several fields in order to take account growing seasons and harvest dates of different crop types the campaign was running during three months in summer 2021 for each observation the following information was documented i observation data and time ii crop type iii type of irrigation system iv irrigation ongoing or turned off a quality check was also performed on the reference database e g with respect to the correct georeferencing of the collected points this was done using field photos taken alongside the data collection all points with unclear georeference were excluded from further analyses while the irrigated fields were observed during the measurements campaign and thus considered very reliable an uncertainty degree should be contemplated for the non irrigated fields since they were derived from a database where farms register their fields and attributes in order to quantitatively evaluate the goodness of the results several metrics including accuracy acc eq 2 precision ppv eq 3 recall tpr eq 4 and f1 score f1 eq 5 were calculated by the confusion matrix as follow 2 acc tp tn tp tn fp fn 3 ppv tp tp fp 4 tpr tp tp fn 5 f 1 2 tp 2 tp fp fn where tp tn fp and fn indicate respectively the true positive true negative false positive and false negative however when the dataset is unbalanced the previous metrics can be misleading in order to overcome this issue relative values were calculated normalizing by the number of elements in each class e g tp and fn were divided by the sum of the reference irrigated areas tp fn whereas fp and tn were divided by the sum of the reference non irrigated areas fp tn in fact the normalization taking into account the unbalanced availability of the classes of the binary confusion matrix allows a better interpretation of the results since the final results could be sensitive to the value of wp a sensitivity analysis was also performed varying the wp threshold in the range of 10 15 20 25 30 35 and the same metrics were determined on the other hand for the irrigation district quota 102 50 the total surface of the irrigated areas ha obtained by applying the proposed approach was compared to the data declared by the consortium 3 results 3 1 marchfeld cropland fig 5 shows the temporal ndvi profiles of the 20 clusters obtained by applying the isodata classification on the study area for the year 2021 cluster 1 was forthwith excluded because it represents water bodies negative ndvi values during the irrigation season ndvi trends were decreasing or constant and lower than 0 3 for the clusters 2 3 5 6 7 10 11 17 and 18 considering the first hypothesis they were labelled as non irrigated on the other hand ndvi trends were constant and higher than 0 3 or increasing for the clusters 4 8 9 12 13 14 15 16 19 and 20 and they were labelled as potentially irrigated in order to facilitate the interpretation of fig 5 the labels assigned for each cluster are reported in table 1 fig s2 shows instead the preliminary map of the potentially irrigated areas at the marchfeld cropland region a cluster specific linear parametrization of optram on potentially irrigated clusters was performed in order to derive the wet and dry edges specifically pixels of potentially irrigated clusters were distributed within the str ndvi feature space of optram fig 6 where the wet and dry edges were determined by a visual inspection as suggested by sadeghi et al 2017 in fact the authors showed as this approach is better than least square regression since oversatured or shadowed pixels scattered around the main point cloud of each trapezoid can be omitted the obtained optram parameters i e id sd iw sw are reported in tab s2 by using optram parameters of tab s2 w values were calculated for each pixel of the selected clusters and then converted into swc values by calculating the difference between the average swc value and the wp and applying the second hypothesis agricultural lands were labelled as irrigated or non irrigated the final map of the irrigated areas obtained for the test site is reported in fig 7 as shown in this figure there is a prevalence of non irrigated areas at marchfeld region during the irrigation season of 2021 in fact the surfaces of the non irrigated areas and the irrigated areas were of 64 and 36 respectively of the total surface of the agricultural lands fig 8 shows the binary confusion matrix between the estimated and the reference irrigated non irrigated areas an overall acc of 71 was obtained with ppv tpr f1 values of 72 68 and 70 respectively fig 9 finally fig 9 shows the sensitivity of metrics by varying the original wp threshold 23 in the range of 10 15 20 25 30 35 acc tpr and f1 values decreased from 74 to 58 from 80 to 26 and from 76 to 39 respectively in the wp range of 10 15 20 25 30 35 ppv values instead increased from 71 to 75 respectively in the range of 10 15 20 25 30 35 3 2 irrigation district quota 102 50 figs 10 and 11 show the temporal ndvi profiles of the 20 clusters obtained by applying the isodata classification to the study area for the year 2019 and 2020 respectively cluster 1 was excluded for both the years because it represents built up ndvi values ranging from 0 0 to 0 1 decreasing or constant and lower than 0 3 ndvi trends were observed for clusters 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 11 and 12 during the irrigation season 2019 and for clusters 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 11 and 13 during the irrigation season 2020 labelling them as non irrigated otherwise constant and higher than 0 3 or increasing ndvi trends were observed for clusters 10 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 during the irrigation season 2019 and for clusters 8 9 12 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 during the irrigation season 2020 these clusters were labelled as potentially irrigated table 2 reports the labels assigned for each cluster fig s3 shows instead the preliminary maps of the potentially irrigated areas at the irrigation district quota 102 50 pixels of potentially irrigated clusters were distributed within the str ndvi feature space of optram figs 12 and 13 and the wet and dry edges were determined by a visual inspection obtaining the parameters id sd iw sw reported in tab s3 note that the w values were calculated and then converted into swc values for the pixels of the selected clusters for all the selected dates of the dry period during the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 using the parameters reported in tab s3 the final maps of the irrigated areas obtained by applying the second hypothesis and labelling the agricultural lands as irrigated or non irrigated are showed in fig 14 for the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 the surfaces of the irrigated areas were of 61 and 60 on the total surface for the years 2019 and 2020 respectively additionally fig s1 shows for each sub district of the quota 102 50 the irrigated surface variation between 2019 and 2020 this variation was calculated as ratio between the difference of irrigated surface on the two irrigation seasons and the total surface of the sub district table 3 shows the comparison between the estimated irrigated areas and the declared irrigated areas by the reclamation consortium an overestimation was observed for both the years showing that the irrigated areas estimated with the proposed approach were grater of 20 98 and 21 16 compared to the declared irrigated areas for the seasons 2019 and 2020 respectively 4 discussion in the current water scarcity scenario the need of up to date and accurate maps of the irrigated areas is essential for supporting stakeholders to formulate suitable water management strategies in the last years many studies have demonstrated the potential of vegetation indices derived from optical rs to detect irrigated areas bolognesi et al 2020 htitiou et al 2019 magidi et al 2021 zurqani et al 2021 htitiou et al 2019 applied an approach based on phenological metrics derived separately from landsat 8 and sentinel 2 ndvi time series using with random forest rf classification for identifying and mapping irrigated crops in semi arid conditions the best performances were obtained for sentinel 2 data with an overall accuracy of 93 in the same climate conditions bolognesi et al 2020 proposed a machine learning classification based approach based on ndvi time series derived from harmonized landsat 8 and sentinel 2 images by comparing six different types of classifiers the authors obtained the best performance with rf reaching an overall accuracy of about 90 in detecting irrigated areas recently magidi et al 2021 proposed an approach for classifying irrigated areas under temperate and subtropical climate conditions they applied rf in conjunction with google earth engine gee platform using landsat 8 and sentinel 2 ndvi time series and other static input data obtaining an overall accuracy of 88 similarly zurqani et al 2021 developed a framework for mapping and quantifying irrigated areas in humid and subtropical climate conditions based on the use of several sentinel 2 spectral indices and other rs datasets on gee platform specifically they produced irrigated and non irrigated land cover maps by applying rf supervised classification for three years with an overall accuracy of 83 73 86 18 and 84 55 for the years 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively despite the high accuracies obtained the approaches proposed by these studies require training process and rules on decision tree structures additionally they did not analyse the case when the same crop type is grown with and without irrigation in the same growing season which could mean similar temporal ndvi profiles as suggested by ozdogan et al 2010 for instance ozdogan and gutman 2008 mapping irrigated areas in central nebraska showed temporal ndvi profiles of irrigated and non irrigated corn fields with a very similar pattern therefore the authors suggested the use of a more sensitive index to make this distinction in this study a new stand alone optical rs approach to map irrigated areas was proposed compared to previous studies it does not require any training and is easily replicable in different contexts using only satellite images rainfall data and wp and fc data moreover when no ground measurements are available for deriving rainfall values alternative data sources such as the climate reanalysis could be used for example as suggested by longo minnolo et al 2022 era5 land reanalysis offers valid rainfall estimates with high probability of detection of the precipitation events in order to map the irrigated areas without using reference data a preliminary clustering classification was used thus crop type is not directly considered the unsupervised classification has been widely adopted for irrigated area mapping although never in fully automated schemes for instance ragettli et al 2018 proposed a method implemented on gee based on unsupervised classification and multi temporal satellite image analysis which made it possible to obtain irrigation maps at 30 m of resolution with an accuracy of 77 96 from 2000 to 2017 specifically they applied the unsupervised classification for creating samples to use as input for rf in the study herein proposed for recognizing the non irrigated and the potentially irrigated areas we used the unsupervised classification and the analysis of the temporal ndvi profiles and the rainfall events thus for each cluster of the unsupervised classification labelled as potentially irrigated which basically represents one or more crop types with the same phenology and green biomass conditions optram was applied for deriving the moisture variation and detecting the actual irrigated areas the resulting map for the austrian site during the irrigation season 2021 was reasonable accurate with an overall accuracy of 70 and a precision for detecting the actual irrigated areas of 71 showing quite lower performances compared to the previous studies that use supervised classification algorithms it should be noticed that the effects of imbalance on performance metrics was faced by normalizing the classes of the confusion matrix luque et al 2019 a similar accuracy about 78 was obtained by dari et al 2021 by applying an approach based only on the use of k means algorithm rs soil moisture products and a land surface model but obtaining maps with lower resolution the maps for the italian site instead showed an overestimation of irrigated areas of about 21 during both the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 with respect to the data declared by the reclamation consortium the overestimation may be in part due to the presence of non declared irrigated areas since several farmers could use own water sources in sicily in fact autonomous irrigation managed by private consortia or owner of single farms is quite widespread and prevails in many areas compared with collective irrigation with abstraction of water from small reservoirs and or wells zucaro et al 2014 some uncertainties in the methodology should be also considered a first source of errors could come from inaccuracies of the unsupervised classification which does not allow a clear crop type distinction affecting optram parameters id sd iw sw in this sense the use of a detailed crop type map derived by supervised approaches could guarantee higher accuracy since optram method would be specifically applied for each crop allowing a better discrimination between irrigated and non irrigated classes this approach was however not tested in this study despite this the use of a ground truth dataset should be taken into account secondly the visual inspection for determining the wet and dry edges of optram suggested by sadeghi et al 2017 could introduce user related bias leading to some degree of uncertainty of model outputs however as demonstrated by babaeian et al 2018 performing a sensitivity analysis by varying the visually fitted parameters the visual inspection results in acceptable soil moisture estimates despite the its perceived user bias in fact optram outputs are not highly sensitive to the dry and wet edge model parameters additionally the reliability of wp and fc of the european soil database used for calibrating w calculated by optram is undefined in fact due the coarse resolution 1 km these products could be not representative of the study areas affecting the swc values as a consequence the use of a not accurate wp as threshold value in the second hypothesis we presented could lead to a not proper estimation of irrigated area affecting the final irrigation maps as showed by the sensibility analysis lastly since soil moisture is highly influenced by rainfall acharya et al 2022 the accuracy and resolution of the rainfall dataset used in the selection of the dry periods could affect swc values calculated by optram these limitations clearly need further investigations in order to enhance the methodological approach proposed additionally since the mapping of irrigated areas at large spatial scales is still a great challenge the enhanced method could be tested at bigger scale recently zhang et al 2022 proposed an approach based on the integrate use of remote sensing irrigation suitability and irrigated area statistics for developing an irrigated cropland map in mainland china despite the good results the authors highlight the heavy dependence of their method on irrigated area statistics and the subjectivity of irrigation suitability analysis as well as the lack of sufficient ground truth data thus the stand alone rs approach presented in this study could provide a valuable contribute to the scientific community regarding irrigation mapping even in the large spatial domain 5 conclusion this paper introduces a new approach for mapping irrigated areas at high resolution under different climate conditions based on the use of the unsupervised classification on ndvi time series and optram the main advantage of this methodology is the requirement of only few input data i e cloud free optical satellite images rainfall values and soil water parameters without needing any reference crop type data and thus allowing its transferability in time and space the approach was applied and tested in marchfeld cropland region in austria under a dfb climate obtaining a map of the irrigated areas for the irrigation season 2021 with an overall accuracy of 70 and a capability in detecting the actual irrigated areas of 71 the proposed approach was also applied in the irrigation district quota 102 50 in italy under csa climate where the results were compared with the irrigation data of the reclamation consortium finding an overestimation by rs of irrigated areas of 21 during the irrigation seasons 2019 2020 despite the lower accuracy compared to studies that use supervised classification approaches these results demonstrate the potential of using optram for irrigation purposes future research could enhance the methodology by studying in detail how crop types affect optram performances and how to solve the main uncertainties related to the soil water parameters additionally all the enhanced framework could be implemented on gee platform or similar cloud computing for larger scale applications in conclusion this approach could allow the promotion of data driven decision for water use and allocation leading to efficient water saving strategies and improving the sustainability of the irrigated agriculture it could be used as an operational monitoring system by water management authorities for regular reporting of irrigated areas

9268,the pressures of frequent extreme weather water shortages and increasing food demand pose a continued challenge of maintaining the sustainable development of irrigated agricultural systems although rational arable land management is fundamental to alleviating these pressures the relationship between cropping patterns and irrigation sustainability is understudied using the hexi corridor as an example a maximum entropy machine learning model was used to determine the optimal cropping pattern based on crop suitability and to explore the impact mechanism of the optimal cropping pattern on the irrigation sustainability index si from the perspective of reliability resilience and vulnerability an optimal cropping pattern was conducive to sustainable irrigation and reduced irrigation water use by 21 03 from 1960 s to 2010 s with no continued agricultural expansion thus the challenges of food security and sustainability for similar regions and globally can be met but will require

competition among different water users agriculture industry and households continues to increase china s growing freshwater demand must be reconciled with already overused renewable water resources huang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 further if irrigation occurs in arid areas where water resources are extremely scarce this will exacerbate water shortages making it more difficult to coordinate

irrigation the hexi corridor in northwestern china is an area experiencing growing conflict between irrigation water use and irrigation sustainability fu et al 2019 in this study the si was used to assess the potential of cropping patterns before and after optimization to improve irrigation sustainability in this region over the past 60 years and the next 20 years the optimal cropping pattern was simulated using the maxent model based on crop suitability of the current cropping pattern determined by field investigations the aims of this study are to 1 find the optimal cropping pattern of crops that matches natural resources 2 determine whether the optimal cropping pattern in goal 1 can improve regional irrigation sustainability and 3 based on goal 2 explore the development potential of future regional sustainable irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 research framework to explore the sustainability of irrigation at the spatial and temporal scales we developed a research framework as shown fig 1 firstly we obtained multi year crop planting locations for six crops maize wheat potatoes rape cotton and alfalfa according to field samples secondly we removed environmental factors that duplicated crop distribution influences through the correlation analysis of climatic topographic and soil factors for each crop the maxent model was then used to predict the suitability distribution for each crop next the optimal cropping pattern was determined by screening for crops with the greatest suitability for each grid the distribution of irrigation water was calculated using the water balance and penman monteith equations allen et al 1998 finally the si index was used to assess irrigation water use over the past 60 years and the ca markov model was used to obtain the spatio temporal variation of the irrigation water si over the next 20 years 2 2 study area the hexi corridor situated in the northwestern gansu province china 92 12 104 20 e 37 17 42 48 n is long approximately 1000 km and narrow fig 2 yang et al 2011 the region is typically arid with an average annual precipitation of 50 150 mm and an average annual evaporation of 1500 2500 mm li et al 2016 irrigation water accounts for more than 90 of the total water consumption but the gdp contribution of agriculture is less than 30 improving water efficiency is an important initiative for the sustainable socioeconomic development of the region huang et al 2022 due to these factors balancing water scarcity and securing agricultural production is of regional concern the oasis in the hexi corridor is flat and suitable for farming long term irrigation and water saving measures have indirectly exacerbated the warm and humid trend in the region and the soil pore structure and physicochemical properties have been enhanced by years of irrigation zhang et al 2017a 2017b fu et al 2022 however the region has become the most important grain producing area in northwest china and the core of the development of the silk road economic belt relying on abundant solar and thermal resources and the only oasis supplied by three inland rivers basins the shiyang heihe and shule rivers

planting species the small planting area of a single type and the high spatial discretization we obtained farmland planting information samples over the past decade through field surveys with handheld gps locators and farmers questionnaires to prevent crop point locations from overfitting the simulation results in the maxent model we conducted a spatially explicit correlation and ecological niche overlap analysis by screening crop point locations with a 2 5 grid size using enmtools holt et al 2018 johnson et al 2017 finally we obtained a total of 5137 effective crop distribution samples of which samples number for spring maize spring wheat potato spring rape cotton and alfalfa accounted for 1561 481 667 562 824 and 1042 of the samples respectively fig s1 in supplementary material 2 4 2 environmental variables meteorological topographical and soil factors that affect crop planting and growth are collectively referred to as natural environmental variables yang et al 2022 although crops differ in biophysical properties across regions the main constraints precipitation temperature soil characteristics etc affecting crop distribution are broadly the same kogo et al 2019 peterson and westfall 2004 therefore we selected precipitation pre cumulative temperature tem relative humidity rhu sunshine hours ssd and wind speed win as the meteorological indicators and used the average meteorological data every 10 years as a chronological change elevation and slope assumed to remain static during the study period were used to reflect the topographic characteristics of the cultivated land to reflect soil characteristics we chose soil texture tex bulk density bd soil organic matter som ph total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp total potassium tk and soil water content swc except for soil water content we defaulted to other soil indicators that remained unchanged during the study period to avoid collinearity among the selected indicators pearson et al 2010 we used the pearson correlation coefficient method to eliminate the rhu with a correlation exceeding 0 9 calculated in spps 24 0 results shown in fig s2 and retained the remaining 14 indicators involved in the prediction of the optimal cropping pattern 2 4 3 optimal cropping pattern simulation the maxent model is a complex machine learning method based on maximum entropy theory which can be run with data on species distribution points and environmental variables phillips et al 2006 based on a machine learning approach the model establishes relationships between sample points and environmental variables jaynes 1957 elith et al 2011 which can better describe the nonlinear relationships between inputs and predictions heumann et al 2011 the model builds an accurate probabilistic model of crop distribution by learning the relationship between the sample and environmental variables and determining the optimal distribution with maximum entropy in the approximate satisfaction condition jiménez valverde et al 2011 suitable distribution areas predicted by the model based on available crop point data represent areas with similar environmental conditions peterson et al 2007 considering that the arable land in the study area was less developed 30 years ago the current arable range 2020 was used to better reflect the influence of environmental variables on the distribution of crop suitability taking the crop distribution points as sample points and the selected environmental variables as constraints of the model we explored the possible distributions of maximum entropy under these constraints the optimal distribution of maximum entropy was used as the crop suitability distribution in this study the general interpretation of the maximum entropy algorithm is as follows when the output of x is y for a given training data set and feature function f i x y i 1 2 n the calculation process is as follows 1 max p c h p x y p x p y x log p y x 2 s t e p f i e p f i i 1 2 n 3 y p y x 1 where h p is the conditional entropy p y x is the distribution assumption of the conditional probability p x is the empirical distribution and e p f i is the expectation value of the characteristic function on the empirical distribution to obtain the suitability distribution for each crop at 1 km resolution a random sample of 75 of the crop distribution points was used as data for the model training set and the remaining 25 was used as the test set guisan and thuiller 2005 the test set was extracted using cross validation to enhance the confidence of the simulation results phillips and dudík 2008 five replicates were conducted for each crop of which the final results were the average the contribution and ranked importance of each environmental variable were then quantified using the jackknife method and corresponding curves for all environmental variables were created the other parameters of the model were set to their default values a receiver operating characteristic roc curve was used to assess the accuracy of the obtained crop suitability areas in the maxent model this was generated by plotting the false positive rate of a model prediction 1 specificity given here as fractional predicted area against the true positive rate model sensitivity given as 1 rate of false negatives the performance of the model was measured by the area under the roc curve auc peterson et al 2008 which ranged from 0 to 1 the higher the auc value the more accurate the model predictions the specific assessment criteria were fail 0 5 0 6 poor 0 6 0 7 fair 0 7 0 8 good 0 8 0 9 and excellent 0 9 1 0 swets 1988 the suitability of the six crops during the six decades from 1961 to 2020 was obtained using the maxent model the distribution probabilities of these crops in the same grid were compared the crop with the highest crop suitability was selected as the most suitable crop in the grid to form the spatial distribution of the optimal cropping pattern over the years 2 5 computation of the si in this study the water supply transmission and distribution losses in the form of surface evaporation and canal seepage were not considered instead water transported to the farm and consumed in the form of evapotranspiration from the field crops was calculated directly the regional irrigation water demand of crops is calculated using the water balance equation formula 6 the penman monteith

liu et al 2022a the si is a composite index that measures the sustainability of water resource systems sandoval solis et al 2011 and is used in this study to assess the sustainability of irrigation water with three indices reliability resilience and vulnerability before calculating we defined the state of each grid in the optimal cropping pattern from the deficit d t i loucks 1997 and the irrigation water state of the crop for the i th grid at time period t can be described as 7 d t i x target t i x suppled t i if x target t i x suppled t i 0 if x target t i x suppled t i where x target t i is the irrigation water amount required by the crop x suppled t i is the irrigation water requirement of the crops under different optimal cropping patterns at other time periods these two values can be calculated in formula 6 based on the interannual cropping pattern reliability is the probability that a system is satisfactory hashimoto et al 1982 here the probability is that the irrigation water for the crops in the grid will be satisfied within 60 years reliability values ranged from 0 to 1 when the reliability is lower the frequency of irrigation water deficit is higher if the reliability value is 0 the area is in a continuous water deficit the higher the reliability the lower the frequency of water deficit and when the reliability is equal to 1 the area is temporarily free from water deficit for a given time step every 10 years the reliability of the i th location based on the frequency of no irrigation water deficit is calculated as 8 rel i lim n 1 n t 1 n z t i where z t i indicates the number of times d t i 0 occurs if d t i 0 z t i 1 if d t i 0 z t i 0 d t i 0 indicates a satisfactory state and d t i 0 indicates a failed state resilience is the rate at which a system can recover from failure and is a measure of the system s ability to adapt to changing conditions lane et al 2015 resilience values ranged from 0 to 1 the lower the value the lower the ability of the area to recover and the longer the water shortage experience when the resilience value is high the area is better able to recover from water shortages and less likely to experience persistent water shortages if the reliability is 0 the resilience is also 0 indicating that the area is in persistent water shortage if the reliability is 1 the resilience is also 1 and the area has no persistent water shortage or no water shortage similarly based on the persistence of no shortage of irrigation water the resilience of the i th location is 9 res i lim n t 1 n w t i n lim n t 1 n z t i where w t i indicates the transition from satisfactory state to failure state if d t i 0 and d t 1 i 0 w t i 1 otherwise w t i 0 vulnerability describes the severity of damage to the system that is the average severity of damage caused by irrigation water deficits kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 vulnerability values ranged from 0 to 1 when the vulnerability value is low there is a slight shortage of irrigation water in the area and a vulnerability value of 0 indicates that there is no shortage a higher value indicates a more severe water deficit and a vulnerability of 1 indicates that the area can hardly be met based on the shortage of water and the total unmet water demand the vulnerability of the i th location is 10 vul i lim n t 1 n d t i n lim n t 1 n z t i x target i the geometric mean method was used to calculate the si sandoval solis et al 2011 which ranged from 0 to 1 higher values indicate higher sustainability of irrigation water indicating the area has the potential for sustainable irrigation lower values indicate lower sustainability indicating the area has less potential when the si is 0 reliability or resilience is 0 and vulnerability is 1 indicating that the area has a continuous shortage of irrigation water resulting in limited crop production when the si is 1 reliability and resilience are 1 and vulnerability is 0 indicating that the area has sufficient irrigation water to meet crop production for a given number of time steps the si at position i is 11 si i rel i res i 1 vul i 1 3 2 6 ca markov model the ca markov model has a high accuracy prediction ability mondal et al 2016 and has been widely used in simulation studies of various spatial evolution types such as land use change drought prediction and urban water demand analysis feizizadeh et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b mokarram and pham 2022 in this study the integrated dynamic ca markov module was applied in idrisi 17 0 to predict spatio temporal changes in the irrigation water si the model is based on two processes the markov and ca models the markov process is used to determine the probability of each grid transition when the state at moment t 1 depends only on its state at moment t which can be expressed by formula 12 and 13 respectively ca is a discrete spatio temporal dynamics simulation model that simulates the evolution of complex systems through local transition rules between cells wolfram 1983 the state of a cell at moment t 1 depends on its state at moment t and the states of the neighboring cells and its general expression can be expressed by formula 14 12 m t 1 p m t 13 p p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p m 1 p m 2 p mn 0 p ij 1 i j 1 2 n j 1 m p ij 1 i 1 2 n 14 s t 1 f s t n where m t 1 and m t are the states of the cells at moment t 1 and moment t respectively p is the state transfer matrix p ij is the transition probability of si changing from j to i f is the transition rule of ca and n is the neighborhood of each cell s t 1 and s t are the states of the cell at moment t 1 and moment t respectively according to chang et al 2021 the accuracy of ca markov model predictions is related to the time step therefore we predicted the future spatial and temporal changes of the si with one step ahead using the decades of 2000 and 2010 to predict 2020 and two steps ahead using the decades of 2000 and 2010 to predict 2030 considering the divergence in the kappa coefficients pontius and millones 2011 we used the figure of merit fom index pontius et al 2008 to judge the accuracy and error of the model predictions based on the following criteria acceptable fom 0 1 good fom 0 15 and excellent fom 0 2 as shown in formula 15 this better reflects the accuracy of the prediction results 15 fom b a b c d where a and b are the area where the change was observed but predicted to be wrong and correctly predicted respectively c is the area where the change was predicted but did not actually occur and d is the area where the change was not predicted but actually occurred 3 results 3 1 optimal cropping pattern the auc values in both the training and test datasets were above 0 8 fig s3 indicating that the model can be used to simulate the distribution of different crop suitability and can reflect the distribution of crops under the influence of the natural environment the simulation results of the optimal cropping pattern showed that the suitability area of maize was the largest multi year average 12 500 km2 that of potatoes was the smallest multi year average 10 562 km2 followed by alfalfa wheat rape and cotton in descending order fig 3 a f fig s4 according to the records of the gansu provincial statistical yearbook 2010 2021 the actual multi year planting areas of the six crops from largest to smallest are corn alfalfa cotton potato rape and wheat compared with the optimal cropping pattern maize still has an absolute advantage although there is a mismatch between the actual planting area of other crops and the suitable planting area in future planting plans the areas of potatoes wheat and cotton should be increased and the area of alfalfa should be slightly reduced the percentage contribution of the main influencing factors and the response curves of the environmental factors varied among the six crop distributions under the combined influence of the various environmental factors meteorological conditions were the dominant factor affecting cropping patterns fig s5 the contribution of meteorological factors was approximately 35 for cotton and 50 for the remaining crops overall precipitation elevation wind speed and temperature were the main contributing factors while soil factors contributed less to crop distribution the total contribution of these four main factors can reach about 70 85 whereas the contribution of soil factors to crop distribution is smaller ranging from 5 to 15 in addition the response thresholds of different crops to environmental variables differed but the same environmental variables showed similar trends fig s6 for example the suitability of maize increases with increasing precipitation fig s6 a and it is optimal to grow maize at a spatial location where precipitation is approximately 275 mm and beyond the threshold interval it decreases the suitability of maize instead the specific effects of the remaining environmental variables on crop suitability can be obtained from fig s6 crop distribution fluctuated between decades owing to changes in crop suitability fig 3 under the optimal cropping pattern the planted area of maize and potatoes tended to shrink while that of wheat rape and cotton expanded and that of alfalfa did not change significantly cropping patterns that consider crop suitability are intensive which facilitates both the mechanization of crop cultivation and the management of irrigation water from the most suitable planting location the centre of gravity and planting range of crops in the study area also showed different migration directions with maize to the northwest potatoes and alfalfa to the northeast and rape to the southeast whereas cotton remained unchanged this implies that the optimal cropping pattern must reasonably adjust the regional distribution based on the actual suitability distribution 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of si according to the optimal cropping pattern agricultural water has continuously decreased and average precipitation utilization rate has continuously increased over the last 60 years fig 4 the total crop water consumption et a was reduced from 5 015 billion m3 1960 s to 4 883 billion m3 2010 s at an average rate of 0 58 per decade and irrigation water use was reduced from 3 304 billion m3 1960 s to 2 609 billion m3 2010 s at an average rate of 4 51 per decade the decrease in irrigation water use was greater than the total crop water consumption although total crop water consumption rose slightly in the 1990 s this did not affect the overall trend of continued reductions the average precipitation utilization rate was increased from 34 1 1960 s to 46 5 2010 s over the 60 years of the study period we used the si to calculate the reliability resilience and vulnerability indexes for each decade fig 5 shows the spatiotemporal changes in irrigation water use for the si from 1961 to 2020 linear regression analysis was used to characterize trends in reliability resilience vulnerability and si and to quantify the magnitude of such trends the change direction of the lower reliability area over time for each year was southeast northwest southeast and all three basins are involved indicating that all three major basins in the hexi corridor had prolonged water shortages affecting irrigation practices however 35 of this corridor still had increased reliability of irrigation water figs s7 and s10 vulnerability was low and evenly distributed in most of the hexi corridors areas of high vulnerability are concentrated in the heihe and shule river basins which should be given more attention in irrigation practices because high vulnerability implies a greater negative impact on the use of irrigation water following water shortages for resilience the overall high resilience in the heihe river basin indicates that irrigation activities can resume due to this higher capacity while the shule and shiyang river basins had lower resilience values the si values fluctuated widely between years fig 5 and s7 s10 particularly so in the shiyang and heihe river basins calculated using spatial statistics the average si of the hexi corridor was 0 293 the shule and shiyang river basins had the lowest si mean values of 0 228 and 0 259 respectively and the highest si mean value 0 352 was in the hehe river basin indicating that irrigation activities can be met in more areas of the basin fig 5 g h show the projected si values for the 2020 and 2030 decades there was a significant increase in the predicted si values when spatially compared to the 2010 decade especially the si is in the range of 0 4 0 7 showing that the shortage of irrigation water in the hexi corridor region will be alleviated however there are still differences in si between basins which is expected to increase in most parts of the heihe and shiyang river basins while in the middle reaches of the shiyang and shule river basins an effort still needs to be made to improve the ability to secure irrigation water because of lower si values 3 3 relationships between reliability resilience vulnerability and the si the main indicators limiting the sustainability of irrigation in the hexi corridor are resilience and vulnerability when the si is low there are higher values of reliability and vulnerability and lower values of resilience fig 6 a this indicates a shortage of irrigation water in some of the study areas furthermore it is not accurate that the sustainability of irrigation is high in some areas as reliability and resilience have different peak to trough distributions and some areas with a high si are enhanced by a single dimensional index such as reliability or resilience drawing from fig 5 and s7 s9 we found that the sustainable development of areas such as the northwestern heihe and the northern of shiyang river basins are at risk there appears to be a linear relationship between the three indices used to calculate the si fig 6 b resilience increases with increasing reliability whereas vulnerability decreases with increasing reliability different slopes indicate that resilience and vulnerability can vary even for areas with similar reliability the relationship between the four indices shows that as si increases reliability and resilience increase linearly and vulnerability decreases in a parabolic trend fig 6 c the si can better evaluate the reliability vulnerability and resilience characteristics corresponding to this region the vulnerability values were less than 0 5 indicating that the region was not seriously affected by water shortages a higher si ensures the ability of irrigated agriculture in an area to cope with droughts even under drought conditions an area can recover quickly in contrast for areas with low si irrigation is prone to continuous water shortages impacting crop yields 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors affecting crop suitability the validated dominant factors of crops can accurately reflect their ecological niche because human activities e g irrigation fertilization field management can have a greater impact on soil properties and water consumption yin et al 2020 climatic factors dominate in the natural state and soil factors have less influence on crop distribution the main contributing factors of the studied crops corresponded to their ecological niches fig s5 in the following ways the growing period of maize coincides with climatic rain and heat and less stringent soil conditions he et al 2020a the combined contribution of the first three factors precipitation 38 7 elevation 30 4 and cumulus temperature 9 9 was 79 wheat requires longer daylight for growth and potassium promotes nitrogen metabolism sui et al 2015 thus sunshine hours 29 1 elevation 21 8 tk 13 2 pre 11 2 and slope 10 5 were the dominant factors potatoes and rape are suitable for planting in hills or plains and are tolerant to low temperatures pullens et al 2019 wang et al 2021 pre dem win and slope were their top five important factors cotton has strict requirements for altitude and temperature li et al 2021 and is susceptible to climatic disasters such as high winds the results also indicate that win 26 6 slope 22 4 and dem 22 3 have a strong influence on its distribution alfalfa is used as livestock fodder and wind affects its uptake of soil moisture during the re growth period and thus ranks first while the contributions of other suitable conditions are relatively balanced liu et al 2022c based on the above verified dominant factors it was again shown that the maxent model successfully simulated the potential distribution of the six crops and could accurately reflect the ecological niche of the crops 4 2 analysis of optimal cropping pattern from the perspective of appropriate spatial distribution the crop suitability simulated by the maxent model was consistent with the natural growth features of the crops the areas with high most suitable and suitable and moderately suitability for crops were distributed in the central and southeastern parts of the hexi corridor where the population distribution is dense the soil is fertile and the precipitation is high the mountainous areas on the southern edge of the hexi corridor are unsuitable for crop cultivation because of their undulating terrain therefore the advantages of crop suitability should be considered in planting coping strategies from the perspective of optimizing the planting area the reasons for the mismatch between the optimal cropping pattern and actual planting area can be analyzed because of the warm and humid climate in the hexi corridor and the increase in human demand for food liu et al 2020 tian et al 2022 the increase in yield and efficiency of crops such as wheat and cotton has led to their expansion wang et al 2008 in turn affecting the area of other crops moreover the higher water consumption of maize and the immaturity of potato cultivation technology are also reasons for the change in optimal cropping patterns which has been argued in similar studies liu et al 2016 xing et al 2022 the optimal cropping pattern is the maximization of the efficiency of natural resource allocation and although human activities can affect the crop patterns the natural environment for crop growth should be respected based on this agriculture should be highly productive through technological means from the perspective of agricultural water management optimal cropping patterns can be adapted to environmental changes to reduce irrigation water consumption the significant increase in interannual precipitation and temperature in the hexi corridor favors vegetation growth zhang et al 2017a which is one reason for the decrease in agricultural water use additionally the optimal cropping pattern increases the proportion of effective precipitation in the grid by adjusting crop types according to the water consumption needs of different crop growth periods therefore the reduction in net irrigation water is more significant fig 5 thus changing cropping patterns is an effective solution for reducing water scarcity zareian 2021 these results help to explain the concept of sustainable irrigation and the importance of optimal cropping patterns in irrigated agriculture 4 3 reflections on sustainable irrigation the increase in precipitation during the 60 year period factored om the alleviation of irrigation water shortages in the region from the spatial scale the shule and shiyang river basins have lower si values possibly due to past intense human activities wang and qin 2017 pan et al 2021 the heihe river basin has a high si which is inseparable from its complete irrigation infrastructure guo et al 2022 this shows that irrigation facilities play an important role in increasing irrigation sustainability from the meteorological conditions affecting irrigation even though there is a mitigation trend of meteorological agricultural and ecological droughts in the hexi corridor cao et al 2022 jiang et al 2022 it is not sustainable and could exacerbate water scarcity gao et al 2021 therefore water saving irrigation practices should be maintained in areas with higher si and agricultural water supply and management should be enhanced in areas with lower si when revising global or regional irrigation sustainability it is important to analyze three dimensions of reliability vulnerability and resilience to ensure that irrigation activities are fully sustainable moreover we believe that the si can be expanded in the future to include other dimensions that could better to assess sustainable irrigation in different regions an assessment of the irrigation water si will hopefully draw attention to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture optimal cropping patterns is an important way to improve the sustainability of irrigation as the sustainability of water resources largely depends on the proper management and efficient use of agricultural water fasakhodi et al 2010 in optimal cropping patterns heat and water stresses on crops are mitigated crop response thresholds to environmental variables are accurately returned and the advantages of natural resources are fully accentuated optimal cropping patterns reduce irrigation water use while intensively using arable land and improving the utilization of natural resources which is typical of agricultural intensification and sustainable development silva et al 2021 in addition to water quantity and natural factors sustainable irrigation can still be assessed from other perspectives e g nutrient use water quality energy use or biodiversity rosa et al 2022 although the impact of anthropogenic disturbances e g irrigation practices economic efficiency on optimal cropping patterns has not been added to this study the results could still provide some reference value for the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in arid regions 5 conclusion to explore whether the optimal cropping pattern is conducive to sustainable irrigation this study investigated the relationship between optimal cropping pattern and irrigation water sustainability in the arid hexi corridor in china over the past 60 years we obtained the following conclusions 1 the maxent model can well simulate the distribution of crop suitability and the optimal cropping pattern determined by this model conforms to the natural features of crop growth and highly matches with natural resources 2 optimal cropping patterns are conducive to sustainable irrigation which can reduce crop water consumption by 2 69 and irrigation water use by 21 03 1961 2020 mainly due to the adjustment of crop water demand and the matching of effective precipitation 3 the continuous growth of the si under the optimal cropping pattern means that this pattern will continue to improve the regional si and alleviate the crisis of insufficient agricultural irrigation water in the future therefore re examining the optimal cropping patterns adapted to environmental factors can mitigate the impact of climate change and human activities on irrigation water shortages

9268,the pressures of frequent extreme weather water shortages and increasing food demand pose a continued challenge of maintaining the sustainable development of irrigated agricultural systems although rational arable land management is fundamental to alleviating these pressures the relationship between cropping patterns and irrigation sustainability is understudied using the hexi corridor as an example a maximum entropy machine learning model was used to determine the optimal cropping pattern based on crop suitability and to explore the impact mechanism of the optimal cropping pattern on the irrigation sustainability index si from the perspective of reliability resilience and vulnerability an optimal cropping pattern was conducive to sustainable irrigation and reduced irrigation water use by 21 03 from 1960 s to 2010 s with no continued agricultural expansion thus the challenges of food security and sustainability for similar regions and globally can be met but will require

rational and precise irrigation management has become important for achieving sustainable irrigation mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 singh 2014 irrigated agriculture has led to severe water shortages both regionally and globally due to the expansion of irrigated areas and the increase in irrigation water use and the continued depletion of irrigation water threatens the sustainability of irrigated

agricultural water use efficiency shtull trauring and bernstein 2018 mikhak et al 2022 african countries are taking steps to improve groundwater mineralisation to remedy the shortage of water for irrigation besser et al 2021 during rapid economic development over the past two decades the expanding production scale of chinese agriculture has consumed large amounts of water as water scarcity and competition among different water users agriculture industry and households continues to increase china s growing freshwater demand must be reconciled with already overused renewable water resources huang et al 2020 wang et al 2019 further if irrigation occurs in arid areas where water resources are extremely scarce this will exacerbate water shortages making it more difficult to coordinate future irrigated agriculture with water sustainability li and wang 2021b li et al 2021c sustainable irrigation refers to irrigation practices that do not exceed the availability of local renewable water and freshwater reserves and can show sustainability regarding irrigation water volume rosa et al 2019 rosa 2022 cropping pattern optimization is an important approach for sustainable irrigation practices akpoti et al 2019 yin et al 2022 extensive research has been conducted on the optimization of cropping patterns to increase yield and reduce irrigation water in agricultural production these optimization methods include among others crop suitability evaluation models based on combined subjective and objective weights he et al 2022 cellular automata model with coupled partial least squares

manners et al 2020 rising and devineni 2020 crop suitability qualitatively and quantitatively reflects the process of crop planting and growth that matches the required natural resources light temperature water soil etc fan et al 2021 however most of these methods use empirical values to delineate crop suitability and cannot accurately assess the influence of the natural environment climate soil topography etc on the suitability of crop planting the ecological maximum entropy maxent model is the most widely used machine learning model for predicting species distribution phillips et al 2006 and has recently been extended to crop planting suitability studies recently wang et al 2021 yu et al 2022 this model realizes a dynamic simulation of the potential distribution of crop suitability based on environmental factors phillips and dudík 2008 it accurately quantifies the complexity and uncertainty of environmental factors on crop growth merow et al 2013 which provides a high predictive accuracy of crop spatial distribution for the determination of agricultural irrigation water resources ashraf et al 2017 feng et al 2021 assessing the sustainability of irrigation water use has also been widely recognized for a long time as it is extremely important to establish climate change adapted irrigation schemes and manage irrigation water resources radmehr et al 2022

energy food optimization models for sustainable development de vito et al 2017 yue et al 2021 generally the single dimensional evaluation of irrigation water sustainability is insufficient and requires a comprehensive assessment of long term irrigation water management davidson et al 2019 the multidimensional elevation indicator sustainability index si of water resources has been used to assess water resources and sustainable agricultural irrigation because of its ability to comprehensively integrates reliability resilience and vulnerability of the indicators in technology assessment

use de o vieira and sandoval solis 2018 the analysis and summary of irrigation water sustainability can help manage future irrigation water resources and contribute to the achievement of sustainable irrigation the hexi corridor in northwestern china is an area experiencing growing conflict between irrigation water use and irrigation sustainability fu et al 2019 in this study the si was used to assess the potential of cropping patterns before and after optimization to improve irrigation sustainability in this region over the past 60 years and the next 20 years the optimal cropping pattern was simulated using the maxent model based on crop suitability of the current cropping pattern determined by field investigations the aims of this study are to 1 find the optimal cropping pattern of crops that matches natural resources 2 determine whether the optimal cropping pattern in goal 1 can improve regional irrigation sustainability and 3 based on goal 2 explore the development potential of future regional sustainable irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 research framework to explore the sustainability of irrigation at the spatial and temporal scales we developed a research framework as shown fig 1 firstly we obtained multi year crop planting locations for six crops maize wheat potatoes rape cotton and alfalfa according to field samples secondly we removed environmental factors that duplicated crop distribution influences through the correlation analysis of climatic topographic and soil factors for each crop the maxent model was then used to predict the suitability distribution for each crop next the optimal cropping pattern was determined by screening for crops with the greatest suitability for each grid the distribution of irrigation water was calculated using the water balance and penman monteith equations allen et al 1998 finally the si index was used to assess irrigation water use over the past 60 years and the ca markov model was used to obtain the spatio temporal variation of the irrigation water si over the next 20 years 2 2 study area the hexi corridor situated in the northwestern gansu province china 92 12 104 20 e 37 17 42 48 n is long approximately 1000 km and narrow fig 2 yang et al 2011 the region is typically arid with an average annual precipitation of 50 150 mm and an average annual evaporation of 1500 2500 mm li et al 2016 irrigation water accounts for more than 90 of the total water consumption but the gdp contribution of agriculture is less than 30 improving water efficiency is an important initiative for the sustainable socioeconomic development of the region huang et al 2022 due to these factors balancing water scarcity and securing agricultural production is of regional concern the oasis in the hexi corridor is flat and suitable for farming long term irrigation and water saving measures have indirectly exacerbated the warm and humid trend in the region and the soil pore structure and physicochemical properties have been enhanced by years of irrigation zhang et al 2017a 2017b fu et al 2022 however the region has become the most important grain producing area in northwest china and the core of the development of the silk road economic belt relying on abundant solar and thermal resources and the only oasis supplied by three inland rivers basins the shiyang heihe and shule rivers

gov cn spring maize spring wheat potatoes spring rape cotton and alfalfa account for approximately 85 of the crops planted in the hexi corridor vegetables were excluded because of the wide variety of planting species the small planting area of a single type and the high spatial discretization we obtained farmland planting information samples over the past decade through field surveys with handheld gps locators and farmers questionnaires to prevent crop point locations from overfitting the simulation results in the maxent model we conducted a spatially explicit correlation and ecological niche overlap analysis by screening crop point locations with a 2 5 grid size using enmtools holt et al 2018 johnson et al 2017 finally we obtained a total of 5137 effective crop distribution samples of which samples number for spring maize spring wheat potato spring rape cotton and alfalfa accounted for 1561 481 667 562 824 and 1042 of the samples respectively fig s1 in supplementary material 2 4 2 environmental variables meteorological topographical and soil factors that affect crop planting and growth are collectively referred to as natural environmental variables yang et al 2022 although crops differ in biophysical properties across regions the main constraints precipitation temperature soil characteristics etc affecting crop distribution are broadly the same kogo et al 2019 peterson and westfall 2004 therefore we selected precipitation pre cumulative temperature tem relative humidity rhu sunshine hours ssd and wind speed win as the meteorological indicators and used the average meteorological data every 10 years as a chronological change elevation and slope assumed to remain static during the study period were used to reflect the topographic characteristics of the cultivated land to reflect soil characteristics we chose soil texture tex bulk density bd soil organic matter som ph total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp total potassium tk and soil water content swc except for soil water content we defaulted to other soil indicators that remained unchanged during the study period to avoid collinearity among the selected indicators pearson et al 2010 we used the pearson correlation coefficient method to eliminate the rhu with a correlation exceeding 0 9 calculated in spps 24 0 results shown in fig s2 and retained the remaining 14 indicators involved in the prediction of the optimal cropping pattern 2 4 3 optimal cropping pattern simulation the maxent model is a complex machine learning method based on maximum entropy theory which can be run with data on species distribution points and environmental variables phillips et al 2006 based on a machine learning approach the model establishes relationships between sample points and environmental variables jaynes 1957 elith et al 2011 which can better describe the nonlinear relationships between inputs and predictions heumann et al 2011 the model builds an accurate probabilistic model of crop distribution by learning the relationship between the sample and environmental variables and determining the optimal distribution with maximum entropy in the approximate satisfaction condition jiménez valverde et al 2011 suitable distribution areas predicted by the model based on available crop point data represent areas with similar environmental conditions peterson et al 2007 considering that the arable land in the study area was less developed 30 years ago the current arable range 2020 was used to better reflect the influence of environmental variables on the distribution of crop suitability taking the crop distribution points as sample points and the selected environmental variables as constraints of the model we explored the possible distributions of maximum entropy under these constraints the optimal distribution of maximum entropy was used as the crop suitability distribution in this study the general interpretation of the maximum entropy algorithm is as follows when the output of x is y for a given training data set and feature function f i x y i 1 2 n the calculation process is as follows 1 max p c h p x y p x p y x log p y x 2 s t e p f i e p f i i 1 2 n 3 y p y x 1 where h p is the conditional entropy p y x is the distribution assumption of the conditional probability p x is the empirical distribution and e p f i is the expectation value of the characteristic function on the empirical distribution to obtain the suitability distribution for each crop at 1 km resolution a random sample of 75 of the crop distribution points was used as data for the model training set and the remaining 25 was used as the test set guisan and thuiller 2005 the test set was extracted using cross validation to enhance the confidence of the simulation results phillips and dudík 2008 five replicates were conducted for each crop of which the final results were the average the contribution and ranked importance of each environmental variable were then quantified using the jackknife method and corresponding curves for all environmental variables were created the other parameters of the model were set to their default values a receiver operating characteristic roc curve was used to assess the accuracy of the obtained crop suitability areas in the maxent model this was generated by plotting the false positive rate of a model prediction 1 specificity given here as fractional predicted area against the true positive rate model sensitivity given as 1 rate of false negatives the performance of the model was measured by the area under the roc curve auc peterson et al 2008 which ranged from 0 to 1 the higher the auc value the more accurate the model predictions the specific assessment criteria were fail 0 5 0 6 poor 0 6 0 7 fair 0 7 0 8 good 0 8 0 9 and excellent 0 9 1 0 swets 1988 the suitability of the six crops during the six decades from 1961 to 2020 was obtained using the maxent model the distribution probabilities of these crops in the same grid were compared the crop with the highest crop suitability was selected as the most suitable crop in the grid to form the spatial distribution of the optimal cropping pattern over the years 2 5 computation of the si in this study the water supply transmission and distribution losses in the form of surface evaporation and canal seepage were not considered instead water transported to the farm and consumed in the

irrigation water state of the crop for the i th grid at time period t can be described as 7 d t i x target t i x suppled t i if x target t i x suppled t i 0 if x target t i x suppled t i where x target t i is the irrigation water amount required by the crop x suppled t i is the irrigation water requirement of the crops under different optimal cropping patterns at other time periods these two values can be calculated in formula 6 based on the interannual cropping pattern reliability is the probability that a system is satisfactory hashimoto et al 1982 here the probability is that the irrigation water for the crops in the grid will be satisfied within 60 years reliability values ranged from 0 to 1 when the reliability is lower the frequency of irrigation water deficit is higher if the reliability value is 0 the area is in a continuous water deficit the higher the reliability the lower the frequency of water deficit and when the reliability is equal to 1 the area is temporarily free from water deficit for a given time step every 10 years the reliability of the i th location based on the frequency of no irrigation water deficit is calculated as 8 rel i lim n 1 n t 1 n z t i where z t i indicates the number of times d t i 0 occurs if d t i 0 z t i 1 if d t i 0 z t i 0 d t i 0 indicates a satisfactory state and d t i 0 indicates a failed state resilience is the rate at which a system can recover from failure and is a measure of the system s ability to adapt to changing conditions lane et al 2015 resilience values ranged from 0 to 1 the lower the value the lower the ability of the area to recover and the longer the water shortage experience when the resilience value is high the area is better able to recover from water shortages and less likely to experience persistent water shortages if the reliability is 0 the resilience is also 0 indicating that the area is in persistent water shortage if the reliability is 1 the resilience is also 1 and the area has no persistent water shortage or no water shortage similarly based on the persistence of no shortage of irrigation water the resilience of the i th location is 9 res i lim n t 1 n w t i n lim n t 1 n z t i where w t i indicates the transition from satisfactory state to failure state if d t i 0 and d t 1 i 0 w t i 1 otherwise w t i 0 vulnerability describes the severity of damage to the system that is the average severity of damage caused by irrigation water deficits kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 vulnerability values ranged from 0 to 1 when the vulnerability value is low there is a slight shortage of irrigation water in the area and a vulnerability value of 0 indicates that there is no shortage a higher value indicates a more severe water deficit and a vulnerability of 1 indicates that the area can hardly be met based on the shortage of water and the total unmet water demand the vulnerability of the i th location is 10 vul i lim n t 1 n d t i n lim n t 1 n z t i x target i the geometric mean method was used to calculate the si sandoval solis et al 2011 which ranged from 0 to 1 higher values indicate higher sustainability of irrigation water indicating the area has the potential for sustainable irrigation lower values indicate lower sustainability indicating the area has less potential when the si is 0 reliability or resilience is 0 and vulnerability is 1 indicating that the area has a continuous shortage of irrigation water resulting in limited crop production when the si is 1 reliability and resilience are 1 and vulnerability is 0 indicating that the area has sufficient irrigation water to meet crop production for a given number of time steps the si at position i is 11 si i rel i res i 1 vul i 1 3 2 6 ca markov model the ca markov model has a high accuracy prediction ability mondal et al 2016 and has been widely used in simulation studies of various spatial evolution types such as land use change drought prediction and urban water demand analysis feizizadeh et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b mokarram and pham 2022 in this study the integrated dynamic ca markov module was applied in idrisi 17 0 to predict spatio temporal changes in the irrigation water si the model is based on two processes the markov and ca models the markov process is used to determine the probability of each grid transition when the state at moment t 1 depends only on its state at moment t which can be expressed by formula 12 and 13 respectively ca is a discrete spatio temporal dynamics simulation model that simulates the evolution of complex systems through local transition rules between cells wolfram 1983 the state of a cell at moment t 1 depends on its state at moment t and the states of the neighboring cells and its general expression can be expressed by formula 14 12 m t 1 p m t 13 p p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p m 1 p m 2 p mn 0 p ij 1 i j 1 2 n j 1 m p ij 1 i 1 2 n 14 s t 1 f s t n where m t 1 and m t are the states of the cells at moment t 1 and moment t respectively p is the state transfer matrix p ij is the transition probability of si changing from j to i f is the transition rule of ca and n is the neighborhood of each cell s t 1 and s t are the states of the cell at moment t 1 and moment t respectively according to chang et al 2021 the accuracy of ca markov model predictions is related to the time step therefore we predicted the future spatial and temporal changes of the si with one step ahead using the decades of 2000 and 2010 to predict 2020 and two steps ahead using the decades of 2000 and 2010 to predict 2030 considering the divergence in the kappa coefficients pontius and millones 2011 we used the figure of merit fom index pontius et al 2008 to judge the accuracy and error of the model predictions based on the following criteria acceptable fom 0 1 good fom 0 15 and excellent fom 0 2 as shown in formula 15 this better reflects the accuracy of the prediction results 15 fom b a b c d where a and b are the area where the change was observed but predicted to be wrong and correctly predicted respectively c is the area where the change was predicted but did not actually occur and d is the area where the change was not predicted but actually occurred 3 results 3 1 optimal cropping pattern the auc values in both the training and test datasets were above 0 8 fig s3 indicating that the model can be used to simulate the distribution of different crop suitability and can reflect the distribution of crops under the influence of the natural environment the simulation results of the optimal cropping pattern showed that the suitability area of maize was the largest multi year average 12 500 km2 that of potatoes was the smallest multi year average 10 562 km2 followed by alfalfa wheat rape and cotton in descending order fig 3 a f fig s4 according to the records of the gansu provincial statistical yearbook 2010 2021 the actual multi year planting areas of the six crops from largest to smallest are corn alfalfa cotton potato rape and wheat compared with the optimal cropping pattern maize still has an absolute advantage although there is a mismatch between the actual planting area of other crops and the suitable planting area in future planting plans the areas of potatoes wheat and cotton should be increased and the area of alfalfa should be slightly reduced the percentage contribution of the main influencing factors and the response curves of the environmental factors varied among the six crop distributions under the combined influence of the various environmental factors meteorological conditions were the dominant factor affecting cropping patterns fig s5 the contribution of meteorological factors was approximately 35 for cotton and 50 for the remaining crops overall precipitation elevation wind speed and temperature were the main contributing factors while soil factors contributed less to crop distribution the total contribution of these four main factors can reach about 70 85 whereas the contribution of soil factors to crop distribution is smaller ranging from 5 to 15 in addition the response thresholds of different crops to environmental variables differed but the same environmental variables showed similar trends fig s6 for example the suitability of maize increases with increasing precipitation fig s6 a and it is optimal to grow maize at a spatial location where precipitation is approximately 275 mm and beyond the threshold interval it decreases the suitability of maize instead the specific effects of the remaining environmental variables on crop suitability can be obtained from fig s6 crop distribution fluctuated between decades owing to changes in crop suitability fig 3 under the optimal cropping pattern the planted area of maize and potatoes tended to shrink while that of wheat rape and cotton expanded and that of alfalfa did not change significantly cropping patterns that consider crop suitability are intensive which facilitates both the mechanization of crop cultivation and the management of irrigation water from the most suitable planting location the centre of gravity and planting range of crops in the study area also showed different migration directions with maize to the northwest potatoes and alfalfa to the northeast and rape to the southeast whereas cotton remained unchanged this implies that the optimal cropping pattern must reasonably adjust the regional distribution based on the actual suitability distribution 3 2 spatiotemporal variation of si according to the optimal cropping pattern agricultural water has continuously decreased and average precipitation utilization rate has continuously increased over the last 60 years fig 4 the total crop water consumption et a was reduced from 5 015 billion m3 1960 s to 4 883 billion m3 2010 s at an average rate of 0 58 per decade and irrigation water use was reduced from 3 304 billion m3 1960 s to 2 609 billion m3 2010 s at an average rate of 4 51 per decade the decrease in irrigation water use was greater than the total crop water consumption although total crop water consumption rose slightly in the 1990 s this did not affect the overall trend of continued reductions the average precipitation utilization rate was increased from 34 1 1960 s to 46 5 2010 s over the 60 years of the study period we used the si to calculate the reliability resilience and vulnerability indexes for each decade fig 5 shows the spatiotemporal changes in irrigation water use for the si from 1961 to 2020 linear regression analysis was used to characterize trends in reliability resilience vulnerability and si and to quantify the magnitude of such trends the change direction of the lower reliability area over time for each year was southeast northwest southeast and all three basins are involved indicating that all three major basins in the hexi corridor had prolonged water shortages affecting irrigation practices however 35 of this corridor still had increased reliability of irrigation water figs s7 and s10 vulnerability was low and evenly distributed in most of the hexi corridors areas of high vulnerability are concentrated in the heihe and shule river basins which should be given more attention in irrigation practices because high vulnerability implies a greater negative impact on the use of irrigation water following water shortages for resilience the overall high resilience in the heihe river basin indicates that irrigation activities can resume due to this higher capacity while the shule and shiyang river basins had lower resilience values the si values fluctuated widely between years fig 5 and s7 s10 particularly so in the shiyang and heihe river basins calculated using spatial statistics the average si of the hexi corridor was 0 293 the shule and shiyang river basins had the lowest si mean values of 0 228 and 0 259 respectively and the highest si mean value 0 352 was in the hehe river basin indicating that irrigation activities can be met in more areas of the basin fig 5 g h show the projected si values for the 2020 and 2030 decades there was a significant increase in the predicted si values when spatially compared to the 2010 decade especially the si is in the range of 0 4 0 7 showing that the shortage of irrigation water in the hexi corridor region will be alleviated however there are still differences in si between basins which is expected to increase in most parts of the heihe and shiyang river basins while in the middle reaches of the shiyang and shule river basins an effort still needs to be made to improve the ability to secure irrigation water because of lower si values 3 3 relationships between reliability resilience vulnerability and the si the main indicators limiting the sustainability of irrigation in the hexi corridor are resilience and vulnerability when the si is low there are higher values of reliability and vulnerability and lower values of resilience fig 6 a this indicates a shortage of irrigation water in some of the study areas furthermore it is not accurate that the sustainability of irrigation is high in some areas as reliability and resilience have different peak to trough distributions and some areas with a high si are enhanced by a single dimensional index such as reliability or resilience drawing from fig 5 and s7 s9 we found that the sustainable development of areas such as the northwestern heihe and the northern of shiyang river basins are at risk there appears to be a linear relationship between the three indices used to calculate the si fig 6 b resilience increases with increasing reliability whereas vulnerability decreases with increasing reliability different slopes indicate that resilience and vulnerability can vary even for areas with similar reliability the relationship between the four indices shows that as si increases reliability and resilience increase linearly and vulnerability decreases in a parabolic trend fig 6 c the si can better evaluate the reliability vulnerability and resilience characteristics corresponding to this region the vulnerability values were less than 0 5 indicating that the region was not seriously affected by water shortages a higher si ensures the ability of irrigated agriculture in an area to cope with droughts even under drought conditions an area can recover quickly in contrast for areas with low si irrigation is prone to continuous water shortages impacting crop yields 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors affecting crop suitability the validated dominant factors of crops can accurately reflect their ecological niche because human activities e g irrigation fertilization field management can have a greater impact on soil properties and water consumption yin et al 2020 climatic factors dominate in the natural state and soil factors have less influence on crop distribution the main contributing factors of the studied crops corresponded to their ecological niches fig s5 in the following ways the growing period of maize coincides with climatic rain and heat and less stringent soil conditions he et al 2020a the combined contribution of the first three factors precipitation 38 7 elevation 30 4 and cumulus temperature 9 9 was 79 wheat requires longer daylight for growth and potassium promotes nitrogen metabolism sui et al 2015 thus sunshine hours 29 1 elevation 21 8 tk 13 2 pre 11 2 and slope 10 5 were the dominant factors potatoes and rape are suitable for planting in hills or plains and are tolerant to low temperatures pullens et al 2019 wang et al 2021 pre dem win and slope were their top five important factors cotton has strict requirements for altitude and temperature li et al 2021 and is susceptible to climatic disasters such as high winds the results also indicate that win 26 6 slope 22 4 and dem 22 3 have a strong influence on its distribution alfalfa is used as livestock fodder and wind affects its uptake of soil moisture during the re growth period and thus ranks first while the contributions of other suitable conditions are relatively balanced liu et al 2022c based on the above verified dominant factors it was again shown that the maxent model successfully simulated the potential distribution of the six crops and could accurately reflect the ecological niche of the crops 4 2 analysis of optimal cropping pattern from the perspective of appropriate spatial distribution the crop suitability simulated by the maxent model was consistent with the natural growth features of the crops the areas with high most suitable and suitable and moderately suitability for crops were distributed in the central and southeastern parts of the hexi corridor where the population distribution is dense the soil is fertile and the precipitation is high the mountainous areas on the southern edge of the hexi corridor are unsuitable for crop cultivation because of their undulating terrain therefore the advantages of crop suitability should be considered in planting coping strategies from the perspective of optimizing the planting area the reasons for the mismatch between the optimal cropping pattern and actual planting area can be analyzed because of the warm and humid climate in the hexi corridor and the increase in human demand for food liu et al 2020 tian et al 2022 the increase in yield and efficiency of crops such as wheat and cotton has led to their expansion wang et al 2008 in turn affecting the area of other crops moreover the higher water consumption of maize and the immaturity of potato cultivation technology are also reasons for the change in optimal cropping patterns which has been argued in similar studies liu et al 2016 xing et al 2022 the optimal cropping pattern is the maximization of the efficiency of natural resource allocation and although human activities can affect the crop patterns the natural environment for crop growth should be respected based on this agriculture should be highly productive through technological means from the perspective of agricultural water management optimal cropping patterns can be adapted to environmental changes to reduce irrigation water consumption the significant increase in interannual precipitation and temperature in the hexi corridor favors vegetation growth zhang et al 2017a which is one reason for the decrease in agricultural water use additionally the optimal cropping pattern increases the proportion of effective precipitation in the grid by adjusting crop types according to the water consumption needs of different crop growth periods therefore the reduction in net irrigation water is more significant fig 5 thus changing cropping patterns is an effective solution for reducing water scarcity zareian 2021 these results help to explain the concept of sustainable irrigation and the importance of optimal cropping patterns in irrigated agriculture 4 3 reflections on sustainable irrigation the increase in precipitation during the 60 year period factored om the alleviation of irrigation water shortages in the region from the spatial scale the shule and shiyang river basins have lower si values possibly due to past intense human activities wang and qin 2017 pan et al 2021 the heihe river basin has a high si which is inseparable from its complete irrigation infrastructure guo et al 2022 this shows that irrigation facilities play an important role in increasing irrigation sustainability from the meteorological conditions affecting irrigation even though there is a mitigation trend of meteorological agricultural and ecological droughts in the hexi corridor cao et al 2022 jiang et al 2022 it is not sustainable and could exacerbate water scarcity gao et al 2021 therefore water saving irrigation practices should be maintained in areas with higher si and agricultural water supply and management should be enhanced in areas with lower si when revising global or regional irrigation sustainability it is important to analyze three dimensions of reliability vulnerability and resilience to ensure that irrigation activities are fully sustainable moreover we believe that the si can be expanded in the future to include other dimensions that could better to assess sustainable irrigation in different regions an assessment of the irrigation water si will hopefully draw attention to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture optimal cropping patterns is an important way to improve the sustainability of irrigation as the sustainability of water resources largely depends on the proper management and efficient use of agricultural water fasakhodi et al 2010 in optimal cropping patterns heat and water stresses on crops are mitigated crop response thresholds to environmental variables are accurately returned and the advantages of natural resources are fully accentuated optimal cropping patterns reduce irrigation water use while intensively using arable land and improving the utilization of natural resources which is typical of agricultural intensification and sustainable development silva et al 2021 in addition to water quantity and natural factors sustainable irrigation can still be assessed from other perspectives e g nutrient use water quality energy use or biodiversity rosa et al 2022 although the impact of anthropogenic disturbances e g irrigation practices economic efficiency on optimal cropping patterns has not been added to this study the results could still provide some reference value for the sustainable development of irrigated agriculture in arid regions 5 conclusion to explore whether the optimal cropping pattern is conducive to sustainable irrigation this study investigated the relationship between optimal cropping pattern and irrigation water sustainability in the arid hexi corridor in china over the past 60 years we obtained the following conclusions 1 the maxent model can well simulate the distribution of crop suitability and the optimal cropping pattern determined by this model conforms to the natural features of crop growth and highly matches with natural resources 2 optimal cropping patterns are conducive to sustainable irrigation which can reduce crop water consumption by 2 69 and irrigation water use by 21 03 1961 2020 mainly due to the adjustment of crop water demand and the matching of effective precipitation 3 the continuous growth of the si under the optimal cropping pattern means that this pattern will continue to improve the regional si and alleviate the crisis of insufficient agricultural irrigation water in the future therefore re examining the optimal cropping patterns adapted to environmental factors can mitigate the impact of climate change and human activities on irrigation water shortages

1282 published research reports retrieved from the data bases of web of science and scopus eventually 83 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria failure and under performance of irrigation schemes in ethiopia is reported to mostly relate to problems during design and implementation and or operation and maintenance low level of community participation lack of site specific reliable hydrological data poorly designed irrigation infrastructures high construction cost and delayed project completion are most mentioned problems during the design and implementation phases of irrigation projects presence of weak local scheme managing institutions and users exclusion in management decisions are among the main problems of small scale irrigation management practices in ethiopia regardless of their water sources irrigation schemes face similar problems in ethiopia adoption of a holistic development and management strategy that integrates technical socio economic and environmental aspects is needed to overcome problems and sustainability challenges of community managed irrigation schemes in ethiopia supporting the irrigation sector via research based findings and

sustainability ethiopia data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction farming practices in sub saharan africa ssa mainly focus on staple crop production for food consumption of the rural poor they are highly rainfed dependent and characterized by low yields and subject to climate driven fluctuations burney and naylor 2012 various factors including rainfall variability land degradation and low levels of soil fertility are among the production constraints in the region worqlul et al 2019 small scale irrigation is a priority development in ssa to increase agricultural production ensure food security and reduce poverty levels of rural smallholders bjornlund et al 2020 sakaki and koga 2013 small scale irrigation development is also seen as an effective way to mitigate climate change effects amede 2015 balana et al 2020 and provides significant employment to the rural community de bont et al 2019 woodhouse et al 2017 ethiopia is the second most populated nation in ssa its smallholder rainfed based farming system would not be able to fill the food requirements of the country due to spatial and temporal rainfall variability land degradation fertility depletion and climate change effects zerssa et al 2021 soil moisture stress due to longer dry spells shorter rainy seasons and sometimes a total lack of rain are among the main reasons of crop failure in rainfed ethiopian farming practices araya and stroosnijder 2011 different water harvesting structures have been built for irrigation purposes and to reduce the adverse effects of soil moisture stress across different parts of ethiopia embaye et al 2020 haregeweyn et al 2006 irrigation development in ethiopia is embraced as a possible solution to maximize agricultural production to satisfy the food demands of the ever increasing population and improve the income of smallholder farmers to achieve these objectives multiple irrigation projects have been developed throughout the country ranging from few hectares to tens of thousands of hectares the ethiopian government is investing in the development of small scale community irrigation schemes with the aim to reduce food insecurity fdre 2001a zewdie et al 2020 zeweld et al 2015 poverty reduction and livelihood improvement bacha et al 2011 hanjra et al 2009 mengistie and kidane 2016 tesfaye and

mtethiwa et al 2016 reported that the performance of small scale irrigation schemes is not addressed at national or basin level but at the outset of projects furthermore small scale irrigation schemes in ssa face critical water management challenges and are proved to be highly unsustainable mutambara et al 2016 the current status and performance of small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia is not different from those in other ssa countries small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia are performing below design expectations leaving huge areas out of irrigation amede 2015 reported that many irrigation schemes are not operating to their design capacity due to design failure poor water and agronomic management practices weak local institutions and excessive siltation problems research findings from awulachew and ayana 2011 also indicated that less than 50 of the expected irrigation users have benefitted from irrigation schemes developed watershed degradation lack of sustainable funding for operation and maintenance failure of hydraulic structures and poor extension services are among the main reasons for under performance of irrigation schemes in ethiopia awulachew and ayana 2011 recent research results e g abera et al 2019 annys et al 2020a gurmu et al 2019 habtu et al 2020 indicate the poor performance of small scale irrigation schemes in different parts of ethiopia even though various studies have indicated the problems and causes there is no study that addresses the management practices of small scale irrigation schemes at national level in ethiopia the objective of this review paper is therefore to address the management challenges and problems of small scale irrigation schemes and future sustainability directions for improvement in ethiopia a systematic literature review slr was conducted on management practices problems and future directions of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia this review is the first of its kind in addressing these issues at national level in ethiopia from which we hope to draw lessons and future directions for policy makers and practitioners 2 research methods this study was conducted using a slr of small scale irrigation management practices in ethiopia the slr is a reliable and less biased review type that can lead to evidence based conclusions as compared to the conventional review methods koutsos et al 2019 slr identify and retrieve relevant evidences to a particular research question or questions to appraise and synthesize results of previous research works and identify practices and gaps produce decision making guidance and areas for future studies liberati et al 2009 munn et al 2018 a slr method called prisma preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analysis mardani et al 2019 moher et al 2009 was used in this research the prisma method includes data resources inclusion and exclusion criteria steps of the review process data abstraction and analysis interpretation and presentation processes koutsos et al 2019 the prisma method consists of three steps searching for literature section 2 1 determining articles eligibility section 2 2 and extraction of data and summarizing section 2 3 2 1 information sources and search strategy primary sources of information for this review were electronic journal databases of web of science and scopus a fixed set of inclusion criteria was used articles published in english limited to journal articles in all years available in the databases the search of articles was undertaken between may and october 2020 a literature search using the terms irrigation and ethiopia table 1 resulted in a total of 1282 articles out of which 559 were from web of science and 723 were from scopus all bibliographical details were imported into mendeley reference manager https www mendeley com to manage the references and eliminate duplications after removal of duplicated articles data papers and conference proceedings 818 articles remained for further screening article screening was done by reading titles and abstracts relevant to this study and irrelevant articles were removed resulting in 338 potentially relevant articles fig 1 illustrates this selection process 2 2 selection and eligibility criteria in the selection and eligibility criteria phase selected articles were evaluated based on the scope of the research work this phase includes defining inclusion and exclusion criteria assessment of articles based on their evidence strength minimizing bias that may exist and reading selected articles in depth koutsos et al 2019 table 2 shows the predefined inclusion and exclusion set of criteria applied in this study information sources such as conference papers report papers working papers technical papers and articles not related with irrigation management were excluded articles from plot based experimental research were also excluded due to their limitations in addressing the entire irrigation system management the management systems of state owned irrigation farms depend on the government institutions bureaucratic procedures and community participation in such schemes is negligible hence research reports and book chapters on state owned irrigation schemes were excluded 97 peer reviewed articles and book chapters were found as potential articles with a main focus on irrigation management in ethiopia but 14 articles were excluded as they were about estate irrigation management practices finally 83 peer reviewed research articles and book chapters appendix a focusing on small scale irrigation management in ethiopia were included in this slr for data synthesis and analysis koga a large scale community irrigation was also included in this review the koga irrigation scheme is managed by both the community and a project operation unit pou having their boundaries in the scheme the smallholder community members manage tertiary quaternary and field water distribution systems while the pou is responsible to manage and operate the reservoir primary and secondary distribution systems 2 3 data extraction and summarizing data and information collected from finally selected articles was inventoried in ms excel spread sheet each article of the final selection was categorized based on its research focus spatial scale irrigation typology water sources source of energy research findings irrigation management systems and identified problems data and information were extracted by reading the abstract followed by in depth reading of the selected articles full content the spatial scale was categorized as national regional district basin watershed or scheme based on the spatial coverage of the research done the irrigation typology was categorized as large scale medium scale and small scale based on the ethiopian irrigation typology classification surface water sources such as river lake reservoir and flash flood and ground water sources of wells and springs were mentioned as the water sources for irrigation the sources of energy for water abstraction were categorized as gravity pump or a combination of both year of irrigation scheme commencement available irrigation scheme infrastructure number of beneficiaries and stakeholders in scheme management were also extracted when available in the literature 3 results and discussion 3 1 general characteristics of selected articles the 83 articles which were identified and included were published between 2004 and 2020 more than 60 of these articles were published in the last five years 2015 2020 this could indicate the level of attention given to small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia in recent studies more than 100 community irrigation schemes are described in the selected articles these schemes are distributed at different parts of ethiopia fig 2 according to scale based irrigation classification in ethiopia nakawuka et al 2018 all identified and analyzed studies were about small scale irrigation development and management surface water resources from embankment based reservoirs 30 are the main water sources for the selected irrigation schemes followed by flowing rivers streams lakes and springs 20 ground water sources from shallow wells 12 and flash floods 11 the water sources for the remaining 27 of selected irrigation schemes is either from different sources or was not mentioned flash flood is commonly utilized as a source of irrigation water supply for spate irrigation systems in semi arid low lands of ethiopia castelli et al 2018 chukalla et al 2013 embaye et al 2012 tola and haile 2020 van steenbergen et al 2011 gravity flow irrigation is dominant about 57 within the irrigation schemes described in the selected literature pumping systems ranging from manually operated treadle pumps to diesel pump 12 were the energy sources for groundwater and lake based irrigation schemes in about 8 of research reports both gravity flow and pumping system were mentioned 3 2 irrigation potential and classification systems in ethiopia ethiopia has twelve river basins with an annual flow of 124 5 billion m3 estimated groundwater potential of 6 5 billion m3 awulachew and ayana 2011 and an estimated irrigation potential that varies from 3 5 to 11 million hectares the national irrigation potential area is not precisely known or documented in scientific research reports most authors mentioned that the irrigation potential of ethiopia is in the range of 3 7 5 3 million hectares e g bacha et al 2011 belay and bewket 2013 derib et al 2011 hagos et al 2016 makombe et al 2007 sakketa 2018 tesfaye and bogale 2008 teshome et al 2018 but according to schmitter et al 2018 the ethiopian agricultural transformation agency ata estimated that about 11 million hectares of land would be suitable for irrigation of which 48 could be irrigated using groundwater resources irrigation potential does not only involve the available land area and water but also includes other biophysical socio economic factors and people s interest to engage in irrigation activities beekman et al 2014 biophysical and socioeconomic factors such as topographic hydrologic agronomic and economic issues should be considered during the irrigation potential assessment you et al 2011 hence this variation of the estimated national irrigation potential could be related to the recent governments commitment to invest in the irrigation sector financial factor the introduction of pressurized irrigation systems topographic factor development of multi purpose large reservoirs water resource availability annys et al 2020b and groundwater resource development for irrigation utilization classification of irrigation schemes under different categories such as traditional or modern and small or large scale is not clearly defined and remains debatable in many countries in tanzania irrigation classification as modern or traditional is a contentious policy issue related to the involvement of external agencies in project initiation and operation de bont et al 2019 schemes that are referred to as traditional are initiated and operated by farmers without the involvement of external authority while formally planned and designed schemes by the government are referred to as modern beekman et al 2014 de bont and veldwisch 2020 classifying irrigation schemes as small or large scale considering the area coverage is not enough nakawuka et al 2018 it needs considering the land holding size of individual farmers and its management system irrigation schemes are classified as small scale when both technology and water sources are self supplied by individuals or small groups of farmers and individuals are the decision makers on technology used crops cultivated and sale of the products xie et al 2021 accordingly an irrigation scheme with a large command area might be classified as small scale when it is composed of farmers who manage individual plots of less than 2 ha and is then also referred to as smallholder irrigation scheme in ethiopia irrigation schemes are classified based on their size of command area technology used and the management system in the irrigation scheme awulachew and ayana 2011 table 3 shows the classification of irrigation systems in ethiopia based on different classification criteria 3 3 irrigation development and challenges in ethiopia irrigation development is considered as an important cornerstone to improve agricultural productivity in many african countries you et al 2011 the same is expected from irrigation development in ethiopia in ethiopia irrigation development is a key option to achieve rapid inclusive and sustainable rural development annys et al 2020a currently significant focus is given to the development of small scale irrigation schemes to overcome food insecurity and rural poverty abera et al 2019 oates et al 2020 sakketa 2018 yami 2013 in the 2005 06 agricultural season about 625 000 ha of land in ethiopia was equipped with irrigation systems amede 2015 mowie 2020 reported that the national irrigation coverage in ethiopia increased from 160 000 ha in 2010 to 490 000 ha in 2015 reports on current status of irrigation development are different and conflicting to each other this discrepancy in estimations shows that the national irrigation potential coverage and status of the currently promoted small scale irrigation schemes development is not well assessed updated and documented by formal research studies in ethiopia 3 3 1 policy issues on irrigation development and management in ethiopia irrigation development and management aspects are described in the ethiopian water sector policy fdre 2001a and the ethiopian water sector strategy fdre 2001b supported with proclamations regulations and development programs irrigation development and adoption of water harvesting technologies are considered as a priority policy points to overcome agricultural productivity risks and thus for the overall economic development of the country the main objective of irrigation development is to expand irrigated agriculture to its possible potential for the production of food crops and raw materials for agro industries without degrading the fertility of irrigated fields and water resources bases fdre 2001a in the water sector policy participation of all stakeholders and gender mainstreaming is stated as a mandatory approach during all water resources projects study implementation and operation phases both national water sector policy and water sector strategy try to address technical environmental socio economic and management aspects of irrigation projects appendix b development of multipurpose and efficient irrigation projects with appropriate technologies supported by research and extension services is the main target of the irrigation sub sector policy in the policy implementation of stepwise cost recovery systems to cover operation and maintenance costs of small scale irrigation schemes is considered as a solution to ensure scheme financial self reliance the water sector policy promotes user based decentralization of irrigation management practices 3 3 2 irrigation development challenges in ethiopia in spite of the governments commitment and effort in investing for irrigation development farmer managed irrigation schemes have performed below their design expectations in ethiopia amede 2015 awulachew and ayana 2011 oates et al 2020 the failure and under performance of irrigation schemes in ethiopia is mostly related to either problems during design and implementation and or operation and maintenance low level of community participation during project study and design phases aberra 2004 amede 2015 wegerich et al 2008 yami 2013 lack of site specific reliable hydrological data embaye et al 2020 hagos and mamo 2014 negash et al 2020 poorly designed infrastructures aberra 2004 amede 2015

mulugeta 2019 are among the major problems during the design and implementation phases of irrigation projects a top down approach that excludes local experiences and community needs is commonly practiced during irrigation development due to this approach community participation is highly limited during project initiation and implementation phases aberra 2004 annys et al 2020a bekele and tilahun 2006 wegerich et al 2008 in practicing irrigation development gender mainstreaming and participation is often ignored imburgia 2019 lefore et al 2019 theis et al 2018 yami 2013 3 4 irrigation management practices in ethiopia 3 4 1 institutions for irrigation management in ethiopia irrigation water management is a complex process with heterogeneous interests of multiple stakeholders with shared water resources that can lead to conflicts among irrigators at different locations with different needs e g upstream versus downstream users of different crops pump users versus canal users amede 2015 appropriate organizations are needed to manage operate and maintain the irrigation system and closely address the issues of equitable water distribution and efficient water use haileslassie et al 2016 institutional setups are either unavailable or weak in operation in most community small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia eguavoen et al 2012 mulugeta 2019 van halsema et al 2011 water user associations wuas are considered as important links between external actors and the local community in small scale irrigation schemes yami 2013 wuas are registered as cooperatives in most schemes amede 2015 mulugeta 2019 oates et al 2020 tola and haile 2020 yami 2013 with expectations to abide by the rules and regulations of cooperatives agency table 4 community cooperatives assist their members in accessing farm inputs and markets for their farm products much more than in irrigation management related tasks experiences in managing traditional small scale irrigation schemes with community by laws enforced by locally elected water distributors contribute to the existence of centuries old traditional irrigation schemes adela et al 2019 habtu and yoshinobu 2006 while many newly developed small scale irrigation schemes in the same area failed due to low community participation non transparent communication and the top down approach in setting by laws for wuas annys et al 2020a yami 2013 weak functioning of the wua leads to ineffective irrigation system control inadequate monitoring and poor community by law enforcement amede 2015 nakawuka et al 2018 in most small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia community by laws set rules for water distribution and allocation infrastructure maintenance canals cleaning fee collection settling disputes among beneficiaries and monetary sanctions for by law violating members sakketa 2018 yami 2013 in some irrigation schemes the water use right of individuals is dependent on owning irrigation land near to the irrigation scheme sakketa 2018 and membership of cooperatives is restricted to landholders in such small scale irrigation schemes landless sharecroppers participation in wua committee positions is highly restricted oates et al 2020 in ethiopia irrigation users financial capacity is weak to cover the operation and maintenance costs of irrigation infrastructure amede 2015 in some irrigation schemes establishment of wuas setting by laws and members responsibilities are done by external actors neglecting members participation and need gurmu et al 2019 mulugeta 2019 yami 2016 external actors transferred the management of irrigation schemes to wuas committees without insuring the managerial and financial capabilities of those committees to operate manage and maintain irrigation schemes yami 2013 local institutions not initiated and formed by irrigation users follow a top down approach amede 2015 habtu and yoshinobu 2006 yami 2013 and lack legitimacy community acceptance and their by laws are not well customized to fit local conditions eguavoen et al 2012 in such irrigation schemes the wua leadership lacks basic knowledge skills and experiences in operating and managing irrigation schemes resulting in poor operation and maintenance strategies though decisions about crops and irrigation technology at farm level are made by individual users decisions on scheme irrigation water management vary across irrigation schemes in ethiopia individual users butterworth et al 2013 dessalegn and merrey 2015 gowing et al 2020 community elected water fathers abera et al 2019 castelli et al 2018 habtu and yoshinobu 2006 wuas adela et al 2019 derib et al 2011 froebrich et al 2020 habtu and yoshinobu 2006 and pous mulugeta 2019 are the decision making actors on management and operation of community irrigation schemes in ethiopia table 5 in some irrigation schemes operation and maintenance decisions are made by more than one of the decision making actors without clear boundary and management roles amede 2015 mulugeta 2019 interference of local political leaders and experts during the decision making process also make farmers reluctant to share their opinion freely abera et al 2019 table 5 shows the management decision making process and experienced problems of seven small scale irrigation schemes taking their water from different sources in summary more funds and attention are devoted to the development of physical infrastructures than social and institutional aspects with an assumption that farmers will operate and manage the infrastructure amede 2015 deneke et al 2011 tilahun et al 2011 the low attention given to the institutional and social infrastructure in irrigation development results in collapse of irrigation schemes and waste of financial resources invested for irrigation infrastructural development aberra 2004 and the built neglect rebuild paradigm suhardiman and giordano 2014 is common in many community managed irrigation schemes 3 4 2 problems and challenges in small scale irrigation management in ethiopia community managed small scale irrigation systems are facing multiple problems and are poorly performing in terms of livelihood improvement cost recovery and scheme sustainability abera et al 2019 amede 2015 awulachew and ayana 2011 table 6 shows the summary of common problems on small scale irrigation schemes across their development and management phases poor scheme management practices abera et al 2019 aberra 2004 adela et al 2019 asres 2016 awulachew and ayana 2011 derib et al 2011 jovanovic et al 2018 tewabe and dessie 2020

scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia due to these problems many community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia are irrigating below half of their design potential leaving more than half of the expected users out of irrigation amede 2015 awulachew and ayana 2011 small scale irrigation schemes also face common problems with regards to their different water sources which affects their performance and sustainability over application of irrigation water beyond crop demands is a common problem in irrigation schemes whose source of water is from reservoirs diversion headworks lakes and groundwater adela et al 2019 afessa and yosef 2019 asres 2016 woldearegay and van 2015 unequitable irrigation water distribution among users is a problem of irrigation schemes from reservoirs diversion headworks and spate irrigation systems upstream catchment erosion reservoir sedimentation and salinization are common problems of irrigation schemes from natural lakes and built dam reservoirs over irrigation beyond crop demands is common even for pump irrigated schemes that requires extra cost for fuel and or electricity in some irrigation schemes water distribution among beneficiaries is under pressure by illegal water pumping from water sources and distribution systems amede 2015 dessalegn and merrey 2015 though there are technical supports and extension services from governmental and non governmental organizations during irrigation operation and maintenance their interventions are not tailored to local contexts abera et al 2019 eguavoen et al 2012 embaye et al 2020 froebrich et al 2020 oates et al 2020 3 5 towards sustainable irrigation management in ethiopia sustainable irrigation development is increasingly acknowledged to promote the conservation of land and water resources towards satisfying human needs of the present generations without compromising the needs of future generations cai et al 2003 tiewtoy et al 2011 addressing the sustainability issues in irrigated farming is regarded as a prerequisite for long term profitability of farming systems dantsis et al 2010 the sustainability of irrigation development depends on its extent on addressing the institutional economic social and environmental aspects integrated with appropriate technologies antunes et al 2017 dantsis et al 2010 mutyasira et al 2018 pires et al 2017 shady 1991 according to harmancioglu et al 2013 the economic social institutional and environmental issues are considered as the pillars of sustainable water resources management the sustainability of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia is reviewed considering the institutional economic social and environmental issues 3 5 1 institutional sustainability most irrigation managing institutions in ethiopia are challenged by multiple problems such as inferior institutional set ups limited financial capacity low managerial skill unclear physical boundary and managerial roles such problems remain unsolved even after modernization of traditional small scale irrigation schemes muchara and mbatha 2016 categorized institutional problems of smallholder irrigation schemes into two firstly the top down approach that ignores those institutions from participating during project design and implementation phases secondly institutions with limited internal capacity and that failed to cope with the dynamic nature of challenges and opportunities in irrigation schemes both institutional problems are common in community managed irrigation schemes in ethiopia if such local institutions are to be sustained and dynamic in their management they must evolve from the community and not to be imposed externally vincent 1994 indigenous irrigation management systems and traditional local institutions made smallholder irrigation schemes sustainable and functional for centuries in asia mutambara et al 2016 indigenous irrigation schemes were also sustained for a longer time in east africa adams and watson 2003 hence to address the institutional sustainability concerns of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia there is a need to revisit the challenges related to members participation establishment of wua their structural set up skills and capacity accountability and transparency inclusion of indigenous community knowledge and limited experience with irrigation project development and management phases are also remarkable issues in ethiopia implementation of irrigation management transfer and participatory irrigation management practices to manage irrigation infrastructure by local communities or wua is becoming a popular trend for community irrigation management in many developing countries cambaza et al 2020 technical support and extension services provided from government and non government organizations should be tailored to the local contexts of scheme managing local institutions 3 5 2 economic sustainability in ethiopia small scale irrigation schemes are benefiting the poor in ensuring food security through diversified cropping patterns switching to high value crop production and lowering the risk of crop failure ahmed and haji 2014 bacha et al 2011 development of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia is capable of improving water and land productivity and thereby enhancing food security and poverty reduction of smallholder households hagos et al 2017 mengistie and kidane 2016 tesfaye and bogale 2008 zewdie et al 2019 the average annual income of irrigation user households is more than 50 higher as compared to non irrigation user households gebregziabher et al 2009 makombe et al 2007 irrigation user households have improved their farm income about 5500 us per ha which is more than 40 higher compared to non irrigation users adela et al 2019 in some irrigation schemes users annual average income is three to eight folds higher as compared to non irrigation users when irrigation is combined with innovative water management practices jovanovic et al 2020 zewdie et al 2019 in addition to its direct effects small scale irrigation improves the crop revenue of rainfed season through the receptivity of farmers to use yield enhancing modern farm inputs zewdie et al 2019 in spite of small scale irrigation contribution in ensuring food security technology adoption of many smallholder farmers is seen to be hampered by lack of access to credit and financial services bacha et al 2011 nakawuka et al 2018 wakeyo and gardebroek 2015 the adoption of appropriate water management technologies is constrained by higher investment costs lack of financial services and poor market integrations lefore et al 2019 the investment cost of irrigation schemes in ethiopia varies based on the type of irrigation water source the investment cost of irrigation schemes from groundwater boreholes ranges from 3900 to 6250 us per ha embaye et al 2020 gebregziabher et al 2009 for irrigation schemes from river diversions the investment cost ranges from 3000 to 3150 us per ha embaye et al 2020 gebregziabher et al 2013 in the 2010 s the construction cost of dam based reservoir irrigation was about 6750 us per ha gebregziabher et al 2013 but recent reports embaye et al 2020 yigzaw et al 2019b indicate that construction cost has increased to a range of 12500 18100 us per ha regardless of the national water sector policy partial investment cost recovery and irrigation water pricing systems had not been implemented yet in ethiopia the implementation of investment cost recovery system is beyond the financial capacity of smallholder farmers due to the high investment cost butterworth et al 2013 hagos and mamo 2014 lefore et al 2019 yigzaw et al 2019a and additional costs resulting from over delay of project construction annys et al 2020a implementation of operation and maintenance cost recovery supported with research and extension services is expected to be a possible solution to financial problems of local institutions and or wuas allowing such institutions to operate business entities related to irrigated farming is also an alternative option to solve their financial limitations 3 5 3 social sustainability women are underrepresented in irrigation managing institutions irrigation development and management decisions in ethiopia imburgia 2019 yami 2013 their participation is highly constrained by multiple technical social and cultural problems and they are forced to provide their farm land to sharecroppers to get less than half of the harvested product eguavoen et al 2012 sisay 2018 yohannes et al 2017 this is mainly due to cultural issues time consuming household tasks and deteriorated irrigation infrastructure that need more time to operate and maintain imburgia 2019 lefore et al 2019 sisay 2018 theis et al 2018 because of these and other economic related problems women are less likely to adopt appropriate technologies as compared to men gebremariam et al 2019 theis et al 2018 low community participation during development and operation of irrigation schemes has resulted in a low sense of project ownership a low knowledge base for design and site selection and community knowledge being ignored aberra 2004 castelli et al 2018 dolinska et al 2020 embaye et al 2020 without farmer participation during the early stages of irrigation project modernization the site selection for headwork structures may go wrong and result in exclusion of former traditional irrigation scheme users wegerich et al 2008 inequitable water distribution among users at different locations e g upstream versus downstream upstream versus midlevel is common in many small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia teshome et al 2018 tola and haile 2020 van steenbergen et al 2011 yami 2016 promoting users participation in all phases of irrigation development and providing enabling conditions and environment for individual irrigation users to realize their capacity and needs are among the possible options for solving sustainability issues in irrigation management users participation during development operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes helps to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility needed for sustainability of schemes 3 5 4 environmental sustainability in ethiopia severe problems related to waterlogging and salinization leads to substantial yield reduction and loss of cultivable land gebrehiwot 2018 habtu et al 2020 salinization of irrigation schemes is an ever increasing problem in the ethiopian rift valley awulachew and ayana 2011 ayenew 2007 zeweld et al 2015 this is due to the utilization of saline lakes for irrigation ayenew 2007 poor irrigation management practices abera et al 2019 awulachew and ayana 2011 lack of proper drainage facilities gebremeskel et al 2018b and groundwater rise due to over irrigation beyene et al 2019 according to oates et al 2020 yohannes et al 2017 and abera et al 2019 salinization is also among the main problems that constrain the yield production of community managed irrigation schemes located outside of the rift valley basin after assessing the salinity level of nine irrigation schemes in tigray region gebremeskel et al 2018b reported that more than 60 of community managed small scale irrigation schemes are affected by salinity problems combined effects of salinity and waterlogging problems are becoming the main reasons for large potential areas to be left out of irrigation in ethiopia over exploitation of irrigation water from natural lakes also adversely affects the ecological stability of these lakes by changing the lake level ayenew 2007 degrading wetland areas mequanent and mingist 2019 and polluting the lakes afessa and yosef 2019 implementation of proper irrigation water management operation and maintenance and proper management of drainage infrastructures could lower the environmental problems of small scale irrigation schemes fig 3 summarizes the multi dimensional challenges of small scale irrigation systems in ethiopia generally poor operation and maintenance practices are common problems in many irrigation schemes this is a combined result of problems that arise from institutional technical and socio economic aspects these poor operation and maintenance practices result in environmental effects of salinization and waterlogging this in turn risks the sustainability of community managed irrigation schemes in addition to the above mentioned sustainability and operational challenges irrigation shemes in tigray regional state are facing multidimensional problems due to the current war many irrigation schemes in the region are severely affected by infrastructural damage lack of man power stolen pumps stolen and annihilated farm tools abandonment of farm lands due to farmers insecurity lack of required farm inputs such as improved seeds fertilizers and pesticides freezing of farmers money in banks and micro finances as a result of the ongoing war demissie et al 2022 nyssen et al 2022 after comparing the areal coverage of 14 irrigation schemes before the war average of 2019 and 2020 and after the war 2021 using remote sensing data nyssen et al 2022 reported that the irrigated area of surveyed schemes was reduced by 31 as a result of the war in tigray excluding large scale plantation farms and tekeze river side irrigation schemes smallscale irrigation schemes are more resilient to the extent of the extreme shock of the tigray war by shifting from planting cash crops to cereals with minimum land management practices demissie et al 2022 nyssen et al 2022 4 conclusion in ethiopia small scale irrigation schemes development is expected to improve agricultural productivity and ensure food security of smallholder households water harvesting development for small scale irrigation schemes is among the priority aspects of the national water sector policy irrigation users annual average income could be improved up to eight folds as compared to non irrigation users income when proper water management practices are implemented irrigation user households also have a financial capacity to adopt yield enhancing farm inputs and improve their crop production of the rainfed season regardless of their benefits many of the developed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia are performing below their expectations leaving considerable users and land areas out of irrigation multiple problems related to technical institutional economic social and environmental aspects during implementation and or operation of these irrigation schemes are the reasons for low performance irrigation development and management practices in ethiopia lacks a holistic strategy that integrates technical socio economic and environmental aspects the low attention given to the social and institutional aspects during scheme development and management is the main cause for the low performance of irrigation practices sustainability of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia is challenged by these multiple problems in addition to these problems many irrigation schemes in tigray region are facing multidimensional operational and sustainability challenges due to the ongoing war in tigray consideration to indigenous community knowledge and experience during development rehabilitation and management is essential for sustainability of irrigation schemes supporting the irrigation sector via research based findings and adoption of

9269,in spite of the investment and efforts made for irrigation development many irrigation schemes in ethiopia are performing below design expectations leaving huge areas and many beneficiaries out of irrigation in this study a systematic literature review was conducted on management practices problems and future directions of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia out of 1282 published research reports retrieved from the data bases of web of science and scopus eventually 83 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria failure and under performance of irrigation schemes in ethiopia is reported to mostly relate to problems during design and implementation and or operation and maintenance low level of community participation lack of site specific reliable hydrological data poorly designed irrigation infrastructures high construction cost and delayed project completion are most mentioned problems during the design and implementation phases of irrigation projects presence of weak local scheme managing institutions and users exclusion in management decisions are among the main problems of small scale irrigation management practices in ethiopia regardless of their water sources irrigation schemes face similar problems in ethiopia adoption of a holistic development and management strategy that integrates technical socio economic and environmental aspects is needed to overcome problems and sustainability challenges of community managed irrigation schemes in ethiopia supporting the irrigation sector via research based findings and adoption of advanced technologies needs further investments and efforts to narrow challenges of irrigation schemes sustainability gaps keywords irrigation community managed irrigation technology sustainability ethiopia data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction farming practices in sub saharan africa ssa mainly focus on staple crop production for food consumption of the rural poor they are highly rainfed dependent and characterized by low yields and subject to climate driven fluctuations burney and naylor 2012 various factors including rainfall variability land degradation and low levels of soil fertility are among the production constraints in the region worqlul et al 2019 small scale irrigation is a priority development in ssa to increase agricultural production ensure food security and reduce poverty levels of rural smallholders bjornlund et al 2020 sakaki and koga 2013 small scale irrigation development is also seen as an effective way to mitigate climate change effects amede 2015 balana et al 2020 and provides significant employment to the rural community de bont et al 2019 woodhouse et al 2017 ethiopia is the second most populated nation in ssa its smallholder rainfed based farming system would not be able to fill the food requirements of the country due to spatial and temporal rainfall variability land degradation fertility depletion and climate change effects zerssa et al 2021 soil moisture stress due to longer dry spells shorter rainy seasons and sometimes a total lack of rain are among the main reasons of crop failure in rainfed ethiopian farming practices araya and stroosnijder 2011 different water harvesting structures have been built for irrigation purposes and to reduce the adverse effects of soil moisture stress across different parts of ethiopia embaye et al 2020 haregeweyn et al 2006 irrigation development in ethiopia is embraced as a possible solution to maximize agricultural production to satisfy the food demands of the ever increasing population and improve the income of smallholder farmers to achieve these objectives multiple irrigation projects have been developed throughout the country ranging from few hectares to tens of thousands of hectares the ethiopian government is investing in the development of small scale community irrigation schemes with the aim to reduce food insecurity fdre 2001a zewdie et al 2020 zeweld et al 2015 poverty reduction and livelihood improvement bacha et al 2011 hanjra et al 2009 mengistie and kidane 2016 tesfaye and bogale 2008 and improve the nutritional level hagos et al 2017 passarelli et al 2018 of the rural community several studies however show that many of the developed irrigation projects in ssa are performing below their design expectations and are depleted before their design lifetime due to complex problems of technical socio economic institutional and environmental aspects berhane et al 2016a embaye et al 2020 haregeweyn et al 2006 lack of access to financial capital limited market availability and extension services technical failure of physical infrastructures failure of managing organizations low level of technology adoption and declining water availability and quality are among the problems constraining community irrigation schemes in ssa bjornlund et al 2020 burney and

mtethiwa et al 2016 reported that the performance of small scale irrigation schemes is not addressed at national or basin level but at the outset of projects furthermore small scale irrigation schemes in ssa face critical water management challenges and are proved to be highly unsustainable mutambara et al 2016 the current status and performance of small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia is not different from those in other ssa countries small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia are performing below design expectations leaving huge areas out of irrigation amede 2015 reported that many irrigation schemes are not operating to their design capacity due to design failure poor water and agronomic management practices weak local institutions and excessive siltation problems research findings from awulachew and ayana 2011 also indicated that less than 50 of the expected irrigation users have benefitted from irrigation schemes developed watershed degradation lack of sustainable funding for operation and maintenance failure of hydraulic structures and poor extension services are among the main reasons for under performance of irrigation schemes in ethiopia awulachew and ayana 2011 recent research results e g abera et al 2019 annys et al 2020a gurmu et al 2019 habtu et al 2020 indicate the poor performance of small scale irrigation schemes in different parts of ethiopia even though various studies have indicated the problems and causes there is no study that addresses the management practices of small scale irrigation schemes at national level in ethiopia the objective of this review paper is therefore to address the management challenges and problems of small scale irrigation schemes and future sustainability directions for improvement in ethiopia a systematic literature review slr was conducted on management practices problems and future directions of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia this review is the first of its kind in addressing these issues at national level in ethiopia from which we hope to draw lessons and future directions for policy makers and practitioners 2 research methods this study was conducted using a slr of small scale irrigation management practices in ethiopia the slr is a reliable and less biased review type that can lead to evidence based conclusions as compared to the conventional review methods koutsos et al 2019 slr identify and retrieve relevant evidences to a particular research question or questions to appraise and synthesize results of previous research works and identify practices and gaps produce decision making guidance and areas for future studies liberati et al 2009 munn et al 2018 a slr method called prisma preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta analysis mardani et al 2019 moher et al 2009 was used in this research the prisma method includes data resources inclusion and exclusion criteria steps of the review process data abstraction and analysis interpretation and presentation processes koutsos et al 2019 the prisma method consists of three steps searching for literature section 2 1 determining articles eligibility section 2 2 and extraction of data and summarizing section 2 3 2 1 information sources and search strategy primary sources of information for this review were electronic journal databases of web of science and scopus a fixed set of inclusion criteria was used articles published in english limited to journal articles in all years available in the databases the search of articles was undertaken between may and october 2020 a literature search using the terms irrigation and ethiopia table 1 resulted in a total of 1282 articles out of which 559 were from web of science and 723 were from scopus all bibliographical details were imported into mendeley reference manager https www mendeley com to manage the references and eliminate duplications after removal of duplicated articles data papers and conference proceedings 818 articles remained for further screening article screening was done by reading titles and abstracts relevant to this study and irrelevant articles were removed resulting in 338 potentially relevant articles fig 1 illustrates this selection process 2 2 selection and eligibility criteria in the selection and eligibility criteria phase selected articles were evaluated based on the scope of the research work this phase includes defining inclusion and exclusion criteria assessment of articles based on their evidence strength minimizing bias that may exist and reading selected articles in depth koutsos et al 2019 table 2 shows the predefined inclusion and exclusion set of criteria applied in this study information sources such as conference papers report papers working papers technical papers and articles not related with irrigation management were excluded articles from plot based experimental research were also excluded due to their limitations in addressing the entire irrigation system management the management systems of state owned irrigation farms depend on the government institutions bureaucratic procedures and community participation in such schemes is negligible hence research reports and book chapters on state owned irrigation schemes were excluded 97 peer reviewed articles and book chapters were found as potential articles with a main focus on irrigation management in ethiopia but 14 articles were excluded as they were about estate irrigation management practices finally 83 peer reviewed research articles and book chapters appendix a focusing on small scale irrigation management in ethiopia were included in this slr for data synthesis and analysis koga a large scale community irrigation was also included in this review the koga irrigation scheme is managed by both the community and a project operation unit pou having their boundaries in the scheme the smallholder community members manage tertiary quaternary and field water distribution systems while the pou is responsible to manage and operate the reservoir primary and secondary distribution systems 2 3 data extraction and summarizing data and information collected from finally selected articles was inventoried in ms excel spread sheet each article of the final selection was categorized based on its research focus spatial scale irrigation typology water sources source of energy research findings irrigation management systems and identified problems data and information were extracted by reading the abstract followed by in depth reading of the selected articles full content the spatial scale was categorized as national regional district basin watershed or scheme based on the spatial coverage of the research done the irrigation typology was categorized as large scale medium scale and small scale based on the ethiopian irrigation typology classification surface water sources such as river lake reservoir and flash flood and ground water sources of wells and springs were mentioned as the water sources for irrigation the sources of energy for water abstraction were categorized as gravity pump or a combination of both year of irrigation scheme commencement available irrigation scheme infrastructure number of beneficiaries and stakeholders in scheme management were also extracted when available in the literature 3 results and discussion 3 1 general characteristics of selected articles the 83 articles which were identified and included were published between 2004 and 2020 more than 60 of these articles were published in the last five years 2015 2020 this could indicate the level of attention given to small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia in recent studies more than 100 community irrigation schemes are described in the selected articles these schemes are distributed at different parts of ethiopia fig 2 according to scale based irrigation classification in ethiopia nakawuka et al 2018 all identified and analyzed studies were about small scale irrigation development and management surface water resources from embankment based reservoirs 30 are the main water sources for the selected irrigation schemes followed by flowing rivers streams lakes and springs 20 ground water sources from shallow wells 12 and flash floods 11 the water sources for the remaining 27 of selected irrigation schemes is either from different sources or was not mentioned flash flood is commonly utilized as a source of irrigation water supply for spate irrigation systems in semi arid low lands of ethiopia castelli et al 2018 chukalla et al 2013 embaye et al 2012 tola and haile 2020 van steenbergen et al 2011 gravity flow irrigation is dominant about 57 within the irrigation schemes described in the selected literature pumping systems ranging from manually operated treadle pumps to diesel pump 12 were the energy sources for groundwater and lake based irrigation schemes in about 8 of research reports both gravity flow and pumping system were mentioned 3 2 irrigation potential and classification systems in ethiopia ethiopia has twelve river basins with an annual flow of 124 5 billion m3 estimated groundwater potential of 6 5 billion m3 awulachew and ayana 2011 and an estimated irrigation potential that varies from 3 5 to 11 million hectares the national irrigation potential area is not precisely known or documented in scientific research reports most authors mentioned that the irrigation potential of ethiopia is in the range of 3 7 5 3 million hectares e g bacha et al 2011 belay and bewket 2013 derib et al 2011 hagos et al 2016 makombe et al 2007 sakketa 2018 tesfaye and bogale 2008 teshome et al 2018 but according to schmitter et al 2018 the ethiopian agricultural transformation agency ata estimated that about 11 million hectares of land would be suitable for irrigation of which 48 could be irrigated using groundwater resources irrigation potential does not only involve the available land area and water but also includes other biophysical socio economic factors and people s interest to engage in irrigation activities beekman et al 2014 biophysical and socioeconomic factors such as topographic hydrologic agronomic and economic issues should be considered during the irrigation potential assessment you et al 2011 hence this variation of the estimated national irrigation potential could be related to the recent governments commitment to invest in the irrigation sector financial factor the introduction of pressurized irrigation systems topographic factor development of multi purpose large reservoirs water resource availability annys et al 2020b and groundwater resource development for irrigation utilization classification of irrigation schemes under different categories such as traditional or modern and small or large scale is not clearly defined and remains debatable in many countries in tanzania irrigation classification as modern or traditional is a contentious policy issue related to the involvement of external agencies in project initiation and operation de bont et al 2019 schemes that are referred to as traditional are initiated and operated by farmers without the involvement of external authority while formally planned and designed schemes by the government are referred to as modern beekman et al 2014 de bont and veldwisch 2020 classifying irrigation schemes as small or large scale considering the area coverage is not enough nakawuka et al 2018 it needs considering the land holding size of individual farmers and its management system irrigation schemes are classified as small scale when both technology and water sources are self supplied by individuals or small groups of farmers and individuals are the decision makers on technology used crops cultivated and sale of the products xie et al 2021 accordingly an irrigation scheme with a large command area might be classified as small scale when it is composed of farmers who manage individual plots of less than 2 ha and is then also referred to as smallholder irrigation scheme in ethiopia irrigation schemes are classified based on their size of command area technology used and the management system in the irrigation scheme awulachew and ayana 2011 table 3 shows the classification of irrigation systems in ethiopia based on different classification criteria 3 3 irrigation development and challenges in ethiopia irrigation development is considered as an important cornerstone to improve agricultural productivity in many african countries you et al 2011 the same is expected from irrigation development in ethiopia in ethiopia irrigation development is a key option to achieve rapid inclusive and sustainable rural development annys et al 2020a currently significant focus is given to the development of small scale irrigation schemes to overcome food insecurity and rural poverty abera et al 2019 oates et al 2020 sakketa 2018 yami 2013 in the 2005 06 agricultural season about 625 000 ha of land in ethiopia was equipped with irrigation systems amede 2015 mowie 2020 reported that the national irrigation coverage in ethiopia increased from 160 000 ha in 2010 to 490 000 ha in 2015 reports on current status of irrigation development are different and conflicting to each other this discrepancy in estimations shows that the national irrigation potential coverage and status of the currently promoted small scale irrigation schemes development is not well assessed updated and documented by formal research studies in ethiopia 3 3 1 policy issues on irrigation development and management in ethiopia irrigation development and management aspects are described in the ethiopian water sector policy fdre 2001a and the ethiopian water sector strategy fdre 2001b supported with proclamations regulations and development programs irrigation development and adoption of water harvesting technologies are considered as a priority policy points to overcome agricultural productivity risks and thus for the overall economic development of the country the main objective of irrigation development is to expand irrigated agriculture to its possible potential for the production of food crops and raw materials for agro industries without degrading the fertility of irrigated fields and water resources bases fdre 2001a in the water sector policy participation of all stakeholders and gender mainstreaming is stated as a mandatory approach during all water resources projects study implementation and operation phases both national water sector policy and water sector strategy try to address technical environmental socio economic and management aspects of irrigation projects appendix b development of multipurpose and efficient irrigation projects with appropriate technologies supported by research and extension services is the main target of the irrigation sub sector policy in the policy implementation of stepwise cost recovery systems to cover operation and maintenance costs of small scale irrigation schemes is considered as a solution to ensure scheme financial self reliance the water sector policy promotes user based decentralization of irrigation management practices 3 3 2 irrigation development challenges in ethiopia in spite of the governments commitment and effort in investing for irrigation development farmer managed irrigation schemes have performed below their design expectations in ethiopia amede 2015 awulachew and ayana 2011 oates et al 2020 the failure and under performance of irrigation schemes in ethiopia is mostly related to either problems during design and implementation and or operation and maintenance low level of community participation during project study and design phases aberra 2004 amede 2015 wegerich et al 2008 yami 2013 lack of site specific reliable hydrological data embaye et al 2020 hagos and mamo 2014 negash et al 2020 poorly designed infrastructures aberra 2004 amede 2015

mulugeta 2019 are among the major problems during the design and implementation phases of irrigation projects a top down approach that excludes local experiences and community needs is commonly practiced during irrigation development due to this approach community participation is highly limited during project initiation and implementation phases aberra 2004 annys et al 2020a bekele and tilahun 2006 wegerich et al 2008 in practicing irrigation development gender mainstreaming and participation is often ignored imburgia 2019 lefore et al 2019 theis et al 2018 yami 2013 3 4 irrigation management practices in ethiopia 3 4 1 institutions for irrigation management in ethiopia irrigation water management is a complex process with heterogeneous interests of multiple stakeholders with shared water resources that can lead to conflicts among irrigators at different locations with different needs e g upstream versus downstream users of different crops pump users versus canal users amede 2015 appropriate organizations are needed to manage operate and maintain the irrigation system and closely address the issues of equitable water distribution and efficient water use haileslassie et al 2016 institutional setups are either unavailable or weak in operation in most community small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia eguavoen et al 2012 mulugeta 2019 van halsema et al 2011 water user associations wuas are considered as important links between external actors and the local community in small scale irrigation schemes yami 2013 wuas are registered as cooperatives in most schemes amede 2015 mulugeta 2019 oates et al 2020 tola and haile 2020 yami 2013 with expectations to abide by the rules and regulations of cooperatives agency table 4 community cooperatives assist their members in accessing farm inputs and markets for their farm products much more than in irrigation management related tasks experiences in managing traditional small scale irrigation schemes with community by laws enforced by locally elected water distributors contribute to the existence of centuries old traditional irrigation schemes adela et al 2019 habtu and yoshinobu 2006 while many newly developed small scale irrigation schemes in the same area failed due to low community participation non transparent communication and the top down approach in setting by laws for wuas annys et al 2020a yami 2013 weak functioning of the wua leads to ineffective irrigation system control inadequate monitoring and poor community by law enforcement amede 2015 nakawuka et al 2018 in most small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia community by laws set rules for water distribution and allocation infrastructure maintenance canals cleaning fee collection settling disputes among beneficiaries and monetary sanctions for by law violating members sakketa 2018 yami 2013 in some irrigation schemes the water use right of individuals is dependent on owning irrigation land near to the irrigation scheme sakketa 2018 and membership of cooperatives is restricted to landholders in such small scale irrigation schemes landless sharecroppers participation in wua committee positions is highly restricted oates et al 2020 in ethiopia irrigation users financial capacity is weak to cover the operation and maintenance costs of irrigation infrastructure amede 2015 in some irrigation schemes establishment of wuas setting by laws and members responsibilities are done by external actors neglecting members participation and need gurmu et al 2019 mulugeta 2019 yami 2016 external actors transferred the management of irrigation schemes to wuas committees without insuring the managerial and financial capabilities of those committees to operate manage and maintain irrigation schemes yami 2013 local institutions not initiated and formed by irrigation users follow a top down approach amede 2015 habtu and yoshinobu 2006 yami 2013 and lack legitimacy community acceptance and their by laws are not well customized to fit local conditions eguavoen et al 2012 in such irrigation schemes the wua leadership lacks basic knowledge skills and experiences in operating and managing irrigation schemes resulting in poor operation and maintenance strategies though decisions about crops and irrigation technology at farm level are made by individual users decisions on scheme irrigation water management vary across irrigation schemes in ethiopia individual users butterworth et al 2013 dessalegn and merrey 2015 gowing et al 2020 community elected water fathers abera et al 2019 castelli et al 2018 habtu and yoshinobu 2006 wuas adela et al 2019 derib et al 2011 froebrich et al 2020 habtu and yoshinobu 2006 and pous mulugeta 2019 are the decision making actors on management and operation of community irrigation schemes in ethiopia table 5 in some irrigation schemes operation and maintenance decisions are made by more than one of the decision making actors without clear boundary and management roles amede 2015 mulugeta 2019 interference of local political leaders and experts during the decision making process also make farmers reluctant to share their opinion freely abera et al 2019 table 5 shows the management decision making process and experienced problems of seven small scale irrigation schemes taking their water from different sources in summary more funds and attention are devoted to the development of physical infrastructures than social and institutional aspects with an assumption that farmers will operate and manage the infrastructure amede 2015 deneke et al 2011 tilahun et al 2011 the low attention given to the institutional and social infrastructure in irrigation development results in collapse of irrigation schemes and waste of financial resources invested for irrigation infrastructural development aberra 2004 and the built neglect rebuild paradigm suhardiman and giordano 2014 is common in many community managed irrigation schemes 3 4 2 problems and challenges in small scale irrigation management in ethiopia community managed small scale irrigation systems are facing multiple problems and are poorly performing in terms of livelihood improvement cost recovery and scheme sustainability abera et al 2019 amede 2015 awulachew and ayana 2011 table 6 shows the summary of common problems on small scale irrigation schemes across their development and management phases poor scheme management practices abera et al 2019 aberra 2004 adela et al 2019 asres 2016 awulachew and ayana 2011 derib et al 2011 jovanovic et al 2018 tewabe and dessie 2020

scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia due to these problems many community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia are irrigating below half of their design potential leaving more than half of the expected users out of irrigation amede 2015 awulachew and ayana 2011 small scale irrigation schemes also face common problems with regards to their different water sources which affects their performance and sustainability over application of irrigation water beyond crop demands is a common problem in irrigation schemes whose source of water is from reservoirs diversion headworks lakes and groundwater adela et al 2019 afessa and yosef 2019 asres 2016 woldearegay and van 2015 unequitable irrigation water distribution among users is a problem of irrigation schemes from reservoirs diversion headworks and spate irrigation systems upstream catchment erosion reservoir sedimentation and salinization are common problems of irrigation schemes from natural lakes and built dam reservoirs over irrigation beyond crop demands is common even for pump irrigated schemes that requires extra cost for fuel and or electricity in some irrigation schemes water distribution among beneficiaries is under pressure by illegal water pumping from water sources and distribution systems amede 2015 dessalegn and merrey 2015 though there are technical supports and extension services from governmental and non governmental organizations during irrigation operation and maintenance their interventions are not tailored to local contexts abera et al 2019 eguavoen et al 2012 embaye et al 2020 froebrich et al 2020 oates et al 2020 3 5 towards sustainable irrigation management in ethiopia sustainable irrigation development is increasingly acknowledged to promote the conservation of land and water resources towards satisfying human needs of the present generations without compromising the needs of future generations cai et al 2003 tiewtoy et al 2011 addressing the sustainability issues in irrigated farming is regarded as a prerequisite for long term profitability of farming systems dantsis et al 2010 the sustainability of irrigation development depends on its extent on addressing the institutional economic social and environmental aspects integrated with appropriate technologies antunes et al 2017 dantsis et al 2010 mutyasira et al 2018 pires et al 2017 shady 1991 according to harmancioglu et al 2013 the economic social institutional and environmental issues are considered as the pillars of sustainable water resources management the sustainability of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia is reviewed considering the institutional economic social and environmental issues 3 5 1 institutional sustainability most irrigation managing institutions in ethiopia are challenged by multiple problems such as inferior institutional set ups limited financial capacity low managerial skill unclear physical boundary and managerial roles such problems remain unsolved even after modernization of traditional small scale irrigation schemes muchara and mbatha 2016 categorized institutional problems of smallholder irrigation schemes into two firstly the top down approach that ignores those institutions from participating during project design and implementation phases secondly institutions with limited internal capacity and that failed to cope with the dynamic nature of challenges and opportunities in irrigation schemes both institutional problems are common in community managed irrigation schemes in ethiopia if such local institutions are to be sustained and dynamic in their management they must evolve from the community and not to be imposed externally vincent 1994 indigenous irrigation management systems and traditional local institutions made smallholder irrigation schemes sustainable and functional for centuries in asia mutambara et al 2016 indigenous irrigation schemes were also sustained for a longer time in east africa adams and watson 2003 hence to address the institutional sustainability concerns of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia there is a need to revisit the challenges related to members participation establishment of wua their structural set up skills and capacity accountability and transparency inclusion of indigenous community knowledge and limited experience with irrigation project development and management phases are also remarkable issues in ethiopia implementation of irrigation management transfer and participatory irrigation management practices to manage irrigation infrastructure by local communities or wua is becoming a popular trend for community irrigation management in many developing countries cambaza et al 2020 technical support and extension services provided from government and non government organizations should be tailored to the local contexts of scheme managing local institutions 3 5 2 economic sustainability in ethiopia small scale irrigation schemes are benefiting the poor in ensuring food security through diversified cropping patterns switching to high value crop production and lowering the risk of crop failure ahmed and haji 2014 bacha et al 2011 development of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia is capable of improving water and land productivity and thereby enhancing food security and poverty reduction of smallholder households hagos et al 2017 mengistie and kidane 2016 tesfaye and bogale 2008 zewdie et al 2019 the average annual income of irrigation user households is more than 50 higher as compared to non irrigation user households gebregziabher et al 2009 makombe et al 2007 irrigation user households have improved their farm income about 5500 us per ha which is more than 40 higher compared to non irrigation users adela et al 2019 in some irrigation schemes users annual average income is three to eight folds higher as compared to non irrigation users when irrigation is combined with innovative water management practices jovanovic et al 2020 zewdie et al 2019 in addition to its direct effects small scale irrigation improves the crop revenue of rainfed season through the receptivity of farmers to use yield enhancing modern farm inputs zewdie et al 2019 in spite of small scale irrigation contribution in ensuring food security technology adoption of many smallholder farmers is seen to be hampered by lack of access to credit and financial services bacha et al 2011 nakawuka et al 2018 wakeyo and gardebroek 2015 the adoption of appropriate water management technologies is constrained by higher investment costs lack of financial services and poor market integrations lefore et al 2019 the investment cost of irrigation schemes in ethiopia varies based on the type of irrigation water source the investment cost of irrigation schemes from groundwater boreholes ranges from 3900 to 6250 us per ha embaye et al 2020 gebregziabher et al 2009 for irrigation schemes from river diversions the investment cost ranges from 3000 to 3150 us per ha embaye et al 2020 gebregziabher et al 2013 in the 2010 s the construction cost of dam based reservoir irrigation was about 6750 us per ha gebregziabher et al 2013 but recent reports embaye et al 2020 yigzaw et al 2019b indicate that construction cost has increased to a range of 12500 18100 us per ha regardless of the national water sector policy partial investment cost recovery and irrigation water pricing systems had not been implemented yet in ethiopia the implementation of investment cost recovery system is beyond the financial capacity of smallholder farmers due to the high investment cost butterworth et al 2013 hagos and mamo 2014 lefore et al 2019 yigzaw et al 2019a and additional costs resulting from over delay of project construction annys et al 2020a implementation of operation and maintenance cost recovery supported with research and extension services is expected to be a possible solution to financial problems of local institutions and or wuas allowing such institutions to operate business entities related to irrigated farming is also an alternative option to solve their financial limitations 3 5 3 social sustainability women are underrepresented in irrigation managing institutions irrigation development and management decisions in ethiopia imburgia 2019 yami 2013 their participation is highly constrained by multiple technical social and cultural problems and they are forced to provide their farm land to sharecroppers to get less than half of the harvested product eguavoen et al 2012 sisay 2018 yohannes et al 2017 this is mainly due to cultural issues time consuming household tasks and deteriorated irrigation infrastructure that need more time to operate and maintain imburgia 2019 lefore et al 2019 sisay 2018 theis et al 2018 because of these and other economic related problems women are less likely to adopt appropriate technologies as compared to men gebremariam et al 2019 theis et al 2018 low community participation during development and operation of irrigation schemes has resulted in a low sense of project ownership a low knowledge base for design and site selection and community knowledge being ignored aberra 2004 castelli et al 2018 dolinska et al 2020 embaye et al 2020 without farmer participation during the early stages of irrigation project modernization the site selection for headwork structures may go wrong and result in exclusion of former traditional irrigation scheme users wegerich et al 2008 inequitable water distribution among users at different locations e g upstream versus downstream upstream versus midlevel is common in many small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia teshome et al 2018 tola and haile 2020 van steenbergen et al 2011 yami 2016 promoting users participation in all phases of irrigation development and providing enabling conditions and environment for individual irrigation users to realize their capacity and needs are among the possible options for solving sustainability issues in irrigation management users participation during development operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes helps to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility needed for sustainability of schemes 3 5 4 environmental sustainability in ethiopia severe problems related to waterlogging and salinization leads to substantial yield reduction and loss of cultivable land gebrehiwot 2018 habtu et al 2020 salinization of irrigation schemes is an ever increasing problem in the ethiopian rift valley awulachew and ayana 2011 ayenew 2007 zeweld et al 2015 this is due to the utilization of saline lakes for irrigation ayenew 2007 poor irrigation management practices abera et al 2019 awulachew and ayana 2011 lack of proper drainage facilities gebremeskel et al 2018b and groundwater rise due to over irrigation beyene et al 2019 according to oates et al 2020 yohannes et al 2017 and abera et al 2019 salinization is also among the main problems that constrain the yield production of community managed irrigation schemes located outside of the rift valley basin after assessing the salinity level of nine irrigation schemes in tigray region gebremeskel et al 2018b reported that more than 60 of community managed small scale irrigation schemes are affected by salinity problems combined effects of salinity and waterlogging problems are becoming the main reasons for large potential areas to be left out of irrigation in ethiopia over exploitation of irrigation water from natural lakes also adversely affects the ecological stability of these lakes by changing the lake level ayenew 2007 degrading wetland areas mequanent and mingist 2019 and polluting the lakes afessa and yosef 2019 implementation of proper irrigation water management operation and maintenance and proper management of drainage infrastructures could lower the environmental problems of small scale irrigation schemes fig 3 summarizes the multi dimensional challenges of small scale irrigation systems in ethiopia generally poor operation and maintenance practices are common problems in many irrigation schemes this is a combined result of problems that arise from institutional technical and socio economic aspects these poor operation and maintenance practices result in environmental effects of salinization and waterlogging this in turn risks the sustainability of community managed irrigation schemes in addition to the above mentioned sustainability and operational challenges irrigation shemes in tigray regional state are facing multidimensional problems due to the current war many irrigation schemes in the region are severely affected by infrastructural damage lack of man power stolen pumps stolen and annihilated farm tools abandonment of farm lands due to farmers insecurity lack of required farm inputs such as improved seeds fertilizers and pesticides freezing of farmers money in banks and micro finances as a result of the ongoing war demissie et al 2022 nyssen et al 2022 after comparing the areal coverage of 14 irrigation schemes before the war average of 2019 and 2020 and after the war 2021 using remote sensing data nyssen et al 2022 reported that the irrigated area of surveyed schemes was reduced by 31 as a result of the war in tigray excluding large scale plantation farms and tekeze river side irrigation schemes smallscale irrigation schemes are more resilient to the extent of the extreme shock of the tigray war by shifting from planting cash crops to cereals with minimum land management practices demissie et al 2022 nyssen et al 2022 4 conclusion in ethiopia small scale irrigation schemes development is expected to improve agricultural productivity and ensure food security of smallholder households water harvesting development for small scale irrigation schemes is among the priority aspects of the national water sector policy irrigation users annual average income could be improved up to eight folds as compared to non irrigation users income when proper water management practices are implemented irrigation user households also have a financial capacity to adopt yield enhancing farm inputs and improve their crop production of the rainfed season regardless of their benefits many of the developed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia are performing below their expectations leaving considerable users and land areas out of irrigation multiple problems related to technical institutional economic social and environmental aspects during implementation and or operation of these irrigation schemes are the reasons for low performance irrigation development and management practices in ethiopia lacks a holistic strategy that integrates technical socio economic and environmental aspects the low attention given to the social and institutional aspects during scheme development and management is the main cause for the low performance of irrigation practices sustainability of community managed small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia is challenged by these multiple problems in addition to these problems many irrigation schemes in tigray region are facing multidimensional operational and sustainability challenges due to the ongoing war in tigray consideration to indigenous community knowledge and experience during development rehabilitation and management is essential for sustainability of irrigation schemes supporting the irrigation sector via research based findings and adoption of appropriate technologies helps to alleviate sustainability issues of small scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of
