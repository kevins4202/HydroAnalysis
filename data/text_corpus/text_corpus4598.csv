22990,over the past several decades understanding the nature and slope of high frequency tail in wind wave modelling studies is extremely important and its uncertainty amongst 4 and 5 frequency exponent representation was an area of major significance hence an attempt has been made to estimate the slope of the high frequency tail of the wind wave frequency spectrum off coastal visakhapatnam using measured data for the period november 2011 to december 2015 the investigation reveals that the high frequency slope of the spectra varied seasonally in the range between 1 80 and 3 77 annually 75 11 of wave conditions were dominated by swells and the rest 24 89 by wind seas further the validation of 1d wave spectra at the coastal location utilizing the nested wam swan setup was promising enough indicating a departure in capturing the peak energies with the aid of spectral fitting method the jonswap spectra was compared with the measured spectra which demonstrated significant deviations from the measured spectra revealing high scatter index ranging from 0 24 to 1 73 the study aims to report on the uncertainty in the correct slope for the high frequency tail and the concept of a unified slope at any coastal location remains unpredictable for the oceanographic community keywords 1d spectrum wam swan jonswap high frequency tail visakhapatnam 1 introduction the prime phenomena among various environment conditions is the occurrence of wind waves which needs attention towards its destructive impact on maritime structures and other marine and coastal activities in the nearshore areas however it is not easy to study the impact only with the irregular and random wind waves recorded in the sea in many advanced coastal applications it is mandatory describing the irregularity of the sea surface using the wave energy spectrum for different reasons guedes soares 1991 highlights the significance of spectral description of sea state as the study of wave characteristics estimation of wave induced loads on marine structures response of floating bodies to the wave action and for the design of marine structures and vessels moreover the spectral representation of waves facilitates the determination of wave forces on offshore structures harbour resonance phenomenon irregular wave run up over topping etc in the works by guedes soares 1991 hanson and philips 1999 it is demonstrated that waves in the ocean consists of locally generated waves and the swells propagating from far off resulting in multi peaked wave energy spectrum further kumar et al 2003 found that 60 of the wave spectra observed was multipeaked along the indian coast and the remaining single peaked with hs more than 2 m among numerous approaches available to describe wave energy spectrum spectral approach is considered important it is because it can provide both the frequency composition of wave information and several other statistical and significant wave characteristics for offshore engineering applications it is considered that deeper the knowledge of ocean wave spectrum and its growth the better its efficiency in studying the impact the measured wave spectrum is generally considered as the sum of wave systems generated by events separated either in space in time or both wave spectrum is quite complex but it is understood easily considering its remarkable shape similarity at different locations under varying wind speeds ranging from small waves to storm generated waves by hurricanes over the past 50 years many studies have been carried out for proper description and parameterization of wind wave spectrum as a result of the studies a series of empirical expressions for the spectrum of the sea surface elevation has been developed among parametric spectrum models pm models pierson and moskowitz 1964 for fully developed sea and jonswap model hasselmann et al 1973 for fetch limited developing sea are widely accepted and used models around the world for decades cem 2006 although few researchers have attempted cavaleri et al 2012 tolman et al 2013 the clear understanding of the processes that drives the shape and generation of wind wave spectrum is still missing in past works gunson and symonds 2014 the three main processes source terms that controls the evolution of waves violante carvalho et al 2004 in deep water are sin energy by the wind sds dissipation due to wave breaking and snl non linear wave wave interaction the shape of the wave spectrum s f is modified by the nonlinear interactions the spectrum is denoted as s f f n where the high frequency part decays exceeding the peak frequency according to phillips 1958 the spectrum is denoted as s f 0 0081 g2 2π 4f 5 in which the wave steepness was considered by setting wave breaking in the spectrum portions with high frequency there were many models representing frequency energy spectra such as neumann 1953 darbyshire 1955 and bretschneider 1962 the most extensively chosen are the pierson moskowitz pm 1964 and jonswap 1973 spectra the above spectral model are portrayed by the high frequency tail relative to f 5 in the equilibrium range which depends on the hypothetical examination by phillips for the spectrum caused due to wave breaking in several studies such as laboratory and full scale measurements it is demonstrated that the tail is nearer to 4 instead of 5 for instance toba 1973 contended that the shape f 4 is more fitting for wind waves in view of his empirical investigation in addition wave spectra in moderately shallow water frequently shows energy density lower than f 5 some of the time relative to f 3 goda 1999 this effect is attributed to the impact of water depth on the shape of the wave spectrum and mainly due to the interaction between spectral components in an attempt to represent the wave spectra at finite water depth bouws et al 1985 proposed a change to the jonswap energyspectrum this spectrum is known as the tma spectrum texel marsen and arsloe with respect to the names of the data sources utilized in its advancement and it is a result of the jonswap and the kitaigorodoskii depth function representing the impact of water depth cem 2006 donelan et al 1985 in his study based on extensive field measurements in lake ontario defined a spectral form which can be considered as a jonswap spectrum modified with f 4 frequency tail the exponent n of the high frequency tail that best depicts the spectrum decay s f f n is yet an open inquiry the estimation of n varied between 3 5 and 5 as reported by in many studies toba 1973 donelan et al 1985 liu 1989 young 1988 rodriguez and soares 1999 violante carvalho et al 2004 the presence of a translational frequency at which the decay changes from f 4 to an f 5 tail has been indicated by rodriguez et al 1999 with respect to application of kitaigorodskii 1983 these studies bring up the issue on whether there exists a high frequency decay violante carvalho et al 2002 universally in the form s f f n which additionally gives solid confirmation that n can fluctuate between 4 and 5 in shallow water liu 1989 recommended f 4 for rising young wind seas and f 3 for fully developed wave spectra while kitaigordskii et al 1975 proposed f 3 tail a couple of different researchers for example young and babanin 2006 and badulin et al 2007 proposed an f 4 tail the random variability of wind generated waves was one of the reasons pointed out by rodriguez and soares 1999 to explain why the high frequency tail of the wave spectrum is uncertain other researchers ewans and kibblewhite 1990 related this change of the exponent to range mitsuyasu et al 1980 of frequencies that replicated the power law model literature suggests that f 4 power law holds while the tail rodriguez et al 1999 maintains a f 5 form at higher frequencies 2 5 3 5 fp in 1990 1991 banner surmised a k 4 tail form for two dimensional wave number spectrums the study explains the importance of directional spread of energy which is dependent on the variations of the slope of the wave spectrum in oceanic scales the study by siadatmousavi et al 2012 recommended the use of n 5 rather than the default value of n 4 for swan the east coast of india characterized by narrow continental shelf width compared to the west coast experiences wave climate which is generally rough during the southwest monsoon june to september and comparatively calm during the remaining part of the year chandramohan et al 1991 neetu et al 2006 at the nearshore region sudden decrease in water depth causes the waves to surge further during extreme events kumar et al 2004 creating severe coastal hazards on an average over the year wave period varies from 9 to 12 s while wave periods in the range of 10 14s were reported sarma 1986 kumar et al 2004 during storm conditions a maximum hs of about 2 25 m over western bay of bengal during summer monsoon was reported by sathe et al 1979 during march to september the waves approach the coast predominantly from the se and from the east during december to february along the indian coast in general the wave spectra are multi peaked harish and baba 1986 vethamony and sastry 1986 often with two peaks prasada rao and baba 1996 during extreme events the frequency energy spectra are single peaked with maximum energy distribution in a narrow frequency band while the spectra are multi peaked kumar et al 2003 and energy is distributed over a wide range of frequencies in different directions for other seasons aboobacker et al 2009 several studies are carried out in the east coast of india to study nearshore wave characteristics prasad et al 2009 sharmila et al 2015 jena et al 2017 in the indian scenario considerable research was carried in specific at the visakhapatnam location kumar et al 2001 2014 suresh et al 2010 balakrishnan nair et al 2013 sirisha et al 2015 2017 murty et al 2016 the significant wave height observed by suresh et al 2010 ranged from 0 88 to 2 62 m and the maximum wave height hmax ranged from 1 05 to 5 01 m for visakhapatnam with the aid of ocean state forecast system at incois balakrishnan nair et al 2013 studied the comparison of forecasted significant wave height peak wave period and direction which matched well with the measured values at visakhapatnam with forecast error si less than 20 and rms error of 0 28 m past studies conducted over coastal visakhapatnam did not pay much attention on the characteristics of high frequency tail in the wave spectrum the shallow water prediction model swan uses the default jonswap spectrum for estimating the initial condition of a nonstationary run and boundary conditions for nested swan runs in case of parametric spectral input the effect of remote forcing influences such as the swells propagating to the bay of bengal from the southern ocean can modify the wave spectra along the coast and thus demand the development of a location specific wave spectra the unique feature reported in this study is to explore location specific high frequency tail characteristics in the bay of bengal region that can be checked and extended for other coastal locations in the east coast the main objectives of this study are i nearshore simulation and validation of wave spectra at the coastal visakhapatnam location using nested wam swan model and measured data ii to analyze the temporal annual variations in wave spectra and to examine the sea swell characteristics at the study location using separation frequency method iii estimating the slope of the high frequency tail the tail is assumed to be of the form s f a f n with n the slope of the spectra estimated using the power laws and iv to compare the measured spectrum with the jonswap spectrum using the least square error method this is applied in the measured data collected using field measurements to further analyze the numeric results the analysis carried out at visakhapatnam confirms that a tail generally close to f 3 7 but with slightly different slopes above the peak frequency is observed the main objective in carrying out this analysis is to demonstrate the fact that there exist uncertainties in the slope of the spectrum at the near shore location and this is because measured spectrum do not resemble the theoretical spectra used in shallow water wave predictions models 2 study location visakhapatnam located on the eastern shore of india often called the jewel of the east coast is a coastal port city situated between 81 06 and 83 31 e of the eastern longitudes and 17 15 and 18 32 n of northern latitudes in the northern part of coastal andhra pradesh it is nestled among the hills of the eastern ghats and facing the bay of bengal to the east fig 1 visakhapatnam district is bounded by bay of bengal in the east east godavari district in the south and orissa state in the west and north directions the length of the coastline is 135 km with headland bay and small beaches apart from being a port city it is the largest city in andhra pradesh with an area of 550 km2 and is primarily an industrial city the climate over visakhapatnam is represented as tropical wet and dry the humidity levels are noted to be high during summer months and the region experiences a weather with warm summer and moderate winters from the wind and wave climate point of view kumar et al 2004 the study area is indicative of two seasons namely the rough weather season southwest monsoon june to september and the fair weather season northeast monsoon during may to september the hs varies from 1 to 3 m indian daily weather reports while during october to december it varies from 0 5 to 2 m keeping apart the cyclone cases and in the remaining part of the year it is mostly less 1 5 m over the larger part of the year the mean wave period ranges from 9 to 12s it is observed that during storm events and normal conditions the predominant offshore wave height ranges from 1 0 to 2 5 m and 0 5 0 75 m respectively in march to september and december to february the waves mainly approach the coast from the south and from the east respectively while during october to november the wave direction is observed to be unpredictable changing from south to east the region is characterized by semi diurnal tides indian tide table and the tidal ranges kumar et al 2004 are 1 43 m mean spring and 0 54 m neap tidal fine coarse sand with a mean grain size of 0 35 mm is the composition of the beach in this location 3 the wave models the model used in this study is the ocean wave model wam cycle 4 5 3 an updated version of the wam cycle 4 komen et al 1994 and gunther et al 1992 described the details of the wave model the wam model solves the spectral energy balance equation describing the two dimensional wave spectrum in the following way 1 f t c g f s i n s n l s d s where f f θ x t is the spectral energy density depending on wave frequency f wave direction θ position x and time t and deep water group velocity c g c g f θ equation 1 describes the loss gain and redistribution of energy in the spectral domain and the equation is valid for deep water with no refraction and no significant current the so called source functions on the right hand side in equation 1 describe the wind input sin nonlinear transfer snl and dissipation due to white capping sds wam cycle 4 5 is an update of the wam cycle 4 wave model which is described in komen et al 1994 and gunther et al 1992 the basic physics and numerical approaches are kept in the new release the source function integration scheme proposed by hersbach and janssen 1999 and its updates bidlot et al 2005 have been incorporated a number of additional options are also added in the new model release of wam cycle 4 5 3 gunther and behrens 2011 the new method in wam 4 5 3 is semi implicit and is based on the developments at ecmwf janssen personal communication 2 f n 1 f n δ t s 1 δ t g where s s u n 1 f n is the source function computed with the spectrum at time n and the wind speed u at time level n 1 the term g is the functional derivative of the source function given by g g u n 1 f n the wave model dissipation source function has been reformulated in terms of a mean steepness parameter and mean frequency that gives more emphasis on the high frequency part of the spectrum and results in a more realistic interaction during transition between wind sea and swell this has allowed the relaxation of the prognostic frequency range over which the model equations are integrated a few other small adjustments were also necessary to take advantage of the increased dynamic range of the model bidlot et al 2005 based on the action density equation the swan booij et al 1999 is a wind wave model specifically developed for coastal areas the governing equation in swan model is represented in the form 3 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ where the symbols represent the following σ intrinsic frequency θ direction x and y are horizontal coordinates and t is the time n is the action density represented as n σ θ x y t the local rate of change of action density in time is represented by the first term on the left hand side of equation 3 the propagation of action in geographical x y space respectively with propagation velocities cx and cy is represented by the second and third terms in equation 3 the fourth term represents the relative shift in frequency due to variations in depth and currents with propagation velocity cσ in σ space the fifth term represents the depth and current induced refraction with propagation velocity cθ in θ space the term s s σ θ x y t at the right hand side of the action balance equation 3 is the source term representing the effect of generation dissipation and non linear wave interactions small descriptions of the source sink terms used for various processes is described below and the contribution of the net source sink terms in shallow waters stot is given as 4 stot sin snl3 snl4 sds w sds b sds br sin represents the wave growth by the wind the terms snl3 snl4 represents the non linear transfer of the wave energy through three and four wave interactions respectively the loss of energy due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking is represented by sds w sds b and sds br respectively further details are available in the research works by booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 and swan team 2012 it is to be noted that the basic scientific philosophy of swan is identical to that of wam swan is a third generation wave model and it uses the same formulations for the source terms but swan contains some additional formulations primarily for shallow water and moreover the numerical techniques are very different 4 data and methodology 4 1 input winds the era interim wind field is used in the present study to force the wave models era interim is a reanalysis of the global atmosphere covering the data rich period dee et al 2011 since 1979 originally era interim ran from 1989 but the 10 year extension for 1979 1988 was produced in 2011 and continuing in real time with spatial resolutions from 2 5 2 5 0 25 0 25 the era interim project was initiated in 2006 to provide a bridge between ecmwf s previous reanalysis era 40 1957 2002 and the next generation extended reanalysis envisaged at ecmwf the data assimilation system used to produce era interim is based on a 2006 release of the integrated forecast system ifs cycle 31r2 the system includes a 4 dimensional variational analysis 4d var with a 12 h analysis window the spatial resolution of the data set is approximately 80 km t255 spectral on 60 vertical levels from the surface up to 0 1 hpa zonal and meridional components of 6 hourly era interim winds with spatial resolutions of 1 1 and 0 25 0 25 are used in this study to force the wam and swan models respectively 4 2 buoy data off visakhapatnam in this study wave measurements utilized off visakhapatnam 17 62 n 83 25 e is located at depth of 18 m the data well directional wave rider buoy maintained by earth system science organization esso indian national centre for ocean information services incois for the period november 2011 to december 2015 is used in the present study the horizontal and vertical acceleration are measured by directional buoy using accelerometers and flux gate compass gives directional displacement in both the axis horizontal and vertical displacement of buoy in vertical and horizontal directions is calculated the buoy measures waves with periods in the range of 1 6 30s and heave motion in the range of 20 to 20 m with a resolution of 1 cm the buoy data records were taken at a frequency of 1 28 hz for 17 min for every half an hour the buoy wave spectra were obtained using fft fast fourier transform wherein fft of eight series each consisting of 256 measured vertical elevations from the buoy is added to obtain the spectra with high cut off at 0 58 hz the average wave spectra recorded between november 2011 to december 2015is used in this study to validate the wave spectra and to estimate the slope of the high frequency tail in the shallow water nearshore regions in visakhapatnam as indicated in literature balakrishnan nair et al 2014 for near shore applications the wave rider buoy data sets sandhya et al 2016 sirisha et al 2017 used in this study are proven insitu measurements thus it is satisfactorily utilized with confidence for estimation of spectral slope of the high frequency tail this data has missing months may june july and december of 2012 january and may of 2013 and may 2014 hence the spectral analysis is carried out for the 4 years keeping data gaps in consideration 4 3 methods and model set up to study the shallow water tail characteristics off visakhapatnam the average wave spectrum for a four year period november 2011 to december 2015 is analyzed in this study fig 2 shows the monthly average spectrum for the period november 2011 to december 2015 that clearly depicts double peaked wave spectra which are wind sea dominated seen during june fig 2 f july fig 2 g and november fig 2 k this characteristic feature noticed in the spectrum is attributed to the locally generated waves that dominate the swells during the southwest monsoon period in comparison with other periods normally the wave spectra kumar et al 2003 are either double or multi peaked in bay of bengal owing to existence of wind seas aboobacker et al 2009 together with young swells during extreme events the location is characterized by single peaked wave spectra and it is noted that the low frequency region in the wave spectrum is demonstrated as the area of high energy concentration the present study attempts to determine the spectral slope of wave spectrum using power and regression laws analysis clauset et al 2009 and there by reaching at a best fit for the coastal location to achieve the best use of buoy data in estimating the slope of the spectrum the buoy wave spectrum was first validated using swan spectrum at the coastal location the nested wam swan set up formed as a multi scale approach as shown in fig 3 was used in this study to simulate waves off visakhapatnam the wave model experiments of the outer coarse grid domain d1 domain d1 30 e to 120 e 70 s to 30 n as shown in fig 3 were performed using wam cycle 4 5 3 on an even latitude longitude grid over a 1 1 grid resolution the spectral domain was discretized into 25 logarithmically spaced frequency bins ranging from 0 041 to 0 411 hz wave spectrum obtained at each grid point was stored in every 6 hrs for the entire experiment the bathymetry for the study area was prepared using blended etopo2 earth topography 2 min data set the boundary conditions from the coarse domain d1 is nested into the intermediate domain d2 over a grid resolution of 0 25 0 25 d2 77 5 e to 94 5 e and 0 5 n to 29 5 n it is then nested to the inner domain d3 over a 0 1 0 1 grid resolution 80 e to 87 e and 14 n to 21 n which is the area considered for the present study the swan model utilized the boundary conditions from d1 to simulate waves in d2 and d3 domains in the first simulation all three domains are considered to accommodate for swells reaching the coastal location from southern ocean swan has an implicit integration scheme the number of bins in frequency and directional space are 33 and 36 respectively that accounts for the frequency space in the surface gravity spectrum the frequency ranges between 0 04 hz and 0 58 hz wind input source term is obtained based on the formulation by komen et al 1984 whereas the default settings apply to other source and sink terms model simulations are operated in a non stationary mode with 30 min of computational time step by the standard wave steepness method of national data buoy centre gilhousen and hervey 2001 sea and swell components from wave spectra are separated between november 2011 to december 2015 by selecting separation frequency f s that divide the wave spectrum into its sea swell components estimations are made the steepness function ξ f and separation f s are as follows 5 ξ f 8 π m 2 f g m 0 f 6 f s c f m where fm frequency of maximum of ξ f g is the acceleration due to gravity m0 and m2 gilhousen and hervey 2001 are the zero and second order spectral moments and c 0 75 is empirically determined constant fitting of observed spectra to parametric spectra is done using the principle of least square error with the measured and fitted spectra the jonswap model is used to study the fit in the measured spectra off visakhapatnam as in case of parametric mode spectrum the jonswap spectrum is given below 7 e f α g 2 2 π 4 f 5 e x p 5 4 f f p 4 γ e x p f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 jonswap spectrum was proposed by joint north sea wave project hasselmann et al 1973 for fetch limited sea states where f is the frequency α is the high frequency spectral level g is the gravitational acceleration fp is the peak frequency γ is the peak enhancement factor and σ is the spectral width in the peak region equivalent to σa for f fp and σb for f fp here σa and σb are assumed haselmann et al 1973 to be equivalent to 0 07 and 0 09 respectively the jonswap model reduces to pm model pierson and moskowitz 1964 since γ is equivalent to unity in the past spectral fitting methods have been reported by many researchers such as acar 1983 moon and oh 1988 tucker and pitt 2001 piscopia 2003 feld and mork 2004 yilmaz 2007 and yilmaz and ozhan 2014 yilmaz 2007 reported that acar 1983 based iterative fitting method gives least si values and has comparatively lesser deviation from the methods of violante carvalho et al 2002 and moon and oh 1998 thus in this study acar 1983 based fitting method is used to fit jonswap spectrum to measured data in this method spectral densities at the middle of frequency band δf are calculated by altering values of spectral parameters α γ and fp with increments to determine the least square errors while keeping σa and σb fixed by values of 0 07 and 0 09 respectively the iterative procedure commences with fp and then corresponding α is estimated giving the least square fit the combinations of α γ and fp are detected for the least errors as the first estimates α1 γ1 and fp1 using first estimates as initials more accurate estimates yilmaz 2007 are investigated by tuning the values with varying increments in next step the ranges for α γ and fp runs through the smaller and higher adjacent values around the first estimates it is repeated three times to obtain final estimates of α γ and fp to quantify and assess the fit of the spectra the scatter index si is used yilmaz and ozhan 2014 5 results and discussion the performance of swan model is assessed in this study by comparing with insitu measurements off coastal visakhapatnam location in addition validation of coastal wave spectra using ecmwf era interim winds is demonstrated the estimation of wave spectral slope is achieved using power laws and separation of wind sea and swell is executed to analyze the shallow water characteristics at the study location lastly the measured spectra are compared with jonswap spectra the model performance was assessed qualitatively using several statistical measures such as bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si correlation coefficient r percentage error pe and model performance index mpi bias is the mean difference between model and observations rmse is defined as the square root of the mean of the squares of the difference between model and observed parameters scatter index is defined as the standard deviation of the difference between model output and observations normalized by mean of observations correlation coefficient measures the linear correlation between observation and model and ranges from 1 to 1 a value of high positive correlation signifies to what extent the forecast data follows the observed trend the various statistical error metrics used are as follows 8 b i a s 1 n m o b s 9 r m s e 1 n m o b s 2 10 s i r m s e o b s 11 r m m o b s o b s m m 2 o b s o b s 2 12 m p i 1 r m s e r r o r r m s c h a n g e s where m and obs represents the model output and buoy observations respectively over a time series of n number of data points where m and o b s are the mean values 5 1 comparison of swan spectra with coastal buoy measurements the spectral representation of the sea state is essential to determine a distinct description of the energy levels from wind waves and swells in this context the validation of buoy spectra is extremely important by comparing with the model simulated wave spectra most importantly the validation of a model for a particular geographical area against measurements is an essential step in the advancement of wave prediction and analysis khandekar 1998 the comparison is made between buoy and model derived 1d wave spectra at coastal visakhapatnam location in bay of bengal based on the buoy data collected for four years from november 2011 to december 2015 the monthly averaged wave spectrum off visakhapatnam is utilized in this study to compare the simulated wave spectra at the coastal location for the period november 2011 to december 2015 it is shown that over the period january to december double peaked spectra is a prominent feature the location clearly depicts the co existence of wind seas and swells throughout the year the existence of double peak spectra owes to the locally generated sea breeze and propagations of intermediate and long period swells towards the north indian ocean it shows that post monsoon season ne monsoon and april pre monsoon is characterized by double peaked wave spectra with dominating swells similarly pre monsoon may southwest monsoon june july august and post monsoon october and november showed presence of double peaked spectra with dominating wind seas a characteristic feature noted is that during the month of september the co existence of wind seas and swells were prominent with clearly visible swell domination the spectral peak in the low frequency region indicates the dominance of distance swells fig 2 i the validation of wave spectra was executed using ecmwf era interim winds as input for a period of four years november 2011 to december 2015 figs 4 and 5 shows the comparison of wave spectra off visakhapatnam for the period november 2011 to december 2013 and january 2014 to december 2015 respectively in general the validation over the period of study demonstrates that the swan model overestimated the peak energies during june and august with slight underestimation in july whereas during the rest of the months the model was able to estimate peak frequencies well although in coastal region the peak energies are underestimated the significant under prediction by swan model was noted in the months of september to may an important feature is that the model performed extremely well during august and september compared with other months during the period of study fig 4 a t shows the comparison between measured and predicted frequency spectrum 1d for visakhapatnam coastal location november 2011 to december 2013 in the comparison made between the measured and predicted frequency spectrum id it was found that the model could reproduce low frequencies during november to december 2011 january to april 2012 and october to november 2012 although at the same time it accurately predicted peak frequencies nevertheless energies at buoy location are under predicted for all months in 2011 and 2012 the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 69 to 0 99 percentage error pe ranged from 7 to 38 with the highest being the month of april 2012 mpi varied from 0 59 to 0 98 the very low performance indices during april 2012 fig 4 f are due to the fact that at the coastal region the input wind speed is weak being the fair weather season but peak energies were slightly over predicted during august 2012 fig 4 g whereas peak frequencies are precisely predicted the month of september 2012 fig 4 h demonstrated a good standalone comparison r 0 99 b 0 06 rmse 0 09 si 0 11 pe 7 0 mpi 0 98 which in turn indicated the effect of long distant swells nayak et al 2013 propagating into the study region the results indicate that growth of energy spectrum and its shift to lower frequencies was accurately reproduced by swan model table 1 shows the peak energies m2 hz simulated by the buoy and model at the coastal location for the period of study the peak energies simulated by buoy and model in december 2011 august and september 2012 were 1 07 0 80 1 50 1 61 and 1 18 1 01 m2 hz respectively the validation results for the month of december 2011 fig 2 b are comparable with the results reported by balakrishnan nair et al 2013 the agreement between measured and forecasted 1d wave spectra is generally good at visakhapatnam during 27 december 2011 06 hrs 28 december 2011 00hrs 29 december 2011 09 hrs and 30 december 2011 11 hrs during february to december 2013 the comparisons revealed similar trends of underestimation during fair weather seasons and overestimation in rough weather seasons it is noted that in the year 2013 the pe ranges were high in the order 5 41 with si ranging from 0 08 to 0 87 the pe is low5 for august and 10 for june and july respectively with a high mpi 0 97 0 96 0 95 showing that the performance of swan model in simulating the peak energies at nearshore area in june july and august 2013 was extremely well peak energies simulated by buoy and model in april 2013 were 0 64 and 0 32 m2 hz respectively during the months of june to september 2013 also the simulated energies were notable the simulated peak energies during june by buoy and model are 1 54 and 1 69 m2 hz whereas these were 2 07 and 1 76 m2 hz during september the months of july 1 50 m2 hz and august 1 03 m2 hz performed equally well in simulating the peak energies as shown in table 1 fig 5 a k shows the comparison between measured and predicted frequency spectrum 1d for visakhapatnam coastal location january to december 2014 the comparison made between measured and predicted frequency spectrum id for visakhapatnam jan to dec 2014 revealed that peak energies were overestimated during june and august by the model fig 5 e g with a pe 7 during the rest of the months of 2014 peak frequencies represented well although the peak energies are under estimated at the coastal location this could be attributed due to weak wind conditions dominant during the fair weather seasons during july 1 77 1 61 m2 hz and september 2014 0 70 0 61 m2 hz the peak energies were slightly underestimated with pe of the order 11 the clear primary swell peak in september 2014 also indicated the swells from southern ocean reaching the study location in october 2014 a very severe cyclonic storm vscs hudhud crossed north andhra pradesh coast over visakhapatnam coast between 0600 and 0700 utc of 12th october 2014 sirisha et al 2015 murty et al 2016 it was the most severe cyclone that struck visakhapatnam in the past three decades with the core of hurricane winds the peak energies of 1 69 m2 hz simulated by swan model is evident fig 5 i due to the cyclone hudhud the model was able to reproduce the energy at buoy location the buoy simulated very high peak energy in the order of 2 14 m2 hz that was highest during 2014 table 1 the analysis also revealed a high pe of 33 and 37 mpi of 0 66 and 0 59 in february and april respectively it is most important to note that the predictions were under predicted during january to april 2014 fig 5 a d and during october to december 2014 fig 5 i k being a fair weather season long swells dominate over the study area and the different representation of swell propagation in model physics could be a possible reason for this deviation similar trends in comparison were observed during january to december 2015 as shown in fig 5 l w the comparisons revealed correlation of the order 0 79 to 0 98 with si ranging from 0 13 to 0 61 the pe varied in the range 7 34 for the year 2015 while the months of july august and september showed very low pe 12 the peak energies simulated during these months were notable as the model performed reasonably well in capturing the peak energies at the coastal location the peak energies simulated by buoy and model are 1 71 1 49 1 21 1 31 and 1 05 0 91 m2 hz for july august and september respectively it is inferred from table 2 that the wave spectra derived from the model matched fairly well with the observed wave spectra during 2011 2015 qualitatively the model output obtained here are moderately consistent with those obtained at the buoy location as observed in most cases the model reproduced the low energies however at the buoy location it could not reproduce peak energies in most cases hence it becomes noticeable from the results that the model performs differently in different season and wave spectra figs 4 and 5 reveals that the wave field comprises of both wind seas and swells a four year 2011 2015 observation between model and buoy when statistically compared during pre post northeast and southwest monsoon periods shows that rmse varies from 0 03 m to 0 24 m indicating a moderate fit the model computed wave spectra are similar to buoy wave spectra in general and follow the change in energy level a match between model and measurements can also be expressed using scatter index si lower the values of si better the fit becomes the variation in absolute value of si from 0 21 to 0 62 indicates a deviation between model and measured data the pe ranged from 2 04 southwest monsoon to 31 9 pre monsoon with mpi ranging from 0 98 south west monsoon to 0 65 pre monsoon therefore best performances were revealed by comparison statistics for the south west monsoon moderate performance for post monsoon and northeast monsoon seasons and very poor performance for pre monsoon overall the nested model is deficient in reproducing the sea state dominated by swell figs 4 and 5 a partial reason for which could be the inaccuracies in the boundary conditions specified by wam and also attributed to the quality of input wind fields 5 2 estimation of high frequency spectral slopes the validated wave spectra for coastal visakhapatnam location provided enough confidence in using the data to analyze the hf tail characteristics at study location the major control on the behavior of the high frequency tail of spectrum is connected to the energy balance of wind waves produced by the local wind fields as the wind takes longer interval torsethaugen and haver 2004 blowing over a fetch the wave energy for a given frequency reaches the equilibrium range the balance in energy input from wind is maintained by wave breaking and also by the loss of energy to other frequency in a study by greenslade 2001 it is noted that the spectral peak suddenly jumps to a different frequency when energy shifts from one portion of the spectrum to another during extreme sea states the wave spectra are single peaked with maximum energy centred in a narrow frequency band the spectra shows double or multi peaks at occasions when the swell energy corresponds to the region where the locally generated waves are present swell dominated sea states are observed normally during fair weather season based on the prevailing local winds the primary and secondary peaks will be observed in the low and high frequency regions respectively a characteristic feature prevailing in the monsoon season is the propagation of distant swells which in turn modifies the wave spectra leading to change in peak energy driven by predominating winds at the location in this study the average wave spectrum is analyzed connected to each month for complete four years with the help of database from 2011 to 2015 with data gaps monthly averaged wave spectra were examined for all years and the study in turn reveals that the spectra has a seasonal variation showing single and double peaked characteristics estimation of slope of hf tail was carried out using power law and power regression laws a power regression law of form ln y b ln x a and a regression power law of the form y b x m has been fitted to the average spectrum and the resultant exponent of the hf tail for all years are given in table 3 fig 6 shows the estimated spectral slope of the hf tail using power law for january to december 2015 the hf tail of the monthly average spectrum was fitted with a power law representing the best fit from the spectral estimates only hf tail of the wave spectrum is considered in the estimation of slope in the case of bimodal spectrum the calculation takes into consideration the slope in the region between the highest frequencies to that corresponding frequency of the spectral peak nearest to the highest frequency table 3 shows the slope in high frequency tail of the monthly averaged wave spectrum during different years the slope during june 2011 2015 varied from n 3 18 to 3 58 and during january 2011 2015 the exponent varied from n 2 12 to 2 52 in february the slope ranged from n 1 80 to 2 57 for the month of july the range of slope varied between 3 38 and 3 61 whereas during november it varied between 2 06 and 2 85 the maximum slope occurs during october 2013 3 77 and minimum in february 2015 1 80 annually the range of the slope was between 2 29 and 2 77 2 44 to 3 48 2 46 to 3 77 2 06 to 3 58 and 1 81to 3 61 for the years 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively in most cases it is observed that the average spectra had a very pronounced linear tail as shown in fig 6 it is significant that the goodness of fit of a statistical model is determined that describes how well it fits to a given set of observations the inconsistency between observed values and the expected values under the model is summarized by the measures of goodness of the fit hence an attempt was made where the goodness of fit would be evaluated for the power law fit with the use of metrices such as residential sum of squares rss sum of squared errors sse coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error r table 4 shows goodness of fit statistics for a representative year 2015 using power law r2 a statistical measure that defines the degree of success of the fit in explaining the variation of data the power law provides a best fit for the measured spectrum with very high r2 value ranging from 0 97 to 0 99 this reveals the best correlation for january to december 2015 rss explains the measure of inconsistency between data and estimation model the rss value dictates a tight fit of the model to the data with small values ranging in between 0 01 and 0 74 sse measures the overall deviation of the response values from the match to the response values the variation in the sse statistics during january to december 2015 was 0 0007 0 1081 indicating the presence of smaller random error component in the model further the inferred fit will be more helpful for prediction purpose the best indicator of the fit is generally the adjacent r square statistics giving best fits closer to 1 the goodness of fit is also determined by another statistical measure namely the rmse the estimate of the standard deviation of the random component in the data the values being very low 0 0003 0 0484 indicated that the fit was more useful for prediction therefore the goodness of fit statistics gives confidence to use the power law in determining the slope of the measured spectra in the light of these outcomes attempts were additionally made to estimate the exponent using other best fits similarly trends were also obtained when the slope of the tail was calculated using other regression methods although the numerical values were quite similar a regression of the power law y b x m of the average spectra over the whole range above the spectral peak was examined the estimated spectral slope of the hf tail using power regression law for july varied from n 3 38 to 3 63 in the same way the estimated spectral slope of the hf tail was in the range n 2 07 to 2 85 during november using power regression law attempts were also made to estimate the slope from the swan model simulated wave spectra using power law the estimated slope for november 2011 january 2012 april 2013 july 2014 and october 2015 are 2 26 2 40 2 71 3 45 2 52 respectively these agree well with the measurements in the same manner the slopes estimated using regression law from model simulated wave spectra also matched well with measurements the variation of these exponents throughout 4 years for all months using both power laws is clearly depicted in table 3 which shows the exponent of the tail obtained by including all frequencies above the peak frequency using the power law table 3 shows the resultant exponent of the hf tail in order to give the best fit the estimated exponents using power regression law express the trends as observed in tables 3 and i e a regression power law of the form y b x m has been fitted to the average spectrum and the resultant exponent of the hf tail for all years are given in table 3 from the basic statistics for the spectral estimates the values of the exponent using power law for the spectral slope ranged from n 1 81 to 3 77 table 3 with a mean range of 2 53 3 03 and low standards deviations of 0 34 0 58 for the years 2011 2015 using power regression law the slope ranged from n 1 80 to 3 77 table 3 with a mean ranging from 2 53 to 3 03 and low standard deviations of 0 33 0 60 both these methods cater almost similar values for the slope except in few months the maximum estimated slope was observed in october 2013 n 3 77 and the lowest slope of n 1 81 1 80 was seen in february 2015 using both laws as shown in the distribution of slope values fig 7 a for significant wave height hs the slope increases with the increase in the significant wave height and reaches a saturation range the slope also increases on the increase in mean wave period as evident from fig 7 b the slope is observed to be maximum during southwest monsoon n 3 18 to 3 63 and post monsoon n 2 06 to 3 77 since hs is maximum being monsoon period june to september and also due to storms experienced in the month of october the slope varied in the range n 1 80 to 3 05 and n 2 73 to 3 28 during the northeast and pre monsoon seasons the slope varies significantly during the rough weather season where both wind seas and swells co exist hence there is an inter annual variation in slope for swell dominated spectra fig 8 shows the time series variation of slope for the period 2011 to 2015 the slope trails a similar trend in all years during the period of study slope variations were minimum in november to february while in june july and october variations were high it is observed that during the rough weather season the slope increases in the month of june july and then decreases in november to december over the years in the southwest monsoon season the high frequency tail slowly increases and then it decreases during post monsoon followed by a drastic decrease in slope during the northeast monsoon over the years therefore there is a seasonal variation in slope and the slope of the high frequency end of the wave spectrum becomes smoother when the wave non linearity increases apart from the long period swells originating in the southern ocean and reaching the study location the tail of spectrum is also influenced by the local wind conditions 5 3 temporal and annual variability of monthly averaged wave spectra the inter annual variations of spectral energy density for different months of 2011 to 2015 are evaluated off visakhapatnam using the monthly average spectrum the time series plot of the maximum spectral energy density over the years 2011 2015 indicates that the magnitude of the spectral energy density is high during southwest monsoon 0 3 2 07 m2 hz and the post monsoon 0 24 2 14 m2 hz seasons this is due to the persistence of strong winds along with monsoon depressions during southwest monsoon and due to the passage of cyclonic storms at the coastal location during fig 9 post monsoon seasons the energy levels during the pre monsoon season varied from 0 3 to 1 66 m2 hz the average spectral energy density observed seasonally for the southwest monsoon periods are 1 34 1 53 0 94 and 1 35 m2 hz during 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively during all the years the spectral energy density is comparatively low in the northeast monsoon 0 2 1 07 m2 hz however the energy density was notably high 2 14 m2 hz during non monsoon period october 2014 in comparison to other years in the same way in september 2013 a high energy was observed 2 07 m2 hz the annual maximum spectral energy density is 1 5 2 07 2 14 and 1 71 m2 hz in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively growth and development of spectral components over time can be examined from wave spectral energy density in frequency time domain seasonally marked variability is seen in the temporal variations of the average spectral density with frequency for the years 2012 2015 as shown in fig 10 the spectral energy density is high during monsoon and post monsoon period in a low frequency wave range of 0 04 0 2 hz for all chosen years this explicitly proves that the area is influenced by swells indicating the presence of long period swells at the study area with noticeable effects of wind seas seen at the study location the peak wave spectral energy density is maximum in august september october and july for the years 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively since storm waves propagated along the region in 2014 higher energies are recorded during this time the peak wave spectral density 2013 2014 is observed to be less than 0 5 m2 hz for the rest two years the energies were greater than or equal to 1 5 m2 hz for the years 2012 2015 which reveals increased swell activity leading to broadening of the spectrum it is noted that variability is different in each year thus showing a seasonal variation the energies are maximum in southwest monsoon and post monsoon periods which may be partly due to storms in addition with the strong winds experienced during the monsoon season the temporal variation in the spectral energy density over the annual period is seen different the study of inter annual variations of spectral energy density for different months in 2011 2015 included the use of monthly averaged wave spectrum the important feature extracted from monthly average spectrum is the presence of huge amounts of energy in the swell frequency when related with the wind sea frequency throughout the year the monthly averaged spectra are double peaked the double peaked wave energy spectrum at the coastal location is attributed to the swells sandhya et al 2014 from the southern indian ocean and locally nayak et al 2013 generated wind seas it was revealed in the study that inter annual variations are observed in wave spectrum during all months with maximum trends between may to october reports from joint typhoon warning centre jtwc confirms that hudhud was the first cyclone which effected urban areas and it is the second strongest tropical cyclone which crossed the visakhapatnam coast after 1985 amarendra et al 2015 hudhud crossed the andaman islands on 08 october 2014 at 0930 h ist it moved west northwest and intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm on 10 october 2014 an it intensified further on 12 october and shortly before landfall near visakhapatnam coast hudhud reached its peak strength with 3 min wind speeds of 185 km hr and a minimum central pressure of 960 mbar imd report 2014 in a study by sirisha et al 2015 it is reported that maximum significant wave height forecasted by the model was 4 45 m on 12th october 0000 utc whereas observations shows a maximum 4 86 m on 12th october 0300 utc the study also highlights the fact that both wind sea and swell equally contributed to this high wave the peak values of hmax observed and forecasted are 7 26 and 7 48 m respectively for the hudhud cyclone the high peak energies of 2 14 m2 hz observed in october 2014 fig 5 i is due to cyclonic storm hudhud 8 14 october 2014 which passed off the visakhapatnam coast northwest coast of bay of bengal the inter annual variability observed in the wave spectrum is due to the changes in the local wind and the swells from the southern ocean and the variations in monsoon intensity significant variation in monthly average peak frequency of the swell is noted during all the years the swell component is high in july and october 2014 as compared to all other years during the study period while the wind sea component is high during july 2013 5 4 sea and swell characteristics off visakhapatnam the study indicates that wave energy spectra comprises single or double energy peaks one in low frequency region connected with swell and the other in the high frequency region associated with locally generated seas showing two or more different wave systems dominated over the region in this study an outline of the near shore wave characteristics at the coastal visakhapatnam location is presented with seasonal scenarios figs 11 and 12 shows the time series of hs significant wave height and tm mean wave period of the total sea swell and wind sea during 2013 2015 where the maximum observed hs is 1 74 m and the corresponding tm is 6 4s the corresponding hs and tm for swell and wind sea are 1 58 m 0 71 m and 8 6s 3 6s respectively the mean wave periods during southwest monsoon varied in the range 5 6 7 1s while during pre monsoon it varied between 4 5 and 6 3s and with maximum period 12 7s during post monsoon in the month of october 2013 during sw monsoon season waves primarily trail the swell pattern and the energy associated with the swells is quite higher figs 11 and 12 than that of the wind seas table 5 shows the monthly variations minimum and maximum of hs and tm for the swell and wind sea off visakhapatnam the swell wave heights are comparatively higher than the wind sea heights during all seasons the swell heights during pre monsoon ranged from 0 56 m to 1 29 m with the corresponding sea heights varying from 0 47 m to 0 59 m swell wave heights were generally higher during the southwest monsoon period and varied from 0 66 m to 1 58 m with corresponding sea heights in the range 0 27s 0 82s as compared to the sea heights 0 39 0 60 m the highest swell heights were observed to be equally higher in post monsoon season 0 39 m 1 57 m the northeast monsoon had slightly lower swell heights of 0 55 1 02 m with seas in the range 0 25 0 59 m similarly during pre monsoon swell period ranged from 7 6 to 9 9s with sea periods of 3 0 3 3s swell wave period during southwest monsoon were higher 8 0 9 0s as compared to sea periods of 3 2 3 6s the swell period were observed to be higher in post monsoon compared to other seasons and it varied from 7 4 to 13 8s with seas 2 7 3 2s and 7 3 10 3s with seas 2 7 3 1s during the northeast monsoon seasons from the monthly variations in hs and tm of swell and wind sea presented in table 5 it is inferred that wind sea hs 0 82 m and swell hs 1 58 m during july was the highest the swell hs was greater than 1 0 m ranged from 1 02 to 1 58 during all months from may to december while the wind sea hs was low 0 9 m during all the months the maximum swell mean period 13 8s was observed during october whereas the maximum wind sea mean period 3 6s was observed during june to september the corresponding minimum values were observed swell 7 3s during january and wind sea 2 7s during february march and november monthly percentage dominance of swell and wind sea is presented in table 6 throughout the year percentage occurrence of single double and multi peaked spectra is 11 62 69 76 and 18 60 respectively highest percentages of single double and multi peaked spectra are seen in may 100 february july and august 100 and december 50 respectively yearly 75 11 of waves prevail by swell and 24 89 by sea the dominance of swell is seen over wind sea throughout the year excepting the months of june july and november maximum swell dominance occurs during the months of may 98 7 and september 97 4 and maximum wind sea dominance occurs during july 62 3 the role of wind seas is important during june to july showing the coexistence of wind seas and swells that result in complex sea states at coastal areas in relation to seasons wind seas prevail during southwest monsoon 42 15 and post monsoon 40 15 while swells are dominant in pre monsoon 94 6 and northeast monsoon 90 25 respectively hence the coast experiences predominate swells during pre monsoon and fair weather conditions the results are in good agreement with many studies along the east coast of india suresh et al 2010 reported that the swells contribute 63 2 to hs whereas wind seas 36 8 along visakhapatnam coast between june to september patra and jena 2012 reported that the wind sea and swells are dominated by 76 and 24 annually in the cuddalore region southeast coast of india the results are also comparable with the study by kumar et al 2014 which reported that during the one year period of 2010 off gangavaram 6 km southwest of visakhapatnam single peaked spectra are observed for 56 8 of time and the remaining are predominantly swell dominated 38 4 double peaked spectra and the wind sea dominated double peaked spectra observed is only 4 8 5 5 comparison of measured and jonswap spectrum in this study the jonswap spectrum is utilized in fitting the average wave spectra at the nearshore area hence the deviation of the spectrum was estimated from the measured data the monthly average wave spectra off visakhapatnam for the years 2013 2015 is compared with the jonswap spectra the study trails the fitting method based on acar 1983 in finding out the spectral parameters α γand fp of the jonswap as discussed in the methodology section it is to be noted that in the measured spectra considered at the visakhapatnam location each of the wave systems is fitted with a jonswap fit hence if there are wind sea and a swell present both peaks are fit a fitted theoretical spectra jonswap is shown in figs 13 and 14 and 15along with the monthly average wave spectra for different months for the years 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 13 shows the comparison of measured and jonswap spectrum for the year 2013 in 2013 the spectral parameters of the jonswap model indicated variations such as α varied from 0 00005 to 0 0023 γ varied from 0 667 to 1 708 with peak frequencies ranging from 0 063 to 0 122 in 2014 the spectral parameters α ranged from 0 00005 to 0 0008 γ varied from 0 625 to 1 25 with peak frequencies ranging from 0 049 to 0 101 fig 14 similarly in 2015 α ranged from 0 00005 to 0 002 γvaried from 0 292 to 1 542 with peak frequencies ranging from 0 063 to 0 115 fig 15 these spectral parameter values obtained at the visakhapatnam location are less than the usually recommended values of α andγ 0 0081 and 3 3 used in equation 5 obtained from the original jonswap data of the north sea figs 13 15 shows the comparison of measured and jonswap fit however it is evident that the jonswap model does not fit adequately the measured spectrum in all the years taken into account it is visible from the figures that the jonswap model does not present a good fit to the low and high frequency peak it is seen that in few cases the jonswap spectrum could fairly pick the peaks but still it largely under predicts both high and low frequency components of the spectrum it fails since it is incapable of following the tail of the measured spectrum over prediction of peak frequencies is also noted in few cases although in few cases the high frequency tail match is seen but in general it can be dictated that the shape of the jonswap model fitted is such that it neglects the high frequency tail of the measured spectrum the study demonstrates that the jonswap spectra do not describe well the wave spectra both at low and high frequencies and hence do not reproduce the measured spectrum table 7 shows the statistical estimates from the comparison of measured and theoretical spectra for the period 2013 to 2015 during all the years the correlation coefficient r was high in the range 0 71 0 98 with rmse ranging from 0 02 to 0 33 although the comparisons showed fairly good correlation it is observed that the si was high during all years showing noticeable deviations from measured spectrum the si ranged from 0 41 to 1 32 0 24 to 1 73 and 0 42 to 1 07 for the years 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively this is because in most cases the high frequency peak splits into two peaks in the frequency domain suggesting that the high frequency peak comprises both swell and a wind sea several factors can lead to the high variability in the estimated parameters the observed spectral densities may also contribute to the variability with importance of sampling interval and degrees of freedom in the spectral estimation process the choice of the fitting method which estimates the parameters could be another source of error leading to biased estimates all these can contribute to the deviations with the spectral parameters as discussed in literature such as hasselmann et al 1976 lewis and allos 1990 piscopia 2003 and ardhuin 2007 thus the higher scatter indices indicate only an average performance in modelling the peaks with jonswap model at the visakhapatnam location it is concluded that the jonswap model is not a good option to better translate the wind sea and swell components of sea state as it shows sufficient deviation from the measured data with this study it is well demonstrated that the theoretical spectrum jonswap fails to describe the high frequency tail of the measured spectrum since the high frequency tail in these spectrum decays in the form f n with n values ranging from 1 80 to 3 77 hence the study reveals a need to modify the jonswap spectrum to incorporate the respective slopes at the coastal locations which is an important stride needed for operational forecasting centers the incorporation of the respective slope in the model spectrum and its performance evaluation for fair and rough weather seasons including cyclonic cases is not in the scope of the present investigation and will be taken up as a future study hence from the estimated slope and by fitting the jonswap spectrum to the measured spectrum the study suggests a deviation and it concludes that the exponents for the tails of the frequency spectra suggest a simple model spectrum with tail k 3 7 for the coastal visakhapatnam location moreover this exponent can be regarded as only site specific since it demands further analysis to extend the same exercise to other buoy locations along the east coast of india and hence confirm the variability of the spectral slope along the east coast 6 concluding remarks the high frequency spectral tail is always calculated with an inverse power law of fourth frequency by the physics of wind generated waves still a particular value for the slope of the high frequency tail of the spectrum cannot be determined by empirical studies in the shallow water models an inverse fifth power proportionality is followed by the jonswap spectrum the present study discusses and analyze the data for the high frequency tail of the wave spectrum using buoy measurements of wave energy spectra for four years off coastal visakhapatnam taking into consideration the data gaps as a limitation the following conclusions were drawn from this study based on the measured wave data 18 m deep off the east coast of india the variations in wave spectral characteristics of the high frequency spectrum during 2011 2015 are studied it is seen that the variability differs in each year showing a seasonal variation with maximum energies concentrated in the months of southwest monsoon 0 30 2 07 m2 hz and post monsoon 0 24 2 14 m2 hz which were partially attributed to storms apart from strong winds experienced during the southwest monsoon season and monsoon depressions the wind seas and swells off visakhapatnam have been separated from the measured wave spectra using the separation frequency method and monthly characteristics have been analyzed swell dominance is seen to be maximum during may 98 7 and september 97 4 and maximum sea dominance is observed in july 62 3 the role of wind seas is notable in june to july indicating the coexistence of wind seas and swells resulting in complex sea states at nearshore areas the study also reports on the application of an nested wave model to simulate and validate wave spectra off coastal visakhapatnam located in the east coast of india the study investigated the overall performance of nested wave model at the visakhapatnam location using ecmwf era interim wind fields and executing analysis based on prominent seasons among all the seasons the southwest monsoon season is rated best for the model performance the results show that model spectra closely follow the buoy spectra however with exception to reproduce well the very high energy waves the study of the slope of the high frequency side of wave frequency spectrum suggest a power decay with exponent ranging from n 1 80 to 3 77 using both power laws and none of the data support the original phillips theory with f 5 high frequency tail the exponent n is less than 3 8 for the buoy located in coastal visakhapatnam at a depth of 18 m the exponents for the tails of the frequency spectra suggest a simple model spectrum with tail k 3 7 for the coastal visakhapatnam location this work is a preliminary attempt to show that there exists considerable uncertainty on the true value of the slope and that the measured spectrum does not follow the jonswap spectrum at the study location utilizing the least square error method the mean wave spectra are used to fit and compare with the jonswap spectrum model at the visakhapatnam location theγvalues are smaller than the value of 3 3 obtained from the original jonswap data belonging to the north sea and α values are less than 0 0081 the jonswap spectrum do not match well with the measured data for the coastal location indicating high scatter index ranging from 0 24 to 1 73 this highlights the need for revision of an existing formulation or to obtain a new mathematical formula for use in nearshore wave modelling it can be realized by incorporating the respective slopes n 1 80 to 3 77 obtained in this study the study in demonstrating the usage of respective slope obtained from this investigation in the swan model spectrum and its performance evaluation for fair and rough weather seasons including cyclonic cases are not in the scope of the present study and will be taken up as a future study further the estimation of the high frequency tail of wave spectra from measured wave data has to be performed for other locations along the east coast of india and hence the existing jonswap spectrum can be modified with the exponent values achieved for the north indian ocean that can lead to the development of a best possible spectrum with respective slopes hence largely the study analyzes the measured wave data to estimate the high frequency spectral slope further as a future scope the results can be used to evolve an equation in similar to the jonswap spectrum in addition the investigation aims to extend for other coastal locations over the east coast of india and hence recommend unified spectra for the bay of bengal region moreover this study will attempt to incorporate the developed location specific wave spectra in wave model and explore its performance over shallow water locations by utilizing the wave measurements available this study can be easily extended to other coastal locations with an overall goal to develop a generic wave spectrum for the bay of bengal region this assures wide practical applications in operational centers as well therefore the study aims to develop location specific best wave spectra for the high frequency tail based on wave measurements off visakhapatnam acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the director esso incois hyderabad under

22990,over the past several decades understanding the nature and slope of high frequency tail in wind wave modelling studies is extremely important and its uncertainty amongst 4 and 5 frequency exponent representation was an area of major significance hence an attempt has been made to estimate the slope of the high frequency tail of the wind wave frequency spectrum off coastal visakhapatnam using measured data for the period november 2011 to december 2015 the investigation reveals that the high frequency slope of the spectra varied seasonally in the range between 1 80 and 3 77 annually 75 11 of wave conditions were dominated by swells and the rest 24 89 by wind seas further the validation of 1d wave spectra at the coastal location utilizing the nested wam swan setup was promising enough indicating a departure in capturing the peak energies with the aid of spectral fitting method the jonswap spectra was compared with the measured spectra which demonstrated significant deviations from the measured spectra revealing high scatter index ranging from 0 24 to 1 73 the study aims to report on the uncertainty in the correct slope for the high frequency tail and the concept of a unified slope at any coastal location remains unpredictable for the oceanographic community keywords 1d spectrum wam swan jonswap high frequency tail visakhapatnam 1 introduction the prime phenomena among various environment conditions is the occurrence of wind waves which needs attention towards its destructive impact on maritime structures and other marine and coastal activities in the nearshore areas however it is not easy to study the impact only with the irregular and random wind waves recorded in the sea in many advanced coastal applications it is mandatory describing the irregularity of the sea surface using the wave energy spectrum for different reasons guedes soares 1991 highlights the significance of spectral description of sea state as the study of wave characteristics estimation of wave induced loads on marine structures response of floating bodies to the wave action and for the design of marine structures and vessels moreover the spectral representation of waves facilitates the determination of wave forces on offshore structures harbour resonance phenomenon irregular wave run up over topping etc in the works by guedes soares 1991 hanson and philips 1999 it is demonstrated that waves in the ocean consists of locally generated waves and the swells propagating from far off resulting in multi peaked wave energy spectrum further kumar et al 2003 found that 60 of the wave spectra observed was multipeaked along the indian coast and the remaining single peaked with hs more than 2 m among numerous approaches available to describe wave energy spectrum spectral approach is considered important it is because it can provide both the frequency composition of wave information and several other statistical and significant wave characteristics for offshore engineering applications it is considered that deeper the knowledge of ocean wave spectrum and its growth the better its efficiency in studying the impact the measured wave spectrum is generally considered as the sum of wave systems generated by events separated either in space in time or both wave spectrum is quite complex but it is understood easily considering its remarkable shape similarity at different locations under varying wind speeds ranging from small waves to storm generated waves by hurricanes over the past 50 years many studies have been carried out for proper description and parameterization of wind wave spectrum as a result of the studies a series of empirical expressions for the spectrum of the sea surface elevation has been developed among parametric spectrum models pm models pierson and moskowitz 1964 for fully developed sea and jonswap model hasselmann et al 1973 for fetch limited developing sea are widely accepted and used models around the world for decades cem 2006 although few researchers have attempted cavaleri et al 2012 tolman et al 2013 the clear understanding of the processes that drives the shape and generation of wind wave spectrum is still missing in past works gunson and symonds 2014 the three main processes source terms that controls the evolution of waves violante carvalho et al 2004 in deep water are sin energy by the wind sds dissipation due to wave breaking and snl non linear wave wave interaction the shape of the wave spectrum s f is modified by the nonlinear interactions the spectrum is denoted as s f f n where the high frequency part decays exceeding the peak frequency according to phillips 1958 the spectrum is denoted as s f 0 0081 g2 2π 4f 5 in which the wave steepness was considered by setting wave breaking in the spectrum portions with high frequency there were many models representing frequency energy spectra such as neumann 1953 darbyshire 1955 and bretschneider 1962 the most extensively chosen are the pierson moskowitz pm 1964 and jonswap 1973 spectra the above spectral model are portrayed by the high frequency tail relative to f 5 in the equilibrium range which depends on the hypothetical examination by phillips for the spectrum caused due to wave breaking in several studies such as laboratory and full scale measurements it is demonstrated that the tail is nearer to 4 instead of 5 for instance toba 1973 contended that the shape f 4 is more fitting for wind waves in view of his empirical investigation in addition wave spectra in moderately shallow water frequently shows energy density lower than f 5 some of the time relative to f 3 goda 1999 this effect is attributed to the impact of water depth on the shape of the wave spectrum and mainly due to the interaction between spectral components in an attempt to represent the wave spectra at finite water depth bouws et al 1985 proposed a change to the jonswap energyspectrum this spectrum is known as the tma spectrum texel marsen and arsloe with respect to the names of the data sources utilized in its advancement and it is a result of the jonswap and the kitaigorodoskii depth function representing the impact of water depth cem 2006 donelan et al 1985 in his study based on extensive field measurements in lake ontario defined a spectral form which can be considered as a jonswap spectrum modified with f 4 frequency tail the exponent n of the high frequency tail that best depicts the spectrum decay s f f n is yet an open inquiry the estimation of n varied between 3 5 and 5 as reported by in many studies toba 1973 donelan et al 1985 liu 1989 young 1988 rodriguez and soares 1999 violante carvalho et al 2004 the presence of a translational frequency at which the decay changes from f 4 to an f 5 tail has been indicated by rodriguez et al 1999 with respect to application of kitaigorodskii 1983 these studies bring up the issue on whether there exists a high frequency decay violante carvalho et al 2002 universally in the form s f f n which additionally gives solid confirmation that n can fluctuate between 4 and 5 in shallow water liu 1989 recommended f 4 for rising young wind seas and f 3 for fully developed wave spectra while kitaigordskii et al 1975 proposed f 3 tail a couple of different researchers for example young and babanin 2006 and badulin et al 2007 proposed an f 4 tail the random variability of wind generated waves was one of the reasons pointed out by rodriguez and soares 1999 to explain why the high frequency tail of the wave spectrum is uncertain other researchers ewans and kibblewhite 1990 related this change of the exponent to range mitsuyasu et al 1980 of frequencies that replicated the power law model literature suggests that f 4 power law holds while the tail rodriguez et al 1999 maintains a f 5 form at higher frequencies 2 5 3 5 fp in 1990 1991 banner surmised a k 4 tail form for two dimensional wave number spectrums the study explains the importance of directional spread of energy which is dependent on the variations of the slope of the wave spectrum in oceanic scales the study by siadatmousavi et al 2012 recommended the use of n 5 rather than the default value of n 4 for swan the east coast of india characterized by narrow continental shelf width compared to the west coast experiences wave climate which is generally rough during the southwest monsoon june to september and comparatively calm during the remaining part of the year chandramohan et al 1991 neetu et al 2006 at the nearshore region sudden decrease in water depth causes the waves to surge further during extreme events kumar et al 2004 creating severe coastal hazards on an average over the year wave period varies from 9 to 12 s while wave periods in the range of 10 14s were reported sarma 1986 kumar et al 2004 during storm conditions a maximum hs of about 2 25 m over western bay of bengal during summer monsoon was reported by sathe et al 1979 during march to september the waves approach the coast predominantly from the se and from the east during december to february along the indian coast in general the wave spectra are multi peaked harish and baba 1986 vethamony and sastry 1986 often with two peaks prasada rao and baba 1996 during extreme events the frequency energy spectra are single peaked with maximum energy distribution in a narrow frequency band while the spectra are multi peaked kumar et al 2003 and energy is distributed over a wide range of frequencies in different directions for other seasons aboobacker et al 2009 several studies are carried out in the east coast of india to study nearshore wave characteristics prasad et al 2009 sharmila et al 2015 jena et al 2017 in the indian scenario considerable research was carried in specific at the visakhapatnam location kumar et al 2001 2014 suresh et al 2010 balakrishnan nair et al 2013 sirisha et al 2015 2017 murty et al 2016 the significant wave height observed by suresh et al 2010 ranged from 0 88 to 2 62 m and the maximum wave height hmax ranged from 1 05 to 5 01 m for visakhapatnam with the aid of ocean state forecast system at incois balakrishnan nair et al 2013 studied the comparison of forecasted significant wave height peak wave period and direction which matched well with the measured values at visakhapatnam with forecast error si less than 20 and rms error of 0 28 m past studies conducted over coastal visakhapatnam did not pay much attention on the characteristics of high frequency tail in the wave spectrum the shallow water prediction model swan uses the default jonswap spectrum for estimating the initial condition of a nonstationary run and boundary conditions for nested swan runs in case of parametric spectral input the effect of remote forcing influences such as the swells propagating to the bay of bengal from the southern ocean can modify the wave spectra along the coast and thus demand the development of a location specific wave spectra the unique feature reported in this study is to explore location specific high frequency tail characteristics in the bay of bengal region that can be checked and extended for other coastal locations in the east coast the main objectives of this study are i nearshore simulation and validation of wave spectra at the coastal visakhapatnam location using nested wam swan model and measured data ii to analyze the temporal annual variations in wave spectra and to examine the sea swell characteristics at the study location using separation frequency method iii estimating the slope of the high frequency tail the tail is assumed to be of the form s f a f n with n the slope of the spectra estimated using the power laws and iv to compare the measured spectrum with the jonswap spectrum using the least square error method this is applied in the measured data collected using field measurements to further analyze the numeric results the analysis carried out at visakhapatnam confirms that a tail generally close to f 3 7 but with slightly different slopes above the peak frequency is observed the main objective in carrying out this analysis is to demonstrate the fact that there exist uncertainties in the slope of the spectrum at the near shore location and this is because measured spectrum do not resemble the theoretical spectra used in shallow water wave predictions models 2 study location visakhapatnam located on the eastern shore of india often called the jewel of the east coast is a coastal port city situated between 81 06 and 83 31 e of the eastern longitudes and 17 15 and 18 32 n of northern latitudes in the northern part of coastal andhra pradesh it is nestled among the hills of the eastern ghats and facing the bay of bengal to the east fig 1 visakhapatnam district is bounded by bay of bengal in the east east godavari district in the south and orissa state in the west and north directions the length of the coastline is 135 km with headland bay and small beaches apart from being a port city it is the largest city in andhra pradesh with an area of 550 km2 and is primarily an industrial city the climate over visakhapatnam is represented as tropical wet and dry the humidity levels are noted to be high during summer months and the region experiences a weather with warm summer and moderate winters from the wind and wave climate point of view kumar et al 2004 the study area is indicative of two seasons namely the rough weather season southwest monsoon june to september and the fair weather season northeast monsoon during may to september the hs varies from 1 to 3 m indian daily weather reports while during october to december it varies from 0 5 to 2 m keeping apart the cyclone cases and in the remaining part of the year it is mostly less 1 5 m over the larger part of the year the mean wave period ranges from 9 to 12s it is observed that during storm events and normal conditions the predominant offshore wave height ranges from 1 0 to 2 5 m and 0 5 0 75 m respectively in march to september and december to february the waves mainly approach the coast from the south and from the east respectively while during october to november the wave direction is observed to be unpredictable changing from south to east the region is characterized by semi diurnal tides indian tide table and the tidal ranges kumar et al 2004 are 1 43 m mean spring and 0 54 m neap tidal fine coarse sand with a mean grain size of 0 35 mm is the composition of the beach in this location 3 the wave models the model used in this study is the ocean wave model wam cycle 4 5 3 an updated version of the wam cycle 4 komen et al 1994 and gunther et al 1992 described the details of the wave model the wam model solves the spectral energy balance equation describing the two dimensional wave spectrum in the following way 1 f t c g f s i n s n l s d s where f f θ x t is the spectral energy density depending on wave frequency f wave direction θ position x and time t and deep water group velocity c g c g f θ equation 1 describes the loss gain and redistribution of energy in the spectral domain and the equation is valid for deep water with no refraction and no significant current the so called source functions on the right hand side in equation 1 describe the wind input sin nonlinear transfer snl and dissipation due to white capping sds wam cycle 4 5 is an update of the wam cycle 4 wave model which is described in komen et al 1994 and gunther et al 1992 the basic physics and numerical approaches are kept in the new release the source function integration scheme proposed by hersbach and janssen 1999 and its updates bidlot et al 2005 have been incorporated a number of additional options are also added in the new model release of wam cycle 4 5 3 gunther and behrens 2011 the new method in wam 4 5 3 is semi implicit and is based on the developments at ecmwf janssen personal communication 2 f n 1 f n δ t s 1 δ t g where s s u n 1 f n is the source function computed with the spectrum at time n and the wind speed u at time level n 1 the term g is the functional derivative of the source function given by g g u n 1 f n the wave model dissipation source function has been reformulated in terms of a mean steepness parameter and mean frequency that gives more emphasis on the high frequency part of the spectrum and results in a more realistic interaction during transition between wind sea and swell this has allowed the relaxation of the prognostic frequency range over which the model equations are integrated a few other small adjustments were also necessary to take advantage of the increased dynamic range of the model bidlot et al 2005 based on the action density equation the swan booij et al 1999 is a wind wave model specifically developed for coastal areas the governing equation in swan model is represented in the form 3 n t c x n x c y n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s σ where the symbols represent the following σ intrinsic frequency θ direction x and y are horizontal coordinates and t is the time n is the action density represented as n σ θ x y t the local rate of change of action density in time is represented by the first term on the left hand side of equation 3 the propagation of action in geographical x y space respectively with propagation velocities cx and cy is represented by the second and third terms in equation 3 the fourth term represents the relative shift in frequency due to variations in depth and currents with propagation velocity cσ in σ space the fifth term represents the depth and current induced refraction with propagation velocity cθ in θ space the term s s σ θ x y t at the right hand side of the action balance equation 3 is the source term representing the effect of generation dissipation and non linear wave interactions small descriptions of the source sink terms used for various processes is described below and the contribution of the net source sink terms in shallow waters stot is given as 4 stot sin snl3 snl4 sds w sds b sds br sin represents the wave growth by the wind the terms snl3 snl4 represents the non linear transfer of the wave energy through three and four wave interactions respectively the loss of energy due to white capping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking is represented by sds w sds b and sds br respectively further details are available in the research works by booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 and swan team 2012 it is to be noted that the basic scientific philosophy of swan is identical to that of wam swan is a third generation wave model and it uses the same formulations for the source terms but swan contains some additional formulations primarily for shallow water and moreover the numerical techniques are very different 4 data and methodology 4 1 input winds the era interim wind field is used in the present study to force the wave models era interim is a reanalysis of the global atmosphere covering the data rich period dee et al 2011 since 1979 originally era interim ran from 1989 but the 10 year extension for 1979 1988 was produced in 2011 and continuing in real time with spatial resolutions from 2 5 2 5 0 25 0 25 the era interim project was initiated in 2006 to provide a bridge between ecmwf s previous reanalysis era 40 1957 2002 and the next generation extended reanalysis envisaged at ecmwf the data assimilation system used to produce era interim is based on a 2006 release of the integrated forecast system ifs cycle 31r2 the system includes a 4 dimensional variational analysis 4d var with a 12 h analysis window the spatial resolution of the data set is approximately 80 km t255 spectral on 60 vertical levels from the surface up to 0 1 hpa zonal and meridional components of 6 hourly era interim winds with spatial resolutions of 1 1 and 0 25 0 25 are used in this study to force the wam and swan models respectively 4 2 buoy data off visakhapatnam in this study wave measurements utilized off visakhapatnam 17 62 n 83 25 e is located at depth of 18 m the data well directional wave rider buoy maintained by earth system science organization esso indian national centre for ocean information services incois for the period november 2011 to december 2015 is used in the present study the horizontal and vertical acceleration are measured by directional buoy using accelerometers and flux gate compass gives directional displacement in both the axis horizontal and vertical displacement of buoy in vertical and horizontal directions is calculated the buoy measures waves with periods in the range of 1 6 30s and heave motion in the range of 20 to 20 m with a resolution of 1 cm the buoy data records were taken at a frequency of 1 28 hz for 17 min for every half an hour the buoy wave spectra were obtained using fft fast fourier transform wherein fft of eight series each consisting of 256 measured vertical elevations from the buoy is added to obtain the spectra with high cut off at 0 58 hz the average wave spectra recorded between november 2011 to december 2015is used in this study to validate the wave spectra and to estimate the slope of the high frequency tail in the shallow water nearshore regions in visakhapatnam as indicated in literature balakrishnan nair et al 2014 for near shore applications the wave rider buoy data sets sandhya et al 2016 sirisha et al 2017 used in this study are proven insitu measurements thus it is satisfactorily utilized with confidence for estimation of spectral slope of the high frequency tail this data has missing months may june july and december of 2012 january and may of 2013 and may 2014 hence the spectral analysis is carried out for the 4 years keeping data gaps in consideration 4 3 methods and model set up to study the shallow water tail characteristics off visakhapatnam the average wave spectrum for a four year period november 2011 to december 2015 is analyzed in this study fig 2 shows the monthly average spectrum for the period november 2011 to december 2015 that clearly depicts double peaked wave spectra which are wind sea dominated seen during june fig 2 f july fig 2 g and november fig 2 k this characteristic feature noticed in the spectrum is attributed to the locally generated waves that dominate the swells during the southwest monsoon period in comparison with other periods normally the wave spectra kumar et al 2003 are either double or multi peaked in bay of bengal owing to existence of wind seas aboobacker et al 2009 together with young swells during extreme events the location is characterized by single peaked wave spectra and it is noted that the low frequency region in the wave spectrum is demonstrated as the area of high energy concentration the present study attempts to determine the spectral slope of wave spectrum using power and regression laws analysis clauset et al 2009 and there by reaching at a best fit for the coastal location to achieve the best use of buoy data in estimating the slope of the spectrum the buoy wave spectrum was first validated using swan spectrum at the coastal location the nested wam swan set up formed as a multi scale approach as shown in fig 3 was used in this study to simulate waves off visakhapatnam the wave model experiments of the outer coarse grid domain d1 domain d1 30 e to 120 e 70 s to 30 n as shown in fig 3 were performed using wam cycle 4 5 3 on an even latitude longitude grid over a 1 1 grid resolution the spectral domain was discretized into 25 logarithmically spaced frequency bins ranging from 0 041 to 0 411 hz wave spectrum obtained at each grid point was stored in every 6 hrs for the entire experiment the bathymetry for the study area was prepared using blended etopo2 earth topography 2 min data set the boundary conditions from the coarse domain d1 is nested into the intermediate domain d2 over a grid resolution of 0 25 0 25 d2 77 5 e to 94 5 e and 0 5 n to 29 5 n it is then nested to the inner domain d3 over a 0 1 0 1 grid resolution 80 e to 87 e and 14 n to 21 n which is the area considered for the present study the swan model utilized the boundary conditions from d1 to simulate waves in d2 and d3 domains in the first simulation all three domains are considered to accommodate for swells reaching the coastal location from southern ocean swan has an implicit integration scheme the number of bins in frequency and directional space are 33 and 36 respectively that accounts for the frequency space in the surface gravity spectrum the frequency ranges between 0 04 hz and 0 58 hz wind input source term is obtained based on the formulation by komen et al 1984 whereas the default settings apply to other source and sink terms model simulations are operated in a non stationary mode with 30 min of computational time step by the standard wave steepness method of national data buoy centre gilhousen and hervey 2001 sea and swell components from wave spectra are separated between november 2011 to december 2015 by selecting separation frequency f s that divide the wave spectrum into its sea swell components estimations are made the steepness function ξ f and separation f s are as follows 5 ξ f 8 π m 2 f g m 0 f 6 f s c f m where fm frequency of maximum of ξ f g is the acceleration due to gravity m0 and m2 gilhousen and hervey 2001 are the zero and second order spectral moments and c 0 75 is empirically determined constant fitting of observed spectra to parametric spectra is done using the principle of least square error with the measured and fitted spectra the jonswap model is used to study the fit in the measured spectra off visakhapatnam as in case of parametric mode spectrum the jonswap spectrum is given below 7 e f α g 2 2 π 4 f 5 e x p 5 4 f f p 4 γ e x p f f p 2 2 σ 2 f p 2 jonswap spectrum was proposed by joint north sea wave project hasselmann et al 1973 for fetch limited sea states where f is the frequency α is the high frequency spectral level g is the gravitational acceleration fp is the peak frequency γ is the peak enhancement factor and σ is the spectral width in the peak region equivalent to σa for f fp and σb for f fp here σa and σb are assumed haselmann et al 1973 to be equivalent to 0 07 and 0 09 respectively the jonswap model reduces to pm model pierson and moskowitz 1964 since γ is equivalent to unity in the past spectral fitting methods have been reported by many researchers such as acar 1983 moon and oh 1988 tucker and pitt 2001 piscopia 2003 feld and mork 2004 yilmaz 2007 and yilmaz and ozhan 2014 yilmaz 2007 reported that acar 1983 based iterative fitting method gives least si values and has comparatively lesser deviation from the methods of violante carvalho et al 2002 and moon and oh 1998 thus in this study acar 1983 based fitting method is used to fit jonswap spectrum to measured data in this method spectral densities at the middle of frequency band δf are calculated by altering values of spectral parameters α γ and fp with increments to determine the least square errors while keeping σa and σb fixed by values of 0 07 and 0 09 respectively the iterative procedure commences with fp and then corresponding α is estimated giving the least square fit the combinations of α γ and fp are detected for the least errors as the first estimates α1 γ1 and fp1 using first estimates as initials more accurate estimates yilmaz 2007 are investigated by tuning the values with varying increments in next step the ranges for α γ and fp runs through the smaller and higher adjacent values around the first estimates it is repeated three times to obtain final estimates of α γ and fp to quantify and assess the fit of the spectra the scatter index si is used yilmaz and ozhan 2014 5 results and discussion the performance of swan model is assessed in this study by comparing with insitu measurements off coastal visakhapatnam location in addition validation of coastal wave spectra using ecmwf era interim winds is demonstrated the estimation of wave spectral slope is achieved using power laws and separation of wind sea and swell is executed to analyze the shallow water characteristics at the study location lastly the measured spectra are compared with jonswap spectra the model performance was assessed qualitatively using several statistical measures such as bias root mean square error rmse scatter index si correlation coefficient r percentage error pe and model performance index mpi bias is the mean difference between model and observations rmse is defined as the square root of the mean of the squares of the difference between model and observed parameters scatter index is defined as the standard deviation of the difference between model output and observations normalized by mean of observations correlation coefficient measures the linear correlation between observation and model and ranges from 1 to 1 a value of high positive correlation signifies to what extent the forecast data follows the observed trend the various statistical error metrics used are as follows 8 b i a s 1 n m o b s 9 r m s e 1 n m o b s 2 10 s i r m s e o b s 11 r m m o b s o b s m m 2 o b s o b s 2 12 m p i 1 r m s e r r o r r m s c h a n g e s where m and obs represents the model output and buoy observations respectively over a time series of n number of data points where m and o b s are the mean values 5 1 comparison of swan spectra with coastal buoy measurements the spectral representation of the sea state is essential to determine a distinct description of the energy levels from wind waves and swells in this context the validation of buoy spectra is extremely important by comparing with the model simulated wave spectra most importantly the validation of a model for a particular geographical area against measurements is an essential step in the advancement of wave prediction and analysis khandekar 1998 the comparison is made between buoy and model derived 1d wave spectra at coastal visakhapatnam location in bay of bengal based on the buoy data collected for four years from november 2011 to december 2015 the monthly averaged wave spectrum off visakhapatnam is utilized in this study to compare the simulated wave spectra at the coastal location for the period november 2011 to december 2015 it is shown that over the period january to december double peaked spectra is a prominent feature the location clearly depicts the co existence of wind seas and swells throughout the year the existence of double peak spectra owes to the locally generated sea breeze and propagations of intermediate and long period swells towards the north indian ocean it shows that post monsoon season ne monsoon and april pre monsoon is characterized by double peaked wave spectra with dominating swells similarly pre monsoon may southwest monsoon june july august and post monsoon october and november showed presence of double peaked spectra with dominating wind seas a characteristic feature noted is that during the month of september the co existence of wind seas and swells were prominent with clearly visible swell domination the spectral peak in the low frequency region indicates the dominance of distance swells fig 2 i the validation of wave spectra was executed using ecmwf era interim winds as input for a period of four years november 2011 to december 2015 figs 4 and 5 shows the comparison of wave spectra off visakhapatnam for the period november 2011 to december 2013 and january 2014 to december 2015 respectively in general the validation over the period of study demonstrates that the swan model overestimated the peak energies during june and august with slight underestimation in july whereas during the rest of the months the model was able to estimate peak frequencies well although in coastal region the peak energies are underestimated the significant under prediction by swan model was noted in the months of september to may an important feature is that the model performed extremely well during august and september compared with other months during the period of study fig 4 a t shows the comparison between measured and predicted frequency spectrum 1d for visakhapatnam coastal location november 2011 to december 2013 in the comparison made between the measured and predicted frequency spectrum id it was found that the model could reproduce low frequencies during november to december 2011 january to april 2012 and october to november 2012 although at the same time it accurately predicted peak frequencies nevertheless energies at buoy location are under predicted for all months in 2011 and 2012 the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 69 to 0 99 percentage error pe ranged from 7 to 38 with the highest being the month of april 2012 mpi varied from 0 59 to 0 98 the very low performance indices during april 2012 fig 4 f are due to the fact that at the coastal region the input wind speed is weak being the fair weather season but peak energies were slightly over predicted during august 2012 fig 4 g whereas peak frequencies are precisely predicted the month of september 2012 fig 4 h demonstrated a good standalone comparison r 0 99 b 0 06 rmse 0 09 si 0 11 pe 7 0 mpi 0 98 which in turn indicated the effect of long distant swells nayak et al 2013 propagating into the study region the results indicate that growth of energy spectrum and its shift to lower frequencies was accurately reproduced by swan model table 1 shows the peak energies m2 hz simulated by the buoy and model at the coastal location for the period of study the peak energies simulated by buoy and model in december 2011 august and september 2012 were 1 07 0 80 1 50 1 61 and 1 18 1 01 m2 hz respectively the validation results for the month of december 2011 fig 2 b are comparable with the results reported by balakrishnan nair et al 2013 the agreement between measured and forecasted 1d wave spectra is generally good at visakhapatnam during 27 december 2011 06 hrs 28 december 2011 00hrs 29 december 2011 09 hrs and 30 december 2011 11 hrs during february to december 2013 the comparisons revealed similar trends of underestimation during fair weather seasons and overestimation in rough weather seasons it is noted that in the year 2013 the pe ranges were high in the order 5 41 with si ranging from 0 08 to 0 87 the pe is low5 for august and 10 for june and july respectively with a high mpi 0 97 0 96 0 95 showing that the performance of swan model in simulating the peak energies at nearshore area in june july and august 2013 was extremely well peak energies simulated by buoy and model in april 2013 were 0 64 and 0 32 m2 hz respectively during the months of june to september 2013 also the simulated energies were notable the simulated peak energies during june by buoy and model are 1 54 and 1 69 m2 hz whereas these were 2 07 and 1 76 m2 hz during september the months of july 1 50 m2 hz and august 1 03 m2 hz performed equally well in simulating the peak energies as shown in table 1 fig 5 a k shows the comparison between measured and predicted frequency spectrum 1d for visakhapatnam coastal location january to december 2014 the comparison made between measured and predicted frequency spectrum id for visakhapatnam jan to dec 2014 revealed that peak energies were overestimated during june and august by the model fig 5 e g with a pe 7 during the rest of the months of 2014 peak frequencies represented well although the peak energies are under estimated at the coastal location this could be attributed due to weak wind conditions dominant during the fair weather seasons during july 1 77 1 61 m2 hz and september 2014 0 70 0 61 m2 hz the peak energies were slightly underestimated with pe of the order 11 the clear primary swell peak in september 2014 also indicated the swells from southern ocean reaching the study location in october 2014 a very severe cyclonic storm vscs hudhud crossed north andhra pradesh coast over visakhapatnam coast between 0600 and 0700 utc of 12th october 2014 sirisha et al 2015 murty et al 2016 it was the most severe cyclone that struck visakhapatnam in the past three decades with the core of hurricane winds the peak energies of 1 69 m2 hz simulated by swan model is evident fig 5 i due to the cyclone hudhud the model was able to reproduce the energy at buoy location the buoy simulated very high peak energy in the order of 2 14 m2 hz that was highest during 2014 table 1 the analysis also revealed a high pe of 33 and 37 mpi of 0 66 and 0 59 in february and april respectively it is most important to note that the predictions were under predicted during january to april 2014 fig 5 a d and during october to december 2014 fig 5 i k being a fair weather season long swells dominate over the study area and the different representation of swell propagation in model physics could be a possible reason for this deviation similar trends in comparison were observed during january to december 2015 as shown in fig 5 l w the comparisons revealed correlation of the order 0 79 to 0 98 with si ranging from 0 13 to 0 61 the pe varied in the range 7 34 for the year 2015 while the months of july august and september showed very low pe 12 the peak energies simulated during these months were notable as the model performed reasonably well in capturing the peak energies at the coastal location the peak energies simulated by buoy and model are 1 71 1 49 1 21 1 31 and 1 05 0 91 m2 hz for july august and september respectively it is inferred from table 2 that the wave spectra derived from the model matched fairly well with the observed wave spectra during 2011 2015 qualitatively the model output obtained here are moderately consistent with those obtained at the buoy location as observed in most cases the model reproduced the low energies however at the buoy location it could not reproduce peak energies in most cases hence it becomes noticeable from the results that the model performs differently in different season and wave spectra figs 4 and 5 reveals that the wave field comprises of both wind seas and swells a four year 2011 2015 observation between model and buoy when statistically compared during pre post northeast and southwest monsoon periods shows that rmse varies from 0 03 m to 0 24 m indicating a moderate fit the model computed wave spectra are similar to buoy wave spectra in general and follow the change in energy level a match between model and measurements can also be expressed using scatter index si lower the values of si better the fit becomes the variation in absolute value of si from 0 21 to 0 62 indicates a deviation between model and measured data the pe ranged from 2 04 southwest monsoon to 31 9 pre monsoon with mpi ranging from 0 98 south west monsoon to 0 65 pre monsoon therefore best performances were revealed by comparison statistics for the south west monsoon moderate performance for post monsoon and northeast monsoon seasons and very poor performance for pre monsoon overall the nested model is deficient in reproducing the sea state dominated by swell figs 4 and 5 a partial reason for which could be the inaccuracies in the boundary conditions specified by wam and also attributed to the quality of input wind fields 5 2 estimation of high frequency spectral slopes the validated wave spectra for coastal visakhapatnam location provided enough confidence in using the data to analyze the hf tail characteristics at study location the major control on the behavior of the high frequency tail of spectrum is connected to the energy balance of wind waves produced by the local wind fields as the wind takes longer interval torsethaugen and haver 2004 blowing over a fetch the wave energy for a given frequency reaches the equilibrium range the balance in energy input from wind is maintained by wave breaking and also by the loss of energy to other frequency in a study by greenslade 2001 it is noted that the spectral peak suddenly jumps to a different frequency when energy shifts from one portion of the spectrum to another during extreme sea states the wave spectra are single peaked with maximum energy centred in a narrow frequency band the spectra shows double or multi peaks at occasions when the swell energy corresponds to the region where the locally generated waves are present swell dominated sea states are observed normally during fair weather season based on the prevailing local winds the primary and secondary peaks will be observed in the low and high frequency regions respectively a characteristic feature prevailing in the monsoon season is the propagation of distant swells which in turn modifies the wave spectra leading to change in peak energy driven by predominating winds at the location in this study the average wave spectrum is analyzed connected to each month for complete four years with the help of database from 2011 to 2015 with data gaps monthly averaged wave spectra were examined for all years and the study in turn reveals that the spectra has a seasonal variation showing single and double peaked characteristics estimation of slope of hf tail was carried out using power law and power regression laws a power regression law of form ln y b ln x a and a regression power law of the form y b x m has been fitted to the average spectrum and the resultant exponent of the hf tail for all years are given in table 3 fig 6 shows the estimated spectral slope of the hf tail using power law for january to december 2015 the hf tail of the monthly average spectrum was fitted with a power law representing the best fit from the spectral estimates only hf tail of the wave spectrum is considered in the estimation of slope in the case of bimodal spectrum the calculation takes into consideration the slope in the region between the highest frequencies to that corresponding frequency of the spectral peak nearest to the highest frequency table 3 shows the slope in high frequency tail of the monthly averaged wave spectrum during different years the slope during june 2011 2015 varied from n 3 18 to 3 58 and during january 2011 2015 the exponent varied from n 2 12 to 2 52 in february the slope ranged from n 1 80 to 2 57 for the month of july the range of slope varied between 3 38 and 3 61 whereas during november it varied between 2 06 and 2 85 the maximum slope occurs during october 2013 3 77 and minimum in february 2015 1 80 annually the range of the slope was between 2 29 and 2 77 2 44 to 3 48 2 46 to 3 77 2 06 to 3 58 and 1 81to 3 61 for the years 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively in most cases it is observed that the average spectra had a very pronounced linear tail as shown in fig 6 it is significant that the goodness of fit of a statistical model is determined that describes how well it fits to a given set of observations the inconsistency between observed values and the expected values under the model is summarized by the measures of goodness of the fit hence an attempt was made where the goodness of fit would be evaluated for the power law fit with the use of metrices such as residential sum of squares rss sum of squared errors sse coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error r table 4 shows goodness of fit statistics for a representative year 2015 using power law r2 a statistical measure that defines the degree of success of the fit in explaining the variation of data the power law provides a best fit for the measured spectrum with very high r2 value ranging from 0 97 to 0 99 this reveals the best correlation for january to december 2015 rss explains the measure of inconsistency between data and estimation model the rss value dictates a tight fit of the model to the data with small values ranging in between 0 01 and 0 74 sse measures the overall deviation of the response values from the match to the response values the variation in the sse statistics during january to december 2015 was 0 0007 0 1081 indicating the presence of smaller random error component in the model further the inferred fit will be more helpful for prediction purpose the best indicator of the fit is generally the adjacent r square statistics giving best fits closer to 1 the goodness of fit is also determined by another statistical measure namely the rmse the estimate of the standard deviation of the random component in the data the values being very low 0 0003 0 0484 indicated that the fit was more useful for prediction therefore the goodness of fit statistics gives confidence to use the power law in determining the slope of the measured spectra in the light of these outcomes attempts were additionally made to estimate the exponent using other best fits similarly trends were also obtained when the slope of the tail was calculated using other regression methods although the numerical values were quite similar a regression of the power law y b x m of the average spectra over the whole range above the spectral peak was examined the estimated spectral slope of the hf tail using power regression law for july varied from n 3 38 to 3 63 in the same way the estimated spectral slope of the hf tail was in the range n 2 07 to 2 85 during november using power regression law attempts were also made to estimate the slope from the swan model simulated wave spectra using power law the estimated slope for november 2011 january 2012 april 2013 july 2014 and october 2015 are 2 26 2 40 2 71 3 45 2 52 respectively these agree well with the measurements in the same manner the slopes estimated using regression law from model simulated wave spectra also matched well with measurements the variation of these exponents throughout 4 years for all months using both power laws is clearly depicted in table 3 which shows the exponent of the tail obtained by including all frequencies above the peak frequency using the power law table 3 shows the resultant exponent of the hf tail in order to give the best fit the estimated exponents using power regression law express the trends as observed in tables 3 and i e a regression power law of the form y b x m has been fitted to the average spectrum and the resultant exponent of the hf tail for all years are given in table 3 from the basic statistics for the spectral estimates the values of the exponent using power law for the spectral slope ranged from n 1 81 to 3 77 table 3 with a mean range of 2 53 3 03 and low standards deviations of 0 34 0 58 for the years 2011 2015 using power regression law the slope ranged from n 1 80 to 3 77 table 3 with a mean ranging from 2 53 to 3 03 and low standard deviations of 0 33 0 60 both these methods cater almost similar values for the slope except in few months the maximum estimated slope was observed in october 2013 n 3 77 and the lowest slope of n 1 81 1 80 was seen in february 2015 using both laws as shown in the distribution of slope values fig 7 a for significant wave height hs the slope increases with the increase in the significant wave height and reaches a saturation range the slope also increases on the increase in mean wave period as evident from fig 7 b the slope is observed to be maximum during southwest monsoon n 3 18 to 3 63 and post monsoon n 2 06 to 3 77 since hs is maximum being monsoon period june to september and also due to storms experienced in the month of october the slope varied in the range n 1 80 to 3 05 and n 2 73 to 3 28 during the northeast and pre monsoon seasons the slope varies significantly during the rough weather season where both wind seas and swells co exist hence there is an inter annual variation in slope for swell dominated spectra fig 8 shows the time series variation of slope for the period 2011 to 2015 the slope trails a similar trend in all years during the period of study slope variations were minimum in november to february while in june july and october variations were high it is observed that during the rough weather season the slope increases in the month of june july and then decreases in november to december over the years in the southwest monsoon season the high frequency tail slowly increases and then it decreases during post monsoon followed by a drastic decrease in slope during the northeast monsoon over the years therefore there is a seasonal variation in slope and the slope of the high frequency end of the wave spectrum becomes smoother when the wave non linearity increases apart from the long period swells originating in the southern ocean and reaching the study location the tail of spectrum is also influenced by the local wind conditions 5 3 temporal and annual variability of monthly averaged wave spectra the inter annual variations of spectral energy density for different months of 2011 to 2015 are evaluated off visakhapatnam using the monthly average spectrum the time series plot of the maximum spectral energy density over the years 2011 2015 indicates that the magnitude of the spectral energy density is high during southwest monsoon 0 3 2 07 m2 hz and the post monsoon 0 24 2 14 m2 hz seasons this is due to the persistence of strong winds along with monsoon depressions during southwest monsoon and due to the passage of cyclonic storms at the coastal location during fig 9 post monsoon seasons the energy levels during the pre monsoon season varied from 0 3 to 1 66 m2 hz the average spectral energy density observed seasonally for the southwest monsoon periods are 1 34 1 53 0 94 and 1 35 m2 hz during 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively during all the years the spectral energy density is comparatively low in the northeast monsoon 0 2 1 07 m2 hz however the energy density was notably high 2 14 m2 hz during non monsoon period october 2014 in comparison to other years in the same way in september 2013 a high energy was observed 2 07 m2 hz the annual maximum spectral energy density is 1 5 2 07 2 14 and 1 71 m2 hz in 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively growth and development of spectral components over time can be examined from wave spectral energy density in frequency time domain seasonally marked variability is seen in the temporal variations of the average spectral density with frequency for the years 2012 2015 as shown in fig 10 the spectral energy density is high during monsoon and post monsoon period in a low frequency wave range of 0 04 0 2 hz for all chosen years this explicitly proves that the area is influenced by swells indicating the presence of long period swells at the study area with noticeable effects of wind seas seen at the study location the peak wave spectral energy density is maximum in august september october and july for the years 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively since storm waves propagated along the region in 2014 higher energies are recorded during this time the peak wave spectral density 2013 2014 is observed to be less than 0 5 m2 hz for the rest two years the energies were greater than or equal to 1 5 m2 hz for the years 2012 2015 which reveals increased swell activity leading to broadening of the spectrum it is noted that variability is different in each year thus showing a seasonal variation the energies are maximum in southwest monsoon and post monsoon periods which may be partly due to storms in addition with the strong winds experienced during the monsoon season the temporal variation in the spectral energy density over the annual period is seen different the study of inter annual variations of spectral energy density for different months in 2011 2015 included the use of monthly averaged wave spectrum the important feature extracted from monthly average spectrum is the presence of huge amounts of energy in the swell frequency when related with the wind sea frequency throughout the year the monthly averaged spectra are double peaked the double peaked wave energy spectrum at the coastal location is attributed to the swells sandhya et al 2014 from the southern indian ocean and locally nayak et al 2013 generated wind seas it was revealed in the study that inter annual variations are observed in wave spectrum during all months with maximum trends between may to october reports from joint typhoon warning centre jtwc confirms that hudhud was the first cyclone which effected urban areas and it is the second strongest tropical cyclone which crossed the visakhapatnam coast after 1985 amarendra et al 2015 hudhud crossed the andaman islands on 08 october 2014 at 0930 h ist it moved west northwest and intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm on 10 october 2014 an it intensified further on 12 october and shortly before landfall near visakhapatnam coast hudhud reached its peak strength with 3 min wind speeds of 185 km hr and a minimum central pressure of 960 mbar imd report 2014 in a study by sirisha et al 2015 it is reported that maximum significant wave height forecasted by the model was 4 45 m on 12th october 0000 utc whereas observations shows a maximum 4 86 m on 12th october 0300 utc the study also highlights the fact that both wind sea and swell equally contributed to this high wave the peak values of hmax observed and forecasted are 7 26 and 7 48 m respectively for the hudhud cyclone the high peak energies of 2 14 m2 hz observed in october 2014 fig 5 i is due to cyclonic storm hudhud 8 14 october 2014 which passed off the visakhapatnam coast northwest coast of bay of bengal the inter annual variability observed in the wave spectrum is due to the changes in the local wind and the swells from the southern ocean and the variations in monsoon intensity significant variation in monthly average peak frequency of the swell is noted during all the years the swell component is high in july and october 2014 as compared to all other years during the study period while the wind sea component is high during july 2013 5 4 sea and swell characteristics off visakhapatnam the study indicates that wave energy spectra comprises single or double energy peaks one in low frequency region connected with swell and the other in the high frequency region associated with locally generated seas showing two or more different wave systems dominated over the region in this study an outline of the near shore wave characteristics at the coastal visakhapatnam location is presented with seasonal scenarios figs 11 and 12 shows the time series of hs significant wave height and tm mean wave period of the total sea swell and wind sea during 2013 2015 where the maximum observed hs is 1 74 m and the corresponding tm is 6 4s the corresponding hs and tm for swell and wind sea are 1 58 m 0 71 m and 8 6s 3 6s respectively the mean wave periods during southwest monsoon varied in the range 5 6 7 1s while during pre monsoon it varied between 4 5 and 6 3s and with maximum period 12 7s during post monsoon in the month of october 2013 during sw monsoon season waves primarily trail the swell pattern and the energy associated with the swells is quite higher figs 11 and 12 than that of the wind seas table 5 shows the monthly variations minimum and maximum of hs and tm for the swell and wind sea off visakhapatnam the swell wave heights are comparatively higher than the wind sea heights during all seasons the swell heights during pre monsoon ranged from 0 56 m to 1 29 m with the corresponding sea heights varying from 0 47 m to 0 59 m swell wave heights were generally higher during the southwest monsoon period and varied from 0 66 m to 1 58 m with corresponding sea heights in the range 0 27s 0 82s as compared to the sea heights 0 39 0 60 m the highest swell heights were observed to be equally higher in post monsoon season 0 39 m 1 57 m the northeast monsoon had slightly lower swell heights of 0 55 1 02 m with seas in the range 0 25 0 59 m similarly during pre monsoon swell period ranged from 7 6 to 9 9s with sea periods of 3 0 3 3s swell wave period during southwest monsoon were higher 8 0 9 0s as compared to sea periods of 3 2 3 6s the swell period were observed to be higher in post monsoon compared to other seasons and it varied from 7 4 to 13 8s with seas 2 7 3 2s and 7 3 10 3s with seas 2 7 3 1s during the northeast monsoon seasons from the monthly variations in hs and tm of swell and wind sea presented in table 5 it is inferred that wind sea hs 0 82 m and swell hs 1 58 m during july was the highest the swell hs was greater than 1 0 m ranged from 1 02 to 1 58 during all months from may to december while the wind sea hs was low 0 9 m during all the months the maximum swell mean period 13 8s was observed during october whereas the maximum wind sea mean period 3 6s was observed during june to september the corresponding minimum values were observed swell 7 3s during january and wind sea 2 7s during february march and november monthly percentage dominance of swell and wind sea is presented in table 6 throughout the year percentage occurrence of single double and multi peaked spectra is 11 62 69 76 and 18 60 respectively highest percentages of single double and multi peaked spectra are seen in may 100 february july and august 100 and december 50 respectively yearly 75 11 of waves prevail by swell and 24 89 by sea the dominance of swell is seen over wind sea throughout the year excepting the months of june july and november maximum swell dominance occurs during the months of may 98 7 and september 97 4 and maximum wind sea dominance occurs during july 62 3 the role of wind seas is important during june to july showing the coexistence of wind seas and swells that result in complex sea states at coastal areas in relation to seasons wind seas prevail during southwest monsoon 42 15 and post monsoon 40 15 while swells are dominant in pre monsoon 94 6 and northeast monsoon 90 25 respectively hence the coast experiences predominate swells during pre monsoon and fair weather conditions the results are in good agreement with many studies along the east coast of india suresh et al 2010 reported that the swells contribute 63 2 to hs whereas wind seas 36 8 along visakhapatnam coast between june to september patra and jena 2012 reported that the wind sea and swells are dominated by 76 and 24 annually in the cuddalore region southeast coast of india the results are also comparable with the study by kumar et al 2014 which reported that during the one year period of 2010 off gangavaram 6 km southwest of visakhapatnam single peaked spectra are observed for 56 8 of time and the remaining are predominantly swell dominated 38 4 double peaked spectra and the wind sea dominated double peaked spectra observed is only 4 8 5 5 comparison of measured and jonswap spectrum in this study the jonswap spectrum is utilized in fitting the average wave spectra at the nearshore area hence the deviation of the spectrum was estimated from the measured data the monthly average wave spectra off visakhapatnam for the years 2013 2015 is compared with the jonswap spectra the study trails the fitting method based on acar 1983 in finding out the spectral parameters α γand fp of the jonswap as discussed in the methodology section it is to be noted that in the measured spectra considered at the visakhapatnam location each of the wave systems is fitted with a jonswap fit hence if there are wind sea and a swell present both peaks are fit a fitted theoretical spectra jonswap is shown in figs 13 and 14 and 15along with the monthly average wave spectra for different months for the years 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 13 shows the comparison of measured and jonswap spectrum for the year 2013 in 2013 the spectral parameters of the jonswap model indicated variations such as α varied from 0 00005 to 0 0023 γ varied from 0 667 to 1 708 with peak frequencies ranging from 0 063 to 0 122 in 2014 the spectral parameters α ranged from 0 00005 to 0 0008 γ varied from 0 625 to 1 25 with peak frequencies ranging from 0 049 to 0 101 fig 14 similarly in 2015 α ranged from 0 00005 to 0 002 γvaried from 0 292 to 1 542 with peak frequencies ranging from 0 063 to 0 115 fig 15 these spectral parameter values obtained at the visakhapatnam location are less than the usually recommended values of α andγ 0 0081 and 3 3 used in equation 5 obtained from the original jonswap data of the north sea figs 13 15 shows the comparison of measured and jonswap fit however it is evident that the jonswap model does not fit adequately the measured spectrum in all the years taken into account it is visible from the figures that the jonswap model does not present a good fit to the low and high frequency peak it is seen that in few cases the jonswap spectrum could fairly pick the peaks but still it largely under predicts both high and low frequency components of the spectrum it fails since it is incapable of following the tail of the measured spectrum over prediction of peak frequencies is also noted in few cases although in few cases the high frequency tail match is seen but in general it can be dictated that the shape of the jonswap model fitted is such that it neglects the high frequency tail of the measured spectrum the study demonstrates that the jonswap spectra do not describe well the wave spectra both at low and high frequencies and hence do not reproduce the measured spectrum table 7 shows the statistical estimates from the comparison of measured and theoretical spectra for the period 2013 to 2015 during all the years the correlation coefficient r was high in the range 0 71 0 98 with rmse ranging from 0 02 to 0 33 although the comparisons showed fairly good correlation it is observed that the si was high during all years showing noticeable deviations from measured spectrum the si ranged from 0 41 to 1 32 0 24 to 1 73 and 0 42 to 1 07 for the years 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively this is because in most cases the high frequency peak splits into two peaks in the frequency domain suggesting that the high frequency peak comprises both swell and a wind sea several factors can lead to the high variability in the estimated parameters the observed spectral densities may also contribute to the variability with importance of sampling interval and degrees of freedom in the spectral estimation process the choice of the fitting method which estimates the parameters could be another source of error leading to biased estimates all these can contribute to the deviations with the spectral parameters as discussed in literature such as hasselmann et al 1976 lewis and allos 1990 piscopia 2003 and ardhuin 2007 thus the higher scatter indices indicate only an average performance in modelling the peaks with jonswap model at the visakhapatnam location it is concluded that the jonswap model is not a good option to better translate the wind sea and swell components of sea state as it shows sufficient deviation from the measured data with this study it is well demonstrated that the theoretical spectrum jonswap fails to describe the high frequency tail of the measured spectrum since the high frequency tail in these spectrum decays in the form f n with n values ranging from 1 80 to 3 77 hence the study reveals a need to modify the jonswap spectrum to incorporate the respective slopes at the coastal locations which is an important stride needed for operational forecasting centers the incorporation of the respective slope in the model spectrum and its performance evaluation for fair and rough weather seasons including cyclonic cases is not in the scope of the present investigation and will be taken up as a future study hence from the estimated slope and by fitting the jonswap spectrum to the measured spectrum the study suggests a deviation and it concludes that the exponents for the tails of the frequency spectra suggest a simple model spectrum with tail k 3 7 for the coastal visakhapatnam location moreover this exponent can be regarded as only site specific since it demands further analysis to extend the same exercise to other buoy locations along the east coast of india and hence confirm the variability of the spectral slope along the east coast 6 concluding remarks the high frequency spectral tail is always calculated with an inverse power law of fourth frequency by the physics of wind generated waves still a particular value for the slope of the high frequency tail of the spectrum cannot be determined by empirical studies in the shallow water models an inverse fifth power proportionality is followed by the jonswap spectrum the present study discusses and analyze the data for the high frequency tail of the wave spectrum using buoy measurements of wave energy spectra for four years off coastal visakhapatnam taking into consideration the data gaps as a limitation the following conclusions were drawn from this study based on the measured wave data 18 m deep off the east coast of india the variations in wave spectral characteristics of the high frequency spectrum during 2011 2015 are studied it is seen that the variability differs in each year showing a seasonal variation with maximum energies concentrated in the months of southwest monsoon 0 30 2 07 m2 hz and post monsoon 0 24 2 14 m2 hz which were partially attributed to storms apart from strong winds experienced during the southwest monsoon season and monsoon depressions the wind seas and swells off visakhapatnam have been separated from the measured wave spectra using the separation frequency method and monthly characteristics have been analyzed swell dominance is seen to be maximum during may 98 7 and september 97 4 and maximum sea dominance is observed in july 62 3 the role of wind seas is notable in june to july indicating the coexistence of wind seas and swells resulting in complex sea states at nearshore areas the study also reports on the application of an nested wave model to simulate and validate wave spectra off coastal visakhapatnam located in the east coast of india the study investigated the overall performance of nested wave model at the visakhapatnam location using ecmwf era interim wind fields and executing analysis based on prominent seasons among all the seasons the southwest monsoon season is rated best for the model performance the results show that model spectra closely follow the buoy spectra however with exception to reproduce well the very high energy waves the study of the slope of the high frequency side of wave frequency spectrum suggest a power decay with exponent ranging from n 1 80 to 3 77 using both power laws and none of the data support the original phillips theory with f 5 high frequency tail the exponent n is less than 3 8 for the buoy located in coastal visakhapatnam at a depth of 18 m the exponents for the tails of the frequency spectra suggest a simple model spectrum with tail k 3 7 for the coastal visakhapatnam location this work is a preliminary attempt to show that there exists considerable uncertainty on the true value of the slope and that the measured spectrum does not follow the jonswap spectrum at the study location utilizing the least square error method the mean wave spectra are used to fit and compare with the jonswap spectrum model at the visakhapatnam location theγvalues are smaller than the value of 3 3 obtained from the original jonswap data belonging to the north sea and α values are less than 0 0081 the jonswap spectrum do not match well with the measured data for the coastal location indicating high scatter index ranging from 0 24 to 1 73 this highlights the need for revision of an existing formulation or to obtain a new mathematical formula for use in nearshore wave modelling it can be realized by incorporating the respective slopes n 1 80 to 3 77 obtained in this study the study in demonstrating the usage of respective slope obtained from this investigation in the swan model spectrum and its performance evaluation for fair and rough weather seasons including cyclonic cases are not in the scope of the present study and will be taken up as a future study further the estimation of the high frequency tail of wave spectra from measured wave data has to be performed for other locations along the east coast of india and hence the existing jonswap spectrum can be modified with the exponent values achieved for the north indian ocean that can lead to the development of a best possible spectrum with respective slopes hence largely the study analyzes the measured wave data to estimate the high frequency spectral slope further as a future scope the results can be used to evolve an equation in similar to the jonswap spectrum in addition the investigation aims to extend for other coastal locations over the east coast of india and hence recommend unified spectra for the bay of bengal region moreover this study will attempt to incorporate the developed location specific wave spectra in wave model and explore its performance over shallow water locations by utilizing the wave measurements available this study can be easily extended to other coastal locations with an overall goal to develop a generic wave spectrum for the bay of bengal region this assures wide practical applications in operational centers as well therefore the study aims to develop

22991,in this paper a three dimensional constitutive ice model with nonlinear viscoelastic and plastic components acting in series is proposed for the dynamic simulation of ice structure interactions the former component corresponds to a nonlinear burgers model in which the deviatoric behaviour is viscoelastic and the volumetric behaviour is elastic the burgers model is combined with the well accepted glen s law and ashby and duval law to describe the time dependent behaviour and distribution in relaxation time a hydrostatic pressure and octahedral shear stress dependent tsai wu type yield criterion is adopted to invoke the plastic state the proposed ice model is assumed to be isotropic and is implemented in the commercial software ls dyna as a user defined material verification of this model is implemented via simulations of creep and indentation experiments and via the simulation of a scenario of ice rigid steel plate collision the simulation of creep experiments shows that this material model can reflect the viscoelastic properties of ice quite well the calculated contact force and pressure area curves agree well with the results of indentation experiments and the ice rigid steel plate collision example yields reasonable results indicating that the proposed model has a good capacity for describing the brittle behaviour of ice the numerical verification proves that the proposed ice material model has a wide range of potential applications keywords ice structure interaction ice model viscoelastic plastic model burgers model numerical simulation 1 introduction the exploration of arctic sea routes and oil and gas resources has become a trend in recent years driven by climate warming technological development and economic benefits khon et al 2010 ostreng et al 2013 these changes will make the activities of ships and marine structures more frequent in arctic however ice structure interactions may cause serious damage to marine structures and ships even resulting in sinking in serious conditions such as collisions as well as leakage of oil and natural gas hill 2006 numerical simulation is an important method to investigate ice structure interactions and one of the key difficulties is in establishing an accurate ice material constitutive model the mechanical characteristics of ice are complex including elasticity delayed elasticity plasticity and brittleness ice shows different deformation characteristics under different conditions the review of ice properties can be found in barrette and jordaan 2001 and schulson and duval 2009 the behaviour of ice is affected by many factors such as temperature loading rate brine and porosity for example when temperature decreases or strain rate increases the post peak stress will decrease quickly with strain and the ice deformation will transit from ductile region to brittle region as shown in fig 1 therefore establishing a relatively complete constitutive model has always been a challenging task most models contain only parts of the ice characteristics and only a small portion of the models have been used in finite element tools to simulate ice structure interaction for the spatial scale ice structure interaction is concerned with global ice loads and local ice loads the former represents the resultant force on the structure and is related to the design of overall structure timco and sudom 2013 while the local ice loads are applied on a small and defined portion of a large area and is related to the local structure to be designed the process simulated in this paper is this kind of local ice structure interaction with ice load acting on a panel or plating between frames jordaan et al 2005 the contact area is smaller than 3 m2 in the simulation part of this paper masterson et al 2007 proposed a local pressure area curve applying to contact area less than 10 m2 obtained from field measurement small and medium scale indentation experiments iso standard 2010 adopted this relation and it is used for comparison in section 4 2 and section 4 3 for the ice behaviour and failure process in the local ice structure interaction jordaan 2001 proposed a systematical elaboration to describe it ice loads are mainly transmitted to the structure through high pressure zones 90 according to johnston et al 1998 ice of high pressure zones is under high confinement due to the surrounding ice and structure and cracks are suppressed so the ice there is highly damaged with recrystallization and will be crushed and extruded while the ice around high pressure zones fails in a brittle manner ice is at a relatively high strain rate in common ice structure interactions such as collision scenarios where ice strain rate is higher than 10 3 s according to liu et al 2011 except for structures subjected to creep of level ice especially when the temperature rises where the ice strain rate is relatively low lower than 10 5 and ductile deformation dominates in addition confinement also influences the ice behaviour even for ice structure interaction in high rates the ice of high pressure zones deforms in a ductile manner with damage one type of the existing ice material models is the ones with physical basis these models emphasize the description of internal microscopic changes of ice such as crystal dislocations grain boundary sliding micro cracks cracks propagation and interaction which need further experimental research of the micromechanics and is still in the initial stages some physical based material models can be referred to cole 1995 cole 1998 kolari 2013 and kolari 2017 another main type is the phenomenological models based on the theory of viscoelasticity plasticity leclair et al 1999 to describe the macroscopic phenomenon relation between stress strain time etc other than the microscopic mechanism inside ice a model represented by rheological elements including springs and dashpots is an effective method and is also the way to establish the material model in this paper there have been many researches about the viscoelasticity viscoplasticity of ice experimental studies have shown that the ice continuum deformation is composite according to the features whether time dependent recoverable the ice deformation can be decomposed into instant elastic delayed elastic growing with time at constant stress and recoverable and viscous or plastic deformation irrecoverable glen 1955 proposed an equation related with temperature to describe the relation between viscous strain rate and stress and is well accepted many laboratory experiments have been conducted since 1970s to investigate the ice continuum deformation and used glen law to describe the viscous behaviour and relevant mechanical parameters were obtained see e g barnes 1971 jones 1982 mellor and cole 1982 sinha 1982 jones and chew 1983 durham et al 1983 rist and murrell 1994 gagnon and gammon 1995 schulson and nickolayev 1995 jones et al 2003 jellinek and brill 1956 adopted a one dimensional maxwell voigt model to describe the viscoelastic deformation of ice because the delayed elastic strain of ice display a distribution of retardation times a large number of kelvin units acting in series can capture this behaviour xiao 1997 used 1 mx unit and 3 k units to simulate the viscoelastic deformation and applied the model to finite element analysis to take numerical simulations and compared the results with creep experiments the results corresponded with the tested curves and the distribution of recovering strain in unloading phase was also simulated successfully however more rheological units bring more mechanical parameters need to be determined through experiments and this makes the application of this type of model difficult leclair et al 1999 applied an equation originally used for creep of polymeric material to simulate the viscoelastic deformation of ice and obtained the parameters through cycle loading experiments ji et al 2005 and gang et al 2006 established two viscoelastic plastic models with mohr coulomb yielding criterion and drucker prager yield criterion respectively the delayed elastic deformation was represented by kelvin unit the models were applied to simulate ice dynamics using smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph it was found the singular problem in the mohr coulomb yield criterion was overcame by the drucker prager criterion some studies suggest that the tsai wu type of yield criterion is more suitable for describing the behaviour of ice e g varsta 1983 derradji aouat 2003 summarised and analysed ice strength data of the previous experiments and used multiple elliptical surfaces to describe the failure of ice zhou et al 2016 conducted experiments on columnar ice and adopted initial yield hardening and subsequent yield to describe the ice behaviour it was found that the initial and subsequent yield surfaces maintained elliptical shape in the plane of effective stress versus hydrostatic stress some models were combined with continuum damage theory representing micro cracks to simulate the quasi brittle behaviour of ice ortiz et al 2015 adopted the elastic mazars damage model to describe the fragile response of ice and the compressive failure of ice cylinders under high speed loading was simulated taylor and jordaan 2014 used schapery s damage theory and element erosion techniques in finite element method to simulate the brittle process of ice and obtained the contact pressure time curve saksala et al 2015 combined continuum damage and embedded discontinuity to describe the strain stress relation of ice two dimensional simulations were conducted and the strain softening behaviour can be simulated however damage based models need a robust material model without damage to completely describe ice behaviors leclair et al 1999 and these brittle models usually ignored the capacity of simulating viscoelasticity especially the delayed elastic behaviour in fact all these characteristics are included in ice material one or more features will be evoked in a given scenario and there is no definite boundary between these characteristics and the lack of ability to describe viscoelastic behaviour limits the scope of application of the model conditions with higher temperature slow interaction high confinement such as high pressure zones cannot be simulated therefore it is meaningful to establish a comprehensive model that can be applied to a wider range of scenarios the main objective of this study is to establish a comprehensive three dimensional ice constitutive model that can be used in finite element method based on viscoelastic plastic theory to simulate the ice structure interaction the viscoelastic behaviour is described with an improved burgers model 1 mx and 1 k units acting in series which is based on the laws summarised from experimental results and takes the influence of temperature and confining pressure into account thus can reflect the viscoelastic behaviour of ice more accurately the viscous relation is based on glen s law 1955 and the delayed elastic relation is based on ashby and duval law 1985 the deviatoric and volumetric parts are constructed separately a tsai wu type criterion is adopted to evoke the plastic deformation and an empirical failure criterion based on the effective plastic strain and hydrostatic pressure is adopted to determine the failure of ice elements in general plastic theory is used to describe the ductile behaviour of ice for the numerical simulation of ice structure interaction the plastic theory can be applied to brittle region for predicting the ice load in a proper way liu 2011 proposed an elastic plastic model with the combination of element erosion to simulate ice ship collision scenario and the ice load was well predicted in addition plastic theory based ice model has a potential for further development it can be developed to model the post peak softening behaviour and the ductile brittle transition of ice therefore the model proposed in this paper can reflect the viscoelasticity of ice and also can simulate the ice load of collision where ice fails mainly in brittle region this model can be used for the simulation of isotropic freshwater ice and iceberg ice with low brine content two typical experiments conducted on ice including a creep experiment and a medium scale indentation experiment and a collision scheme between ice and a rigid plate were simulated to verify the performance of this model it is shown that the proposed ice model can simulate the comprehensive characteristics during the ice structure interaction scenario the proposed ice model can be applied in fem simulations to give structural safety assessments for arctic ships during their design phases or provide evaluations for other ice structure interaction related engineering practices 2 description of the constitutive viscoelastic plastic ice material model the ice model proposed in this paper is an incremental viscoelastic plastic model the viscoelastic constitutive law corresponds to a nonlinear burgers model the yield criterion marking the beginning of the plastic phase corresponds to the tsai wu yield surface and the associated flow rule is adopted the numerical implementation is based on a differential method and return mapping algorithm 2 1 viscoelastic plastic constitutive law for ice material the deformation of ice are composed of several components instantaneous elastic delayed elastic viscous and plastic components fig 2 illustrates the typical one dimensional ice creep behaviour including the characteristics of the generation and recovery of the first three deformation components under a constant external force the instantaneous elastic strain ε e often makes up a small portion of the total strain of ice and it s reversible and time independent it is followed by a period of transient creep which is composed of delayed elastic strain ε d and viscous strain ε v and then a steady strain rate stage where the viscous strain dominates the delayed elastic strain manifests as a gradually increasing strain for which the increase slows with time and the strain can also fully recover and after the external load is removed the deformation will relax with a distribution of relaxation times rather than a single relaxation time manifesting as the fully recovery of this deformation will take a much longer time than it s generation leclair et al 1999 the viscous strain is very small initially but becomes greater over time for the creep deformation of granular polycrystalline ice dislocation glide is usually the main mechanism and dislocation climb is considered as a complementary mode schulson and duval 2009 barnes et al 1971 the dislocation relaxation mechanism dominates the delayed elastic deformation of ice cole 1995 plastic strain and viscous strain are both permanent but behave in different ways in this study viscous strain is attributed to the time effect and even with a small external force it will occur the plastic strain will only be produced on the condition that the ice exceeds its elastic limit or yield limit that being the case the yield criterion and flow rule are important for the plastic strain and this will be discussed in the next section for the ice behaviour in a tri axial stress state the deformation mechanism of ice can be divided into two components volume change and shape change of the ice crystal lattice the volumetric deformation of ice is caused by the variation of the intermolecular distance under hydrostatic pressure but the shape of the ice crystal remains the same the deviatoric strain is attribute to the shape distortion of ice crystals corresponding to the effect of deviatoric stress barrette and jordaan 2001 to facilitate the establishment of a constitutive model in a tri axial stress state the ice behaviour can be decomposed into these two parts to process separately according to the above phenomena the material model proposed in this paper will be based on the following hypotheses the material model is isotropic the total deviatoric strain is assumed to be represented as the sum of instantaneous elastic strain viscous strain delayed elastic strain and plastic strain the volumetric behaviour is represented by elastic and plastic strain the viscous elastic and delayed elastic deformation will be affected by temperature therefore the total stress and strain tensors of ice can be decomposed into deviatoric part and volumetric part 1 ε i j e i j δ i j ε v o l 2 σ i j s i j δ i j p 3 δ i j 1 i j 0 i j where ε i j and σ i j are the strain and stress components e i j and s i j are the deviatoric strain and stress components ε v o l ε i i 3 and p σ i i 3 are the volumetric strain and stress and the einstein summation convention lai et al 2009 applies the total deviatoric strain rate e i j and volumetric strain rate ε v o l can be expressed as 4 e i j e i j e e i j v e i j d e i j p 5 ε v o l ε v o l e ε v o l p where e i j e e i j v e i j d and e i j p are the deviatoric elastic viscous delayed elastic and plastic strain rates respectively and ε v o l e and ε v o l p are the volumetric elastic and plastic strain rates respectively for the deviatoric viscoelastic behaviour including the first three parts a burgers model consisting of a maxwell unit and a kelvin unit arranged in series is used here fig 3 shows the burgers model elastic strain ε e and viscous strain ε v are represented by the spring and dashpot in maxwell model respectively delayed elastic strain ε d is represented by the combination of spring and dashpot arranged in parallel in the kelvin unit 2 1 1 elastic strain the elastic volumetric strain has a linear relation to the volumetric stress as does the deviatoric instantaneous elastic strain with the stress components the elastic part can be described by the generalized hooke s law 6 ε v o l e p 3 k 7 e i j e s i j 2 g m where k is the bulk modulus and g m is the shear modulus of the maxwell unit 2 1 2 viscous strain basic viscous relation can be described as a linear relation between stress and strain rate according to newton s law σ μ ε which also can be represented by the dashpot in original maxwell unit however many experiments have observed that the viscous strain rate is nonlinear with stress such as in constant stress loading experiments the viscous strain under different stress levels is in nonlinear relationship with stress at the same loading time glen s law 1955 is a well accepted equation to describe this relation in this paper the formula proposed by jones and chew 1983 which was based on glen s law and took confining pressure into account is adopted to improve the burgers model 8 ε v a exp q p v r t σ 1 σ 3 n where σ 1 σ 3 is uniaxial stress a and n are material constants q is activation energy r 8 314 j mol k is molar gas constant t is absolute temperature p is the hydrostatic pressure and v is the activation volume in order to extend this relation to three dimension the differential stress σ 1 σ 3 can be replaced by effective stress according to the isotropic assumption and the axial viscous strain rate can be written in the deviatoric form 9 e i j v s n 1 2 η m s i j 10 2 η m a 1 exp q p v r t where s i j is deviatoric stress s 3 s i j s i j 2 is the effective stress and the einstein summation convention lai et al 2009 applies according to jones and chew 1983 v equals 32 cm3 mol here the above stress unit is mpa in this equation the influence of temperature is included it is reflected in two parameters temperature t and activation energy q at the same stress level the viscous strain rate improves and ice becomes softer as temperature increases a lot of tri axial experiments were conducted in the past decades and many of the experimental data were analysed using glen s law 1955 e g durham et al 1983 barnes et al 1971 jones 1982 rist and murrell 1994 the values of the parameters were obtained and this provides a good reference for the determination of the parameters in the application of this model it was found that n is around 3 under lower stress level and could be 4 under higher stress level which is probably associated with the occurrence of micro cracking and non basal gliding rist and murrell 1994 q has different values in different temperature intervals and some of the experimental suggestions are listed in table 1 the creep tests simulated subsequently in this paper was conducted under 11 c o and the effective stress was under 10 mpa thus 3 is an ideal value for n and q 78 6 kj mol and a 6 5e8 s 1 mpa3 suggested by barnes et al 1971 is adopted for simulations of indentation tests and ice plate collision n 4 is proper as the hydrostatic pressure is over 30 mpa as calculated 2 1 3 delayed elastic stain the delayed elastic deformation in axial direction can be represented in the time power law form this can be described by part of andarade s law in which the strain is the third power of time ε t β t 1 3 glen 1955 schulson and duval 2009 where β is a parameter in this model ashby and duval s law 1985 is adopted 11 ε d b σ e 1 exp c ε v t σ e 1 m where σ is the axial stress e is the elastic modulus c 0 016 and m 3 in this model the index of time is also 1 3 the delayed elastic strain is related with the viscous strain rate thus is also dependent on temperature and confining pressure as time goes on the delayed elastic strain gradually approaches the maximum value b σ e and b is a parameter which can determine the maximum delayed strain the maximum delayed elastic strain could be ten times higher than the instantaneous elastic strain cole 1995 duval 1978 so the value of b should be around 10 or even greater equation 11 is extended to three dimensional form and the viscous strain rate is substituted by equation 9 then the deviatoric viscous strain can be expressed as 12 e i j d b s i j 2 g 1 exp c s n 1 t η m g 1 3 where g g m is the shear modulus s i j and s are deviatoric stress component and effective stress as defined in viscous strain part kelvin unit can represent the above equation the total deviatoric stress is equal to the sum of the stresses produced by the spring and the dashpot in kelvin unit as shown in fig 3 13 2 g k e i j d 6 η k t 2 3 e i j d s i j 14 g k g m b 15 2 η k g k 2 η m c b s n 1 1 3 g k 2 exp q p v r t 2 a b c s n 1 1 3 where g k η k and e i j d are the shear modulus viscous coefficient and deviatoric strain rate component of the kelvin body respectively formula 12 and 13 are equivalent because the former is the analytical solution of the latter the model shows that the delayed elastic constitutive relation is also nonlinear 2 1 4 plastic strain the law of plastic deformation is described by the plastic potential theory which is also one of the incremental plastic theories in addition the associated flow rule is adopted to specify that the direction of the plastic strain increment vector is normal to the yield surface the plastic strain rates of the deviatoric and volumetric parts are respectively expressed as follows 16 e i j p λ f σ i j ε v o l p δ i j 17 ε v o l p λ 3 f σ 11 f σ 22 f σ 33 where λ is the plastic consistency parameter and f is the yield function formulas above in combination with the yield and failure criteria described in section 2 2 below compose the viscoelastic plastic constitutive model of ice the viscoelastic and plastic strain rate parts are assumed to act in series in the condition of the offshore structure subjected from creep load produced by floating ice cover moving slowly or by level ice under rising temperature against it the strain rate is usually lower than 10 5 and time dependent deformation can be fully developed for the high rate deformation with strain rate higher than 10 3 the viscous part usually does not have enough time to develop and the model will degenerate automatically to be nearly elastic plastic 2 2 yield and failure criteria for the plastic theory establishing broadly effective yield and failure criteria is an essential task ice will undergo plastic volumetric deformation and its yield stress is dependent on hydrostatic pressure which is quite different from most metal materials and more like concrete and rock schulson 2001 studies regarding the yield criterion of ice are insufficient as of yet e g varsta 1983 und polach et al 2013 kim et al 2011 some studies have simulated the yield or failure phenomenon by using damage theory considering that the damage begins to accumulate when stress begins to decline and that ice will fail at a critical damage value however there remains a lack of unified and widely accepted damage criteria and accumulation laws another approach is to use the yield surface method which can reflect the stress or strain state when ice material yields varsta 1983 summarised different criteria and suggested tsai wu criterion is suitable for ice problems derradji aouat et al 2000 2003 2005 2010 summarised the experimental results of different kinds of ice and proposed a 3 d yield criterion based on mroz s multi surface concept which is relatively systematic and has a theoretical foundation timco and frederking 1984 proposed an n type yield function to describe the behaviour of ice liu et al 2011 and shi et al 2016 have prone separately that the last two criteria are both tsai wu type yield criterion and are hydrostatic pressure dependent because the equations can be deduced to the same form with tsai wu equation this yield criterion can cover the test data within a certain range which makes it a reasonable way to describe the yield law of ice although more data are needed to improve it the tsai wu yield surface is adopted here and can be expressed as follows derradji aouat 2003 18 f p q 3 2 q 2 a 0 a 1 p a 2 p 2 where a 0 a 1 and a 3 are constants p is the hydrostatic pressure and q is the octahedral shear stress the yield condition f 0 is represented by an ellipse on the q p plane equation 18 can be written as follows 19 q q max 2 q α p max 2 1 where p max q max and α are important parameters affecting the shape of the elliptical line see fig 4 note that the ellipse contains the origin hence the material in this model is able to support the tensile stress in the principle stress space the failure criterion is represented by an ellipsoid of rotation about the hydrostatic pressure axis since the associated flow rule is adopted here the plastic potential function is the same as the yield function which determines the flow direction of plastic strain increments in the ice structure interaction ice will fail due to crushing or fracturing erosion technique is used to simulate the failure of ice in finite element method once the element violates the failure criterion it will be deleted this technique is easy to implement and efficient according to the classical theory of plasticity no appreciable plastic deformation occurs in brittle failure nonetheless plasticity theory has been used in descriptions of the brittleness of ice liu et al 2011 kolari 2007 shi et al 2016 on the one hand from the phenomenological point of view the sudden drop of post peak stress can be simulated with the use of the strain softening concept in plastic theory kolari 2007 wang et al 1997 needleman 1988 it is even feasible to extend the model to the ductile range by controlling the magnitude of strain softening which is also a reason for using the viscoelastic plasticity to establish the model on the other hand since the erosion technique is used the stress wave problem will lead to an inappropriate effect on the remaining elements in the simulation of elastic brittle failure of ice in which case the plasticity concept can be adopted as a solution liu et al 2011 therefore a proper failure criterion is important in the simulation of ice as it determines how much plastic strain is produced or how long the stress travels on the yield surface in addition the capacity of ice to resist compression is much stronger than to resist tension and thus should also be taken into account in the failure criterion the empirical failure criterion established by liu et al 2011 and modified by gao et al 2015 was adopted this failure criterion is based on equivalent plastic strain ε e q and hydrostatic pressure σ v o l if ε e q p ε f or σ v o l p c u t the element fails 20 ε e q p 2 3 ε i j p ε i j p 21 ε f ε 0 σ v o l 10 8 0 5 2 where ε f and p c u t are the thresholds of equivalent plastic strain and hydrostatic pressure respectively ε 0 is the component of the plastic strain tensor and ε 0 is the initial failure strain 3 numerical implementation and calibration of the program 3 1 numerical implementation the model is incorporated in ls dyna halquist 2007 as a user defined material subroutine and the programme flow is shown in fig 5 at the beginning of each time step the strain increment is imported from the software it is assumed that only viscoelastic deformation has occurred at first and trial stresses were calculated then the yield function 18 is calculated if f 0 the stress state is within the yield stress space and yield criterion is not met then the trial results are real stresses in this time step and will be returned to the software otherwise f 0 the yield criterion is met and plastic deformation occurs the trial stresses will be corrected through the return mapping algorithm after several iterations the stresses are mapped back to the yield surface and the results are returned at the current time step the stresses travel on the yield surface over time until the failure criterion is satisfied to calibrate the program and display the calculation process single element simulations of constant force loading and constant displacement loading will be conducted 3 2 constant force loading to calibrate the numerical program of the model and display the simulation capacity of viscoelastic behaviour a single element test is conducted under constant force including the loading and unloading processes it is assumed that the model does not yield and the results of the finite element analysis will be compared with the numerical results from mathematica a cubic solid unit is used and constant loads of 2 mn and 1 mn are applied separately on the pairs of surfaces in the x direction and the other two directions as shown in fig 6 left the external loads are removed at 50 s to verify the simulating ability of the unloading scenario a comparison of the numerical simulation results from ls dyna and mathematica is illustrated in fig 6 the force on the right side refers to the difference value between the x direction and the other two directions the finite element result agrees well with the mathematica result indicating that the numerical implementation process is correct 3 3 constant displacement rate loading this simulation displays the yield and failure process of the ice element four points on one surface of the ice element in x direction are fixed and the other four points are applied with a compressive displacement at the speed of 0 02 m s fig 7 illustrates the stress development and failure of the element red line at first only viscoelastic deformation occurs after the yield criterion is met the stresses begin to flow on the yield surface and the strain is developing at the same time until the equivalent plastic strain meets the threshold value at the end of the red line the dashed line indicates the stress flow on yield surface if the ice failure does not occur the yield curve is elliptical and consistent with the description in section 2 2 4 numerical examples and discussion numerical examples are described in this section to demonstrate the performance of the present model first a creep experiment is simulated to test the performance of the model to describe this rheological phenomenon second the pond inlet medium scale indentation test is simulated and the pressure area curves are verified to demonstrate the model s ability to assess ice loads third to verify the simulation ability of the model in brittle regions of high strain rates 10 3 s a collision scenario between ice and a rigid plate is simulated 4 1 creep experiments under tri axial compressive conditions 4 1 1 description of the creep experiments ice creep is a time dependent behaviour related to the motion of crystal defects and is thermally activated barratte and jordaan 2001 since higher temperatures can accelerate the creep process the creep deformation of ice can be obvious at temperatures close to its melting point a creep experiment is a commonly used method to study this mechanical behaviour of ice xiao 1997 conducted a series of tri axial creep experiments using laboratory prepared granular ice and the test temperature was kept at 10 c o the seeds used to make ice samples were 2 00 mm 3 36 mm the ice samples were shaped into cylinders of 70 mm in diameter and 175 mm in length with minimal bubble content during the tests the ice samples were subjected to confining pressure from all directions and an additional constant load in the axial direction three typical test scenarios with different axial loads are simulated using the proposed model in this section to better illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the model proposed here the simulation results of shi et al 2017 who also simulated this creep test using a damage theory based viscoelastic model were adopted for comparison 4 1 2 numerical model and material parameters the finite element fe model is established using solid elements with one integration point as shown in fig 8 the ice cylinder is fixed in the bottom and constant pressures are applied on the side and top surfaces the confining pressure in the lateral direction is 10 mpa and the total axial pressures tested are 15 mpa 17 mpa and 20 mpa the element size is 5 mm 9 mm 9 mm other element sizes such as 3 mm 6 mm 6 mm and 6 mm 12 mm 12 mm are also tested and yield similar deformation as the previous size hence this simulation is not sensitive to element size due to the regular shape and small deformation the loading period is 20s after which the external pressures are removed to investigate the recovery of ice deformation and the unloading phase is also set as 20s as discussed in section 2 1 2 and section 2 1 3 the main parameters of ice have been determined and are listed in table 2 it should be noted that n equals 3 in this part poisson s ratio is recommended by timco and weeks 2010 parameters of the yield function a 0 a 1 a 2 are 22 93 2 06 0 023 respectively according to gao et al 2015 4 1 3 results and comparison to experiments fig 9 illustrates the simulated curves of strain versus time at different axial stresses using the viscoelastic plastic model proposed here the experimental results in the laboratory and simulation results using the viscoelastic model shi et al 2017 are also shown for comparison the legend lists the effective stress at the beginning the instantaneous increase of strain represents the elastic deformation generated by the ice sample upon being subjected to external pressure then the strain rises gradually over time attributing mainly to the delayed elastic strain and viscous strain in the loading phase the curves calculated from this model agree well with those of the experimental results under the three stress levels at the moment of 20s the creep strain drops rapidly with the removal of the external force then decreases slowly with time the simulated recovering strains in unloading phase is in good agreement with the experimental results although the strain curve under effective stresses of 5 mpa and 7 mpa are slightly lower than the experimental value the 10 mpa curves correspond well compared to the viscoelastic model of shi et al 2017 the new proposed model yields results that are more consistent with experiments especially for 10 mpa and the distribution in relation times is well simulated shi s model and the viscoelastic part of the material model proposed in this paper are both established on burgers model but the construction ways are different thus the descripted nonlinear strain stress relations are different the viscoelastic part of our model is based on glen s law 1955 and ashby and duval s law 1985 and this method is prone to be effective simulating the experimental phenomenon very well the recovery curves of unloading phase correspond well to the experimental results showing that the deformation components elastic delayed elastic and viscous deformation are well described the nonlinearity of creep is illustrated by the nonlinear behaviour of the strains in response to different stress levels at the same time according to the experimental results no obvious plastic deformation occurred in the ice samples otherwise the strain would increase rapidly in a short period of time in the numerical simulation of loading phase the plastic strain is not triggered which is in agreement with the experimental results thus the simulation of this scenario using this model is realistic and the unrecoverable strain represents viscous deformation rather than plastic deformation corresponding to section 2 1 the instantaneous drop at the moment of 20s represents the recovery of elastic strain and the gradual decline in unloading phase represents the recovery of delayed elastic strain 4 2 pond inlet indentation tests 4 2 1 description of the indentation tests indentation tests can be used to investigate the failure mechanism of ice and obtain the contact force or pressure simulating indentation tests and comparing the contact force and pressure area curves is a direct way to verify the accuracy of the proposed material model for the indentation tests at laboratory scale the contact areas are generally several square centimetres it is challenging to extend the results to the ice ship interaction analysis because of the size effect mobil oil canada kennedy 1990 johnson and benoit 1987 conducted a series of medium scale indentation experiments on a grounded iceberg near pond inlet in 1984 and the maximum contact area reached 3 m2 which approached the size in full scale ice ship interactions the pond inlet indention test with the maximum indenter is simulated in this section and the simulation result of liu et al 2011 for the same test using an elastic plastic model is also presented for comparison in pond inlet tests a series of tunnels were excavated into the iceberg and the indenter system was positioned in the tunnel and different sizes of spherical indenters were controlled to press into the vertical wall driven by the hydraulic system pressure cells were arranged on the face of the indenters to measure the local pressure of the indenting process enabling the contact force to be obtained a schematic of the experimental scenario and the corresponding numerical model is shown in fig 10 at beginning of the pond inlet test the indenter was pressed towards the ice surface at constant velocity of 0 1 m s and upon reaching the surface the penetrating displacement x t was imposed on the indenter as a quarter sine curve 23 x t x 0 sin ω t where x 0 is the maximum penetration distance ω is the frequency of motion and t is time the velocity of the indenter varies from initial maximum value to zero which represents the slowing down of the ice or ship after impacting each other the whole test lasted for 3 6s 4 2 2 numerical model and material parameters compared to the iceberg the stiffness of the indenter is much higher in the fe model the indenter is established as a section of rigid sphere with the radius of 2 3 m and the ice is modelled as a cuboid with height of 1 2 m and length and width of 6 m the solid elements with one integration point are adopted the nodes at the back of the ice wall are fixed and the velocity is imposed on the indenter an automatic contact algorithm is utilized between ice and indenter an eroding contact algorithm is utilized for the iceberg thus the ice element will be deleted once it fails the static and dynamic coefficients of friction are 0 15 considering the relatively higher hydrostatic pressure higher than 30 mpa n 4 is more proper and the temperature t 253 15 k the other material parameters are the same as those in the simulation of creep experiments the hexahedral mesh grids are structured the grids in the central part of ice are denser and the surrounding grids are sparse to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of calculation to select the appropriate element size four mesh sizes 100 mm 100 mm 100 mm 75 mm 75 mm 75 mm 50 mm 50 mm 50 mm 30 mm 30 mm 30 mm in the middle part are tested 4 2 3 results and comparison to experiments the calculated curves of force versus time of different mesh sizes are illustrated in fig 11 left smaller elements lead to smaller fluctuations of the force curve and higher computational costs the difference in contact force of mesh size between 100 mm and 75 mm is larger while the results of 50 mm and 30 mm are similar for a compromise between the effectiveness and efficiency of the calculation 50 mm is an ideal choice fig 11 right shows the in situ measurement results of a group of tests using the 3 m2 indenter in pond inlet test and t1t5 t3t2 t4t2 and t4t3 are test numbers kennedy 1990 the force of t1t5 before 1 5s is much higher than the others although the other curves have a similar trend the obtained ice loads are still different for different testing times the saw tooth response in the indention tests is thought to be ice induced oscillation as analysed by brown et al 2013 and o rourke et al 2016 which is a complex phenomenon the numerical simulation with proper element size can capture the variation law of the mean value of contact force over time fig 12 displays the distribution of hydrostatic pressure left and von mises stress right as well as the element erosion situation as the indenter advances the ice elements undergo the process from deformation to failure when meeting the failure criterion the ice element will be deleted to simulate the process of ice crushing at 2 21s a small pit forms as shown in fig 12 in the central position of the contact area of ice contacting with the top of the spherical indenter the stress of ice is the highest moreover the hydrostatic stress reaches 35 52 mpa which is much higher than the maximum value of von mises stress in many small scale indentation tests brown et al 2013 o rourke et al 2016 it has been observed with the aid of high speed video that the damaged ice layer mainly exists in the contact area between ice and the indenter and the deformation of the ice is usually manifested as recrystallization and micro fractures fig 11 shows that only the stresses in the contact area are high and the stresses in other areas are very low especially for the hydrostatic stress this result is consistent with the observed experimental phenomenon the pressure area relation is often used to evaluate the ice load on structures the pressure area curves of the numerical simulations and test data are compared and illustrated in fig 13 the pressure from numerical simulation is obtained by dividing the resultant force by the nominal contact area when the contact area is less than 0 2 m2 the simulation result of the viscoelastic plastic model is higher than the test data this is because the pressures from the tests are conservative resulting from inaccurate control of the test start time according to johnson and benoit 1987 pond inlet s apparatuses were also used in hobson s choice indentation tests frederking et al 1990 which obtained higher pressure in the small contact area using the same apparatus as the pond inlet further illustrating the rationality of the simulation results over 0 2 m2 the simulation result matches well with test results furthermore the trend of simulation results is in accordance with the curve in the iso cd 19906 standard 2010 which is obtained from the pressure data of the molikpad structure masterson et al 2007 gulf flat jack iyer and masterson 1987 hobson s choice tests frederking et al 1990 gagnon 1998 and pond inlet tests masterson et al 1992 removing the kelvin unit and the dashpot in the maxwell unit the viscoelastic plastic evp model will degenerate to an elastic plastic ep model which is similar with the models of gao et al 2015 and liu et al 2011 the values of the ep curve and evp curve are very similar this is because under high speed interactions of the ice and the indenter the viscous and delayed elastic deformations of ice have not fully developed in a short time before the failure of ice in this condition the performance of the viscoelastic plastic model is close to that of an elastic plastic model the pressure area curves are also similar to that of liu s ep model as shown in fig 13 although the values are slightly different probably due to different parameters and meshing the calculation times of the models are also compared the ep model takes 34 h and 14 min to finish the simulation and the evp model takes 42 h and 53 min the evp model takes longer time 8 h and 39 min but it is still in an acceptable range for the actual interactions between ice and structures there are many conditions where the viscoelasticity of ice cannot be ignored such as the piling up of ice around offshore platforms the kelvin unit and viscous element in the maxwell unit of the evp model representing the viscoelasticity will share the strain and produce lower stress than that of the ep model therefore this improvement gives the viscoelastic plastic model the potential for better simulation of these conditions and a wider range of applicability 4 3 collision between spherical ice and a rigid plate 4 3 1 description of the collision scenario and the numerical model an ice rigid plate collision scenario is simulated in this section to verify the material model s capacity to describe the brittleness of ice the collision speed is 1 m s to ensure that the simulation is close to the situation of collision between ice and ship and the deformation of ice is in the brittle region with high strain rates 10 3 s schulson 2001 the shape of the ice is a sphere representing the mean model shape of the iceberg a rigid plate is adopted to represent the strength design strategy norsok standard 2004 if the calculated pressure does not exceed the rule requirements then the actual pressure generated by the ice colliding with ships will also meet the requirements the ice model is half a sphere with a radius of 1 m as shown in fig 14 the maximum penetration depth is 0 6 m since the bottom of the sphere does not come into contact with the rigid plate it is modelled as a rigid body and fixed the rigid plate with the side length of 1 5 m moves at a constant speed and collides with the spherical ice an automatic contact algorithm is set and the erosion technique is also adopted the frictional coefficients are 0 15 and other ice material mechanical parameters including the shear moduli and bulk modulus are the same as those in section 3 2 the temperature is assumed to be 253 15 k a parameter sensitivity analysis of mesh size 33 mm 33 mm 33 mm 22 mm 22 mm 22 mm 16 7 mm 16 7 mm 16 7 mm is performed fig 15 illustrates the distribution of hydrostatic stress and von mises stress representing the volume stress and partial stress of ice respectively at the mesh size of 22 mm 22 mm 22 mm 4 3 2 results and discussion fig 16 illustrates the pressure area curve of the simulation and different specifications and design curves are also illustrated for comparison according to the simulation results once the spherical ice comes into contact with the steel plate the contact pressure is very large then decreases rapidly with the penetration distance and contact area increasing when the contact area is larger than 0 5 m2 the pressure tends to reach a stable value this trend coincides well with the iso standard 2010 and api 1995 curves but the pressure values are lower than those of the specifications this finding is reasonable because the specification curves take the upper limit of experiments and field test data masterson et al 2007 compared with the two specification curves the molikpaq design curve masterson et al 2007 is closer to the simulation results the simulated contact pressure fluctuates within a certain range along with the contact area but the average value agrees well with the pressure curve proposed by timco and sudom 2013 timco s design curve is for wide structures and takes the intermediate value of the test results of molikpaq east and north facing panels this finding further proves that the numerical simulation results are quite reasonable the fluctuation of the pressure curve derived from numerical simulation is due to the elements erosion and it is more obvious when the contact area is smaller than 0 5 m2 because the deletion of elements leads to the change of contact force and this change is amplified when the force is divided by a small contact area unlike the massive ice in the simulation of indentation tests the elements of the spherical ice are not well confined after contacting with the rigid plate the ice elements at the top of the sphere fail rapidly under pressure and are eroded then the contact force changes frequently in the small contact area when the grid density is larger the pressure fluctuates more moderately but the average pressure values of different grid densities are similar which indicates that the model has good robustness for the ice in the brittle region the constitutive law is linear elastic before it fails as shown in fig 1 strain rate 0 2 1 s the numerical results of the elastic plastic model which are represented by simulation ep 22 mm in fig 16 are illustrated for comparison the results show that most of the scattered dots of simulation ep 22 mm overlap with the simulation evp 22 mm curve this finding proves that the model has a good ability of simulating high speed collision the viscoelastic part will degenerate automatically to become elastic the proposed model retains a good capacity for describing the brittle behaviour of ice 5 conclusions a three dimensional viscoelastic plastic constitutive model is proposed in this paper to simulate the behaviour of ice during the ice structure interactions the ice characteristics embodied in this model are more comprehensive than the previous models and verifications are made through three sets of comparisons between numerical simulation results and those from tests the main results are as follow the proposed model is composed of viscoelastic and plastic components acting in series the viscoelastic part is represented with a nonlinear burgers model in which the volumetric behaviour is assumed to be elastic and the deviatoric behaviour is assumed to be viscoelastic and includes instantaneous elastic viscous and delayed elastic components the viscous part is based on glen s law 1955 and the delayed elastic model is based on ashby and duval s equation 1985 temperature and confining pressure are included the plastic part is evoked by a tsai wu yield criterion that is hydrostatic pressure and octahedral shear stress dependent the incremental plastic theory and associated flow rule are adopted the numerical examples show that the present ice model yields well results and can reflect the comprehensive characteristics of ice based on the laws summarised from experiments the proposed model can reflect the viscoelastic behaviour of ice well in the simulation of creep experiments the calculated strain time curves are consistent with the experimental results under different external loads and the strain recovery in the unloading phase is simulated successfully combining with element erosion the proposed model also has a good capacity to simulate the ice structure interaction in brittle region and predict the ice load in the simulation of pond inlet medium scale indentation tests the contact force and the average pressure agree well with the experimental results and the pressure area curve of the ice rigid plate collision simulation is also in a reasonable range compared to the elastic plastic model which is limited to high speed interactions between ice and structures the proposed viscoelastic plastic model includes viscoelasticity and thus has more potential applications e g the long term piling up of ice around offshore platforms in arctic regions when the creep deformation cannot be ignored moreover this improvement makes the proposed model

22991,in this paper a three dimensional constitutive ice model with nonlinear viscoelastic and plastic components acting in series is proposed for the dynamic simulation of ice structure interactions the former component corresponds to a nonlinear burgers model in which the deviatoric behaviour is viscoelastic and the volumetric behaviour is elastic the burgers model is combined with the well accepted glen s law and ashby and duval law to describe the time dependent behaviour and distribution in relaxation time a hydrostatic pressure and octahedral shear stress dependent tsai wu type yield criterion is adopted to invoke the plastic state the proposed ice model is assumed to be isotropic and is implemented in the commercial software ls dyna as a user defined material verification of this model is implemented via simulations of creep and indentation experiments and via the simulation of a scenario of ice rigid steel plate collision the simulation of creep experiments shows that this material model can reflect the viscoelastic properties of ice quite well the calculated contact force and pressure area curves agree well with the results of indentation experiments and the ice rigid steel plate collision example yields reasonable results indicating that the proposed model has a good capacity for describing the brittle behaviour of ice the numerical verification proves that the proposed ice material model has a wide range of potential applications keywords ice structure interaction ice model viscoelastic plastic model burgers model numerical simulation 1 introduction the exploration of arctic sea routes and oil and gas resources has become a trend in recent years driven by climate warming technological development and economic benefits khon et al 2010 ostreng et al 2013 these changes will make the activities of ships and marine structures more frequent in arctic however ice structure interactions may cause serious damage to marine structures and ships even resulting in sinking in serious conditions such as collisions as well as leakage of oil and natural gas hill 2006 numerical simulation is an important method to investigate ice structure interactions and one of the key difficulties is in establishing an accurate ice material constitutive model the mechanical characteristics of ice are complex including elasticity delayed elasticity plasticity and brittleness ice shows different deformation characteristics under different conditions the review of ice properties can be found in barrette and jordaan 2001 and schulson and duval 2009 the behaviour of ice is affected by many factors such as temperature loading rate brine and porosity for example when temperature decreases or strain rate increases the post peak stress will decrease quickly with strain and the ice deformation will transit from ductile region to brittle region as shown in fig 1 therefore establishing a relatively complete constitutive model has always been a challenging task most models contain only parts of the ice characteristics and only a small portion of the models have been used in finite element tools to simulate ice structure interaction for the spatial scale ice structure interaction is concerned with global ice loads and local ice loads the former represents the resultant force on the structure and is related to the design of overall structure timco and sudom 2013 while the local ice loads are applied on a small and defined portion of a large area and is related to the local structure to be designed the process simulated in this paper is this kind of local ice structure interaction with ice load acting on a panel or plating between frames jordaan et al 2005 the contact area is smaller than 3 m2 in the simulation part of this paper masterson et al 2007 proposed a local pressure area curve applying to contact area less than 10 m2 obtained from field measurement small and medium scale indentation experiments iso standard 2010 adopted this relation and it is used for comparison in section 4 2 and section 4 3 for the ice behaviour and failure process in the local ice structure interaction jordaan 2001 proposed a systematical elaboration to describe it ice loads are mainly transmitted to the structure through high pressure zones 90 according to johnston et al 1998 ice of high pressure zones is under high confinement due to the surrounding ice and structure and cracks are suppressed so the ice there is highly damaged with recrystallization and will be crushed and extruded while the ice around high pressure zones fails in a brittle manner ice is at a relatively high strain rate in common ice structure interactions such as collision scenarios where ice strain rate is higher than 10 3 s according to liu et al 2011 except for structures subjected to creep of level ice especially when the temperature rises where the ice strain rate is relatively low lower than 10 5 and ductile deformation dominates in addition confinement also influences the ice behaviour even for ice structure interaction in high rates the ice of high pressure zones deforms in a ductile manner with damage one type of the existing ice material models is the ones with physical basis these models emphasize the description of internal microscopic changes of ice such as crystal dislocations grain boundary sliding micro cracks cracks propagation and interaction which need further experimental research of the micromechanics and is still in the initial stages some physical based material models can be referred to cole 1995 cole 1998 kolari 2013 and kolari 2017 another main type is the phenomenological models based on the theory of viscoelasticity plasticity leclair et al 1999 to describe the macroscopic phenomenon relation between stress strain time etc other than the microscopic mechanism inside ice a model represented by rheological elements including springs and dashpots is an effective method and is also the way to establish the material model in this paper there have been many researches about the viscoelasticity viscoplasticity of ice experimental studies have shown that the ice continuum deformation is composite according to the features whether time dependent recoverable the ice deformation can be decomposed into instant elastic delayed elastic growing with time at constant stress and recoverable and viscous or plastic deformation irrecoverable glen 1955 proposed an equation related with temperature to describe the relation between viscous strain rate and stress and is well accepted many laboratory experiments have been conducted since 1970s to investigate the ice continuum deformation and used glen law to describe the viscous behaviour and relevant mechanical parameters were obtained see e g barnes 1971 jones 1982 mellor and cole 1982 sinha 1982 jones and chew 1983 durham et al 1983 rist and murrell 1994 gagnon and gammon 1995 schulson and nickolayev 1995 jones et al 2003 jellinek and brill 1956 adopted a one dimensional maxwell voigt model to describe the viscoelastic deformation of ice because the delayed elastic strain of ice display a distribution of retardation times a large number of kelvin units acting in series can capture this behaviour xiao 1997 used 1 mx unit and 3 k units to simulate the viscoelastic deformation and applied the model to finite element analysis to take numerical simulations and compared the results with creep experiments the results corresponded with the tested curves and the distribution of recovering strain in unloading phase was also simulated successfully however more rheological units bring more mechanical parameters need to be determined through experiments and this makes the application of this type of model difficult leclair et al 1999 applied an equation originally used for creep of polymeric material to simulate the viscoelastic deformation of ice and obtained the parameters through cycle loading experiments ji et al 2005 and gang et al 2006 established two viscoelastic plastic models with mohr coulomb yielding criterion and drucker prager yield criterion respectively the delayed elastic deformation was represented by kelvin unit the models were applied to simulate ice dynamics using smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph it was found the singular problem in the mohr coulomb yield criterion was overcame by the drucker prager criterion some studies suggest that the tsai wu type of yield criterion is more suitable for describing the behaviour of ice e g varsta 1983 derradji aouat 2003 summarised and analysed ice strength data of the previous experiments and used multiple elliptical surfaces to describe the failure of ice zhou et al 2016 conducted experiments on columnar ice and adopted initial yield hardening and subsequent yield to describe the ice behaviour it was found that the initial and subsequent yield surfaces maintained elliptical shape in the plane of effective stress versus hydrostatic stress some models were combined with continuum damage theory representing micro cracks to simulate the quasi brittle behaviour of ice ortiz et al 2015 adopted the elastic mazars damage model to describe the fragile response of ice and the compressive failure of ice cylinders under high speed loading was simulated taylor and jordaan 2014 used schapery s damage theory and element erosion techniques in finite element method to simulate the brittle process of ice and obtained the contact pressure time curve saksala et al 2015 combined continuum damage and embedded discontinuity to describe the strain stress relation of ice two dimensional simulations were conducted and the strain softening behaviour can be simulated however damage based models need a robust material model without damage to completely describe ice behaviors leclair et al 1999 and these brittle models usually ignored the capacity of simulating viscoelasticity especially the delayed elastic behaviour in fact all these characteristics are included in ice material one or more features will be evoked in a given scenario and there is no definite boundary between these characteristics and the lack of ability to describe viscoelastic behaviour limits the scope of application of the model conditions with higher temperature slow interaction high confinement such as high pressure zones cannot be simulated therefore it is meaningful to establish a comprehensive model that can be applied to a wider range of scenarios the main objective of this study is to establish a comprehensive three dimensional ice constitutive model that can be used in finite element method based on viscoelastic plastic theory to simulate the ice structure interaction the viscoelastic behaviour is described with an improved burgers model 1 mx and 1 k units acting in series which is based on the laws summarised from experimental results and takes the influence of temperature and confining pressure into account thus can reflect the viscoelastic behaviour of ice more accurately the viscous relation is based on glen s law 1955 and the delayed elastic relation is based on ashby and duval law 1985 the deviatoric and volumetric parts are constructed separately a tsai wu type criterion is adopted to evoke the plastic deformation and an empirical failure criterion based on the effective plastic strain and hydrostatic pressure is adopted to determine the failure of ice elements in general plastic theory is used to describe the ductile behaviour of ice for the numerical simulation of ice structure interaction the plastic theory can be applied to brittle region for predicting the ice load in a proper way liu 2011 proposed an elastic plastic model with the combination of element erosion to simulate ice ship collision scenario and the ice load was well predicted in addition plastic theory based ice model has a potential for further development it can be developed to model the post peak softening behaviour and the ductile brittle transition of ice therefore the model proposed in this paper can reflect the viscoelasticity of ice and also can simulate the ice load of collision where ice fails mainly in brittle region this model can be used for the simulation of isotropic freshwater ice and iceberg ice with low brine content two typical experiments conducted on ice including a creep experiment and a medium scale indentation experiment and a collision scheme between ice and a rigid plate were simulated to verify the performance of this model it is shown that the proposed ice model can simulate the comprehensive characteristics during the ice structure interaction scenario the proposed ice model can be applied in fem simulations to give structural safety assessments for arctic ships during their design phases or provide evaluations for other ice structure interaction related engineering practices 2 description of the constitutive viscoelastic plastic ice material model the ice model proposed in this paper is an incremental viscoelastic plastic model the viscoelastic constitutive law corresponds to a nonlinear burgers model the yield criterion marking the beginning of the plastic phase corresponds to the tsai wu yield surface and the associated flow rule is adopted the numerical implementation is based on a differential method and return mapping algorithm 2 1 viscoelastic plastic constitutive law for ice material the deformation of ice are composed of several components instantaneous elastic delayed elastic viscous and plastic components fig 2 illustrates the typical one dimensional ice creep behaviour including the characteristics of the generation and recovery of the first three deformation components under a constant external force the instantaneous elastic strain ε e often makes up a small portion of the total strain of ice and it s reversible and time independent it is followed by a period of transient creep which is composed of delayed elastic strain ε d and viscous strain ε v and then a steady strain rate stage where the viscous strain dominates the delayed elastic strain manifests as a gradually increasing strain for which the increase slows with time and the strain can also fully recover and after the external load is removed the deformation will relax with a distribution of relaxation times rather than a single relaxation time manifesting as the fully recovery of this deformation will take a much longer time than it s generation leclair et al 1999 the viscous strain is very small initially but becomes greater over time for the creep deformation of granular polycrystalline ice dislocation glide is usually the main mechanism and dislocation climb is considered as a complementary mode schulson and duval 2009 barnes et al 1971 the dislocation relaxation mechanism dominates the delayed elastic deformation of ice cole 1995 plastic strain and viscous strain are both permanent but behave in different ways in this study viscous strain is attributed to the time effect and even with a small external force it will occur the plastic strain will only be produced on the condition that the ice exceeds its elastic limit or yield limit that being the case the yield criterion and flow rule are important for the plastic strain and this will be discussed in the next section for the ice behaviour in a tri axial stress state the deformation mechanism of ice can be divided into two components volume change and shape change of the ice crystal lattice the volumetric deformation of ice is caused by the variation of the intermolecular distance under hydrostatic pressure but the shape of the ice crystal remains the same the deviatoric strain is attribute to the shape distortion of ice crystals corresponding to the effect of deviatoric stress barrette and jordaan 2001 to facilitate the establishment of a constitutive model in a tri axial stress state the ice behaviour can be decomposed into these two parts to process separately according to the above phenomena the material model proposed in this paper will be based on the following hypotheses the material model is isotropic the total deviatoric strain is assumed to be represented as the sum of instantaneous elastic strain viscous strain delayed elastic strain and plastic strain the volumetric behaviour is represented by elastic and plastic strain the viscous elastic and delayed elastic deformation will be affected by temperature therefore the total stress and strain tensors of ice can be decomposed into deviatoric part and volumetric part 1 ε i j e i j δ i j ε v o l 2 σ i j s i j δ i j p 3 δ i j 1 i j 0 i j where ε i j and σ i j are the strain and stress components e i j and s i j are the deviatoric strain and stress components ε v o l ε i i 3 and p σ i i 3 are the volumetric strain and stress and the einstein summation convention lai et al 2009 applies the total deviatoric strain rate e i j and volumetric strain rate ε v o l can be expressed as 4 e i j e i j e e i j v e i j d e i j p 5 ε v o l ε v o l e ε v o l p where e i j e e i j v e i j d and e i j p are the deviatoric elastic viscous delayed elastic and plastic strain rates respectively and ε v o l e and ε v o l p are the volumetric elastic and plastic strain rates respectively for the deviatoric viscoelastic behaviour including the first three parts a burgers model consisting of a maxwell unit and a kelvin unit arranged in series is used here fig 3 shows the burgers model elastic strain ε e and viscous strain ε v are represented by the spring and dashpot in maxwell model respectively delayed elastic strain ε d is represented by the combination of spring and dashpot arranged in parallel in the kelvin unit 2 1 1 elastic strain the elastic volumetric strain has a linear relation to the volumetric stress as does the deviatoric instantaneous elastic strain with the stress components the elastic part can be described by the generalized hooke s law 6 ε v o l e p 3 k 7 e i j e s i j 2 g m where k is the bulk modulus and g m is the shear modulus of the maxwell unit 2 1 2 viscous strain basic viscous relation can be described as a linear relation between stress and strain rate according to newton s law σ μ ε which also can be represented by the dashpot in original maxwell unit however many experiments have observed that the viscous strain rate is nonlinear with stress such as in constant stress loading experiments the viscous strain under different stress levels is in nonlinear relationship with stress at the same loading time glen s law 1955 is a well accepted equation to describe this relation in this paper the formula proposed by jones and chew 1983 which was based on glen s law and took confining pressure into account is adopted to improve the burgers model 8 ε v a exp q p v r t σ 1 σ 3 n where σ 1 σ 3 is uniaxial stress a and n are material constants q is activation energy r 8 314 j mol k is molar gas constant t is absolute temperature p is the hydrostatic pressure and v is the activation volume in order to extend this relation to three dimension the differential stress σ 1 σ 3 can be replaced by effective stress according to the isotropic assumption and the axial viscous strain rate can be written in the deviatoric form 9 e i j v s n 1 2 η m s i j 10 2 η m a 1 exp q p v r t where s i j is deviatoric stress s 3 s i j s i j 2 is the effective stress and the einstein summation convention lai et al 2009 applies according to jones and chew 1983 v equals 32 cm3 mol here the above stress unit is mpa in this equation the influence of temperature is included it is reflected in two parameters temperature t and activation energy q at the same stress level the viscous strain rate improves and ice becomes softer as temperature increases a lot of tri axial experiments were conducted in the past decades and many of the experimental data were analysed using glen s law 1955 e g durham et al 1983 barnes et al 1971 jones 1982 rist and murrell 1994 the values of the parameters were obtained and this provides a good reference for the determination of the parameters in the application of this model it was found that n is around 3 under lower stress level and could be 4 under higher stress level which is probably associated with the occurrence of micro cracking and non basal gliding rist and murrell 1994 q has different values in different temperature intervals and some of the experimental suggestions are listed in table 1 the creep tests simulated subsequently in this paper was conducted under 11 c o and the effective stress was under 10 mpa thus 3 is an ideal value for n and q 78 6 kj mol and a 6 5e8 s 1 mpa3 suggested by barnes et al 1971 is adopted for simulations of indentation tests and ice plate collision n 4 is proper as the hydrostatic pressure is over 30 mpa as calculated 2 1 3 delayed elastic stain the delayed elastic deformation in axial direction can be represented in the time power law form this can be described by part of andarade s law in which the strain is the third power of time ε t β t 1 3 glen 1955 schulson and duval 2009 where β is a parameter in this model ashby and duval s law 1985 is adopted 11 ε d b σ e 1 exp c ε v t σ e 1 m where σ is the axial stress e is the elastic modulus c 0 016 and m 3 in this model the index of time is also 1 3 the delayed elastic strain is related with the viscous strain rate thus is also dependent on temperature and confining pressure as time goes on the delayed elastic strain gradually approaches the maximum value b σ e and b is a parameter which can determine the maximum delayed strain the maximum delayed elastic strain could be ten times higher than the instantaneous elastic strain cole 1995 duval 1978 so the value of b should be around 10 or even greater equation 11 is extended to three dimensional form and the viscous strain rate is substituted by equation 9 then the deviatoric viscous strain can be expressed as 12 e i j d b s i j 2 g 1 exp c s n 1 t η m g 1 3 where g g m is the shear modulus s i j and s are deviatoric stress component and effective stress as defined in viscous strain part kelvin unit can represent the above equation the total deviatoric stress is equal to the sum of the stresses produced by the spring and the dashpot in kelvin unit as shown in fig 3 13 2 g

deviatoric strain rate component of the kelvin body respectively formula 12 and 13 are equivalent because the former is the analytical solution of the latter the model shows that the delayed elastic constitutive relation is also nonlinear 2 1 4 plastic strain the law of plastic deformation is described by the plastic potential theory which is also one of the incremental plastic theories in addition the associated flow rule is adopted to specify that the direction of the plastic strain increment vector is normal to the yield surface the plastic strain rates of the deviatoric and volumetric parts are respectively expressed as follows 16 e i j p λ f σ i j ε v o l p δ i j 17 ε v o l p λ 3 f σ 11 f σ 22 f σ 33 where λ is the plastic consistency parameter and f is the yield function formulas above in combination with the yield and failure criteria described in section 2 2 below compose the viscoelastic plastic constitutive model of ice the viscoelastic and plastic strain rate parts are assumed to act in series in the condition of the offshore structure subjected from creep load produced by floating ice cover moving slowly or by level ice under rising temperature against it the strain rate is usually lower than 10 5 and time dependent deformation can be fully developed for the high rate deformation with strain rate higher than 10 3 the viscous part usually does not have enough time to develop and the model will degenerate automatically to be nearly elastic plastic 2 2 yield and failure criteria for the plastic theory establishing broadly effective yield and failure criteria is an essential task ice will undergo plastic volumetric deformation and its yield stress is dependent on hydrostatic pressure which is quite different from most metal materials and more like concrete and rock schulson 2001 studies regarding the yield criterion of ice are insufficient as of yet e g varsta 1983 und polach et al 2013 kim et al 2011 some studies have simulated the yield or failure phenomenon by using damage theory considering that the damage begins to accumulate when stress begins to decline and that ice will fail at a critical damage value however there remains a lack of unified and widely accepted damage criteria and accumulation laws another approach is to use the yield surface method which can reflect the stress or strain state when ice material yields varsta 1983 summarised different criteria and suggested tsai wu criterion is suitable for ice problems derradji aouat et al 2000 2003 2005 2010 summarised the experimental results of different kinds of ice and proposed a 3 d yield criterion based on mroz s multi surface concept which is relatively systematic and has a theoretical foundation timco and frederking 1984 proposed an n type yield function to describe the behaviour of ice liu et al 2011 and shi et al 2016 have prone separately that the last two criteria are both tsai wu type yield criterion and are hydrostatic pressure dependent because the equations can be deduced to the same form with tsai wu equation this yield criterion can cover the test data within a certain range which makes it a reasonable way to describe the yield law of ice although more data are needed to improve it the tsai wu yield surface is adopted here and can be expressed as follows derradji aouat 2003 18 f p q 3 2 q 2 a 0 a 1 p a 2 p 2 where a 0 a 1 and a 3 are constants p is the hydrostatic pressure and q is the octahedral shear stress the yield condition f 0 is represented by an ellipse on the q p plane equation 18 can be written as follows 19 q q max 2 q α p max 2 1 where p max q max and α are important parameters affecting the shape of the elliptical line see fig 4 note that the ellipse contains the origin hence the material in this model is able to support the tensile stress in the principle stress space the failure criterion is represented by an ellipsoid of rotation about the hydrostatic pressure axis since the associated flow rule is adopted here the plastic potential function is the same as the yield function which determines the flow direction of plastic strain increments in the ice structure interaction ice will fail due to crushing or fracturing erosion technique is used to simulate the failure of ice in finite element method once the element violates the failure criterion it will be deleted this technique is easy to implement and efficient according to the classical theory of plasticity no appreciable plastic deformation occurs in brittle failure nonetheless plasticity theory has been used in descriptions of the brittleness of ice liu et al 2011 kolari 2007 shi et al 2016 on the one hand from the phenomenological point of view the sudden drop of post peak stress can be simulated with the use of the strain softening concept in plastic theory kolari 2007 wang et al 1997 needleman 1988 it is even feasible to extend the model to the ductile range by controlling the magnitude of strain softening which is also a reason for using the viscoelastic plasticity to establish the model on the other hand since the erosion technique is used the stress wave problem will lead to an inappropriate effect on the remaining elements in the simulation of elastic brittle failure of ice in which case the plasticity concept can be adopted as a solution liu et al 2011 therefore a proper failure criterion is important in the simulation of ice as it determines how much plastic strain is produced or how long the stress travels on the yield surface in addition the capacity of ice to resist compression is much stronger than to resist tension and thus should also be taken into account in the failure criterion the empirical failure criterion established by liu et al 2011 and modified by gao et al 2015 was adopted this failure criterion is based on equivalent plastic strain ε e q and hydrostatic pressure σ v o l if ε e q p ε f or σ v o l p c u t the element fails 20 ε e q p 2 3 ε i j p ε i j p 21 ε f ε 0 σ v o l 10 8 0 5 2 where ε f and p c u t are the thresholds of equivalent plastic strain and hydrostatic pressure respectively ε 0 is the component of the plastic strain tensor and ε 0 is the initial failure strain 3 numerical implementation and calibration of the program 3 1 numerical implementation the model is incorporated in ls dyna halquist 2007 as a user defined material subroutine and the programme flow is shown in fig 5 at the beginning of each time step the strain increment is imported from the software it is assumed that only viscoelastic deformation has occurred at first and trial stresses were calculated then the yield function 18 is calculated if f 0 the stress state is within the yield stress space and yield criterion is not met then the trial results are real stresses in this time step and will be returned to the software otherwise f 0 the yield criterion is met and plastic deformation occurs the trial stresses will be corrected through the return mapping algorithm after several iterations the stresses are mapped back to the yield surface and the results are returned at the current time step the stresses travel on the yield surface over time until the failure criterion is satisfied to calibrate the program and display the calculation process single element simulations of constant force loading and constant displacement loading will be conducted 3 2 constant force loading to calibrate the numerical program of the model and display the simulation capacity of viscoelastic behaviour a single element test is conducted under constant force including the loading and unloading processes it is assumed that the model does not yield and the results of the finite element analysis will be compared with the numerical results from mathematica a cubic solid unit is used and constant loads of 2 mn and 1 mn are applied separately on the pairs of surfaces in the x direction and the other two directions as shown in fig 6 left the external loads are removed at 50 s to verify the simulating ability of the unloading scenario a comparison of the numerical simulation results from ls dyna and mathematica is illustrated in fig 6 the force on the right side refers to the difference value between the x direction and the other two directions the finite element result agrees well with the mathematica result indicating that the numerical implementation process is correct 3 3 constant displacement rate loading this simulation displays the yield and failure process of the ice element four points on one surface of the ice element in x direction are fixed and the other four points are applied with a compressive displacement at the speed of 0 02 m s fig 7 illustrates the stress development and failure of the element red line at first only viscoelastic deformation occurs after the yield criterion is met the stresses begin to flow on the yield surface and the strain is developing at the same time until the equivalent plastic strain meets the threshold value at the end of the red line the dashed line indicates the stress flow on yield surface if the ice failure does not occur the yield curve is elliptical and consistent with the description in section 2 2 4 numerical examples and discussion numerical examples are described in this section to demonstrate the performance of the present model first a creep experiment is simulated to test the performance of the model to describe this rheological phenomenon second the pond inlet medium scale indentation test is simulated and the pressure area curves are verified to demonstrate the model s ability to assess ice loads third to verify the simulation ability of the model in brittle regions of high strain rates 10 3 s a collision scenario between ice and a rigid plate is simulated 4 1 creep experiments under tri axial compressive conditions 4 1 1 description of the creep experiments ice creep is a time dependent behaviour related to the motion of crystal defects and is thermally activated barratte and jordaan 2001 since higher temperatures can accelerate the creep process the creep deformation of ice can be obvious at temperatures close to its melting point a creep experiment is a commonly used method to study this mechanical behaviour of ice xiao 1997 conducted a series of tri axial creep experiments using laboratory prepared granular ice and the test temperature was kept at 10 c o the seeds used to make ice samples were 2 00 mm 3 36 mm the ice samples were shaped into cylinders of 70 mm in diameter and 175 mm in length with minimal bubble content during the tests the ice samples were subjected to confining pressure from all directions and an additional constant load in the axial direction three typical test scenarios with different axial loads are simulated using the proposed model in this section to better illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the model proposed here the simulation results of shi et al 2017 who also simulated this creep test using a damage theory based viscoelastic model were adopted for comparison 4 1 2 numerical model and material parameters the finite element fe model is established using solid elements with one integration point as shown in fig 8 the ice cylinder is fixed in the bottom and constant pressures are applied on the side and top surfaces the confining pressure in the lateral direction is 10 mpa and the total axial pressures tested are 15 mpa 17 mpa and 20 mpa the element size is 5 mm 9 mm 9 mm other element sizes such as 3 mm 6 mm 6 mm and 6 mm 12 mm 12 mm are also tested and yield similar deformation as the previous size hence this simulation is not sensitive to element size due to the regular shape and small deformation the loading period is 20s after which the external pressures are removed to investigate the recovery of ice deformation and the unloading phase is also set as 20s as discussed in section 2 1 2 and section 2 1 3 the main parameters of ice have been determined and are listed in table 2 it should be noted that n equals 3 in this part poisson s ratio is recommended by timco and weeks 2010 parameters of the yield function a 0 a 1 a 2 are 22 93 2 06 0 023 respectively according to gao et al 2015 4 1 3 results and comparison to experiments fig 9 illustrates the simulated curves of strain versus time at different axial stresses using the viscoelastic plastic model proposed here the experimental results in the laboratory and simulation results using the viscoelastic model shi et al 2017 are also shown for comparison the legend lists the effective stress at the beginning the instantaneous increase of strain represents the elastic deformation generated by the ice sample upon being subjected to external pressure then the strain rises gradually over time attributing mainly to the delayed elastic strain and viscous strain in the loading phase the curves calculated from this model agree well with those of the experimental results under the three stress levels at the moment of 20s the creep strain drops rapidly with the removal of the external force then decreases slowly with time the simulated recovering strains in unloading phase is in good agreement with the experimental results although the strain curve under effective stresses of 5 mpa and 7 mpa are slightly lower than the experimental value the 10 mpa curves correspond well compared to the viscoelastic model of shi et al 2017 the new proposed model yields results that are more consistent with experiments especially for 10 mpa and the distribution in relation times is well simulated shi s model and the viscoelastic part of the material model proposed in this paper are both established on burgers model but the construction ways are different thus the descripted nonlinear strain stress relations are different the viscoelastic part of our model is based on glen s law 1955 and ashby and duval s law 1985 and this method is prone to be effective simulating the experimental phenomenon very well the recovery curves of unloading phase correspond well to the experimental results showing that the deformation components elastic delayed elastic and viscous deformation are well described the nonlinearity of creep is illustrated by the nonlinear behaviour of the strains in response to different stress levels at the same time according to the experimental results no obvious plastic deformation occurred in the ice samples otherwise the strain would increase rapidly in a short period of time in the numerical simulation of loading phase the plastic strain is not triggered which is in agreement with the experimental results thus the simulation of this scenario using this model is realistic and the unrecoverable strain represents viscous deformation rather than plastic deformation corresponding to section 2 1 the instantaneous drop at the moment of 20s represents the recovery of elastic strain and the gradual decline in unloading phase represents the recovery of delayed elastic strain 4 2 pond inlet indentation tests 4 2 1 description of the indentation tests indentation tests can be used to investigate the failure mechanism of ice and obtain the contact force or pressure simulating indentation tests and comparing the contact force and pressure area curves is a direct way to verify the accuracy of the proposed material model for the indentation tests at laboratory scale the contact areas are generally several square centimetres it is challenging to extend the results to the ice ship interaction analysis because of the size effect mobil oil canada kennedy 1990 johnson and benoit 1987 conducted a series of medium scale indentation experiments on a grounded iceberg near pond inlet in 1984 and the maximum contact area reached 3 m2 which approached the size in full scale ice ship interactions the pond inlet indention test with the maximum indenter is simulated in this section and the simulation result of liu et al 2011 for the same test using an elastic plastic model is also presented for comparison in pond inlet tests a series of tunnels were excavated into the iceberg and the indenter system was positioned in the tunnel and different sizes of spherical indenters were controlled to press into the vertical wall driven by the hydraulic system pressure cells were arranged on the face of the indenters to measure the local pressure of the indenting process enabling the contact force to be obtained a schematic of the experimental scenario and the corresponding numerical model is shown in fig 10 at beginning of the pond inlet test the indenter was pressed towards the ice surface at constant velocity of 0 1 m s and upon reaching the surface the penetrating displacement x t was imposed on the indenter as a quarter sine curve 23 x t x 0 sin ω t where x 0 is the maximum penetration distance ω is the frequency of motion and t is time the velocity of the indenter varies from initial maximum value to zero which represents the slowing down of the ice or ship after impacting each other the whole test lasted for 3 6s 4 2 2 numerical model and material parameters compared to the iceberg the stiffness of the indenter is much higher in the fe model the indenter is established as a section of rigid sphere with the radius of 2 3 m and the ice is modelled as a cuboid with height of 1 2 m and length and width of 6 m the solid elements with one integration point are adopted the nodes at the back of the ice wall are fixed and the velocity is imposed on the indenter an automatic contact algorithm is utilized between ice and indenter an eroding contact algorithm is utilized for the iceberg thus the ice element will be deleted once it fails the static and dynamic coefficients of friction are 0 15 considering the relatively higher hydrostatic pressure higher than 30 mpa n 4 is more proper and the temperature t 253 15 k the other material parameters are the same as those in the simulation of creep experiments the hexahedral mesh grids are structured the grids in the central part of ice are denser and the surrounding grids are sparse to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of calculation to select the appropriate element size four mesh sizes 100 mm 100 mm 100 mm 75 mm 75 mm 75 mm 50 mm 50 mm 50 mm 30 mm 30 mm 30 mm in the middle part are tested 4 2 3 results and comparison to experiments the calculated curves of force versus time of different mesh sizes are illustrated in fig 11 left smaller elements lead to smaller fluctuations of the force curve and higher computational costs the difference in contact force of mesh size between 100 mm and 75 mm is larger while the results of 50 mm and 30 mm are similar for a compromise between the effectiveness and efficiency of the calculation 50 mm is an ideal choice fig 11 right shows the in situ measurement results of a group of tests using the 3 m2 indenter in pond inlet test and t1t5 t3t2 t4t2 and t4t3 are test numbers kennedy 1990 the force of t1t5 before 1 5s is much higher than the others although the other curves have a similar trend the obtained ice loads are still different for different testing times the saw tooth response in the indention tests is thought to be ice induced oscillation as analysed by brown et al 2013 and o rourke et al 2016 which is a complex phenomenon the numerical simulation with proper element size can capture the variation law of the mean value of contact force over time fig 12 displays the distribution of hydrostatic pressure left and von mises stress right as well as the element erosion situation as the indenter advances the ice elements undergo the process from deformation to failure when meeting the failure criterion the ice element will be deleted to simulate the process of ice crushing at 2 21s a small pit forms as shown in fig 12 in the central position of the contact area of ice contacting with the top of the spherical indenter the stress of ice is the highest moreover the hydrostatic stress reaches 35 52 mpa which is much higher than the maximum value of von mises stress in many small scale indentation tests brown et al 2013 o rourke et al 2016 it has been observed with the aid of high speed video that the damaged ice layer mainly exists in the contact area between ice and the indenter and the deformation of the ice is usually manifested as recrystallization and micro fractures fig 11 shows that only the stresses in the contact area are high and the stresses in other areas are very low especially for the hydrostatic stress this result is consistent with the observed experimental phenomenon the pressure area relation is often used to evaluate the ice load on structures the pressure area curves of the numerical simulations and test data are compared and illustrated in fig 13 the pressure from numerical simulation is obtained by dividing the resultant force by the nominal contact area when the contact area is less than 0 2 m2 the simulation result of the viscoelastic plastic model is higher than the test data this is because the pressures from the tests are conservative resulting from inaccurate control of the test start time according to johnson and benoit 1987 pond inlet s apparatuses were also used in hobson s choice indentation tests frederking et al 1990 which obtained higher pressure in the small contact area using the same apparatus as the pond inlet further illustrating the rationality of the simulation results over 0 2 m2 the simulation result matches well with test results furthermore the trend of simulation results is in accordance with the curve in the iso cd 19906 standard 2010 which is obtained from the pressure data of the molikpad structure masterson et al 2007 gulf flat jack iyer and masterson 1987 hobson s choice tests frederking et al 1990 gagnon 1998 and pond inlet tests masterson et al 1992 removing the kelvin unit and the dashpot in the maxwell unit the viscoelastic plastic evp model will degenerate to an elastic plastic ep model which is similar with the models of gao et al 2015 and liu et al 2011 the values of the ep curve and evp curve are very similar this is because under high speed interactions of the ice and the indenter the viscous and delayed elastic deformations of ice have not fully developed in a short time before the failure of ice in this condition the performance of the viscoelastic plastic model is close to that of an elastic plastic model the pressure area curves are also similar to that of liu s ep model as shown in fig 13 although the values are slightly different probably due to different parameters and meshing the calculation times of the models are also compared the ep model takes 34 h and 14 min to finish the simulation and the evp model takes 42 h and 53 min the evp model takes longer time 8 h and 39 min but it is still in an acceptable range for the actual interactions between ice and structures there are many conditions where the viscoelasticity of ice cannot be ignored such as the piling up of ice around offshore platforms the kelvin unit and viscous element in the maxwell unit of the evp model representing the viscoelasticity will share the strain and produce lower stress than that of the ep model therefore this improvement gives the viscoelastic plastic model the potential for better simulation of these conditions and a wider range of applicability 4 3 collision between spherical ice and a rigid plate 4 3 1 description of the collision scenario and the numerical model an ice rigid plate collision scenario is simulated in this section to verify the material model s capacity to describe the brittleness of ice the collision speed is 1 m s to ensure that the simulation is close to the situation of collision between ice and ship and the deformation of ice is in the brittle region with high strain rates 10 3 s schulson 2001 the shape of the ice is a sphere representing the mean model shape of the iceberg a rigid plate is adopted to represent the strength design strategy norsok standard 2004 if the calculated pressure does not exceed the rule requirements then the actual pressure generated by the ice colliding with ships will also meet the requirements the ice model is half a sphere with a radius of 1 m as shown in fig 14 the maximum penetration depth is 0 6 m since the bottom of the sphere does not come into contact with the rigid plate it is modelled as a rigid body and fixed the rigid plate with the side length of 1 5 m moves at a constant speed and collides with the spherical ice an automatic contact algorithm is set and the erosion technique is also adopted the frictional coefficients are 0 15 and other ice material mechanical parameters including the shear moduli and bulk modulus are the same as those in section 3 2 the temperature is assumed to be 253 15 k a parameter sensitivity analysis of mesh size 33 mm 33 mm 33 mm 22 mm 22 mm 22 mm 16 7 mm 16 7 mm 16 7 mm is performed fig 15 illustrates the distribution of hydrostatic stress and von mises stress representing the volume stress and partial stress of ice respectively at the mesh size of 22 mm 22 mm 22 mm 4 3 2 results and discussion fig 16 illustrates the pressure area curve of the simulation and different specifications and design curves are also illustrated for comparison according to the simulation results once the spherical ice comes into contact with the steel plate the contact pressure is very large then decreases rapidly with the penetration distance and contact area increasing when the contact area is larger than 0 5 m2 the pressure tends to reach a stable value this trend coincides well with the iso standard 2010 and api 1995 curves but the pressure values are lower than those of the specifications this finding is reasonable because the specification curves take the upper limit of experiments and field test data masterson et al 2007 compared with the two specification curves the molikpaq design curve masterson et al 2007 is closer to the simulation results the simulated contact pressure fluctuates within a certain range along with the contact area but the average value agrees well with the pressure curve proposed by timco and sudom 2013 timco s design curve is for wide structures and takes the intermediate value of the test results of molikpaq east and north facing panels this finding further proves that the numerical simulation results are quite reasonable the fluctuation of the pressure curve derived from numerical simulation is due to the elements erosion and it is more obvious when the contact area is smaller than 0 5 m2 because the deletion of elements leads to the change of contact force and this change is amplified when the force is divided by a small contact area unlike the massive ice in the simulation of indentation tests the elements of the spherical ice are not well confined after contacting with the rigid plate the ice elements at the top of the sphere fail rapidly under pressure and are eroded then the contact force changes frequently in the small contact area when the grid density is larger the pressure fluctuates more moderately but the average pressure values of different grid densities are similar which indicates that the model has good robustness for the ice in the brittle region the constitutive law is linear elastic before it fails as shown in fig 1 strain rate 0 2 1 s the numerical results of the elastic plastic model which are represented by simulation ep 22 mm in fig 16 are illustrated for comparison the results show that most of the scattered dots of simulation ep 22 mm overlap with the simulation evp 22 mm curve this finding proves that the model has a good ability of simulating high speed collision the viscoelastic part will degenerate automatically to become elastic the proposed model retains a good capacity for describing the brittle behaviour of ice 5 conclusions a three dimensional viscoelastic plastic constitutive model is proposed in this paper to simulate the behaviour of ice during the ice structure interactions the ice characteristics embodied in this model are more comprehensive than the previous models and verifications are made through three sets of comparisons between numerical simulation results and those from tests the main results are as follow the proposed model is composed of viscoelastic and plastic components acting in series the viscoelastic part is represented with a nonlinear burgers model in which the volumetric behaviour is assumed to be elastic and the deviatoric behaviour is assumed to be viscoelastic and includes instantaneous elastic viscous and delayed elastic components the viscous part is based on glen s law 1955 and the delayed elastic model is based on ashby and duval s equation 1985 temperature and confining pressure are included the plastic part is evoked by a tsai wu yield criterion that is hydrostatic pressure and octahedral shear stress dependent the incremental plastic theory and associated flow rule are adopted the numerical examples show that the present ice model yields well results and can reflect the comprehensive characteristics of ice based on the laws summarised from experiments the proposed model can reflect the viscoelastic behaviour of ice well in the simulation of creep experiments the calculated strain time curves are consistent with the experimental results under different external loads and the strain recovery in the unloading phase is simulated successfully combining with element erosion the proposed model also has a good capacity to simulate the ice structure interaction in brittle region and predict the ice load in the simulation of pond inlet medium scale indentation tests the contact force and the average pressure agree well with the experimental results and the pressure area curve of the ice rigid plate collision simulation is also in a reasonable range compared to the elastic plastic model which is limited to high speed interactions between ice and structures the proposed viscoelastic plastic model includes viscoelasticity and thus has more potential applications e g the long term piling up of ice around offshore platforms in arctic regions when the creep deformation cannot be ignored moreover this improvement makes the proposed model

22992,the objective of this paper is to investigate the cavitating flow patterns around a specific hydrofoil tulin hydrofoil via combined experimental and numerical studies and to better understand the vortex cavitation interactions in transient cavitating flows the experimental studies were carried out in the closed loop cavitation tunnel and a high speed digital camera is applied to document the cavitation patterns the numerical investigations are performed using a large eddy simulation method and the zwart cavitation model the results showed that the predicted cavity formation and evolution agree well with the experimental observation with decreasing of the cavitation number different cavitating flow patterns occur around the hydrofoil namely inception cavitation σ 1 57 vortex cavitation σ 1 27 cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 cloud cavitation σ 0 87 mixture supercavitation σ 0 67 and developed supercavitation σ 0 54 especially the flow structures of vortex cavitation cavitating vortex street and cloud cavitation were further investigated with the euler and lagrangian method for vortex cavitation the cavitating vortex forms and sheds at the leading and trailing edge of the foil alternatively with a pair of asymmetric vortex structures observed the trailing edge cavitating vortex has a regular vortex shape and a clear boundary between the vortex structures for cavitating vortex street vortex shedding process is not independent instead the vortex braid between the trailing edge cavitating vortexes and the so called cat s eye vortex row can be obviously observed the center of circulation region is corresponding to low finite time lyapunov exponent ftle value and the bridges of the ftle is concentrated in the boundary of the vortex structure and curling in the dynamic surrounding of the circulation region the trajectory of the points well presents the dynamic flow pattern for cloud cavitation pattern the cavity develops to cover the entire suction surface and the cloud cavity sheds downstream periodically 1 introduction in recent years the unsteady cavitation behaviors have attracted increasing attention due to their serious effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the blade and hydraulic systems lu et al 2015 ma et al 2018 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 and even on the energy efficiency of the power and propulsion systems gohil and saini 2015 long et al 2016 manko et al 2003 particularly hydrofoil design and optimization in super cavitating conditions are always hot research problems bonfiglio et al 2017 bonfiglio et al 2018a vernengo et al 2017 bonfiglio et al 2018b vernengo et al 2016 royset et al 2017 among which the tulin hydrofoil is of great interest in many different applications such as support surfaces of super high speed hydrofoil crafts support or active control surfaces of super ventilated underwater or surface crafts and supercavitating and surface piercing propellers young and savander 2011 alimirzazadeh et al 2016 yari and ghassemi 2016 brizzolara 2015 due to a sharp leading edge and a relatively thick trailing edge of tulin hydrofoil tulin 2001 the unsteady cavitation behaviors and the vortex cavitation interactions around tulin hydrofoil become more obvious and acuter li et al 2008 in order to study the cavitating performance much experimental work has been carried out to investigate the attached cavitation around the straight hydrofoils such as the standard naca series hydrofoils and clark y series hydrofoils wu et al 2018 yang et al 2017 chen et al 2017a coutier delgosha et al 2007 dular et al 2012 tanimura tanimura et al 1995 experimentally investigated the mechanism of cloud cavitation around a hydrofoil with a high speed camera and a high speed video camera the results showed that a re entrant jet is formed from the downstream of the cavity and leads to the cavity shedding and unstable flow characteristics laberteaux and ceccio laberteaux and ceccio 2001a observed two types of partial cavities with closed partial cavities formed on a two dimensional naca0009 hydrofoil and open partial cavities without re entrant flow formed on a planoconvex hydrofoil cavities forming on test objects with spanwise variation were investigated the interface of the closed cavities curved smoothly to form a re entrant jet at the cavity terminus and the re entrant flow was directed spanwise thus preventing its impingement on the cavity interface laberteaux and ceccio 2001b arndt arndt and wosnik 2008 applied the particle image velocimetry piv technology to measure the wake flow around a naca0015 hydrofoil in no cavitation and cavitation conditions the results showed that the generation of cavitation can significantly change the flow field structure and increase the low speed wake region significantly the piv technology and the high speed photography are also used by katz gopalan and kate 2000 to measure the flow structure at the closure region and downstream of attached cavitation it is found that when the cavity is thin there is no reverse flow downstream the cavity shedding creates hairpin like vortices structure and the cavity collapse changes the turbulent flow characteristics wang wang et al 2001 studied different cavitation mechanisms around a clark y hydrofoil by using a high speed video camera and laser doppler velocity ldv including initial cavitation sheet cavitation cloud cavitation and supercavitation the results showed that the clustered hairpin like counter rotating cavity vortices occur at incipient cavitation a finger like structure on the leading edge and an oscillatory wavy structure on the trailing edge appear at sheet cavitation stage and large scale vortex structures and re entrant jet

showed that the turbulent velocity fluctuations increased obviously in the cavitation and wake region with the thicker turbulent boundary layer thickness and the higher turbulent intensities however there is still lack of studies for the specific supercavitation blade such as the tulin hydrofoil and not much available data for the flow patterns around it due to the limitation of the experimental

investigate the turbulent vortex cavitation interactions in transient sheet cloud cavitating flows and the results showed strong correlation between the cavity and vorticity structures chen et al chen et al 2017b investigated the flow structure and dynamics of a cascading cavitation shedding regime around a three dimensional twisted hydrofoil using the les approach the predicted cavitation flow behavior agrees well with the experimental observations ji et al ji et al 2015 coupled the les with a homogeneous cavitation model to predict the vapor fraction pressure velocity and vorticity around a naca66 hydrofoil the results verified the relationship between the cavity shedding process and the pressure fluctuations although much effort has been made to the cavitating flow around different hydrofoils most of which are limited to the attached cavitation and few of them have been designed for the supercavitation applications hence an improved understanding of the unsteady cavitating flow

setup which is shown in fig 4 according to the previous research ji et al 2015 sagaut 2002 chen et al 2010a lakshmipathy and girimaji 2010 the spanwise domain should be at least twice the thickness of the hydrofoil to resolve streamwise vortex in this paper considering the space economy and the computational efficiency the width of the computational domain is set as 0 3c which is triple the thickness of the tulin hydrofoil moreover the length and the height of the computational domain is set according to the real size of the test section to make the turbulence intensity of the inflow and the blockage ratio of the section consistent with the experiment the boundary conditions are including the inlet velocity and the outlet pressure the top and bottom boundaries of the tunnel are no slip wall the front and back boundaries of the tunnel are symmetry the important non dimensional parameter cavitation number σ is defined as 14 σ p p v 0 5 ρ l u where p is the tunnel pressure p v is

water at 25 c the 3d fluid mesh is given in fig 5 we used a structured grid strategy in computational mesh it is noted that the values of y calculated at the first grid point away from the hydrofoil surface were within 1 2 three meshes which give a constant refinement ratio r n fine n course 2 are used in the grid convergence study where n is the number of grid nodes as shown in table 3 the mesh distribution in mid plane is the same for all three cases according to the mesh generation method in previous 2d hydrofoil research li et al 2008 li et al 2009 the only difference is the number of nodes in the spanwise direction the relative error is estimated based on richardson extrapolation richardson 1911 richardson and gaunt 1927 do et al 2010 the averaged lift coefficient c l mean is defined as c l mean l 0 5ρu 2 sc l is the averaged lift and s is the span of hydrofoil as the relative errors are less than 1 the results for mesh iii are considered as mesh independent and the subsequent simulations are performed with the meshing scheme of mesh iii the simulations were conducted using commercial cfd software the unsteady cavitating flow simulations were started from a steady non cavitating flow field the cavitation model and unsteady solver were then turned on for the cavitating flow simulations the time step was set to 3 5 10 5 s t ref 200 where t r e f c u this treatment also is an effective way to investigate the fundamental turbulent vortex interaction used les method as reported recently by many researchers ji et al 2015 coutier delgosha et al 2003b 3 4 lagrangian coherent structures lcss contrast to the eulerian viewpoint such as the vorticity q and λ2 criterion haller 2005 davidson 2004 jeong and hussain 1995 tabor and klapper 1994 the lagrangian coherent structures lcss can be regarded as a trajectory based approach by considering the fluid flow as a dynamic system of fluid particles the lcss are extracted from the finite time lyapunov exponent ftle which characterizes the separation rate of neighborhood trajectories during a finite time haller and yuan 2000 tseng and liu 2016 to characterize the separation rate of the infinitely close trajectories the lyapunov exponent is defined as 15 σ lim t δ x 0 0 1 t ln δ x x 0 t δ x 0 where t is the time x 0 is an arbitrary point in the dynamical system based on the cauchy green deformation tensor the separation rate can be acquired as 16 δ t 0 t l e x 0 x t 0 t l e t 0 x 0 x 0 t x t t l e t 0 x 0 x 0 where t le is the time interval x t 0 t le t 0 x 0 is the new position of point x 0 after t le then the finite time lyapunov exponent ftle during the time interval t le is defined as 17 σ t 0 t l e x 0 1 t l e ln λ max δ t 0 t l e x 0 where λ max δ t 0 t l e x 0 is the max eigenvalue of the cauchy green deformation tensor based on the ftle field the lagrangian coherent structures lcs can be obtained with ridges of the ftle field and has been proven useful to capture the vortex boundary tseng and liu 2016 wu et al 2016b zhang et al 2018b 4 results and discussions 4 1 global flow patterns in different cavitation regimes experiments are performed for different cavitation regimes including inception cavitation σ 1 57 vortex cavitation σ 1 27 cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 cloud cavitation σ 0 87 mixture supercavitation σ 0 67 and developed supercavitation σ 0 54 fig 6 shows the experimental observations and predicted cavity patterns at different cavitation regimes good agreement is obtained between the experimental observations and numerical simulations for the inception cavitation σ 1 57 as shown in fig 6 a the cavity vortex is formed at the leading edge of suction side and the trailing edge of the pressure side without attached cavitation around the hydrofoil due to the relatively high cavitation number the pressure of the whole flow field is too high to induce large scale cavity it shows that the small scale cavity rotates and soon collapses downstream for the vortex cavitation σ 1 27 the cavitation area is significantly enlarged as shown in fig 6 b two pairs of vortices which are developed from the leading and trailing edge respectively can be obviously observed with decreasing of the cavitation number the cavitation vortex street develops more sufficiently as shown in fig 6 c in the vortex street the leading edge lower vortices developed more fully than the trailing edge upper vortices the interaction between the upper and the lower cavity vortex becomes more acuter for the cloud cavitation σ 0 87 as shown in fig 6 d the cavity develops to cover the entire suction surface and the large scale cloud cavity sheds downstream periodically due to the entrainment of vortex and the influence of the re entrant jet the cloud cavity breaks off from the head of the suction side with decreasing of the cavitation number the supercavitation pattern can be observed when the cavitation number σ 0 67 the cavity length is more than three times of the chord length as shown in fig 6 e the cavity is in a two phase coexistence phase the small scale vortex structures are shedding at rear end of the cavity when the cavitation number further decreases to σ 0 54 the supercavitation develops completely and there is a stable interface between the water phase and vapor phase as shown in fig 6 f for the developed supercavitation the cavitation area is basically full of the vapor accompanied with the mixture of water and vapor in the back part the water vapor mixing zone is mainly concentrated in the lower part of the suction surface which is a relatively narrow band area and fluctuates within a certain range 4 2 turbulent vortex cavitation interactions in transient cavitating flows in this section further analysis of the cavitating flow structures will be conducted with focus on three stages vortex cavitation σ 1 27 cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 and cloud cavitation σ 0 87 4 2 1 vortex cavitation σ 1 27 for the vortex cavitation stage fig 7 shows the time evolution of the cavity for the case with σ 1 27 during the whole development process the cavitating vortex forms and sheds at the leading and trailing edge of the foil alternatively with a pair of asymmetric vortex structures observed as shown in fig 8 it should be noted that both the cavitating vortex structures don t attach on the foil surface for the upper cavitating vortex structures at the trailing edge of the foil from t 1 to t 2 a cavity is formed in the center of the trailing edge vortex which is initially concentrated in a very small area as shown in fig 7 a b then the cavitating vortex rotates clockwise with the cavity diameter increasing from t 3 to t 4 and the trailing edge cavitating vortex develops to the maximum at t t 5 as shown in fig 7 c e after that the cavitating vortex gradually decreases and moves downstream from t 6 to t 8 finally collapses at t t 9 as shown in fig 7 i while for the lower cavitating vortex structures at the leading edge of the foil the cavitation area is larger and less regular than the upper cavitating vortex structures this is mainly because of the lower pressure distribution on the suction side of the hydrofoil in order to further analyze the evolution of the cavitating vortex structures in this stage figs 9 and 10 show the ftle field and the lagrangian coherent structures lcs near the leading and trailing edge of the foil respectively the ftle characterizes the stretching distance of adjacent points over a period of time for the leading edge cavitating vortex structures as shown in fig 9 the high value of ftle is meandering streamwise capturing the front and boundary of the vortex structures besides fig 9 a shows the changes of location of two adjacent vortices at t 3 and t 3 tle and fig 9 b shows the trajectory of the specific points in the adjacent vortices from fig 9 a and b it is noted that particles in group a and group b rotate counter clockwise move toward downstream two vortices develop gradually and merge together finally this is corresponding to the enlargement and development of the vortex cavitation pattern shown in fig 7 c 7 h while for the trailing edge cavitating vortex structures as shown in fig 10 the high value of ftle is concentrated in the region at the rear end of the foil and stretches downstream with shape of a vortex braid from the lagrangian tracer and the trajectory of the specific points it can be seen that the vortices near the trailing edge group c rotate clockwise and are partly entrained to the reverse flow direction while the vortices away from the trailing edge group d rotate counter clockwise and move downstream this is closely related to the development of the trailing edge vortex cavitation 4 2 2 cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 with decreasing of the cavitation number the cavitation pattern around the tulin hydrofoil developed to the cavitating vortex street fig 11 shows the evolution of the cavity patterns during the cavitating vortex street stage σ 1 07 a trailing edge upper cavitating vortex is formed at t 1 and matches with a leading edge lower cavitating vortex at t 2 in a horizontal distance of 0 17c from the tail of the hydrofoil then the merged cavitating vortex structure sheds downstream at t 3 which is mainly dominated by the upper vortices from t 4 to t 6 as shown in fig 11 d 11 f the previous trailing edge cavitating vortex sheds downstream and a new vortex structure has been formed at the trailing edge of the hydrofoil during this stage there is no independent vortex shedding process instead the vortex braid between the trailing edge cavitating vortexes and the so called cat s eye vortex row can be obviously observed as shown in fig 12 to further analyze the flow structures of the cavitating vortex street fig 13 shows the z vorticity contours and the streamlines at representative times it can be observed that the z vorticity can well capture the evolution of the vortex structures in such a transient flow field with the extremum value representing the centers of the circulation regions in fig 13 the counter clockwise is defined as positive z vorticity value and the clockwise is defined as negative value as shown in fig 13 a 13 c the z vorticity region with negative value increases which is corresponding to the development of the trailing edge vortex structures meanwhile the z vorticity region with positive value further develops from upstream to the trailing edge of the foil then the leading and trailing edge vortexes with opposite revolving direction interact with each other resulting to the shedding of the trailing edge vortex and the leading edge vortex successively as shown in fig 13 d 13 f figs 14 and 15 show the ftle field and the trajectory of specific points in the leading and trailing edge vortexes as the ftle represents the dynamic flow tendency instead of the current status the center of circulation region is corresponding to low ftle value and the bridges of the ftle lcs is concentrated in the boundary of the vortex structure curling in the dynamic surrounding of the circulation region from the trajectory of the points located in the middle and rear end of the leading edge vortex structures the later part of the leading edge vortex is partly entrained upward and merged with the trailing edge vortex as shown in the points b and c while the points located in the boundary of the leading edge vortex seen the points a and d move along the bridges of the ftle and downstream as for the points put in the trailing edge vortex structures as seen the points g and h in fig 15 both the upper and lower part of the trailing edge vortex rotate clockwise and meanwhile shed downstream to further investigate the shedding performance table 4 compares the characteristic shedding time and length for the vortex cavitation σ 1 27 and the cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 the period time t 0 for the cavitating vortex street is longer than that for the vortex cavitation and the shedding frequency is lower this is because with the cavitation number decreasing the cavitation is developed more sufficiently with larger maximum diameter of the vortex structures which needs more time while the relative time of the vortex development t 1 t 0 in which t 1 is counted from the formation to the maximum of the vortex structure is shorter for the cavitating vortex street this is due to the complex interaction between the leading and trailing edge vortex which makes the shedding process dominant in the whole period from table 4 it can be also found that the location for cavity collapse is 1 84c for the vortex cavitation and 2 99c for the cavitating vortex street which is corresponding to the long vortex braid in the flow field as shown in figs 11 and 12 4 2 3 cloud cavitation σ 0 87 fig 16 shows the evolution of the cavity patterns and vortex structures at cloud cavitation stage σ 0 87 good agreement can be obtained between the experimental observations and numerical simulations the cavity develops completely and large scale cloud cavity forms develops and sheds periodically with the periodical time of t 0 25 ms at t t 1 as shown in fig 16 a with shedding of the large scale cloud cavity in the previous period a new small cavity begins to form at the leading edge of hydrofoil which is accompanied by the small counter clockwise vortex structure inside the cavitation region from t t 2 to t t 4 the leading edge cavity develops towards the trailing edge at the same time the leading edge vortex rotates counter clockwise and moves downstream with a well defined boundary line between the cavities which turns into a vortex braid to connect the rear and front vortexes as shown in fig 16 d until t t 5 as shown in fig 16 e the cavity is attached on the whole suction side of hydrofoil and the previous large scale cloud cavity sheds away completely due to the interaction between the clockwise and the counter clockwise vortex structures at t t 6 as shown in fig 16 f due to the entrainment effect of the leading edge vortex and the interaction between the re entrant jet and the cavity interface the cavity cut off from the leading edge and sheds downstream 5 conclusion in this study physical and numerical investigations are conducted for a tulin hydrofoil at different cavitation regimes the flow structures of vortex cavitation cavitating vortex street and cloud cavitation are further investigated with the euler and lagrangian method the primary findings are as follows 1 with decreasing of the cavitation number different cavitation regimes occur around the tulin hydrofoil for the inception cavitation σ 1 57 the cavity vortex is formed at the leading edge of suction side and the trailing edge of the pressure side without attached cavitation around the hydrofoil for the vortex cavitation σ 1 27 and the cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 two pairs of vortices which are developed from the leading and trailing edge respectively can be obviously observed for the cloud cavitation σ 0 87 the cavity develops to cover the entire suction surface and the large scale cloud cavity sheds downstream periodically with further decreasing of the cavitation number the supercavitation pattern is observed at σ 0 67 and σ 0 54 with a stable interface between the water phase and vapor phase 2 for vortex cavitation the cavitating vortex forms and sheds at the leading and trailing edge of the foil alternatively with a pair of asymmetric vortex structures observed it should be noted that both the cavitating vortex structures don t attach on the foil surface compare to the trailing edge cavitating vortex structures the cavitation area for the lower cavitating vortex structures at the leading edge of the foil is larger and less regular because of the lower pressure distribution on the suction side of the hydrofoil the ftle characterizes the stretching distance of adjacent points over a period of time and the high value of ftle is meandering streamwise capturing the front and boundary of the vortex structures 3 for cavitating vortex street pattern the cavitation pattern around the tulin hydrofoil developed to the cavitating vortex street which consists of alternating evolution of upper and lower vortexes with the vortex braid between the trailing edge cavitating vortexes and the so called cat s eye vortex row obviously observed the z vorticity can well capture the evolution of the vortex structures in such a transient flow field with the extremum value representing the centers of the circulation regions and the ftle represents the dynamic flow tendency instead of the current status with the center of circulation region corresponding to low ftle value and the bridges of the ftle lcs concentrated in the boundary of the vortex structure curling in the dynamic surrounding of the circulation region 4 for the cloud cavitation the cavity develops completely and large scale cloud cavity forms develops and sheds periodically during this stage the cavity is attached on the whole suction side of hydrofoil when it reaches to the maximum and large scale cloud cavity sheds away completely due to the interaction between the clockwise and the counter clockwise vortex structures due to the entrainment of the leading edge vortex and the interaction between the re entrant jet and the cavity interface the cloud cavity cuts off from the leading edge and sheds downstream in this paper we focus on the investigation of different cavitating flow patterns around a tulin hydrofoil from 2d viewpoint in the future the top view of the cavity patterns will be studied which can help to better understand the three dimensional cavity patterns in order to better reveal the vortex cavitation interaction mechanism the hydrodynamic characteristics for different cavitation regimes will be also further discussed acknowledgement this

the cavitation patterns the numerical investigations are performed using a large eddy simulation method and the zwart cavitation model the results showed that the predicted cavity formation and evolution agree well with the experimental observation with decreasing of the cavitation number different cavitating flow patterns occur around the hydrofoil namely inception cavitation σ 1 57 vortex cavitation σ 1 27 cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 cloud cavitation σ 0 87 mixture supercavitation σ 0 67 and developed supercavitation σ 0 54 especially the flow structures of vortex cavitation cavitating vortex street and cloud cavitation were further investigated with the euler and lagrangian method for vortex cavitation the cavitating vortex forms and sheds at the leading and trailing edge of the foil alternatively with a pair of asymmetric vortex structures observed the trailing edge cavitating vortex has a regular vortex shape and a clear boundary between the vortex structures for cavitating vortex street vortex shedding process is not independent instead the vortex braid between the trailing edge cavitating vortexes and the so called cat s eye vortex row can be obviously observed the center of circulation region is corresponding to low finite time lyapunov exponent ftle value and the bridges of the ftle is concentrated in the boundary of the vortex structure and curling in the dynamic surrounding of the circulation region the trajectory of the points well presents the dynamic flow pattern for cloud cavitation pattern the cavity develops to cover the entire suction surface and the cloud cavity sheds downstream periodically 1 introduction in recent years the unsteady cavitation behaviors have attracted increasing attention due to their serious effect on the hydrodynamic performance of the blade and hydraulic systems lu et al 2015 ma et al 2018 wang et al 2018 wu et al 2018 and even on the energy efficiency of the power and propulsion systems gohil and saini 2015 long et al 2016 manko et al 2003 particularly hydrofoil design and optimization in super cavitating conditions are always hot research problems bonfiglio et al 2017 bonfiglio et al 2018a vernengo et al 2017 bonfiglio et al 2018b vernengo et al 2016 royset et al 2017 among which the tulin hydrofoil is of great interest in many different applications such as support surfaces of super high speed hydrofoil crafts support or active control surfaces of super ventilated underwater or surface crafts and supercavitating and surface piercing propellers young and savander 2011 alimirzazadeh et al 2016 yari and ghassemi 2016 brizzolara 2015 due to a sharp leading edge and a relatively thick trailing edge of tulin hydrofoil tulin 2001 the unsteady cavitation behaviors and the vortex cavitation interactions around tulin hydrofoil become more obvious and acuter li et al 2008 in order to study the cavitating performance much experimental work has been carried out to investigate the attached cavitation around the straight hydrofoils such as the standard naca series hydrofoils and clark y series hydrofoils wu et al 2018 yang et al 2017 chen et al 2017a coutier delgosha et al 2007 dular et al 2012 tanimura tanimura et al 1995 experimentally investigated the mechanism of cloud cavitation around a hydrofoil with a high speed camera and a high speed video camera the results showed that a re entrant jet is formed from the downstream of the cavity and leads to the cavity shedding and unstable flow characteristics laberteaux and ceccio laberteaux and ceccio 2001a observed two types of partial cavities with closed partial cavities formed on a two dimensional naca0009 hydrofoil and open partial cavities without re entrant flow formed on a planoconvex hydrofoil cavities forming on test objects with spanwise variation were investigated the interface of the closed cavities curved smoothly to form a re entrant jet at the cavity terminus and the re entrant flow was directed spanwise thus preventing its impingement on the cavity interface laberteaux and ceccio 2001b arndt arndt and wosnik 2008 applied the particle image velocimetry piv technology to measure the wake flow around a naca0015 hydrofoil in no cavitation and cavitation conditions the results showed that the generation of cavitation can significantly change the flow field structure and increase the low speed wake region significantly the piv technology and the high speed photography are also used by katz gopalan and kate 2000 to measure the flow structure at the closure region and downstream of attached cavitation it is found that when the cavity is thin there is no reverse flow downstream the cavity shedding creates hairpin like vortices structure and the cavity collapse changes the turbulent flow characteristics wang wang et al 2001 studied different cavitation mechanisms around a clark y hydrofoil by using a high speed video camera and laser doppler velocity ldv including initial cavitation sheet cavitation cloud cavitation and supercavitation the results showed that the clustered hairpin like counter rotating cavity vortices occur at incipient cavitation a finger like structure on the leading edge and an oscillatory wavy structure on the trailing edge appear at sheet cavitation stage and large scale vortex structures and re entrant jet forms at cloud cavitation huang huang et al 2013a b zhang et al 2018a wu et al 2015 experimentally investigated the unsteady structure of sheet cloud cavitation around a clark y hydrofoil the results showed that the turbulent velocity fluctuations increased obviously in the cavitation and wake region with the thicker turbulent boundary layer thickness and the higher turbulent intensities however there is still lack of studies for the specific supercavitation blade such as the tulin hydrofoil and not much available data for the flow patterns around it due to the limitation of the experimental measurement and the improvement of computing technique numerical simulations have played an important role in predicting the cavitating flow and capturing the interaction between the cavitation patterns and turbulent flow structures asnaghi et al 2018 asnaghi et al 2017 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 delannoy and kueny delannoy 1990 used the barotropic state law and linked the mixture density

predicted the void fraction based on the bubble radius merkle et al merkle et al 1998 and kunz et al kunz et al 2000 established the transport equation based on the dimensional analysis and the experimental observations singhal et al singhal 2002 presented the full cavitation model considering the effect of the turbulent fluctuations of pressure and velocity and the noncondensible gas senocak and shyy senocak and shyy 2004a senocak and shyy 2004b developed the interfacial dynamic model which theoretically eliminated the effect of the empirical coefficient on the cavitation model many comparative studies of the above cavitation models can be referred to wang et al 2017 and huang et al 2012 cavitating flow is generally relatively high reynolds number flow and the turbulence model is critical for capturing the unsteady turbulent cavitating flow behaviors the reynolds average navier stokes rans equation approach has been widely used with the turbulent eddy viscosity modified to overcome the over prediction of the turbulence viscosity johansen et al 2004 yang et al 2011 huang et al 2013a b as the non physical modification of the turbulence model is depending on the empirical coefficient and does not apply to different type of cavitating flows the rans method has been replaced by the large eddy simulation les to give a better capture the large scale turbulent eddies and the transient turbulence structures mohammad reza and ehsan 2018 wu et al 2016a yang et al 2018 bai et al 2018 huang et al huang et al 2014 utilized the large eddy simulation approach to investigate the turbulent vortex cavitation interactions in transient sheet cloud cavitating flows and the results showed strong correlation between the cavity and vorticity structures chen et al chen et al 2017b investigated the flow structure and dynamics of a cascading cavitation shedding regime around a three dimensional twisted hydrofoil using the les approach the predicted cavitation flow behavior agrees well with the experimental observations ji et al ji et al 2015 coupled the les with a homogeneous cavitation model to predict the vapor fraction pressure velocity and vorticity around a naca66 hydrofoil the results verified the relationship between the cavity shedding process and the pressure fluctuations although much effort has been made to the cavitating flow around different hydrofoils most of which are limited to the attached cavitation and few of them have been designed for the supercavitation applications hence an improved understanding of the unsteady cavitating flow patterns and the vortex cavitation interactions around a tulin hydrofoil will help to optimize the design and to enhance performance of the high speed hydrofoil crafts surface piercing propellers et

setup which is shown in fig 4 according to the previous research ji et al 2015 sagaut 2002 chen et al 2010a lakshmipathy and girimaji 2010 the spanwise domain should be at least twice the thickness of the hydrofoil to resolve streamwise vortex in this paper considering the space economy and the computational efficiency the width of the computational domain is set as 0 3c which is triple the thickness of the tulin hydrofoil moreover the length and the height of the computational domain is set according to the real size of the test section to make the turbulence intensity of the inflow and the blockage ratio of the section consistent with the experiment the boundary conditions are including the inlet velocity and the outlet pressure the top and bottom boundaries of the tunnel are no slip wall the front and back boundaries of the tunnel are symmetry the important non dimensional parameter cavitation number σ is defined as 14 σ p p v 0 5 ρ l u where p is the tunnel pressure p v is the saturated vapor pressure the mean free stream velocity u is 10 m s the reynolds number is defined as re u c ν 7 0 105 where c is the chord length and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid water at 25 c the 3d fluid mesh is given in fig 5 we used a structured grid strategy in computational mesh it is noted that the values of y calculated at the first grid point away from the hydrofoil surface were within 1 2 three meshes which give a constant refinement ratio r n fine n course 2 are used in the grid convergence study where n is the number of grid nodes as shown in table 3 the mesh distribution in mid plane is the same for all three cases according to the mesh generation method in previous 2d hydrofoil research li et al 2008 li et al 2009 the only difference is the number of nodes in the spanwise direction the relative error is estimated based on richardson extrapolation richardson 1911 richardson and gaunt 1927 do et al 2010 the averaged lift coefficient c l mean is defined as c l mean l 0 5ρu 2 sc l is the averaged lift and s is the span of hydrofoil as the relative errors are less than 1 the results for mesh iii are considered as mesh independent and the subsequent simulations are performed with the meshing scheme of mesh iii the simulations were conducted using commercial cfd software the unsteady cavitating flow simulations were started from a steady non cavitating flow field the cavitation model and unsteady solver were then turned on for the cavitating flow simulations the time step was set to 3 5 10 5 s t ref 200 where t r e f c u this treatment also is an effective way to investigate the fundamental turbulent vortex interaction used les method as reported recently by many researchers ji et al 2015 coutier delgosha et al 2003b 3 4 lagrangian coherent structures lcss contrast to the eulerian viewpoint such as the vorticity q and λ2 criterion haller 2005 davidson 2004 jeong and hussain 1995 tabor and klapper 1994 the lagrangian coherent structures lcss can be regarded as a trajectory based approach by considering the fluid flow as a dynamic system of fluid particles the lcss are extracted from the finite time lyapunov exponent ftle which characterizes the separation rate of neighborhood trajectories during a finite time haller and yuan 2000 tseng and liu 2016 to characterize the separation rate of the infinitely close trajectories the lyapunov exponent is defined as 15 σ lim t δ x 0 0 1 t ln δ x x 0 t δ x 0 where t is the time x 0 is an arbitrary point in the dynamical system based on the cauchy green deformation tensor the separation rate can be acquired as 16 δ t 0 t l e x 0 x t 0 t l e t 0 x 0 x 0 t x t t l e t 0 x 0 x 0 where t le is the time interval x t 0 t le t 0 x 0 is the new position of point x 0 after t le then the finite time lyapunov exponent ftle during the time interval t le is defined as 17 σ t 0 t l e x 0 1 t l e ln λ max δ t 0 t l e x 0 where λ max δ t 0 t l e x 0 is the max eigenvalue of the cauchy green deformation tensor based on the ftle field the lagrangian coherent structures lcs can be obtained with ridges of the ftle field and has been proven useful to capture the vortex boundary tseng and liu 2016 wu et al 2016b zhang et al 2018b 4 results and discussions 4 1 global flow patterns in different cavitation regimes experiments are performed for different cavitation regimes including inception cavitation σ 1 57 vortex cavitation σ 1 27 cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 cloud cavitation σ 0 87 mixture supercavitation σ 0 67 and developed supercavitation σ 0 54 fig 6 shows the experimental observations and predicted cavity patterns at different cavitation regimes good agreement is obtained between the experimental observations and numerical simulations for the inception cavitation σ 1 57 as shown in fig 6 a the cavity vortex is formed at the leading edge of suction side and the trailing edge of the pressure side without attached cavitation around the hydrofoil due to the relatively high cavitation number the pressure of the whole flow field is too high to induce large scale cavity it shows that the small scale cavity rotates and soon collapses downstream for the vortex cavitation σ 1 27 the cavitation area is significantly enlarged as shown in fig 6 b two pairs of vortices which are developed from the leading and trailing edge respectively can be obviously observed with decreasing of the cavitation number the cavitation vortex street develops more sufficiently as shown in fig 6 c in the vortex street the leading edge lower vortices developed more fully than the trailing edge upper vortices the interaction between the upper and the lower cavity vortex becomes more acuter for the cloud cavitation σ 0 87 as shown in fig 6 d the cavity develops to cover the entire suction surface and the large scale cloud cavity sheds downstream periodically due to the entrainment of vortex and the influence of the re entrant jet the cloud cavity breaks off from the head of the suction side with decreasing of the cavitation number the supercavitation pattern can be observed when the cavitation number σ 0 67 the cavity length is more than three times of the chord length as shown in fig 6 e the cavity is in a two phase coexistence phase the small scale vortex structures are shedding at rear end of the cavity when the cavitation number further decreases to σ 0 54 the supercavitation develops completely and there is a stable interface between the water phase and vapor phase as shown in fig 6 f for the developed supercavitation the cavitation area is basically full of the vapor accompanied with the mixture of water and vapor in the back part the water vapor mixing zone is mainly concentrated in the lower part of the suction surface which is a relatively narrow band area and fluctuates within a certain range 4 2 turbulent vortex cavitation interactions in transient cavitating flows in this section further analysis of the cavitating flow structures will be conducted with focus on three stages vortex cavitation σ 1 27 cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 and cloud cavitation σ 0 87 4 2 1 vortex cavitation σ 1 27 for the vortex cavitation stage fig 7 shows the time evolution of the cavity for the case with σ 1 27 during the whole development process the cavitating vortex forms and sheds at the leading and trailing edge of the foil alternatively with a pair of asymmetric vortex structures observed as shown in fig 8 it should be noted that both the cavitating vortex structures don t attach on the foil surface for the upper cavitating vortex structures at the trailing edge of the foil from t 1 to t 2 a cavity is formed in the center of the trailing edge vortex which is initially concentrated in a very small area as shown in fig 7 a b then the cavitating vortex rotates clockwise with the cavity diameter increasing from t 3 to t 4 and the trailing edge cavitating vortex develops to the maximum at t t 5 as shown in fig 7 c e after that the cavitating vortex gradually decreases and moves downstream from t 6 to t 8 finally collapses at t t 9 as shown in fig 7 i while for the lower cavitating vortex structures at the leading edge of the foil the cavitation area is larger and less regular than the upper cavitating vortex structures this is mainly because of the lower pressure distribution on the suction side of the hydrofoil in order to further analyze the evolution of the cavitating vortex structures in this stage figs 9 and 10 show the ftle field and the lagrangian coherent structures lcs near the leading and trailing edge of the foil respectively the ftle characterizes the stretching distance of adjacent points over a period of time for the leading edge cavitating vortex structures as shown in fig 9 the high value of ftle is meandering streamwise capturing the front and boundary of the vortex structures besides fig 9 a shows the changes of location of two adjacent vortices at t 3 and t 3 tle and fig 9 b shows the trajectory of the specific points in the adjacent vortices from fig 9 a and b it is noted that particles in group a and group b rotate counter clockwise move toward downstream two vortices develop gradually and merge together finally this is corresponding to the enlargement and development of the vortex cavitation pattern shown in fig 7 c 7 h while for the trailing edge cavitating vortex structures as shown in fig 10 the high value of ftle is concentrated in the region at the rear end of the foil and stretches downstream with shape of a vortex braid from the lagrangian tracer and the trajectory of the specific points it can be seen that the vortices near the trailing edge group c rotate clockwise and are partly entrained to the reverse flow direction while the vortices away from the trailing edge group d rotate counter clockwise and move downstream this is closely related to the development of the trailing edge vortex cavitation 4 2 2 cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 with decreasing of the cavitation number the cavitation pattern around the tulin hydrofoil developed to the cavitating vortex street fig 11 shows the evolution of the cavity patterns during the cavitating vortex street stage σ 1 07 a trailing edge upper cavitating vortex is formed at t 1 and matches with a leading edge lower cavitating vortex at t 2 in a horizontal distance of 0 17c from the tail of the hydrofoil then the merged cavitating vortex structure sheds downstream at t 3 which is mainly dominated by the upper vortices from t 4 to t 6 as shown in fig 11 d 11 f the previous trailing edge cavitating vortex sheds downstream and a new vortex structure has been formed at the trailing edge of the hydrofoil during this stage there is no independent vortex shedding process instead the vortex braid between the trailing edge cavitating vortexes and the so called cat s eye vortex row can be obviously observed as shown in fig 12 to further analyze the flow structures of the cavitating vortex street fig 13 shows the z vorticity contours and the streamlines at representative times it can be observed that the z vorticity can well capture the evolution of the vortex structures in such a transient flow field with the extremum value representing the centers of the circulation regions in fig 13 the counter clockwise is defined as positive z vorticity value and the clockwise is defined as negative value as shown in fig 13 a 13 c the z vorticity region with negative value increases which is corresponding to the development of the trailing edge vortex structures meanwhile the z vorticity region with positive value further develops from upstream to the trailing edge of the foil then the leading and trailing edge vortexes with opposite revolving direction interact with each other resulting to the shedding of the trailing edge vortex and the leading edge vortex successively as shown in fig 13 d 13 f figs 14 and 15 show the ftle field and the trajectory of specific points in the leading and trailing edge vortexes as the ftle represents the dynamic flow tendency instead of the current status the center of circulation region is corresponding to low ftle value and the bridges of the ftle lcs is concentrated in the boundary of the vortex structure curling in the dynamic surrounding of the circulation region from the trajectory of the points located in the middle and rear end of the leading edge vortex structures the later part of the leading edge vortex is partly entrained upward and merged with the trailing edge vortex as shown in the points b and c while the points located in the boundary of the leading edge vortex seen the points a and d move along the bridges of the ftle and downstream as for the points put in the trailing edge vortex structures as seen the points g and h in fig 15 both the upper and lower part of the trailing edge vortex rotate clockwise and meanwhile shed downstream to further investigate the shedding performance table 4 compares the characteristic shedding time and length for the vortex cavitation σ 1 27 and the cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 the period time t 0 for the cavitating vortex street is longer than that for the vortex cavitation and the shedding frequency is lower this is because with the cavitation number decreasing the cavitation is developed more sufficiently with larger maximum diameter of the vortex structures which needs more time while the relative time of the vortex development t 1 t 0 in which t 1 is counted from the formation to the maximum of the vortex structure is shorter for the cavitating vortex street this is due to the complex interaction between the leading and trailing edge vortex which makes the shedding process dominant in the whole period from table 4 it can be also found that the location for cavity collapse is 1 84c for the vortex cavitation and 2 99c for the cavitating vortex street which is corresponding to the long vortex braid in the flow field as shown in figs 11 and 12 4 2 3 cloud cavitation σ 0 87 fig 16 shows the evolution of the cavity patterns and vortex structures at cloud cavitation stage σ 0 87 good agreement can be obtained between the experimental observations and numerical simulations the cavity develops completely and large scale cloud cavity forms develops and sheds periodically with the periodical time of t 0 25 ms at t t 1 as shown in fig 16 a with shedding of the large scale cloud cavity in the previous period a new small cavity begins to form at the leading edge of hydrofoil which is accompanied by the small counter clockwise vortex structure inside the cavitation region from t t 2 to t t 4 the leading edge cavity develops towards the trailing edge at the same time the leading edge vortex rotates counter clockwise and moves downstream with a well defined boundary line between the cavities which turns into a vortex braid to connect the rear and front vortexes as shown in fig 16 d until t t 5 as shown in fig 16 e the cavity is attached on the whole suction side of hydrofoil and the previous large scale cloud cavity sheds away completely due to the interaction between the clockwise and the counter clockwise vortex structures at t t 6 as shown in fig 16 f due to the entrainment effect of the leading edge vortex and the interaction between the re entrant jet and the cavity interface the cavity cut off from the leading edge and sheds downstream 5 conclusion in this study physical and numerical investigations are conducted for a tulin hydrofoil at different cavitation regimes the flow structures of vortex cavitation cavitating vortex street and cloud cavitation are further investigated with the euler and lagrangian method the primary findings are as follows 1 with decreasing of the cavitation number different cavitation regimes occur around the tulin hydrofoil for the inception cavitation σ 1 57 the cavity vortex is formed at the leading edge of suction side and the trailing edge of the pressure side without attached cavitation around the hydrofoil for the vortex cavitation σ 1 27 and the cavitating vortex street σ 1 07 two pairs of vortices which are developed from the leading and trailing edge respectively can be obviously observed for the cloud cavitation σ 0 87 the cavity develops to cover the entire suction surface and the large scale cloud cavity sheds downstream periodically with further decreasing of the cavitation number the supercavitation pattern is observed at σ 0 67 and σ 0 54 with a stable interface between the water phase and vapor phase 2 for vortex cavitation the cavitating vortex forms and sheds at the leading and trailing edge of the foil alternatively with a pair of asymmetric vortex structures observed it should be noted that both the cavitating vortex structures don t attach on the foil surface compare to the trailing edge cavitating vortex structures the cavitation area for the lower cavitating vortex structures at the leading edge of the foil is larger and less regular because of the lower pressure distribution on the suction side of the hydrofoil the ftle characterizes the stretching distance of adjacent points over a period of time and the high value of ftle is meandering streamwise capturing the front and boundary of the vortex structures 3 for cavitating vortex street pattern the cavitation pattern around the tulin hydrofoil developed to the cavitating vortex street which consists of alternating evolution of upper and lower vortexes with the vortex braid between the trailing edge cavitating vortexes and the so called cat s eye vortex row obviously observed the z vorticity can well capture the evolution of the vortex structures in such a transient flow field with the extremum value representing the centers of the circulation regions and the ftle represents the dynamic flow tendency instead of the current status with the center of circulation region corresponding to low ftle value and the bridges of the ftle lcs concentrated in the boundary of the vortex structure curling in the dynamic surrounding of the circulation region 4 for the cloud cavitation the cavity develops completely and large scale cloud cavity forms develops and sheds periodically during this stage the cavity is attached on the whole suction side of hydrofoil when it reaches to the maximum and large scale cloud cavity sheds away completely due to the interaction between the clockwise and the counter clockwise vortex structures due to the entrainment of the leading edge vortex and the interaction between the re entrant jet and the cavity interface the cloud cavity cuts off from the leading edge and sheds downstream in this paper we focus on the investigation of different cavitating flow patterns around a tulin hydrofoil from 2d viewpoint in the future the top view of the cavity patterns will be studied which can help to better understand the three dimensional cavity patterns in order to better reveal the vortex cavitation interaction mechanism the hydrodynamic characteristics for different cavitation regimes will be also further discussed acknowledgement this

22993,suction piles fabricated with glass fiber reinforced plastic gfrp have been regarded as alternatives to conventional steel or reinforced concrete suction piles to reduce the transportation cost and corrosion risk however difficulty may arise in suction installation due to the small weight of the gfrp pile in this study a concrete pile cap was attached to the top of the gfrp pile to add weight provide additional resistance against lateral loading by increasing the contact area with soil and thus solve the problem the field applicability of the gfrp suction pile was verified by performing field tests on suction installation and numerical simulations to analyze structural integrity against design loads results obtained from numerical analyses showed that the gfrp suction pile was stable during penetration and under various loading conditions suggestions for the design of gfrp suction piles were proposed based on the field test results and in consideration of the suction pressure inside the pile keywords gfrp suction pile field test numerical analysis bearing capacity structural integrity 1 introduction many offshore structures have been constructed for offshore space utilization offshore wind turbines and marine resource development in korea a suction pile is a circular surface foundation with thin skirts around its circumference suction piles can be installed economically and efficiently into soil deposits in deep water and have been used extensively in offshore facilities the length to diameter ratio l d of these piles does not exceed 6 0 randolph et al 2005 the skirt of a suction pile penetrates the ground by pumping water out of the pile which creates suction pressure inside it the penetration force for pile installation is proportional to the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pile and the section area of the pile meanwhile the penetration resistance is proportional to the pile diameter therefore as the pile diameter increases the pile can be easily penetrated with suction pressure inside the pile according to a case study the diameter of suction piles ranges from 3 5 to 44 m pile length ranges from 4 to 36 m and water depth is from 30 to 1830 m suction piles are installed in various soil conditions including soft clay and sand however the material of the suction piles is restricted only to steel or reinforced concrete andersen et al 2005 using steel or reinforced concrete for the production of suction piles requires securing a wide area for manufacturing transportation and installation cost significantly increase as the pile diameter increases due to the heavy weight of the materials in addition steel may suffer from corrosion problems caused by long term exposure to seawater and bacteria tomlinson and woodward 2014 so it may not be suitable for repeated use which is one of the important advantages of suction piles in this study a suction pile was fabricated using a glass fiber reinforced plastic gfrp pipe which is a new composite material to solve the disadvantages of conventional steel or reinforced concrete suction piles gfrp possesses better durability against seawater compared with steel or concrete smaller weight with a specific gravity of about one third of that of steel and higher compressive and tensile strength than concrete several researchers have applied gfrp to manufacture composite piles or reinforce steel or concrete piles reddy et al 2009 conducted a finite element analysis of reinforced concrete piles retrofitted using gfrp composites the ultimate axial loading capacity increased to 40 and the lateral bearing capacity increased from 30 to 70 depending on the existing axial load karimi et al 2011a 2011b reported that wrapping a steel column with gfrp and carbon frp laminate sheets significantly improved compressive strength elastic axial stiffness and ultimate displacement giraldo and rayhani 2014 carried out several static laboratory tests on small scale gfrp and hollow steel piles in soft clay to examine frictional performance the axial compressive capacity of the gfrp pile was 40 higher than that of the hollow steel pile however the deflection of the gfrp pile head was larger than that of the hollow steel pile under lateral loading vijay et al 2016 investigated the application of the gfrp shell and wrap system for corroded steel piles by conducting several laboratory tests and implementing them in a rehabilitation program the bearing capacity of the deteriorated steel piles increased significantly and the rehabilitation cost was reduced by up to 10 15 of the traditional replacement cost however no research has been performed on manufacturing suction piles with gfrp materials in the current study several improvements for manufacturing gfrp suction piles were suggested to solve the difficulty in suction installation caused by the small weight of the gfrp pile a concrete pile cap was attached to the top of the gfrp pile to add weight and provide additional resistance against lateral loading the field applicability of the gfrp suction pile was verified by performing field tests on suction installation and numerical simulations to analyze the structural integrity against design loads field experiments were conducted in the southern coast of korea the penetration depth by self weight penetration velocity final penetration depth and installation slope of the gfrp suction pile were measured during repeated penetration and pulling out of the pile numerical analysis was carried out by performing 3d finite element analysis to examine the structural integrity of gfrp materials and the bearing capacity and structural stability of the gfrp pile under various loading conditions such as vertical horizontal and moment loads 2 gfrp suction pile 2 1 introduction the gfrp suction pile used in this study was composed of a pile body made of a gfrp pipe and a pile cap made of concrete as shown in fig 1 a suction pile body made of a gfrp pipe presents better durability against seawater corrosion than steel pipes however gfrp is vulnerable to impact and shear loads hence the pile should be carefully installed conventional suction piles without pile caps have difficulty in penetrating the entire length of the suction pile due to ground heaving inside the pile as shown in fig 1 thus accurate prediction of the final penetration depth is difficult erbrich and tjelta 1999 therefore the use of the concrete pile cap can improve penetration by adding weight and increase lateral resistance by increasing the contact area with soils the gfrp pile in this study was inserted into the concrete pile cap to ensure that the entire length of the suction pile can penetrate the ground due to the thickness of the concrete cap in addition a pad eye for the connection with the mooring line was attached to the side of the concrete cap a steel shoe was attached to the toe of gfrp to prevent damage on gfrp and reduce penetration resistance the gfrp material used in this study consisted of three layers created via continuous filament winding a core layer made of a polymer mortar was inserted between the inner and outer gfrp structure layers as shown in fig 2 the gfrp was created by using glass fiber roving and structural resin and the inner and outer gfrp structure layers strengthen the circumferential strength the gfrp has a young s modulus of about 25 gpa and a tensile strength of about 200 20 mpa the polymer mortar core layer has a young s modulus of about 11 gpa and a high compressive strength of about 100 10 mpa due to the constraining effect of the inside and outside gfrp layers lee et al 2007 the polymer mortar layer reduces the unit cost of gfrp because the material s cost is lower than that of gfrp in addition gfrp can be mass produced in a factory and easily connected at the site the average unit weight of gfrp is generally in the range of 17 6 22 5 kn m3 depending on the manufacturing method and required strength gfrp is lighter than steel or concrete piles and allows for easy handling in the field sea transportation is also possible using buoyancy 2 2 strength characteristics of gfrp the structural strength of gfrp was investigated by performing loading tests before manufacturing a suction pile for field tests the gfrp used in the tests was produced for water and sewage treatment in korea fiber company the gfrp has an inner diameter of 200 mm and a thickness of 9 mm the loading tests included tensile compressive and bending strength tests the tensile strength test was performed in longitudinal and circumferential directions the tensile strength test in the longitudinal direction was performed by applying astm d638 03 2003 and that in the circumferential direction was performed by applying astm d2290 16 2016 test specimens for circumferential tensile loading were prepared by cutting a gfrp into a pipe with 30 mm width and forming a groove of 5 mm in the upper and lower portions the measured tensile strength was about 200 mpa in the longitudinal direction and about 230 mpa in the circumferential direction the uniaxial compressive test was performed on gfrp with a diameter of 200 mm and a length of 400 mm the uniaxial compressive strength of gfrp was about 100 mpa the compressive strength of gfrp was larger than the compressive strength of concrete about 35 mpa and smaller than that of steel about 400 mpa the bending flexural test was performed on gfrp with a diameter of 200 mm and a length of 1200 mm the test was carried out via the four point loading method and the distance between the loading points was 400 mm the bending flexural strength of the gfrp was about 42 kn m the strength test results of the gfrp are summarized in table 1 3 structural stability of gfrp under suction pressure the structural stability against suction pressure needs to be examined numerical analyses were performed with a conventional finite element analysis program abaqus simulia 2010 the suction pile was modeled without the modeling of soils and the structural stability of the pile was analyzed after applying suction pressure to the pile the gfrp for the analyses has 1 8 m diameter 3 0 m length and 36 mm thickness which comprises the dimension of the gfrp pile for the field test table 2 shows the input properties used in the analysis these values were obtained from the strength loading test in this numerical modeling of gfrp under suction the coupled elements between the degree of freedom of displacement and pore water pressure were used to simulate the suction pressure inside the pile a 2d axisymmetric condition was applied to simulate the 3d shape of the pile the gfrp and internal elements subjected to suction pressure were modeled using the shell and solid elements respectively the internal solid element has large permeability and negligible stiffness therefore the same magnitude of the suction pressure will be applied on the inside of the pile regardless of the presence of the solid element the displacement and rotation at the pile tip were fixed the pore water pressure was controlled through consolidation analysis and reduced to 100 kpa which is the maximum possible suction pressure inside the pile table 3 summarizes the analysis results the maximum compressive and tensile stresses in the longitudinal direction were 2 74 and 2 91 mpa respectively the maximum compressive and tensile stresses in the circumferential direction were 2 78 and 1 93 mpa respectively the mobilized stresses in the gfrp under suction pressure were much smaller than the material strength of gfrp therefore the gfrp is considered stable with respect to the suction pressure generated in the pile penetration since the gfrp suction pile is a thin skirt structure the structural integrity of suction piles during installation is generally governed by buckling of the skirts under the required suction pressure suction foundation buckling can be examined by using analytical and numerical methods according to dnvgl rp c202 dnv 2017 for analyzing the buckling strength of shells the elastic buckling strength σ e can be given as follows 1 σ e c π 2 e 12 1 ν 2 t l 2 c ψ 1 ρ ξ ψ 2 where c is the reduced buckling coefficient ν is the poisson s ratio of the material of the suction pile e is the young s modulus of the suction pile t is the thickness of the suction pile l is the unsupported length of the suction pile during installation ρ is a factor accounting for imperfection knockdown factor ξ and ψ are coefficients by considering hydrostatic loading applied to suction piles during installation the coefficients are determined as follows ρ 0 6 ψ 2 and ξ 1 04 z where z is bardorf s parameter or the curvature parameter z l 2 r t 1 ν 2 and r represents the radius of the suction pile subsequently the elastic buckling strength of the suction pile under hydrostatic loading is approximately 2811 mpa in consideration of a lower bound value with no soil support buckling analyses based on the numerical simulation of this study showed a similar buckling stress of approximately 2700 mpa if the suction pressure was increased up to the gfrp strength of 100 mpa the mobilized stresses during installation were considerably smaller than the elastic buckling strength in addition when the suction pile penetrates the ground the buckling capacity would increase with the increase in the confining pressure of the surrounding soil lee and tran 2013 therefore the suction pile used in this study is safe against buckling during installation 4 field penetration tests 4 1 gfrp for field tests in this study a prototype gfrp suction pile was manufactured and installed offshore to evaluate the field applicability of the pile the dimension of the gfrp piles for the field test was 1 8 m inner diameter 3 0 m length and 36 mm thickness as shown in fig 3 the top cover plate of the gfrp pile was made with a dome shape to distribute the stress generated at the connection part between the main body and top plate when the suction pressure was applied the suction pile must be initially penetrated into the ground by its own weight to some extent to maintain the suction pressure however due to the small weight of the gfrp which is about a third of the weight of steel increasing its own weight for initial penetration is necessary therefore the weight of the gfrp pile was increased by connecting the concrete cap to the upper part of the pile generally the wall thickness of a steel suction pile is 0 6 of the pile diameter tran et al 2007 according to this criterion the thickness of the steel suction pile corresponding to the pile diameter of the gfrp pile 1 8 m is about 10 8 mm therefore the weight difference between the gfrp pile and the steel pile with the same diameter was calculated and the weight of the concrete cap was made equal to the weight difference the concrete cap in fig 3 b has an inner diameter of 1 9 m an outer diameter of 2 5 m and a thickness of 0 7 m the concrete cap and gfrp pile were connected by wiring the lifting lugs on each of them two venturi pipes for suction pressure application and an inclinometer for inclination measurement were installed on the upper part of the gfrp pile suction pressure was measured with two water pressure gauges installed inside and outside the pile at the skirt toe of the gfrp pile a wedge shaped shoe made of steel was attached to reduce penetration resistance and increase the buckling resistance of the wall figs 4 and 5 show the process of reinforcing the steel shoe at the toe and the gfrp suction pile being transported on a barge respectively 4 2 test site and site condition field tests were conducted on the southwestern sea of korea the average water depth of this area is 13 5 m and the tidal difference ranges from 2 5 to 5 4 m an offshore wind farm is expected to be built in the area and eight spt tests have been conducted fig 6 shows the boring logs and spt test results the upper soil was a medium or dense sand layer with an spt n value of about 20 30 to 40 30 as shown in fig 6 b soil properties were determined as internal friction angle of 27 cohesion 0 and submerged unit weight 20 0 kn m3 by referring to the boring logs literature kgs 2009 and the suction foundation technical manual pari 2003 4 3 test procedure first the gfrp pile was placed on the sea floor by using a crane second the pile was penetrated by its own weight and then by applying suction pressure in the pile via the suction pump during pile penetration the hydrostatic pressure of the external water pressure gauge was measured to calculate the penetration depth and rate of the pile the inclination of the pile was measured with an inclinometer after pile penetration was completed a diver checked the penetration status of the pile and the pile was pulled out in addition the water depth of the pile was measured at 10 min intervals by using a depth sounder and used for the calculation of penetration depth and for water pressure measurement 4 4 test results fig 7 shows the test results measured during the entire process of pile installation the results include water pressure measurement inside and outside the pile fig 7 a inclination angle of the pile fig 7 b and penetration depth of the pile fig 7 c fig 7 c shows that penetration by self weight was about 0 5 m and stopped at 1150 s thereafter suction pressure which is the difference in water pressure between the inside and outside of the pile was applied to penetrate the pile the final penetration by suction pressure was about 2 2 m and stopped at about 2850 s considering that the length of the gfrp pile was 3 0 m and the thickness of the concrete cap was 0 7 m the maximum effective depth for the penetration was 2 3 m therefore the gfrp pile penetrated up to about 96 of the effective depth in this test the curve slope in fig 7 c corresponds to the penetration rate which was about 60 mm min on the average the completion of pile penetration took about 39 min inclination data showed that the pile was about 4 tilted in the x direction during penetration by its own weight however as penetration by suction pressure progressed the tilting of the pile decreased steadily this phenomenon showed that the tilting of the pile could be compensated for to some extent by the hoisting force of the crane and the control of suction pressure although the pile was tilted by uneven grounds the tilting of the pile after the completion of penetration was about 1 6 which satisfied the allowable rotation of 7 5 for the usual suction piles lee et al 2005 chioktouridi 2016 the results of this field test verified the field applicability of the gfrp pile in the installation of the suction pile if the suction pressure exceeds the maximum value the ground inside the pile would become unstable when suction pressure is applied to saturated sand water flow occurs inward from the outside of the suction pile therefore if excessive suction pressure is applied to the sandy ground boiling may occur due to the upward seepage of water in the ground within the suction pile bang et al 2000 tran et al 2007 the boiling stability of sandy soil inside the suction pile can be evaluated using eq 3 in this equation the amount of soil heaving δ corresponds to the amount of soil that moves inward during pile penetration eq 4 can be applied to calculate soil heaving and input parameter α d refers to the ratio of the amount of soil that moves inward to the total amount of soil that moves during the penetration α d is generally 1 0 for sandy soil and 0 5 for clay soil maximum suction pressure p sc can be evaluated with eq 5 which is modified from eq 3 pari 2003 3 f γ d δ γ w h a γ d δ p s p t 4 δ α d a t a s d 5 p sc 1 f d δ γ 1 1 p t p s where f is the factor of safety f 1 0 γ is the effective

obtained from model and field tests consequently eq 4 could not properly capture the effect of the dilatant characteristics on the soil heaving inside the suction pile however eq 4 might be used to provide reference values for calculating the suction pressure for the preliminary design fig 8 shows the ratio of toe suction pressure toe suction pressure suction pressure according to the d b ratio d penetration depth b pile diameter pari 2003 table 4 shows the results of the maximum suction pressure calculated for the gfrp pile in the study the ratio of toe suction pressure in fig 8 was applied and safety factor f 1 0 was used due to the situation that the suction pile is penetrated by suction pressure fig 9 shows a comparison of the maximum and measured suction pressure values in the field test the upper part of the test site in this study was sandy soil thus the value of α d 1 was applied to calculate the upper limit of suction pressure the measured suction pressure increased slightly during initial penetration and increased gradually at more than 1 0 m depth the suction pressure applied in the test corresponded to about 73 89 of the maximum suction pressure at a penetration depth of 1 0 2 0 m 5 bearing capacity of gfrp pile in sandy soils to ensure applicability in practical circumstances the stability of the gfrp suction pile was examined via numerical analysis commercial abaqus software was used to model the pile foundation soil system under purely vertical horizontal and moment loadings fig 10 a shows the geometry of the gfrp suction pile which is composed of a concrete cap connected by a gfrp suction pile modeling was conducted by using the first order eight node linear brick and reduced integration continuum element c3d8r as shown in fig 10 b only half of the entire system was modeled due to the symmetric condition as shown in fig 10 b the results obtained from the numerical analyses were doubled to obtain the bearing capacities for the entire foundation the vertical and horizontal displacements at the bottom boundary and the horizontal displacements at the lateral boundaries were constrained preliminary analyses were performed to obtain the optimum finite element mesh sizes and boundary extensions of the soil foundation domains to minimize their effects on the results in fig 10 b b h and b v denote the vertical and horizontal boundary extents from the center of the gfrp suction pile foundation and the ground surface respectively in this study the finite element boundaries were extended at b h 3 5 d and b v 2 5 d the loading condition was simulated by means of a reference point rp the rp was placed at the bottom center of the concrete cap loading was applied using a displacement controlled method in which the vertical u horizontal h and rotation θ displacements at the rp were increased gradually until failure as shown in fig 10 b the interface friction angle between the foundation and soil was set to 2φ 3 where φ is the internal friction angle of sand the interface was modeled with coulomb friction and hard contact models which are available in the abaqus program the compressive loading behavior of suction piles is mainly governed by the shaft resistance of the skirt and the toe resistance by the inside soil so the pile toe modeling technique might have a negligible effect on the compression capacity therefore the soil pile interaction at the suction pile toe was modeled similar to that of the skirt a fully drained condition was assumed in consideration of conservative designs because the sandy soil has a high permeability coefficient and the development of excess suction pore pressure might result in an additional resistance an elastic perfectly plastic model was used to represent the loading behavior of either the concrete cap or the gfrp suction pile this model means that the modeled material would behave elastically within a relatively small strain range and show a perfectly plastic behavior after yielding the common properties of the concrete cap are presented in table 5 the hashin model a damage model for fibre reinforced composites was selected to simulate the gfrp composite material simulia 2010 table 6 presents the input parameters for the hashin model obtained from both standards and the manufacturers a non associative mohr coulomb elastoplastic model was applied to simulate the behavior of the ground the ground was modeled as medium dense and dense sand table 7 presents the soil properties determined from eau recommendations eau 2004 the variation in young s modulus e s of the sand according to depth is expressed by the following equation achmus et al 2009 6 e s λ p a σ m p a j where p a is atmospheric pressure p a 100 kpa λ is the janbu modulus number j is the stress index and σ m is the mean principle stress tables 8 a and 8b summarize the numerical analysis results of mobilized stresses in different loading directions the deformation and induced stresses of the gfrp suction pile at the yielding state can be virtually seen in fig 11 the stresses mobilized in the gfrp were much smaller than the corresponding material strengths from a practical point of view offshore foundations are subject to a relatively small vertical load compared with horizontal and moment loads therefore the stresses induced by vertical loading cannot be large as that shown in the tables it can be concluded that the structural stability of gfrp suction piles is maintained under practical loading conditions figs 12 a b and c present the load displacement curves of the gfrp suction pile under purely horizontal moment and vertical loadings respectively the bearing capacities of the foundation were determined by using the tangent method in which the capacities were the intersection points of two tangent lines of the former and latter parts of full load displacement curves mansur and kaufman 1956 villalobos 2006 tran et al 2017 as shown in figs 12 a and b the bearing capacities obtained by using the tangent method might contain operator dependent errors hung and kim 2014 stated that the variation of bearing capacities determined through the tangent method might range from 2 to 5 in addition if the load displacement curves have a low inclination then the tangent method might produce a conservative value of the bearing capacity the horizontal bearing capacities ho were about 170 and 234 kn for medium dense and dense sand respectively the moment bearing capacities mo were about 352 and 473 kn m for medium dense and dense sand respectively the horizontal and moment bearing capacities increased by about 1 4 times with increasing ground density the load displacement curves of the gfrp suction pile foundation under purely vertical loading did not converge as the frictional and pile toe resistance increased according to the increase in confining pressure on the basis of the design concept used in this study the padeye where the anchor might be attached to was placed in the pile cap however the optimum loading point was found at approximately two thirds of the embedment depth i e 0 7 d where d is the embedment depth as shown in fig 13 the pure horizontal bearing capacity of the loading at the pile cap might be approximately three times smaller than that at the optimum loading point due to the pile rotation consequently the effect of the loading point on the bearing capacities should be considered in the practical design 6 conclusion suction piles were fabricated with gfrp which is a new composite material the following conclusions were obtained from laboratory loading tests on material strength field tests on suction installation and numerical simulations analyzing the applicability of the gfrp suction pile 1 the material tensile strengths of gfrp were 200 mpa in the longitudinal direction and 230 mpa in the circumferential direction the uniaxial compressive strength and bending flexural strength of gfrp were 100 mpa and 42 kn m respectively 2 the structural stability of the gfrp suction pile under suction pressure was investigated by performing a finite element analysis the mobilized stresses in the gfrp under suction pressure were much smaller than the material strength of gfrp therefore the gfrp was considered stable with respect to the suction pressure generated in pile penetration 3 a field test was performed to verify the applicability of the gfrp suction pile penetration by self weight was about 0 5 m which is sufficient to maintain the suction condition in the pile the final penetration by suction pressure was approximately 2 2 m which was about 96 of the possible penetration length the tilting of the pile after the completion of penetration was about 1 6 which satisfies the allowable rotation of 7 5 for usual suction piles the suction pressure applied in the test corresponded to about 73 89 of the maximum suction pressure at a penetration depth of 1 0 2 0 m the field test results for the final penetration depth tilting and applied suction pressure showed that the gfrp suction pile can be successfully applied in the field 4 the structural stability of the gfrp suction pile under various loading conditions was analyzed via 3d finite element analyses the mobilized stresses during horizontal and moment loadings were much smaller than the material strengths 5 gfrp suction piles can experience extreme loads induced by winds earthquakes waves and ship impacts which are generally in the form of cyclic loading thus continuous research on the bearing behavior and durability of gfrp suction piles under actual loading conditions such as combined or cyclic loads is encouraged acknowledgements this research was supported by a grant

22993,suction piles fabricated with glass fiber reinforced plastic gfrp have been regarded as alternatives to conventional steel or reinforced concrete suction piles to reduce the transportation cost and corrosion risk however difficulty may arise in suction installation due to the small weight of the gfrp pile in this study a concrete pile cap was attached to the top of the gfrp pile to add weight provide additional resistance against lateral loading by increasing the contact area with soil and thus solve the problem the field applicability of the gfrp suction pile was verified by performing field tests on suction installation and numerical simulations to analyze structural integrity against design loads results obtained from numerical analyses showed that the gfrp suction pile was stable during penetration and under various loading conditions suggestions for the design of gfrp suction piles were proposed based on the field test results and in consideration of the suction pressure inside the pile keywords gfrp suction pile field test numerical analysis bearing capacity structural integrity 1 introduction many offshore structures have been constructed for offshore space utilization offshore wind turbines and marine resource development in korea a suction pile is a circular surface foundation with thin skirts around its circumference suction piles can be installed economically and efficiently into soil deposits in deep water and have been used extensively in offshore facilities the length to diameter ratio l d of these piles does not exceed 6 0 randolph et al 2005 the skirt of a suction pile penetrates the ground by pumping water out of the pile which creates suction pressure inside it the penetration force for pile installation is proportional to the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the pile and the section area of the pile meanwhile the penetration resistance is proportional to the pile diameter therefore as the pile diameter increases the pile can be easily penetrated with suction pressure inside the pile according to a case study the diameter of suction piles ranges from 3 5 to 44 m pile length ranges from 4 to 36 m and water depth is from 30 to 1830 m suction piles are installed in various soil conditions including soft clay and sand however the material of the suction piles is restricted only to steel or reinforced concrete andersen et al 2005 using steel or reinforced concrete for the production of suction piles requires securing a wide area for manufacturing transportation and installation cost significantly increase as the pile diameter increases due to the heavy weight of the materials in addition steel may suffer from corrosion problems caused by long term exposure to seawater and bacteria tomlinson and woodward 2014 so it may not be suitable for repeated use which is one of the important advantages of suction piles in this study a suction pile was fabricated using a glass fiber reinforced plastic gfrp pipe which is a new composite material to solve the disadvantages of conventional steel or reinforced concrete suction piles gfrp possesses better durability against seawater compared with steel or concrete smaller weight with a specific gravity of about one third of that of steel and higher compressive and tensile strength than concrete several researchers have applied gfrp to manufacture composite piles or reinforce steel or concrete piles reddy et al 2009 conducted a finite element analysis of reinforced concrete piles retrofitted using gfrp composites the ultimate axial loading capacity increased to 40 and the lateral bearing capacity increased from 30 to 70 depending on the existing axial load karimi et al 2011a 2011b reported that wrapping a steel column with gfrp and carbon frp laminate sheets significantly improved compressive strength elastic axial stiffness and ultimate displacement giraldo and rayhani 2014 carried out several static laboratory tests on small scale gfrp and hollow steel piles in soft clay to examine frictional performance the axial compressive capacity of the gfrp pile was 40 higher than that of the hollow steel pile however the deflection of the gfrp pile head was larger than that of the hollow steel pile under lateral loading vijay et al 2016 investigated the application of the gfrp shell and wrap system for corroded steel piles by conducting several laboratory tests and implementing them in a rehabilitation program the bearing capacity of the deteriorated steel piles increased significantly and the rehabilitation cost was reduced by up to 10 15 of the traditional replacement cost however no research has been performed on manufacturing suction piles with gfrp materials in the current study several improvements for manufacturing gfrp suction piles were suggested to solve the difficulty in suction installation caused by the small weight of the gfrp pile a concrete pile cap was attached to the top of the gfrp pile to add weight and provide additional resistance against lateral loading the field applicability of the gfrp suction pile was verified by performing field tests on suction installation and numerical simulations to analyze the structural integrity against design loads field experiments were conducted in the southern coast of korea the penetration depth by self weight penetration velocity final penetration depth and installation slope of the gfrp suction pile were measured during repeated penetration and pulling out of the pile numerical analysis was carried out by performing 3d finite element analysis to examine the structural integrity of gfrp materials and the bearing capacity and structural stability of the gfrp pile under various loading conditions such as vertical horizontal and moment loads 2 gfrp suction pile 2 1 introduction the gfrp suction pile used in this study was composed of a pile body made of a gfrp pipe and a pile cap made of concrete as shown in fig 1 a suction pile body made of a gfrp pipe presents better durability against seawater corrosion than steel pipes however gfrp is vulnerable to impact and shear loads hence the pile should be carefully installed conventional suction piles without pile caps have difficulty in penetrating the entire length of the suction pile due to ground heaving inside the pile as shown in fig 1 thus accurate prediction of the final penetration depth is difficult erbrich and tjelta 1999 therefore the use of the concrete pile cap can improve penetration by adding weight and increase lateral resistance by increasing the contact area with soils the gfrp pile in this study was inserted into the concrete pile cap to ensure that the entire length of the suction pile can penetrate the ground due to the thickness of the concrete cap in addition a pad eye for the connection with the mooring line was attached to the side of the concrete cap a steel shoe was attached to the toe of gfrp to prevent damage on gfrp and reduce penetration resistance the gfrp material used in this study consisted of three layers created via continuous filament winding a core layer made of a polymer mortar was inserted between the inner and outer gfrp structure layers as shown in fig 2 the gfrp was created by using glass fiber roving and structural resin and the inner and outer gfrp structure layers strengthen the circumferential strength the gfrp has a young s modulus of about 25 gpa and a tensile strength of about 200 20 mpa the polymer mortar core layer has a young s modulus of about 11 gpa and a high compressive strength of about 100 10 mpa due to the constraining effect of the inside and outside gfrp layers lee et al 2007 the polymer mortar layer reduces the unit cost of gfrp because the material s cost is lower than that of gfrp in addition gfrp can be mass produced in a factory and easily connected at the site the average unit weight of gfrp is generally in the range of 17 6 22 5 kn m3 depending on the manufacturing method and required strength gfrp is lighter than steel or concrete piles and allows for easy handling in the field sea transportation is also possible using buoyancy 2 2 strength characteristics of gfrp the structural strength of gfrp was investigated by performing loading tests before manufacturing a suction pile for field tests the gfrp used in the tests was produced for water and sewage treatment in korea fiber company the gfrp has an inner diameter of 200 mm and a thickness of 9 mm the loading tests included tensile compressive and bending strength tests the tensile strength test was performed in longitudinal and circumferential directions the tensile strength test in the longitudinal direction was performed by applying astm d638 03 2003 and that in the circumferential direction was performed by applying astm d2290 16 2016 test specimens for circumferential tensile loading were prepared by cutting a gfrp into a pipe with 30 mm width and forming a groove of 5 mm in the upper and lower portions the measured tensile strength was about 200 mpa in the longitudinal direction and about 230 mpa in the circumferential direction the uniaxial compressive test was performed on gfrp with a diameter of 200 mm and a length of 400 mm the uniaxial compressive strength of gfrp was about 100 mpa the compressive strength of gfrp was larger than the compressive strength of concrete about 35 mpa and smaller than that of steel about 400 mpa the bending flexural test was performed on gfrp with a diameter of 200 mm and a length of 1200 mm the test was carried out via the four point loading method and the distance between the loading points was 400 mm the bending flexural strength of the gfrp was about 42 kn m the strength test results of the gfrp are summarized in table 1 3 structural stability of gfrp under suction pressure the structural stability against suction pressure needs to be examined numerical analyses were performed with a conventional finite element analysis program abaqus simulia 2010 the suction pile was modeled without the modeling of soils and the structural stability of the pile was analyzed after applying suction pressure to the pile the gfrp for the analyses has 1 8 m diameter 3 0 m length and 36 mm thickness which comprises the dimension of the gfrp pile for the field test table 2 shows the input properties used in the analysis these values were obtained from the strength loading test in this numerical modeling of gfrp under suction the coupled elements between the degree of freedom of displacement and pore water pressure were used to simulate the suction pressure inside the pile a 2d axisymmetric condition was applied to simulate the 3d shape of the pile the gfrp and internal elements subjected to suction pressure were modeled using the shell and solid elements respectively the internal solid element has large permeability and negligible stiffness therefore the same magnitude of the suction pressure will be applied on the inside of the pile regardless of the presence of the solid element the displacement and rotation at the pile tip were fixed the pore water pressure was controlled through consolidation analysis and reduced to 100 kpa which is the maximum possible suction pressure inside the pile table 3 summarizes the analysis results the maximum compressive and tensile stresses in the longitudinal direction were 2 74 and 2 91 mpa respectively the maximum compressive and tensile stresses in the circumferential direction were 2 78 and 1 93 mpa respectively the mobilized stresses in the gfrp under suction pressure were much smaller than the material strength of gfrp therefore the gfrp is considered stable with respect to the suction pressure generated in the pile penetration since the gfrp suction pile is a thin skirt structure the structural integrity of suction piles during installation is generally governed by buckling of the skirts under the required suction pressure suction foundation buckling can be examined by using analytical and numerical methods according to dnvgl rp c202 dnv 2017 for analyzing the buckling strength of shells the elastic buckling strength σ e can be given as follows 1 σ e c π 2 e 12 1 ν 2 t l 2 c ψ 1 ρ ξ ψ 2 where c is the reduced buckling coefficient ν is the poisson s ratio of the material of the suction pile e is the young s modulus of the suction pile t is the thickness of the suction pile l is the unsupported length of the suction pile during installation ρ is a factor accounting for imperfection knockdown factor ξ and ψ are coefficients by considering hydrostatic loading applied to suction piles during installation the coefficients are determined as follows ρ 0 6 ψ 2 and ξ 1 04 z where z is bardorf s parameter or the curvature parameter z l 2 r t 1 ν 2 and r represents the radius of the suction pile subsequently the elastic buckling strength of the suction pile under hydrostatic loading is approximately 2811 mpa in consideration of a lower bound value with no soil support buckling analyses based on the numerical simulation of this study showed a similar buckling stress of approximately 2700 mpa if the suction pressure was increased up to the gfrp strength of 100 mpa the mobilized stresses during installation were considerably smaller than the elastic buckling strength in addition when the suction pile penetrates the ground the buckling capacity would increase with the increase in the confining pressure of the surrounding soil lee and tran 2013 therefore the suction pile used in this study is safe against buckling during installation 4 field penetration tests 4 1 gfrp for field tests in this study a prototype gfrp suction pile was manufactured and installed offshore to evaluate the field applicability of the pile the dimension of the gfrp piles for the field test was 1 8 m inner diameter 3 0 m length and 36 mm thickness as shown in fig 3 the top cover plate of the gfrp pile was made with a dome shape to distribute the stress generated at the connection part between the main body and top plate when the suction pressure was applied the suction pile must be initially penetrated into the ground by its own weight to some extent to maintain the suction pressure however due to the small weight of the gfrp which is about a third of the weight of steel increasing its own weight for initial penetration is necessary therefore the weight of the gfrp pile was increased by connecting the concrete cap to the upper part of the pile generally the wall thickness of a steel suction pile is 0 6 of the pile diameter tran et al 2007 according to this criterion the thickness of the steel suction pile corresponding to the pile diameter of the gfrp pile 1 8 m is about 10 8 mm therefore the weight difference between the gfrp pile and the steel pile with the same diameter was calculated and the weight of the concrete cap was made equal to the weight difference the concrete cap in fig 3 b has an inner diameter of 1 9 m an outer diameter of 2 5 m and a thickness of 0 7 m the concrete cap and gfrp pile were connected by wiring the lifting lugs on each of them two venturi pipes for suction pressure application and an inclinometer for inclination measurement were installed on the upper part of the gfrp pile suction pressure was measured with two water pressure gauges installed inside and outside the pile at the skirt toe of the gfrp pile a wedge shaped shoe made of steel was attached to reduce penetration resistance and increase the buckling resistance of the wall figs 4 and 5 show the process of reinforcing the steel shoe at the toe and the gfrp suction pile being transported on a barge respectively 4 2 test site and site condition field tests were conducted on the southwestern sea of korea the average water depth of this area is 13 5 m and the tidal difference ranges from 2 5 to 5 4 m an offshore wind farm is expected to be built in the area and eight spt tests have been conducted fig 6 shows the boring logs and spt test results the upper soil was a medium or dense sand layer with an spt n value of about 20 30 to 40 30 as shown in fig 6 b soil properties were determined as internal friction angle of 27 cohesion 0 and submerged unit weight 20 0 kn m3 by referring to the boring logs literature kgs 2009 and the suction foundation technical manual pari 2003 4 3 test procedure first the gfrp pile was placed on the sea floor by using a crane second the pile was penetrated by its own weight and then by applying suction

and the thickness of the concrete cap was 0 7 m the maximum effective depth for the penetration was 2 3 m therefore the gfrp pile penetrated up to about 96 of the effective depth in this test the curve slope in fig 7 c corresponds to the penetration rate which was about 60 mm min on the average the completion of pile penetration took about 39 min inclination data showed that the pile was about 4 tilted in the x direction during penetration by its own weight however as penetration by suction pressure progressed the tilting of the pile decreased steadily this phenomenon showed that the tilting of the pile could be compensated for to some extent by the hoisting force of the crane and the control of suction pressure although the pile was tilted by uneven grounds the tilting of the

verified the field applicability of the gfrp pile in the installation of the suction pile if the suction pressure exceeds the maximum value the ground inside the pile would become unstable when suction pressure is applied to saturated sand water flow occurs inward from the outside of the suction pile therefore if excessive suction pressure is applied to the sandy ground boiling may occur due to the upward seepage of water in the ground within the suction pile bang et al 2000 tran et al 2007 the boiling stability of sandy soil inside the suction pile can be evaluated using eq 3 in this equation the amount of soil heaving δ corresponds to the amount of soil that moves inward during pile penetration eq 4 can be applied to calculate soil heaving and input parameter α d refers to the ratio of the amount of soil that moves inward to the total amount of soil that moves during the penetration α d is generally 1 0 for sandy soil and 0 5 for clay soil maximum suction pressure p sc can be evaluated with eq 5 which is modified from eq 3 pari 2003 3 f γ d δ γ w h a γ d δ p s p t 4 δ α d a t a s d 5 p sc 1 f d δ γ 1 1 p t p s where f is the factor of safety f 1 0 γ is the effective

obtained from model and field tests consequently eq 4 could not properly capture the effect of the dilatant characteristics on the soil heaving inside the suction pile however eq 4 might be used to provide reference values for calculating the suction pressure for the preliminary design fig 8 shows the ratio of toe suction pressure toe suction pressure suction pressure according to the d b ratio d penetration depth b pile diameter pari 2003 table 4 shows the results of the maximum suction pressure calculated for the gfrp pile in the study the ratio of toe suction pressure in fig 8 was applied and safety factor f 1 0 was used due to the situation that the suction pile is penetrated by suction pressure fig 9 shows a comparison of the maximum and measured suction pressure values in the field test the upper part of the test site in this study was sandy soil thus the value of α d 1 was applied to calculate the upper limit of suction pressure the measured suction pressure increased slightly during initial penetration and increased gradually at more than 1 0 m depth the suction pressure applied in the test corresponded to about 73 89 of the maximum suction pressure at a penetration depth of 1 0 2 0 m 5 bearing capacity of gfrp pile in sandy soils to ensure applicability in practical circumstances the stability of the gfrp suction pile was examined via numerical analysis commercial abaqus software was used to model the pile foundation soil system under purely vertical horizontal and moment loadings fig 10 a shows the geometry of the gfrp suction pile which is composed of a concrete cap connected by a gfrp suction pile modeling was conducted by using the first order eight node linear brick and reduced integration continuum element c3d8r as shown in fig 10 b only half of the entire system was modeled due to the symmetric condition as shown in fig 10 b the results obtained from the numerical analyses were doubled to obtain the bearing capacities for the entire foundation the vertical and horizontal displacements at the bottom boundary and the horizontal displacements at the lateral boundaries were constrained preliminary analyses were performed to obtain the optimum finite element mesh sizes and boundary extensions of the soil foundation domains to minimize their effects on the results in fig 10 b b h and b v denote the vertical and horizontal boundary extents from the center of the gfrp suction pile foundation and the ground surface respectively in this study the finite element boundaries were extended at b h 3 5 d and b v 2 5 d the loading condition was simulated by means of a reference point rp the rp was placed at the bottom center of the concrete cap loading was applied using a displacement controlled method in which the vertical u horizontal h and rotation θ displacements at the rp were increased gradually until failure as shown in fig 10 b the interface friction angle between the foundation and soil was set to 2φ 3 where φ is the internal friction angle of sand the interface was modeled with coulomb friction and hard contact models which are available in the abaqus program the compressive loading behavior of suction piles is mainly governed by the shaft resistance of the skirt and the toe resistance by the inside soil so the pile toe modeling technique might have a negligible effect on the compression capacity therefore the soil pile interaction at the suction pile toe was modeled similar to that of the skirt a fully drained condition was assumed in consideration of conservative designs because the sandy soil has a high permeability coefficient and the development of excess suction pore pressure might result in an additional resistance an elastic perfectly plastic model was used to represent the loading behavior of either the concrete cap or the gfrp suction pile this model means that the modeled material would behave elastically within a relatively small strain range and show a perfectly plastic behavior after yielding the common properties of the concrete cap are presented in table 5 the hashin model a damage model for fibre reinforced composites was selected to simulate the gfrp composite material simulia 2010 table 6 presents the input parameters for the hashin model obtained from both standards and the manufacturers a non associative mohr coulomb elastoplastic model was applied to simulate the behavior of the ground the ground was modeled as medium dense and dense sand table 7 presents the soil properties determined from eau recommendations eau 2004 the variation in young s modulus e s of the sand according to depth is expressed by the following equation achmus et al 2009 6 e s λ p a σ m p a j where p a is atmospheric pressure p a 100 kpa λ is the janbu modulus number j is the stress index and σ m is the mean principle stress tables 8 a and 8b summarize the numerical analysis results of mobilized stresses in different loading directions the deformation and induced stresses of the gfrp suction pile at the yielding state can be virtually seen in fig 11 the stresses mobilized in the gfrp were much smaller than the corresponding material strengths from a practical point of view offshore foundations are subject to a relatively small vertical load compared with horizontal and moment loads therefore the stresses induced by vertical loading cannot be large as that shown in the tables it can be concluded that the structural stability of gfrp suction piles is maintained under practical loading conditions figs 12 a b and c present the load displacement curves of the gfrp suction pile under purely horizontal moment and vertical loadings respectively the bearing capacities of the foundation were determined by using the tangent method in which the capacities were the intersection points of two tangent lines of the former and latter parts of full load displacement curves mansur and kaufman 1956 villalobos 2006 tran et al 2017 as shown in figs 12 a and b the bearing capacities obtained by using the tangent method might contain operator dependent errors hung and kim 2014 stated that the variation of bearing capacities determined through the tangent method might range from 2 to 5 in addition if the load displacement curves have a low inclination then the tangent method might produce a conservative value of the bearing capacity the horizontal bearing capacities ho were about 170 and 234 kn for medium dense and dense sand respectively the moment bearing capacities mo were about 352 and 473 kn m for medium dense and dense sand respectively the horizontal and moment bearing capacities increased by about 1 4 times with increasing ground density the load displacement curves of the gfrp suction pile foundation under purely vertical loading did not converge as the frictional and pile toe resistance increased according to the increase in confining pressure on the basis of the design concept used in this study the padeye where the anchor might be attached to was placed in the pile cap however the optimum loading point was found at approximately two thirds of the embedment depth i e 0 7 d where d is the embedment depth as shown in fig 13 the pure horizontal bearing capacity of the loading at the pile cap might be approximately three times smaller than that at the optimum loading point due to the pile rotation consequently the effect of the loading point on the bearing capacities should be considered in the practical design 6 conclusion suction piles were fabricated with gfrp which is a new composite material the following conclusions were obtained from laboratory loading tests on material strength field tests on suction installation and numerical simulations analyzing the applicability of the gfrp suction pile 1 the material tensile strengths of gfrp were 200 mpa in the longitudinal direction and 230 mpa in the circumferential direction the uniaxial compressive strength and bending flexural strength of gfrp were 100 mpa and 42 kn m respectively 2 the structural stability of the gfrp suction pile under suction pressure was investigated by performing a finite element analysis the mobilized stresses in the gfrp under suction pressure were much smaller than the material strength of gfrp therefore the gfrp was considered stable with respect to the suction pressure generated in pile penetration 3 a field test was performed to verify the applicability of the gfrp suction pile penetration by self weight was about 0 5 m which is sufficient to maintain the suction condition in the pile the final penetration by suction pressure was approximately 2 2 m which was about 96 of the possible penetration length the tilting of the pile after the completion of penetration was about 1 6 which satisfies the allowable rotation of 7 5 for usual suction piles the suction pressure applied in the test corresponded to about 73 89 of the maximum suction pressure at a penetration depth of 1 0 2 0 m the field test results for the final penetration depth tilting and applied suction pressure showed that the gfrp suction pile can be successfully applied in the field 4 the structural stability of the gfrp suction pile under various loading conditions was analyzed via 3d finite element analyses the mobilized stresses during horizontal and moment loadings were much smaller than the material strengths 5 gfrp suction piles can experience extreme loads induced by winds earthquakes waves and ship impacts which are generally in the form of cyclic loading thus continuous research on the bearing behavior and durability of gfrp suction piles under actual loading conditions such as combined or cyclic loads is encouraged acknowledgements this research was supported by a grant

22994,seawater piston pump is a key power component for underwater equipment low pressure pulsation and vibration have become the key requirements of high quality seawater piston pump in the interest of improving the stability reliability and stealth of underwater equipment a new type crankshaft seawater piston pump was studied in this paper the kinematics of the pistons was analyzed and a simulation model was established the simulation results indicated that its pressure pulsation rate was as high as 17 fortunately after integrating accumulators and optimizing the precharge pressures the pressure pulsation rate can be reduced below 5 in the working range the pump possessed better performance when the accumulators were precharged with optimized multiple pressures than with a single pressure in addition experimental analysis was conducted through measuring the pressure pulsation and vibration acceleration under different conditions the experiment results of the pressure pulsation well agreed with the simulation results besides the vibration acceleration of the seawater piston pump was obviously reduced in wide working range when the accumulators were precharged with the optimized combination multiple parameters in conclusion integrating accumulators into pump and optimizing the precharge parameters can reduce the pressure pulsation and vibration acceleration in the working range keywords seawater pump pressure pulsation vibration accumulator 1 introduction water hydraulics which utilizes natural water as working medium instead of traditional mineral oil possesses several important advantages in comparison with traditional oil hydraulics such as little environment pollution nonflammable and lower operating cost koskinen and aaltonen 2014 lim et al 2003 wang and gao 2013 especially in underwater environment water hydraulics is very flexible to establish open circuit type system using the surrounding water as working medium directly and discharging drainage to the open surroundings without needing return hose and reservoir wu et al 2017 these advantages invoke engineers great interests in applying water hydraulics system to underwater equipment and it has been widely utilized in variable ballast system vbs bilge drainage system high pressure water mist fire suppression system high pressure waterjet propulsion system etc liu et al 2014 2017 huawei et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b 2018b 2018c with the missions of underwater equipment becoming increasingly complex and varied such as military applications inspection of underwater structures exploration of unknown environments oceanographic observations submarine rescue underwater animal behavior research and so on zhao et al 2016 the underwater equipment possessing better stability higher reliability lower vibration and noise radiation are strongly required seawater hydraulic piston pump is a core power component in water hydraulics system its performance would directly influence on the whole properties of the water hydraulics system and even on the overall underwater equipment flow pulsation is an inherent characteristic of piston pumps resulting from the discrete annular distribution and periodic motion of pistons moreover the flow pulsation would cause pressure pulsation after interacting with the downstream load components and the pressure pulsation would further result in a series of undesirable issues such as fluid induced vibration aggravating mechanical vibration noise radiation cavitation and so on bae et al 2014 li et al 2017 sung et al 2018 the accompanying vibration is one of the main reasons causing looseness and mechanical fatigue failures that would directly damage to the personal safety and the equipment performances in general seawater piston pump is the main excitation source of vibration and noise of underwater equipment which would worsen the invisibility stability and reliability xu et al 2016 therefore it is very important to reduce the pressure pulsation vibration and noise of seawater piston pump for improving the overall performance of water hydraulics system and underwater equipment among the methods of reducing the pressure pulsation vibration and noise of hydraulic systems optimizing the existing structure and installing auxiliary attenuators are the two most reliable solutions a multidisciplinary design optimization mdo procedure based on co simulation and integrated optimization has been proposed by liu et al 2016 in order to determine the parameters related to the fluid distribution process of piston pump including the piston chamber wrap angle the inlet port and outlet port area the silencing groove wrap angle and the silencing groove opening degree through the integration and optimization based on the data exchange between amesim and adams software and the sequential quadratic programming the flow ripple rates under six working conditions are reduced and the pressure distribution is more uniform the mdo procedure is an effective and feasible method for piston pump design besides optimizing the valve plate transition region including relief grooves and timing is always the research hotspot in reducing the pressure pulsation vibration and noise of piston pump xu et al 2016 kim et al 2004 found that using an appropriate pre compression angle and notch design could reduce the pump vibration and noise through analyzing the effects of pre compression angle and v notch on pressure variation of axial piston pump by comparing three types of valve plates it is further considered that v type notch valve plate is better than circular type notch in the characteristic of pressure and flow pulsation through the simulation analysis by using simulation x softerware bae et al 2014 about the influence of the closed angle between valve port and chamber on the pulsation characteristic of piston pump zhang et al 2017 found that the working characteristics are better with a compression angle of 3 and an expansion angle of 2 through fluid simulation and theoretical analysis innovatively xu et al 2013 presented a new distribution method to reduce the flow ripple torque pulsation and noise emission by using a pressure equalization mechanism composed of check valve and pressure recuperation chamber matching the parameter of rotation speed and swashplate angle is another optimization thought in reducing pulsation huang et al 2015 suggested that the combination of lower rotation speed and higher swashplate angle is reasonable for the variable displacement and variable speed control pump in considering the pressure pulsation characteristics installing pulsation attenuators is another important method on suppressing flow pulsation vibration and noise by smoothing the delivery flow variations at pump outlet wang and wang 2017 gao et al 2013 passive attenuators are the mostly widely used devices to achieve the fluid pulsation suppression in hydraulics system zhang et al 2018a the common facilities include accumulator branched resonator of λ 4 length λ is wavelength helmholtz resonator and multi cavity resonator etc a kind of compact pulsation attenuator in forms of bladder accumulator with good compactness and versatility was proposed to suppress fluid pulsation by chai et al 2016 gao et al 2013 developed a novel pulsation attenuator based on spring accumulator for pressure controlled aircraft pump and investigated the components parameters this novel pulsation attenuator has the characteristic of compact structure and good self adjusting ability which can be conveniently embedded into the pump and adjust itself to adapt to the changes of pump operation parameters within a certain range and the pressure fluctuation can be reduced with up to 80 flow through damper promises a faster response time and thus a wider broadband frequency which is benefit of solving the limitation of branched resonators in frequency response and its operating behavior with regard to the remaining pressure pulsations and vibration levels was investigated by koegler et al 2016 multi element buffer bottle formed by orifices pipes and t offs is an integrated fluid filter network which is usually installed inside the pump for attenuating pressure pulsation and its parameters should be pre designed within the range of its operating condition li et al 2017 inserting a reactive type of silencer in the pump discharge line to change the impedance of the circuit and reflects the pressure oscillations back is also benefit of attenuating the pressure oscillations kim et al 2005 used a parallel line to reduce the hydraulic pipeline pressure ripples strunk 1991 described a cross loop attenuator to attenuate the odd harmonics in the pressure ripple of piston pumps introducing feed back control mechanism to achieve active control is an attractive method on suppressing pulsation within a wide range of working condition guan et al 2014 proposed a novel acfpp active control of fluid pressure pulsation method for the hydraulic piping system by bilateral overflow of piezoelectric direct drive slide valve pddsv and adopted an adaptive optimum control strategy to adjust the control parameters this method can eliminate the sinusoidal component of the pressure pulsation when the pddsv only works at half of the frequency of the pressure pulsation chen et al 2013 contributed an integral sliding mode control strategy to stabilize the pressure of hydrodynamic system with accumulator luo et al 2011 conducted a semi active accumulator to match the requirement of parameters various under different working conditions however the aforementioned methods on suppressing pressure pulsation have some limitations on one hand optimizing the existing structure parameters and installing passive attenuators can only work within a certain range which is difficult to satisfy the requirements for variable working conditions at the same time the passive attenuator is also limited by the construction space and frequency response on the other hand introducing feed back control mechanism takes the risks of complicating the system and raising the operation cost to overcome these shortcomings this paper integrated a group of passive accumulators into a seawater piston pump which works at a low frequency and optimally combined the precharge parameters to reduce the pressure pulsation rate and the vibration acceleration within a wide working range based on the theoretical analysis of the pistons kinematic a whole simulation model of the seawater piston pump was established by use of amesim software and the pressure pulsation characteristics were analyzed respectively under different working conditions then eight accumulators were integrated into the pump and the precharge parameters were designed by use of the optimal combination method to reduce the pressure pulsation rate the simulation results of the seawater piston pump when the accumulators were precharged with different pressures were compared with each other to approve the influence of the combined accumulators on pulsation suppression theoretically finally the pressure pulsation and the vibration acceleration of the seawater piston pump were measured and compared in order to experimentally verify the usefulness of the combined accumulator on suppressing pressure pulsation and vibration acceleration in the range of the whole working conditions 2 pressure pulsation of seawater piston pump the seawater hydraulic piston pump mainly consists of an end cover a pump casing a crankshaft an oriented ring a swash plate 8 connecting rods 8 pistons 8 sets of flat valves a valve body a cylinder block an outlet belt a base plate 8 sets of accumulators etc as shown in fig 1 structurally this piston pump implements the motion conversation from the rotation of crankshaft to the reciprocation of pistons by use of the resultant motion of the crankshaft swashplate and connecting rod the rotation of the crankshaft compels the swashplate to swing conically simultaneous the eight pistons annularly distributed in the cylinder block are driven to undergo periodical reciprocation movements and each piston corresponds to a set of flat valve which opens and closes periodically accompanying with the reciprocation motion of the pistons to suck in low pressure water and delivery high pressure water the special motion conversion mechanism makes the piston pump possess both the advantages of swashplate type pump and bent axis type pump it has only one essential piston cylinder tribology and the lateral force between piston and cylinder is only 1 18 of swashplate type pump zhang et al 2016a 2016b consequently the friction and wear conditions of the piston couples have been significantly improved which is very important for water hydraulics to overcome its poor lubrication unfortunately it aggravates the risk of pressure pulsation and vibration because of the nonuniform motion of pistons according to the structure feature of this piston pump the piston motions are the resultant motions of the crankshaft swash plate and connecting rods the mechanical kinematic of the pistons and connecting rods could be analyzed based on the coordinate transformation theory chao et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a then the local coordinate of the connecting rods within the swashplate could be expressed in cartesian global coordinates as 1 x c i y c i z c i x x r sin θ i r cos θ i cos φ y y r sin θ i z z r sin θ i r cos θ i sin φ where x c i y c i z c i is the global coordinate of the connecting rods θ i 2 π i 8 π 16 i 1 2 8 r represents the distribution circle radius of the connecting rod on the swashplate ϕ is the crankshaft angle and ϕ 25 φ is the swinging angle of the swashplate referring to a fix coordinate plane and sin φ cos ω t sin ϕ cos 2 ϕ sin 2 ϕ cos 2 ω t cos φ cos ϕ cos 2 ϕ sin 2 ϕ cos 2 ω t x x y y z z are the first column elements of the coordinate transformation matric x x sin ϕ sin φ sin ω t y y cos ϕ cos φ sin ϕ sin φ cos ω t z z sin ϕ cos φ sin ω t ω denotes the crankshaft angular velocity then based on the space distance and inflexibility of the connecting rods the displacement of the pistons in the cylinder block can be obtained 2 z a i z c i l 2 x c i x a i 2 y c i y a i 2 where l is the length of the connect rods x a i y a i and z a i are the coordinates of the pistons and x a i r cos θ i y a i r sin θ i according to eq 2 the displacements of the pistons are derived numerically simultaneous the velocities and accelerations of the pistons are also obtained as shown in fig 2 the kinematic motions of the pistons in the cylinder block are different from piston to piston and the phase differences between the pistons are not constant even though the pistons are uniformly distributed in the cylinder block the velocities and accelerations are also different accordingly the difference in motion between the pistons is mainly caused by the motion conversion mechanism from the rotation of crankshaft to the reciprocation of the pistons the swashplate would make a conical movement around the shaft accompanying with the oriented ring swinging up and down when the crankshaft rotates in other word the conical movement of the swashplate is the synthesis of the swashplate s swing motion and the oriented ring s swing motion the projection image of the coordinates of the connecting rod on the global coordinate system is ellipse and they would change periodically with the conical motion of the swashplate as a result the motions of the pistons are different form each other more detailed analysis are discussed by zhang et al 2016a the kinematic performances of the pistons would further influence on the flow and pressure characteristic of the seawater piston pump in order to analyze the flow characteristic of the pump more precisely the dynamic of the flat valves are also considered generally the force exerted on the valve core includes the hydraulic force the steady hydrodynamic force and the spring preload then the force equilibrium equation of the flat valves is gained based on newton s second law 3 m c in m s in 3 x in p atm p v π r in 2 ρ q in 2 a in k i n x 0 x in m c out m s out 3 y out p v p w π r out 2 ρ q out 2 a out k out y 0 y out

water v 0 is the dead volume r piston represents the radius of the pistons in order to analyze the performances of the seawater piston pump its whole simulation model is established by use of amesim r12 0 based on the principle of the seawater piston pump and the mathematic model of the piston kinematics as shown in fig 3 the simulation model includes 8 piston modules and each module includes a piston an inlet valve and an outlet valve subassembly and the delivery piping system is simplified as a lumped compressible volume the rotation speed of the crankshaft is set as 150 r min the motion of piston is modeled with mathematic function according to the kinematic model the delivery pressure is regulated through a throttle valve in the range 0 3 0 mpa at the interval of 0 5 mpa the parameter of suction port is set as atmosphere environment fig 4 shows the simulation results of the flow characteristic of the seawater piston pump without accumulators the flow pulsation is completely determined by the structure parameters of the seawater piston pump and independent with the delivery pressure neglecting the influence of leakage its maximum flow is 420 l min and the minimum flow is 320 l min resulting from the comprehensive effects of the non uniform motions of the pistons the flow pulsation of this seawater piston pump is higher in comparison with traditional piston pump obviously the flow pulsation contains two main frequencies the high frequency which relates to the discontinues distribution of the pistons can be calculated as f h n z 60 the low frequency related to the non uniform motion of the pistons doubles the shaft frequency that is f l 2 n 60 the flow pulsation would further lead to pressure pulsation interacting with the downstream control valves and actuators considering the difficulty on measuring flow pulsation pressure pulsation is usually regarded as the criterion for pulsation characteristic analysis differing from flow pulsation the amplitude of the pressure pulsation would increase with the delivery pressure but the pulsation rate nearly keeps constant and the amplitude of the pressure pulsation rate is double of the flow pulsation rate in theory the pressure pulsation rate is about 17 under the working condition of 0 3 mpa in considering the delivery piping system as shown in fig 5 and the definition of pressure pulsation rate is as following 6 δ p p max p min p max p min 3 the method on suppressing pulsation in order to reduce the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump a group of accumulators are integrated into the seawater piston pump as shown in fig 6 chambers in the outlet belt are utilized and bladders were installed in them to form separated gas chambers and liquid chambers to achieve the function of accumulator the gas chambers are precharged with pressurized nitrogen gas and the liquid chambers intercommunicate with the delivery chamber of the seawater piston pump the pressure and volume of the gas chamber would vary with the system pressure to absorb and supply flow for system to smoothen the flow and pressure pulsation when the system pressure pulsation raises the gas volumes are compressed and the liquid chambers expand to store more water so the working medium is stored in the liquid chamber to suppress the peak pressure conversely when the pressure decreases the gas chambers would expand and compress the liquid chamber to force the working medium back to system for increasing the system minimum pressure consequently the accumulators implement the function of reducing pressure peak and filling pressure valley to suppress pressure pulsation on the basis of the working principle of accumulator the mathematic model of the accumulator is built according to the gas state equation the pressure and volume of nitrogen gas in the accumulator is expressed as following 7 p c v c γ p a v a γ const where p c and v c is the charged pressure and volume of nitrogen gas p a and v a is the instantaneous pressure and volume of gas γ is adiabatic index and γ 1 4 assuming the accumulators always work at the normal state and neglecting the fully discharged state and the fully charged state that is the gas pressure is equal to the system pressure p s p a and the gas volume can be obtained by using the polytrophic law 8 v a v c p c p a 1 γ considering the compressibility of water medium is insignificant in comparison with the nitrogen gas hence the hydraulic pressure derivative is regarded as being equal to the gas pressure derivative therefore the following derivative equation is obtained 9 d p d t γ p v d v d t that is 10 d p ai d t γ p ci v ai q ci where q a i 1 n q ai d v d t the system pressure and the flow rate could be obtained through orifice flow equation the system flow is the sum of the piston delivery flow and the output flow of the accumulators 11 q s q p q a in addition the system flow can be calculated based on the orifice equation 12 q s c d c v a orific 2 p out p atm ρ specially the diving depth of underwater equipment would constantly change according to the mission requirements so the load pressure of the seawater piston pump would instantaneously vary accordingly and its working range is p miñ p max however the parameter of the accumulators can t adjust online accompanying with the working condition and its performance would worsen when the working condition deviates from the setting range therefore it is significant to take measures to make the accumulators maintain efficient on absorbing the pressure pulsation in wide working rang optimizing and combining the precharge pressures of the accumulator group is a good method the parameters of the accumulators should be set firstly in considering the system parameters the total volume of a single accumulator is derived 13 v a δ v 1 2 δ p 2 δ p 1 γ where v a is the total bladder volume δ p is the allowance pressure pulsation coefficient and δ p 0 8 δv is the excess volume over the average value in a pulsation period and it can be derived according to the expression of the instantaneous flow rate as following manring 2000 14 δ v q r 2 0 π z p max cos π z p β z p sin π z p 1 π 0 d β c δ q r where q r is the displacement of the seawater piston pump and q r 2 727 10 3 m 3 r z p is the number of piston and z p 8 c δ is the pulsation coefficient which is related to the piston number and c δ 1 256 10 3 then δ v 3 425 10 6 and v a 0 6 10 3 in order to determine the precharge parameters of the accumulators the 8 accumulators are divided into 4 groups and every 2 accumulators are precharged with the same parameters the 4 working pressure points are respectively set as p w1 p w2 p w3 p w4 and p w1 1 mpa as usual the precharge pressure of 2 accumulators which mainly work at the first working point is set as p c 1 α 1 p w 1 in general the precharge pressure of the next group accumulators can be set as equal to the previous working point pressure however the number of working accumulator would increase with the working pressure increasing that means the absorption performance would be better under higher pressure condition when more accumulators begin working therefore in order to improve the performance under low pressure conditions and balance the overall absorption performance the next prechargé pressure is set as the previous working pressure multiplied by a coefficient no more than 1 that is p c i 1 β i p wi β i 0 8 0 08 i 1 i 1 2 3 for instance the second precharge pressure is p c 2 β 1 p w 1 the working pressure point corresponding to the precharge pressure can be determined as p wj p cj α j according to the empirical principle of accumulator precharge similarly the coefficient is corrected as α j 0 6 0 02 j 1 in considering the influence of the previous accumulators for example the second working pressure point is determined as p w 2 p c 2 α 2 then the parameters of the accumulators are gained and listed in table 1 the simulation model is established by use of amesim r12 0 tool 4 groups of accumulators are integrated into the piston pump and the delivery piping system is simplified as a lumped compressible volume as shown in fig 7 the parameters of the accumulators are set according to table 1 after integrating accumulators into the seawater piston pump and optimally combining the precharge parameters the flow characteristic of the seawater piston pump is very different from the seawater piston pump without accumulators as shown in fig 8 the maximum flow rate is respectively 420 417 393 383 378 378 and 377 l min and the minimum flow rate is respectively 322 322 350 360 365 366 367 and 320 l min at the pressure of 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 mpa the amplitude of the flow pulsation would reduce with the delivery pressure because the compression of the gas chambers of the accumulator and the flow absorption would increase with the delivery pressure at the same time the pressure pulsation is depicted in fig 9 the pressure pulsation still maintains 17 when the working pressure is below 0 6 mpa because the lowest precharge pressure of the accumulators is 0 6 mpa and they don t work under the pressure condition of below 0 6 mpa in addition the higher the delivery pressure is the more the number of the working accumulator is hence the performance of the accumulators on absorbing pressure pulsation would be better with the working pressure increasing when the delivery pressure is 3 mpa the pressure pulsation rate can be tremendously reduced to 3 58 from 15 7 obviously the pressure pulsation is well suppressed in the whole working range except for the low pressure conditions fortunately the impact of pressure pulsation on the system under low pressure conditions is weak and it can be neglected to a certain degree in addition the comparison of the pressure pulsation rate of the seawater piston pump under the conditions that the accumulators are precharged with different single pressures is conducted as shown in fig 10 the pressure pulsation rate of the seawater piston pump integrated with accumulators and precharged with a single pressure is worse than that the accumulators are precharged with the optimized multiple parameters when the integrating accumulators are precharged with a single pressure they only work well within a certain range for example when the accumulators are all precharged with the pressure of 0 6 mpa even though the seawater piston pump has a good performance the durability of the accumulators would be dramatically affected if the pump works under high pressure conditions due to the enormous deformation of the bladder if the accumulators are all precharged with the pressure of 2 0 mpa the accumulators only work above the precharged pressure and the pressure pulsation rate is higher below 2 0 mpa consequently the seawater piston pump has the best comprehensive performance within a wide working range when the accumulators are precharged with the optimized multiple parameters instead of being precharged with a single pressure as listed in table 2 4 the experiment of pressure pulsation on vibration experiments are conducted to research the pressure pulsation and vibration acceleration of the seawater piston pump an experiment system is established as shown in fig 11 the pump works at the speed of 150 r min through the deceleration of a gearbox the reduction ratio is 1 5 the delivery pressure of the seawater piston pump is regulated in the range of 0 3 mpa through a throttle valve the system pressure is measured through pressure transducers and the measurement signals are collected by the data acquisition card lan xi type 3050 b 0606ch brüel kjær and processed through the analysis software pulse labshop 14 1 in order to accomplish the comparative tests and obtain the test results of the pressure pulsation and vibration accelerations of the seawater piston pump without accumulators working the influences of the accumulators integrated into the pump should be eliminated in hence the accumulators are all precharged with 4 mpa which is higher than the maximum working pressure in order to make the accumulators work at the fully charge situation that is equivalent to the condition without accumulators at the same time 8 test points are selected on the seawater piston pump to gain the vibration acceleration signals and the accelerometers type 4514 b 001 brüel kjær are also connected to the data acquisition system and analysis software pulse labshop 14 1 all the date are finally saved as txt type documents and processed through matable software fig 12 shows the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump when the accumulator are all precharged with 4 mpa that is the accumulators all work at the fully charged situation and they have no capability on absorbing pressure pulsation after data processing the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump is respectively as 20 65 20 93 19 12 17 39 16 56 and 15 33 at the conditions of 0 5 mpa 1 0 mpa 1 5 mpa 2 0 mpa 2 5 mpa and 3 0 mpa the experiment results well agree with the simulation results under the same conditions simultaneously the pressure pulsation would decrease with the working pressure increasing because the influence of piping system on pulsation suppression would enhance under high pressure condition after precharging the accumulators with the optimized multiple parameters the results of pressure pulsation are obtained as depicted in fig 13 the pressure pulsation is dramatically reduced in comparison with the seawater piston pump whose accumulators don t work and the pulsation rates are controlled below 3 when the delivery pressure is above 1 0 mpa under the conditions of below 0 5 mpa the pressure pulsation is relatively high and it reaches to 18 because the minimum precharge pressure of the accumulators is 0 6 mpa which is higher than the delivery pressure and the accumulators don t work however the pulsation amplitude and intensity is relatively low so it has little influence on the pump performance the experimental results well agree with the simulation results the comparison of the pressure pulsation rate between simulation and experiment is listed in table 3 the experiment results indicate that the seawater piston pump integrated with accumulators and precharged with the optimized multiple pressures has lower pressure pulsation rate in the whole working range and the seawater piston pump has better comprehensive performance in comparison with being precharged with a single pressure the results verified that it is a good method to suppressing pressure pulsation besides the pressure pulsation rate of the seawater piston pump under the condition that the integrating accumulators are precharged with the same pressures are obtained and compared as shown in fig 14 same as the simulation results when the accumulators are precharged with the same pressures they only work well within a special range for instance when the accumulators are all precharged with the pressure of 0 6 mpa the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump would become worse under the high pressure working conditions if the accumulators are all precharged with the pressure of 2 0 mpa it would have a better performance under the high pressure working conditions but the performance becomes worse under the conditions of below 2 0 mpa in summary the pressure pulsation rate of the seawater piston pump is relatively lower within the whole working conditions when the accumulators are precharged with the optimized multiple pressures the experimental results of the pulsation rates under different conditions are listed in table 4 at the same time the vibration accelerations of the seawater piston pump are also measured and analyzed eight acceleration signals are obtained through the acceleration transducers mounted on the test point under the same conditions and the signals are processed through the analysis software pulse labshop 14 1 achieving the time domain and frequency domain information the total vibration acceleration level is directly acquired through the analysis software and the frequency characteristic of the vibration acceleration is derived through fft analysis program embedded in the software in addition the average of the vibration acceleration levels is given by according to the power average method 15 l 10 log 10 1 8 i 1 8 10 l i 10 where l is the average of the vibration acceleration levels l i is the vibration acceleration at i test point fig 15 shows the common signal processing for acquiring the average vibration acceleration level at the working pressure of 3 0 mpa when the integrated accumulators are precharged with the optimized multiple parameters it indicates that the maximum vibration acceleration level appears near the outlet port test point 5 and the vibration on the outlet belt test point 5 8 is higher than that on the base plate test point 1 4 because the outlet belt is more closer to the vibration exciting source such as the motion mechanism and fluid pulsation and the valve body between the outlet belt and the base plate can isolate a certain vibration in addition the vibration is dominated at the low frequency region 1500 hz which is mainly related to the shaft frequency the flow pulsation the mechanical vibration and the fluid vibration according to the aforementioned method eight acceleration signals are measured by the acceleration transducers attached on the test points under the same condition and the average vibration acceleration level is counted on the basis of the power average method the average vibration acceleration levels are respectively obtained at the working pressure of 0 5 mpa 1 0 mpa 1 5 mpa 2 0 mpa 2 5 mpa and 3 0 mpa under the conditions that the integrated accumulators don t work as shown in fig 16 the maximum vibration acceleration level appears at the working pressure of 3 0 mpa and the vibration acceleration level would increase with the increase of working pressure they are 0 52 db 0 19 db 0 54 db 1 85 db 3 33 db and 4 43 db in turn the shapes of the frequency curve under different working pressure conditions are similar and the frequency characteristic is independent of the delivery pressure similarly the average vibration acceleration levels are obtained respectively at the working pressure of 0 5 mpa 1 0 mpa 1 5 mpa 2 0 mpa 2 5 mpa and 3 0 mpa when the integrated accumulators are set the optimized parameters as shown in fig 17 the vibration acceleration levels are 0 91 db 0 06 db 0 42 db 1 17 db 2 61 db and 3 25 db in turn which are lower than that when the accumulator doesn t work in addition the shapes of the frequency curves have little difference which means integrating accumulators into the seawater piston pump has little influence on the frequency response of the vibration the comparison of the vibration acceleration levels of the seawater piston pump when the accumulators are precharged with different pressures is shown in fig 18 and table 5 it obviously indicates that the seawater piston pump has lower vibration acceleration relatively in the whole working range when the accumulators are set the optimized multiple parameters in addition the vibration acceleration is associated with the pressure pulsation and the vibration acceleration is accordingly lower under the conditions of lower pressure pulsation at the same time the vibration would increase with the working pressure increasing because the intensity of the excitation sources increase in conclusion it is an effective method to reduce vibration acceleration level through integrating accumulators into the seawater piston pump and setting the reasonable parameters 5 conclusion the new type crankshaft piston pump has the characteristics of high flow pulsation and pressure pulsation due to the discrete of pistons and their nonuniform motions the whole simulation model of the seawater pump was established using amesim based on the kinematic model of the pistons and the piping system was simplified as a lumped compressible volume the simulation results show that the flow pulsation is higher than the traditional piston pump because the kinematics of the pistons is different from each other hence the pressure pulsation rate is as high as 17 the frequency of pressure pulsation mainly includes 5 hz 10 hz and 20 hz that is related to the shaft frequency the piston number and the motion characteristic in order to reduce the pressure pulsation and the vibration eight accumulators are integrated into the seawater piston pump and the precharge parameters are determined as 0 6 mpa 0 8 mpa 1 2 mpa and 2 0 mpa to make the pump possess better performance in the whole working range in comparison with the single equal precharge pressure the simulation analysis of the seawater piston pump with accumulator was also completed and the results indicated that the pressure pulsation can be reduced below 5 under all conditions the accumulators can effectively reduce the pressure pulsation in addition the experiment about the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump was completed to evidence the effects of accumulators on suppressing pressure pulsation the experiment results of the pressure pulsation rates well agreed with the simulation results at the same time the acceleration of the seawater piston pump were measured and compared the experiments showed that the vibration acceleration level would increase with the increase of the working pressure and the lower pulsation rate is benefit of suppressing the vibration acceleration the seawater piston pump integrated with accumulators and combined the multiple precharge pressures optimally have good performance in wide working conditions it provided a reasonable solution for overcoming the limitations of the poor tunability of the accumulator precharge parameters acknowledgement this work was supported by the china

pressure in addition experimental analysis was conducted through measuring the pressure pulsation and vibration acceleration under different conditions the experiment results of the pressure pulsation well agreed with the simulation results besides the vibration acceleration of the seawater piston pump was obviously reduced in wide working range when the accumulators were precharged with the optimized combination multiple parameters in conclusion integrating accumulators into pump and optimizing the precharge parameters can reduce the pressure pulsation and vibration acceleration in the working range keywords seawater pump pressure pulsation vibration accumulator 1 introduction water hydraulics which utilizes natural water as working medium instead of traditional mineral oil possesses several important advantages in comparison with traditional oil hydraulics such as little environment pollution nonflammable and lower operating cost koskinen and aaltonen 2014 lim et al 2003 wang and gao 2013 especially in underwater environment water hydraulics is very flexible to establish open circuit type system using the surrounding water as working medium directly and discharging drainage to the open surroundings without needing return hose and reservoir wu et al 2017 these advantages invoke engineers great interests in applying water hydraulics system to underwater equipment and it has been widely utilized in variable ballast system vbs bilge drainage system high pressure water mist fire suppression system high pressure waterjet propulsion system etc liu et al 2014 2017 huawei et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b 2018b 2018c with the missions of underwater equipment becoming increasingly complex and varied such as military applications inspection of underwater structures exploration of unknown environments oceanographic observations submarine rescue underwater animal behavior research and so on zhao et al 2016 the underwater equipment possessing better stability higher reliability lower vibration and noise radiation are strongly required seawater hydraulic piston pump is a core power component in water hydraulics system its performance would directly influence on the whole properties of the water hydraulics system and even on the overall underwater equipment flow pulsation is an inherent characteristic of piston pumps resulting from the discrete annular distribution and periodic motion of pistons moreover the flow pulsation would cause pressure pulsation after interacting with the downstream load components and the pressure pulsation would further result in a series of undesirable issues such as fluid induced vibration aggravating mechanical vibration noise radiation cavitation and so on bae et al 2014 li et al 2017 sung et al 2018 the accompanying vibration is one of the main reasons causing looseness and mechanical fatigue failures that would directly damage to the personal safety and the equipment performances in general seawater piston pump is the main excitation source of vibration and noise of underwater equipment which would worsen the invisibility stability and reliability xu et al 2016 therefore it is very important to reduce the pressure pulsation vibration and noise of seawater piston pump for improving the overall performance of water hydraulics system and underwater equipment among the methods of reducing the pressure pulsation vibration and noise of hydraulic systems optimizing the existing structure and installing auxiliary attenuators are the two most reliable solutions a multidisciplinary design optimization mdo procedure based on co simulation and integrated optimization has been proposed by liu et al 2016 in order to determine the parameters related to the fluid distribution process of piston pump including the piston chamber wrap angle the inlet port and outlet port area the silencing groove wrap angle and the silencing groove opening degree through the integration and optimization based on the data exchange between amesim and adams software and the sequential quadratic programming the flow ripple rates under six working conditions are reduced and the pressure distribution is more uniform the mdo procedure is an effective and feasible method for piston pump design besides optimizing the valve plate transition region including relief grooves and timing is always the research hotspot in reducing the pressure pulsation vibration and noise of piston pump xu et al 2016 kim et al 2004 found that using an appropriate pre compression angle and notch design could reduce the pump vibration and noise through analyzing the effects of pre compression angle and v notch on pressure variation of axial piston pump by comparing three types of valve plates it is further considered that v type notch valve plate is better than circular type notch in the characteristic of pressure and flow pulsation through the simulation analysis by using simulation x softerware bae et al 2014 about the influence of the closed angle between valve port and chamber on the pulsation characteristic of piston pump zhang et al 2017 found that the working characteristics are better with a compression angle of 3 and an expansion angle of 2 through fluid simulation and theoretical analysis innovatively xu et al 2013 presented a new distribution method to reduce the flow ripple torque pulsation and noise emission by using a pressure equalization mechanism composed of check valve and pressure recuperation chamber matching the parameter of rotation speed and swashplate angle is another optimization thought in reducing pulsation huang et al 2015 suggested that the combination of lower rotation speed and higher swashplate angle is reasonable for the variable displacement and variable speed control pump in considering the pressure pulsation characteristics installing pulsation attenuators is another important method on suppressing flow pulsation vibration and noise by smoothing the delivery flow variations at pump outlet wang and wang 2017 gao et al 2013 passive attenuators are the mostly widely used devices to achieve the fluid pulsation suppression in hydraulics system zhang et al 2018a the common facilities include accumulator branched resonator of λ 4 length λ is wavelength helmholtz resonator and multi cavity resonator etc a kind of compact pulsation attenuator in forms of bladder accumulator with good compactness and versatility was proposed to suppress fluid pulsation by chai et al 2016 gao et al 2013 developed a novel pulsation attenuator based on spring accumulator for pressure controlled aircraft pump and investigated the components parameters this novel pulsation attenuator has the characteristic of compact structure and good self adjusting ability which can be conveniently embedded into the pump and adjust itself to adapt to the changes of pump operation parameters within a certain range and the pressure fluctuation can be reduced with up to 80 flow through damper promises a faster response time and thus a wider broadband frequency which is benefit of solving the limitation of branched resonators in frequency response and its operating behavior with regard to the remaining pressure pulsations and vibration levels was investigated by koegler et al 2016 multi element buffer bottle formed by orifices pipes and t offs is an integrated fluid filter network which is usually installed inside the pump for attenuating pressure pulsation and its parameters should be pre designed within the range of its operating condition li et al 2017 inserting a reactive type of silencer in the pump discharge line to change the impedance of the circuit and reflects the pressure oscillations back is also benefit of attenuating the pressure oscillations kim et al 2005 used a parallel line to reduce the hydraulic pipeline pressure ripples strunk 1991 described a cross loop attenuator to attenuate the odd harmonics in the pressure ripple of piston pumps introducing feed back control mechanism to achieve active control is an attractive method on suppressing pulsation within a wide range of working condition guan et al 2014 proposed a novel acfpp active control of fluid pressure pulsation method for the hydraulic piping system by bilateral overflow of piezoelectric direct drive slide valve pddsv and adopted an adaptive optimum control strategy to adjust the control parameters this method can eliminate the sinusoidal component of the pressure pulsation when the pddsv only works at half of the frequency of the pressure pulsation chen et al 2013 contributed an integral sliding mode control strategy to stabilize the pressure of hydrodynamic system with accumulator luo et al 2011 conducted a semi active accumulator to match the requirement of parameters various under different working conditions however the aforementioned methods on suppressing pressure pulsation have some limitations on one hand optimizing the existing structure parameters and installing passive attenuators can only work within a certain range which is difficult to satisfy the requirements for variable working conditions at the same time the passive attenuator is also limited by the construction space and frequency response on the other hand introducing feed back control mechanism takes the risks of complicating the system and raising the operation cost to overcome these shortcomings this paper integrated a group of passive accumulators into a seawater piston pump which works at a low frequency and optimally combined the precharge parameters to reduce the pressure pulsation rate and the vibration acceleration within a wide working range based on the theoretical analysis of the pistons kinematic a whole simulation model of the seawater piston pump was established by use of amesim software and the pressure pulsation characteristics were analyzed respectively under different working conditions then eight accumulators were integrated into the pump and the precharge parameters were designed by use of the optimal combination method to reduce the pressure pulsation rate the simulation results of the seawater piston pump when the accumulators were precharged with different pressures were compared with each other to approve the influence of the combined accumulators on pulsation suppression theoretically finally the pressure pulsation and the vibration acceleration of the seawater piston pump were measured and compared in order to experimentally verify the usefulness of the combined accumulator on suppressing pressure pulsation and vibration acceleration in the range of the whole working conditions 2 pressure pulsation of seawater piston pump the seawater hydraulic piston pump mainly consists of an end cover a pump casing a crankshaft an oriented ring a swash plate 8 connecting rods 8 pistons 8 sets of flat valves a valve body a cylinder block an outlet belt a base plate 8 sets of accumulators etc as shown in fig 1 structurally this piston pump implements the motion conversation from the rotation of crankshaft to the reciprocation of pistons by use of the resultant motion of the crankshaft swashplate and connecting rod the rotation of the crankshaft compels the swashplate to swing conically simultaneous the eight pistons annularly distributed in the cylinder block are driven to undergo periodical reciprocation movements and each piston corresponds to a set of flat valve which opens and closes periodically accompanying with the reciprocation motion of the pistons to suck in low pressure water and delivery high pressure water the special motion conversion mechanism makes the piston pump possess both the advantages of swashplate type pump and bent axis type pump it has only one essential piston cylinder tribology and the lateral force between piston and cylinder is only 1 18 of swashplate type pump zhang et al 2016a 2016b consequently the friction and wear conditions of the piston couples have been significantly improved which is very important for water hydraulics to overcome its poor lubrication unfortunately it aggravates the risk of pressure pulsation and vibration because of the nonuniform motion of pistons according to the structure feature of this piston pump the piston motions are the resultant motions of the crankshaft swash plate and connecting rods the mechanical kinematic of the pistons and connecting rods could be analyzed based on the coordinate transformation theory chao et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a then the local coordinate of the connecting rods within the swashplate could be expressed in cartesian global coordinates as 1 x c i y c i z c i x x r sin θ i r cos θ i cos φ y y r sin θ i z z r sin θ i r cos θ i sin φ where x c i y c i z c i is the global coordinate of the connecting rods θ i 2 π i 8 π 16 i 1 2 8 r represents the distribution circle radius of the connecting rod on the swashplate ϕ is the crankshaft angle and ϕ 25 φ is the swinging angle of the swashplate referring to a fix coordinate plane and sin φ cos ω t sin ϕ cos 2 ϕ sin 2 ϕ cos 2 ω t cos φ cos ϕ cos 2 ϕ sin 2 ϕ cos 2 ω t x x y y z z are the first column elements of the coordinate transformation matric x x sin ϕ sin φ sin ω t y y cos ϕ cos φ sin ϕ sin φ cos ω t z z sin ϕ cos φ sin ω t ω denotes the crankshaft angular velocity then based on the space distance and inflexibility of the connecting rods the displacement of the pistons in the cylinder block can be obtained 2 z a i z c i l 2 x c i x a i 2 y c i y a i 2 where l is the length of the connect rods x a i y a i and z a i are the coordinates of the pistons and x a i r cos θ i y a i r sin θ i according to eq 2 the displacements of the pistons are derived numerically simultaneous the velocities and accelerations of the pistons are also obtained as shown in fig 2 the kinematic motions of the pistons in the cylinder block are different from piston to piston and the phase differences between the pistons are not constant even though the pistons are uniformly distributed in the cylinder block the velocities and accelerations are also different accordingly the difference in motion between the pistons is mainly caused by the motion conversion mechanism from the rotation of crankshaft to the reciprocation of the pistons the swashplate would make a conical movement around the shaft accompanying with the oriented ring swinging up and down when the crankshaft rotates in other word the conical movement of the swashplate is the synthesis of the swashplate s swing motion and the oriented ring s swing motion the projection image of the coordinates of the connecting rod on the global coordinate system is ellipse and they would change periodically with the conical motion of the swashplate as a result the motions of the pistons are different form each other more detailed analysis are discussed by zhang et al 2016a the kinematic performances of the pistons would further influence on the flow and pressure characteristic of the seawater piston pump in order to analyze the flow characteristic of the pump more precisely the dynamic of the flat valves are also considered generally the force exerted on the valve core includes the hydraulic force the steady hydrodynamic force and the spring preload then the force equilibrium equation of the flat valves is gained based on newton s second law 3 m c in m s in 3 x in p atm p v π r in 2 ρ q in 2 a in k i n x 0 x in m c out m s out 3 y out p v p w π r out 2 ρ q out 2 a out k out y 0 y out

water v 0 is the dead volume r piston represents the radius of the pistons in order to analyze the performances of the seawater piston pump its whole simulation model is established by use of amesim r12 0 based on the principle of the seawater piston pump and the mathematic model of the piston kinematics as shown in fig 3 the simulation model includes 8 piston modules and each module includes a piston an inlet valve and an outlet valve subassembly and the delivery piping system is simplified as a lumped compressible volume the rotation speed of the crankshaft is set as 150 r min the motion of piston is modeled with mathematic function according to the kinematic model the delivery pressure is regulated through a throttle valve in the range 0 3 0 mpa at the interval of 0 5 mpa the parameter of suction port is set as atmosphere environment fig 4 shows the simulation results of the flow characteristic of the seawater piston pump without accumulators the flow pulsation is completely determined by the structure parameters of the seawater piston pump and independent with the delivery pressure neglecting the influence of leakage its maximum flow is 420 l min and the minimum flow is 320 l min resulting from the comprehensive effects of the non uniform motions of the pistons the flow pulsation of this seawater piston pump is higher in comparison with traditional piston pump obviously the flow pulsation contains two main frequencies the high frequency which relates to the discontinues distribution of the pistons can be calculated as f h n z 60 the low frequency related to the non uniform motion of the pistons doubles the shaft frequency that is f l 2 n 60 the flow pulsation would further lead to pressure pulsation interacting with the downstream control valves and actuators considering the difficulty on measuring flow pulsation pressure pulsation is usually regarded as the criterion for pulsation characteristic analysis differing from flow pulsation the amplitude of the pressure pulsation would increase with the delivery pressure but the pulsation rate nearly keeps constant and the amplitude of the pressure pulsation rate is double of the flow pulsation rate in theory the pressure pulsation rate is about 17 under the working condition of 0 3 mpa in considering the delivery piping system as shown in fig 5 and the definition of pressure pulsation rate is as following 6 δ p p max p min p max p min 3 the method on suppressing pulsation in order to reduce the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump a group of accumulators are integrated into the seawater piston pump as shown in fig 6 chambers in the outlet belt are utilized and bladders were installed in them to form separated gas chambers and liquid chambers to achieve the function of accumulator the gas chambers are precharged with pressurized nitrogen gas and the liquid chambers intercommunicate with the delivery chamber of the seawater piston pump the pressure and volume of the gas chamber would vary with the system pressure to absorb and supply flow for system to smoothen the flow and pressure pulsation when the system pressure pulsation raises the gas volumes are compressed and the liquid chambers expand to store more water so the working medium is stored in the liquid chamber to suppress the peak pressure conversely when the pressure decreases the gas chambers would expand and compress the liquid chamber to force the working medium back to system for increasing the system minimum pressure consequently the accumulators implement the function of reducing pressure peak and filling pressure valley to suppress pressure pulsation on the basis of the working principle of accumulator the mathematic model of the accumulator is built according to the gas state equation the pressure and volume of nitrogen gas in the accumulator is expressed as following 7 p c v c γ p a v a γ const where p c and v c is the charged pressure and volume of nitrogen gas p a and v a is the instantaneous pressure and volume of gas γ is adiabatic index and γ 1 4 assuming the accumulators always work at the normal state and neglecting the fully discharged state and the fully charged state that is the gas pressure is equal to the system pressure p s p a and the gas volume can be obtained by using the polytrophic law 8 v a v c p c p a 1 γ considering the compressibility of water medium is insignificant in comparison with the nitrogen gas hence the hydraulic pressure derivative is regarded as being equal to the gas pressure derivative therefore the following derivative equation is obtained 9 d p d t γ p v d v d t that is 10 d p ai d t γ p ci v ai q ci where q a i 1 n q ai d v d t the system pressure and the flow rate could be obtained through orifice flow equation the system flow is the sum of the piston delivery flow and the output flow of the accumulators 11 q s q p q a in addition the system flow can be calculated based on the orifice equation 12 q s c d c v a orific 2 p out p atm ρ specially the diving depth of underwater equipment would constantly change according to the mission requirements so the load pressure of the seawater piston pump would instantaneously vary accordingly and its working range is p miñ p max however the parameter of the accumulators can t adjust online accompanying with the working condition and its performance would worsen when the working condition deviates from the setting range therefore it is significant to take measures to make the accumulators maintain efficient on absorbing the pressure pulsation in wide working rang optimizing and combining the precharge pressures of the accumulator group is a good method the parameters of the accumulators should be set firstly in considering the system parameters the total volume of a single accumulator is derived 13 v a δ v 1 2 δ p 2 δ p 1 γ where v a is the total bladder volume δ p is the allowance pressure pulsation coefficient and δ p 0 8 δv is the excess volume over the average value in a pulsation period and it can be derived according to the expression of the instantaneous flow rate as following manring 2000 14 δ v q r 2 0 π z p max cos π z p β z p sin π z p 1 π 0 d β c δ q r where q r is the displacement of the seawater piston pump and q r 2 727 10 3 m 3 r z p is the number of piston and z p 8 c δ is the pulsation coefficient which is related to the piston number and c δ 1 256 10 3 then δ v 3 425 10 6 and v a 0 6 10 3 in order to determine the precharge parameters of the accumulators the 8 accumulators are divided into 4 groups and every 2 accumulators are precharged with the same parameters the 4 working pressure points are respectively set as p w1 p w2 p w3 p w4 and p w1 1 mpa as usual the precharge pressure of 2 accumulators which mainly work at the first working point is set as p c 1 α 1 p w 1 in general the precharge pressure of the next group accumulators can be set as equal to the previous working point pressure however the number of working accumulator would increase with the working pressure increasing that means the absorption performance would be better under higher pressure condition when more accumulators begin working therefore in order to improve the performance under low pressure conditions and balance the overall absorption performance the next prechargé pressure is set as the previous working pressure multiplied by a coefficient no more than 1 that is p c i 1 β i p wi β i 0 8 0 08 i 1 i 1 2 3 for instance the second precharge pressure is p c 2 β 1 p w 1 the working pressure point corresponding to the precharge pressure can be determined as p wj p cj α j according to the empirical principle of accumulator precharge similarly the coefficient is corrected as α j 0 6 0 02 j 1 in considering the influence of the previous accumulators for example the second working pressure point is determined as p w 2 p c 2 α 2 then the parameters of the accumulators are gained and listed in table 1 the simulation model is established by use of amesim r12 0 tool 4 groups of accumulators are integrated into the piston pump and the delivery piping system is simplified as a lumped compressible volume as shown in fig 7 the parameters of the accumulators are set according to table 1 after integrating accumulators into the seawater piston pump and optimally combining the precharge parameters the flow characteristic of the seawater piston pump is very different from the seawater piston pump without accumulators as shown in fig 8 the maximum flow rate is respectively 420 417 393 383 378 378 and 377 l min and the minimum flow rate is respectively 322 322 350 360 365 366 367 and 320 l min at the pressure of 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 mpa the amplitude of the flow pulsation would reduce with the delivery pressure because the compression of the gas chambers of the accumulator and the flow absorption would increase with the delivery pressure at the same time the pressure pulsation is depicted in fig 9 the pressure pulsation still maintains 17 when the working pressure is below 0 6 mpa because the lowest precharge pressure of the accumulators is 0 6 mpa and they don t work under the pressure condition of below 0 6 mpa in addition the higher the delivery pressure is the more the number of the working accumulator is hence the performance of the accumulators on absorbing pressure pulsation would be better with the working pressure increasing when the delivery pressure is 3 mpa the pressure pulsation rate can be tremendously reduced to 3 58 from 15 7 obviously the pressure pulsation is well suppressed in the whole working range except for the low pressure conditions fortunately the impact of pressure pulsation on the system under low pressure conditions is weak and it can be neglected to a certain degree in addition the comparison of the pressure pulsation rate of the seawater piston pump under the conditions that the accumulators are precharged with different single pressures is conducted as shown in fig 10 the pressure pulsation rate of the seawater piston pump integrated with accumulators and precharged with a single pressure is worse than that the accumulators are precharged with the optimized multiple parameters when the integrating accumulators are precharged with a single pressure they only work well within a certain range for example when the accumulators are all precharged with the pressure of 0 6 mpa even though the seawater piston pump has a good performance the durability of the accumulators would be dramatically affected if the pump works under high pressure conditions due to the enormous deformation of the bladder if the accumulators are all precharged with the pressure of 2 0 mpa the accumulators only work above the precharged pressure and the pressure pulsation rate is higher below 2 0 mpa consequently the seawater piston pump has the best comprehensive performance within a wide working range when the accumulators are precharged with the optimized multiple parameters instead of being precharged with a single pressure as listed in table 2 4 the experiment of pressure pulsation on vibration experiments are conducted to research the pressure pulsation and vibration acceleration of the seawater piston pump an experiment system is established as shown in fig 11 the pump works at the speed of 150 r min through the deceleration of a gearbox the reduction ratio is 1 5 the delivery pressure of the seawater piston pump is regulated in the range of 0 3 mpa through a throttle valve the system pressure is measured through pressure transducers and the measurement signals are collected by the data acquisition card lan xi type 3050 b 0606ch brüel kjær and processed through the analysis software pulse labshop 14 1 in order to accomplish the comparative tests and obtain the test results of the pressure pulsation and vibration accelerations of the seawater piston pump without accumulators working the influences of the accumulators integrated into the pump should be eliminated in hence the accumulators are all precharged with 4 mpa which is higher than the maximum working pressure in order to make the accumulators work at the fully charge situation that is equivalent to the condition without accumulators at the same time 8 test points are selected on the seawater piston pump to gain the vibration acceleration signals and the accelerometers type 4514 b 001 brüel kjær are also connected to the data acquisition system and analysis software pulse labshop 14 1 all the date are finally saved as txt type documents and processed through matable software fig 12 shows the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump when the accumulator are all precharged with 4 mpa that is the accumulators all work at the fully charged situation and they have no capability on absorbing pressure pulsation after data processing the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump is respectively as 20 65 20 93 19 12 17 39 16 56 and 15 33 at the conditions of 0 5 mpa 1 0 mpa 1 5 mpa 2 0 mpa 2 5 mpa and 3 0 mpa the experiment results well agree with the simulation results under the same conditions simultaneously the pressure pulsation would decrease with the working pressure increasing because the influence of piping system on pulsation suppression would enhance under high pressure condition after precharging the accumulators with the optimized multiple parameters the results of pressure pulsation are obtained as depicted in fig 13 the pressure pulsation is dramatically reduced in comparison with the seawater piston pump whose accumulators don t work and the pulsation rates are controlled below 3 when the delivery pressure is above 1 0 mpa under the conditions of below 0 5 mpa the pressure pulsation is relatively high and it reaches to 18 because the minimum precharge pressure of the accumulators is 0 6 mpa which is higher than the delivery pressure and the accumulators don t work however the pulsation amplitude and intensity is relatively low so it has little influence on the pump performance the experimental results well agree with the simulation results the comparison of the pressure pulsation rate between simulation and experiment is listed in table 3 the experiment results indicate that the seawater piston pump integrated with accumulators and precharged with the optimized multiple pressures has lower pressure pulsation rate in the whole working range and the seawater piston pump has better comprehensive performance in comparison with being precharged with a single pressure the results verified that it is a good method to suppressing pressure pulsation besides the pressure pulsation rate of the seawater piston pump under the condition that the integrating accumulators are precharged with the same pressures are obtained and compared as shown in fig 14 same as the simulation results when the accumulators are precharged with the same pressures they only work well within a special range for instance when the accumulators are all precharged with the pressure of 0 6 mpa the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump would become worse under the high pressure working conditions if the accumulators are all precharged with the pressure of 2 0 mpa it would have a better performance under the high pressure working conditions but the performance becomes worse under the conditions of below 2 0 mpa in summary the pressure pulsation rate of the seawater piston pump is relatively lower within the whole working conditions when the accumulators are precharged with the optimized multiple pressures the experimental results of the pulsation rates under different conditions are listed in table 4 at the same time the vibration accelerations of the seawater piston pump are also measured and analyzed eight acceleration signals are obtained through the acceleration transducers mounted on the test point under the same conditions and the signals are processed through the analysis software pulse labshop 14 1 achieving the time domain and frequency domain information the total vibration acceleration level is directly acquired through the analysis software and the frequency characteristic of the vibration acceleration is derived through fft analysis program embedded in the software in addition the average of the vibration acceleration levels is given by according to the power average method 15 l 10 log 10 1 8 i 1 8 10 l i 10 where l is the average of the vibration acceleration levels l i is the vibration acceleration at i test point fig 15 shows the common signal processing for acquiring the average vibration acceleration level at the working pressure of 3 0 mpa when the integrated accumulators are precharged with the optimized multiple parameters it indicates that the maximum vibration acceleration level appears near the outlet port test point 5 and the vibration on the outlet belt test point 5 8 is higher than that on the base plate test point 1 4 because the outlet belt is more closer to the vibration exciting source such as the motion mechanism and fluid pulsation and the valve body between the outlet belt and the base plate can isolate a certain vibration in addition the vibration is dominated at the low frequency region 1500 hz which is mainly related to the shaft frequency the flow pulsation the mechanical vibration and the fluid vibration according to the aforementioned method eight acceleration signals are measured by the acceleration transducers attached on the test points under the same condition and the average vibration acceleration level is counted on the basis of the power average method the average vibration acceleration levels are respectively obtained at the working pressure of 0 5 mpa 1 0 mpa 1 5 mpa 2 0 mpa 2 5 mpa and 3 0 mpa under the conditions that the integrated accumulators don t work as shown in fig 16 the maximum vibration acceleration level appears at the working pressure of 3 0 mpa and the vibration acceleration level would increase with the increase of working pressure they are 0 52 db 0 19 db 0 54 db 1 85 db 3 33 db and 4 43 db in turn the shapes of the frequency curve under different working pressure conditions are similar and the frequency characteristic is independent of the delivery pressure similarly the average vibration acceleration levels are obtained respectively at the working pressure of 0 5 mpa 1 0 mpa 1 5 mpa 2 0 mpa 2 5 mpa and 3 0 mpa when the integrated accumulators are set the optimized parameters as shown in fig 17 the vibration acceleration levels are 0 91 db 0 06 db 0 42 db 1 17 db 2 61 db and 3 25 db in turn which are lower than that when the accumulator doesn t work in addition the shapes of the frequency curves have little difference which means integrating accumulators into the seawater piston pump has little influence on the frequency response of the vibration the comparison of the vibration acceleration levels of the seawater piston pump when the accumulators are precharged with different pressures is shown in fig 18 and table 5 it obviously indicates that the seawater piston pump has lower vibration acceleration relatively in the whole working range when the accumulators are set the optimized multiple parameters in addition the vibration acceleration is associated with the pressure pulsation and the vibration acceleration is accordingly lower under the conditions of lower pressure pulsation at the same time the vibration would increase with the working pressure increasing because the intensity of the excitation sources increase in conclusion it is an effective method to reduce vibration acceleration level through integrating accumulators into the seawater piston pump and setting the reasonable parameters 5 conclusion the new type crankshaft piston pump has the characteristics of high flow pulsation and pressure pulsation due to the discrete of pistons and their nonuniform motions the whole simulation model of the seawater pump was established using amesim based on the kinematic model of the pistons and the piping system was simplified as a lumped compressible volume the simulation results show that the flow pulsation is higher than the traditional piston pump because the kinematics of the pistons is different from each other hence the pressure pulsation rate is as high as 17 the frequency of pressure pulsation mainly includes 5 hz 10 hz and 20 hz that is related to the shaft frequency the piston number and the motion characteristic in order to reduce the pressure pulsation and the vibration eight accumulators are integrated into the seawater piston pump and the precharge parameters are determined as 0 6 mpa 0 8 mpa 1 2 mpa and 2 0 mpa to make the pump possess better performance in the whole working range in comparison with the single equal precharge pressure the simulation analysis of the seawater piston pump with accumulator was also completed and the results indicated that the pressure pulsation can be reduced below 5 under all conditions the accumulators can effectively reduce the pressure pulsation in addition the experiment about the pressure pulsation of the seawater piston pump was completed to evidence the effects of accumulators on suppressing pressure pulsation the experiment results of the pressure pulsation rates well agreed with the simulation results at the same time the acceleration of the seawater piston pump were measured and compared the experiments showed that the vibration acceleration level would increase with the increase of the working pressure and the lower pulsation rate is benefit of suppressing the vibration acceleration the seawater piston pump integrated with accumulators and combined the multiple precharge pressures optimally have good performance in wide working conditions it provided a reasonable solution for overcoming the limitations of the poor tunability of the accumulator precharge parameters acknowledgement this work was supported by the china
