13315,different cleaning strategies for membranes from membrane bioreactors mbr were investigated and applied to a pilot mbr treating real refinery wastewater it was assessed different cleaning agents sodium percarbonate dodecyl sulfate citric acid oxalic acid and sodium hypochlorite at different concentrations 500 5000 ppm temperatures 22 40 c ph without adjustment and ph 12 with and without air scouring for membranes permeability recovery the best cleaning sequence was defined to be oxalic acid ph 2 5 followed by naocl 5000 ppm which was responsible for the inorganic fouling removal and allowed the oxidant agent to remove more effectively the organic fouling layer improvement in permeability recovery at 40 c 92 7 of the initial permeability and higher naocl concentration 5000 ppm was found due to the increase in chemical oxidation kinetics and the diffusion rate of the cleaning agents within the fouled layer and membrane oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite 40 c had a lower effect on membranes morphology and thermal resistance proven by thermogravimetric analysis and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy the pilot scale operation was used to estimate the membrane lifespan which was approximately 1916 days of monitoring about five years graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords clean in place protocol cleaning agents pilot mbr membrane lifespan refinery wastewater 1 introduction membrane bioreactors mbr combines biological and membrane separation processes and have been widely applied to industrial wastewater enabling its reuse 1 2 over the last two decades mbr reached a significant market share in the wastewater treatment business and it is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 13 2 2 compared to conventional activated sludge systems mbrs have a low area demand 2 to 10 times lower low sludge production 2 times lower higher sludge retention time and total removal of suspended solids high removal efficiency of micropollutants and persistent organic pollutants and low sensitivity to wastewater composition 1 2 despite that membrane fouling caused by feed wastewater composition and biosolids compromises mbr s efficiency requiring higher pressures to ensure a stable permeate flux besides the impact on energy requirements and costs the increase in operating pressure may damage the ultrafiltration uf membranes 3 one way to get around this problem is through periodic membrane cleaning protocols whether physical or chemical 4 physical cleaning can be done through backwashing or relaxation the first method reverses the permeate flux in the opposite direction removing the foulant layer adhered to the membrane surface the second procedure interrupts the filtration process for a few minutes while the aeration process is maintained 5 despite its simplicity the efficiency of physical cleaning is limited to reversible fouling chemical cleaning agents should be employed whenever physical cleaning protocols are unable to restore the membrane permeability 4 or the initial permeability decays by 50 or the transmembrane pressure exceeds 40 50 kpa 6 sodium hypochlorite 7 8 and hydrogen peroxide are examples of oxidizing agents considered for organic fouling removal which can be conjugated with citric and oxalic acids for additional removal of inorganic components 9 however whether to choose for first an oxidizing or acid agent in a cleaning protocol depends on the wastewater composition and operating conditions it is necessary to investigate the most appropriate order their concentration exposure time and cleaning intervals to reduce the operating costs 4 10 and prolong the membrane lifespan especially for mbr that treats industrial wastewaters wei et al 11 suggest a clean in place cip protocol for being a faster and cheaper procedure for chemical cleaning these advantages were proven by alkmim et al 12 in a pilot scale mbr operation for 750 days comparing sodium hypochlorite 500 3000 ppm naoh ph 12 and hcl ph 1 for their efficiency in membrane permeability recovery the cleaning procedure was performed periodically and or when the transmembrane pressure reached 15 kpa among the three cleaning agents concentrated sodium hypochlorite 3000 ppm presented the greatest performance for permeability recovery whereas diluted sodium hypochlorite 500 1000 ppm naoh and hcl had a similar efficiency besides wei et al 11 and alkmim et al 12 other researchers have also investigated chemical cleaning procedures for mbr membranes achieving success in permeability recovery a few recent examples were summarized in table 1 along with the cleaning agent used its concentration and exposure time besides the cleaning agent concentration other operational variables as temperature 13 ph 14 and aeration 15 interfere in the cleaning process efficiency the studies mentioned so far point to the fact that there is no defined protocol for mbr membranes cleaning being necessary to carry out in depth studies of each system to establish an appropriate cleaning protocol concentration exposure time temperature ph and aeration effects it must be noted that most studies dealt with synthetic wastewater which does not reflect the complexity of real industrial samples especially those from oil refineries the wastewater from this industrial sector is characterized by high concentrations of dissolved salts ammonium oil greases and phenols which have a high fouling potential 22 besides a direct interaction with the membrane surface these compounds might also stress the microbiota that in response produce extracellular polymeric substances and soluble products of great fouling potential 22 therefore if fouling and cleaning protocols are investigated it is presumable that a better assessment would be made when real wastewater was treated by mbr rather than synthetic samples previous attempts to estimate the membrane lifespan and the effect of chemical cleaning were carried out ayala et al 23 showed that chemical cleaning with sodium hypochlorite citric acid and hydrochloric acid in full scale mbr treating municipal wastewater leads to a decline in membrane permeability r 0 87 and membrane weld strength r 0 84 this decline was attributed to deposition of inorganic scale and prolonged exposure to sodium hypochlorite the estimated membrane lifespan in their study was 6 years fenu et al 24 assessed the membrane lifespan in full scale mbrs treating municipal wastewater the authors also reported that a decline in permeability could be due to irreversible fouling and exposure to chemical cleanings their estimations for the membrane lifespan were between 8 1 and 10 0 years it can be noted that in both previous studies the effect of fouling and chemical cleaning on the membrane lifespan could not be separated from that this paper investigated different cleaning strategies for membranes from a pilot mbr treating oil refinery wastewater based on the studies mentioned so far different cleaning agents sodium percarbonate dodecyl sulfate citric acid oxalic acid and sodium hypochlorite at different concentrations 500 5000 ppm temperatures 22 40 c ph without adjustment and ph 12 and air scouring were assessed possible alterations in membrane morphology thermal resistance and its lifespan were verified for the most appropriate cleaning procedure pristine membranes were also used to assess the effect of cleaning onto the membrane lifespan thru sequential cleaning cycles the results from bench scale results were employed in the pilot scale operation monitoring the cleaning contribution to restoring the mbr permeability for 1841 days 2 material and methods 2 1 cleaning sequence and agents of mbr membranes the uf membranes polymeric chlorinated polyethylene pe c average pore size 0 4 μm nominal permeability 800 l m2h bar were collected from an mbr used for refinery wastewater treatment equipped with an 8 m3 biological tank with submerged plate and frame membrane modules with a total filtration area of 75 m2 the mbr operated with an organic load rate of 13 kg m3 d of cod chemical oxygen demand solid and hydraulic retention time of 40 days and 5 6 h respectively and an airflow of 45 nm3 h other wastewater characteristics were 36 4 ppm of ammonium 17 4 4 7 ppm of phenol 4 2 1 0 ppm of total phosphorous and turbidity of 54 35 ntu to guarantee a stable permeate flux 1 min of relaxation was performed every 9 min of filtration and a chemical cleaning was adopted whenever the membrane permeability reached 100 l m2 h bar 2 1 1 membranes for the cleaning trials fouled membranes were removed from the module cut into a rectangular shape 0 152 0 071 m 0 0108 m2 and placed in an acrylic module for hydraulic permeability and flux determination the membranes were stored in a container with deionized water before and after each analysis 2 1 2 hydraulic permeability determination the tests for hydraulic permeability were carried out after membranes compaction at 0 59 bar with a recirculation flow rate of 3 2 l min an initial membrane compaction ensures that the variations in hydraulic permeability after exposure to chemical cleaning agents will depend only on the polymer chemical alterations and not on the membrane mechanical deformation permeate flux was determined by the time required for 20 ml filtration of deionized water measured in a graduated cylinder for these experiments the feed cross flow was set at 3 2 l h maintaining the temperature constant at 22 1 c membrane permeability was measured before and after each chemical treatment for comparative purposes the permeability recovery η after cleaning in relation to the nominal permeability provided by the manufacturer 800 l m2h bar was estimated by eqs 1 2 where lp l m2h bar corresponds to the empirical permeability 1 η total 100 1 l p cleaned l p fouled 2 η related to new 100 l p cleaned 800 the permeate flux l m2h and the transmembrane pressure applied 0 59 0 49 0 39 and 0 29 bar were fitted by a linear regression where the angular coefficient represented the membrane permeability 2 1 3 cleaning agents and sequence three fouled membranes were used for preliminary trials identified as s 1 s 2 and s 3 these membranes came from the same fouled membrane sheet the first s 1 naocl ca was washed for 2 h with sodium hypochlorite naocl 5000 ppm and then for 2 h with citric acid ph 2 5 in the second s 2 ca naocl the same process was used but with the reverse cleaning sequence citric acid followed by hypochlorite the third membrane s 3 oa naocl was cleaned with oxalic acid ph 2 5 for 2 h and then with naocl 5000 ppm also for 2 h a recirculation flow of 3 2 l min was considered in all cleaning procedures for each cleaning cycle a membrane sample was collected to analyze the cleaning effects over its morphology and the fouling agents composition by scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6360lv and dispersive energy spectroscopy eds these samples were collected at three distinctive moments for fouled membrane and after each cleaning process 2 1 4 cleaning protocol establishment different cleaning conditions were tested after the cleaning sequence and acid agent were defined the membranes exposure time 2 h and the recirculation flow rate 3 2 l min were kept the same whereas the temperature aeration naocl concentration and ph varied as described in fig 1 sodium percarbonate 500 2000 ppm in a single stage cleaning process and dodecyl sulfate 500 ppm ph 12 after cleaned with oxalic acid ph 2 5 were also investigated the hydraulic permeability was defined as a response variable for each cleaning process and the membranes subjected to the most efficient cleaning process were evaluated by sem and eds 2 2 cleaning effects on membrane lifespan pristine membranes fouling free were considered for these experiments for a better assessment of the chemical agents effect over membrane lifespan the membranes were separated into three pairs each pair was subjected to the same cleaning process one of the membranes used for permeability measurements and the other separated for characterization of its integrity by sem thermogravimetric analysis tga fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ftir and contact angle upon exposure 2 2 1 membrane cleaning and exposure the first pair of membranes were subjected to a cleaning protocol with citric acid followed by sodium hypochlorite the second and third membrane pairs were cleaned with oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite at room temperature 22 1 c and 40 1 c in a water bath respectively the cleaning sequence was determined after preliminary trials previously described in section 2 1 3 the membranes were first immersed in the acid citric or oxalic ph 2 5 then immersed in sodium hypochlorite solution 5000 ppm for another 2 h each measuring the membrane permeability before and after each cleaning agent exposure the cleaning cycles repeated until the membrane permeability was compromised the membranes integrity was evaluated periodically by sem tga perkin elmer tga 7 heating rate 10 c min from 25 to 1000 c under a nitrogen atmosphere 50 ml min ftir shimadzu prestige 21 and atr module a range of 400 to 4000 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 0 and contact angle θ sessile drop method using a goniometer sca20 version 2 dataphysics solvent deionized water at 23 c the values were taken in triplicate 3 results and discussions 3 1 cleaning sequence and agents for mbr membranes 3 1 1 cleaning sequence fig 2 brings the permeability results of the membranes s 1 naocl ca s 2 ca naocl and s 3 oa naocl before and after each cleaning procedure an effective cleaning process depends on six different mass transfer steps 4 25 the cleaning agent must undergo a series of bulk reactions hydrolysis and other after being introduced 1 then transported to the membrane surface 2 the cleaning agent then interacts with the foulant layer 3 and starts to solubilize and detach foulants 4 the waste cleaning agent with suspended foulants is transported to the fouling layer interface 5 and finally to the bulk solution 6 the permeability recovery was greater when the membrane was first subjected to acid cleaning most probably due to inorganic fouling or inorganic substances inlaid with the organic material after the inorganic fouling was removed the organic fraction is exposed to sodium hypochlorite favoring a higher interaction with the cleaning agent their solubilization and detachment which ultimately increases the cleaning efficiency a first deposition of organic materials is expected and in accordance with conceptual models for fouling formation 26 the foulant agents and the membrane surface interact mainly through hydrophobic attraction which tends to occur preferentially between the higher molecular weight compounds proteins polysaccharides humic acids and other substances either soluble or colloidal and biosolids microorganisms within the wastewater and biological medium and the membrane surface 4 26 afterward inorganic deposition may occur to a lower extent indeed an acid oxidant sequence as oxalic acid sodium hypochlorite seems to have a greater performance compared to the opposite oxidant acid for cleaning membranes used for industrial wastewater treatment recognized for their high content of organic matter 27 however this is not a defined protocol and in depth studies of each treatment system are required as the cleaning sequence remains governed by the feed wastewater quality and foulant types compared to citric acid oxalic acid showed a better efficiency for permeability recovery 86 2 and 90 5 respectively as seen in fig 2 and the microscopy analysis in fig 3 the best efficiency for the acid hypochlorite cleaning sequence was also confirmed by microscopy analysis fig 3 which reveals a lower fouling extension for s 2 ca naocl and s 3 oa naocl over the membrane surface after each cleaning cycle similarly liikanen et al 28 also reported a better performance for flux recovery when oxalic acid 0 2 wt was compared to citric acid 1 6 wt for cleaning nf255 membranes used for drinking water treatment the expectation of inorganic depositions covering the membrane surface was confirmed by eds spectra fig 4 corresponding to eds spectra for fouled and after cleaning procedure for membranes s 1 naocl ca s 2 ca naocl and s 3 oa naocl reveals that inorganic materials were indeed present at fouled membranes after an acid cleaning it is noticed a greater reduction in ions such as iron calcium and phosphorus with peaks of lower intensity for spectra corresponding to s 2 ca naocl and s 3 oa naocl compared to s 1 naocl ca spectra 3 1 2 cleaning protocol establishment after the cleaning sequence and the acid agent were defined oxalic acid sodium hypochlorite experiments were carried out under different temperatures ph and concentrations and the results for permeability recovery were presented in fig 5 besides these cleaning agents sodium percarbonate 500 2000 ppm in a single stage cleaning process and dodecyl sulfate 500 ppm ph 12 after cleaned with oxalic acid ph 2 5 were also investigated however demonstrated no contributions for permeability restoration 3 for that reason the results were omitted and focused on the cleaning agents and conditions with greater performance it is observed that oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite at 40 c was able to recover 92 7 of the initial permeability after cleaning protocol 2285 l m2h bar and 293 recovery compared to the nominal permeability informed by the manufacture from all experimental conditions that was the one with greater performance for permeability recovery the improvement in cleaning performance at higher cleaning temperatures 40 c was also described by wang et al 4 at higher temperatures chemical oxidation kinetics increases exponentially as well as the diffusion rate of the cleaning agents within the fouled layer and membrane polymeric matrix 4 it is thus possible to remove more foulant materials from the membrane surface or from the membrane pores at 40 c for mild fouling conditions heating is not always the best cost effective alternative however the strategy becomes interesting at more intense and severe fouling from the different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite tested 5000 ppm showed a greater performance for permeability recovery 85 2 compared to the initial permeability and 100 compared to the nominal higher sodium hypochlorite concentrations favor bulk reactions and the cleaning agent diffusion towards the fouling layer which explains the results observed however higher concentrations could increase the membrane hydrophilicity lower contact angle and reduce its tensile strength undesired aftereffects that may reduce its lifespan 29 30 the efficiency of oxalic acid hypochlorite at 40 c for membrane cleaning was visualized by sem images fig 6 obtained at different magnifications 1500 and 7000 it can be observed an efficiency in the scaling layer removal that was initially present on the membrane surface for the same sodium hypochlorite concentration 5000 ppm but different conditions aeration and ph 12 the cleaning efficiency decreased from 85 2 to 78 3 compared to initial when aeration was considered and to 60 3 compared to initial at ph 12 these were unexpected results compared to what is current reported in the literature air scouring may serve as an additional contribution for reversible fouling removal as it induces shear stress over the fouling layer responsible for its removal 15 however it could have promoted the oxidizing agent volatilization leading to antagonistic effects when these two strategies were combined most probably their performance for permeability restoration could be better obtained if considered separately other alternatives to improve the contribution of air scouring in mbr membranes cleaning could be also a higher cross flow velocity and shear stress bubbles of greater size different bubble shape and diffusers location and geometry 4 as for aeration it is expected from greater ph values a better efficiency for organic fouling removal 31 however the greater detachment rate and dissolution of the fouling layer at greater sodium hypochlorite concentrations most probably increase the suspended foulants in the bulk solution at greater ph conditions these compounds and microorganisms may disintegrate into fine particles and or soluble organic matter 31 which ultimately may be blocking the uf membrane pores and lead to irreversible fouling that hypothesis points out to antagonistic effects when greater concentrations of sodium hypochlorite and ph conditions are considered and requires an in depth investigation nevertheless it should explain the lower efficiency of permeability recovery at greater ph values 3 2 effect of chemical cleaning onto membrane lifespan 3 2 1 effects on hydraulic permeability the three membranes i citric acid followed by sodium hypochlorite ii oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite 22 1 c and iii oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite 40 1 c were subjected to a sequence of 38 cleaning cycles the behavior of this exposure to cleaning agents was monitored by the membrane hydraulic permeability and the results are shown in fig 7 the normalized flux for the membranes i and ii decreased linearly with the increase in cleaning cycles and thus with exposure to sodium hypochlorite the spearman correlation between the permeability and the exposure to the cleaning agents showed that both membranes i rs 0 974 p 0 001 and ii rs 0 810 p 0 001 significantly reduce their normalized flux when continuously exposed to the cleaning agents the membrane iii however showed no significant correlation with the cleaning cycles rs 0 223 p 0 179 the results from section 3 1 showed that the cleaning efficiency with oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite at 40 c is higher than the same system cleaned at room temperature conditions of greater temperature also contribute to alterations in membrane morphology elongating its pores 32 that would explain the increase in membrane iii flux after different cleaning cycles that were later fouled and followed a similar pattern observed for membranes i and ii nonetheless this higher efficiency observed for membrane iii does not translate into a lower lifespan the decline in membrane permeability and thus in normalized flux along with the exposure to sodium hypochlorite has been documented 30 as an example hajibabania et al 33 reported a similar behavior when pvdf membranes were exposed to sodium hypochlorite the authors attributed the decline in permeability to changes in membrane pore size the difference in the decrease of normalized flux from the membrane i 97 6 exposed to 59 500 ppm h of citric acid and 380 000 ppm h of sodium hypochlorite to membrane ii 82 6 exposed to 15 352 ppm h of oxalic acid and 380 000 ppm h of sodium hypochlorite can be associated with the chemical structure of the cleaning agent citric acid has three carboxyl groups in its chemical structure while oxalic acid has two the higher content of carboxyl groups in the citric acid may have led to a reaction at a higher extent leading to a higher content of this functional group on the membrane surface reducing its normalized flux due to the pore size reduction 3 2 2 membrane surface fig 8 shows sem images from the membrane surface after the first and 38th cleaning cycles the results in fig 8 shows that the membrane surface structure becomes more homogeneous along with the cleaning cycles such changes reinforce the hypothesis previously considered that exposure to chemical cleaning agents leads to structural changes on the membrane surface which influences the permeability besides that more evident morphological changes between the three membranes were not detected which means that other effects at a sub microscopic scale are playing a role in the reduction of permeability nonetheless degradation of the chlorinated polyethylene is expected only at higher temperatures klarić et al 34 showed that only at 240 c that this polymer which constitutes the membrane starts to degrade 3 2 3 thermogravimetric infrared spectroscopy and contact angle analysis tga ftir fig 9 and contact angles analysis fig 10 were performed to better understand possible alterations in the membrane s polymeric matrix after being exposed to oxalic acid and sodium hypochlorite at 40 c the thermal decomposition profile in fig 9a shows a non single step degradation with two main events starting at 250 dehydrochlorination and 400 c polymer matrix degradation 35 independently from the cleaning cycle which suggests that there were no significant changes in the membranes thermal resistance the greater weight loss and the differences observed after 500 c could be attributed to the presence of residual inorganic matter from oxalic acid and sodium hypochlorite that may have accumulated over the membrane along with the cleaning cycles this effect can be seen in the derivate weight loss which shows peaks of higher intensity higher weight loss for all major events from the ftir spectrum it is possible to denote different peaks which correspond to different functional groups related to the membrane polymer pe c chlorinated polyethylene additives and cleaning agents the ch 2 70 cm 1 ccl 609 cm 1 and ch2 1460 cm 1 peaks can be attributed to the membrane polymer the peak at 1729 cm 1 c o can be associated with a common additive on membranes the polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp used for enhancing membrane hydrophilicity lastly the peak at 3430 cm 1 can be associated with the oh stretching from the reactions that occur between the cleaning agent and the membrane surface furthermore the ftir shows that there was no change in functional groups on the membrane surface i e shifts on peaks new peaks nonetheless the intensity of each peak was increasing over the number of cleaning cycles since the ftir analysis was carried out under the same blank the peak intensity can be indicative of the abundance of each bond thus it can be stated that along with cleaning cycles the interaction between the cleaning agent and membrane surface increases the content of most bonds and functional groups which corroborates with the tga results the contact angle θ is an important parameter for determining the membrane surface hydrophilic properties pristine uf membranes usually have a contact angle between 30 and 90 36 which means a high affinity for water 37 furthermore highly hydrophilic membrane surfaces have been discovered to attract a tightly bound water layer which reduces membrane foulant hydrophobic interactions and thus reduces membrane fouling 38 in this study the contact angle increased over the cleaning cycles from 99 to 112 fig 10 which means that the membrane surface started to become hydrophobic more prone to fouling and reduced flux which can explain the decline in membrane permeability similar results were reported by phuntsho et al 37 when an autopsy of a 10 year old polypropylene pp hollow fiber microfiltration membrane from the sydney olympic park water reclamation plant was carried out 3 2 4 theoretical membrane lifespan estimation if we consider that an operating facility could work with up to 50 of permeability decline without expressive alterations of its productive capacity 24 the uf membranes would tolerate 32 cleaning cycles as demonstrated by the empirical results in fig 7 if the membranes were cleaned every three months their expected lifespan would correspond to approximately eight years for membranes cleaned with oxalic acid ph 2 5 and sodium hypochlorite 5000 ppm at 40 c the life span for pvdf membranes was also estimated by fenu et al 24 for mbr operations based on the same concept the authors reported a membrane lifespan of 11 6 years assuming a permeability decline of 62 our estimations though were based on chemical degradation effects only and did not consider a possible membrane degradation by operational conditions wastewater and sludge properties which also affect the membrane lifespan the bench scale results were still promising and appropriate to define a proper cleaning protocol that was applied in a pilot mbr operation treating refinery wastewater 3 3 cleaning protocol applied to pilot mbr operation the pilot hydraulic permeability of the mbr along 1841 days is shown in fig 11 and photos of the plate and frame pilot scale module are shown in fig s1 supplementary material the maximum permeability curve is where the highest permeabilities due to efficient cleanings or low fouling are denoted similarly the lowest permeability curve is where the lowest permeabilities due to inefficient cleanings or high fouling are denoted from this figure it can be noted that the fouling potential increases over time as the time between operations at low and high permeability is gradually reduced which leads to more frequent chemical cleanings the increased need for chemical cleaning is likely to influence these results according to costa et al 39 membrane exposure to chemical agents can lead to a decrease in permeability besides organic and inorganic fouling the estimative of membrane lifespan can be carried out by these two previously mentioned curves highest and lowest permeabilities curve as these two curves follow the permeability they converge to a common point which represents the membrane lifespan a point which chemical cleaning will not be able to restore the membrane permeability this point was found after approximately 1916 days of monitoring which would be about five years from that point on filtration is still theoretically possible but the pressure required to promote a stable is high not operationally viable fenu et al 24 estimated that the membrane lifespan in full scale mbrs treating municipal wastewater was upwards of 10 years this difference in estimated lifespan can be attributed to the higher complexity of the refinery wastewater thus it is highlighted the importance of determining the best cleaning procedure and estimate the membrane lifespan for each application 4 final considerations in order to extend the use of mbr for industrial wastewater treatment it is important to establish stable operating conditions which include appropriate management of membranes permeability from all chemical cleaning protocols oxalic acid ph 2 5 followed by sodium hypochlorite 5000 ppm at 40 c was the most effective in restoring the membrane permeability the greater performance not necessarily implied in a lower membrane lifespan in fact membranes subjected to this cleaning procedure had no substantial impact on its morphology and thermal resistance maintaining its permeability up to 32 chemical cleaning cycles the cleaning protocols were validated in a pilot system employed for refinery wastewater treatment suggesting that the membrane would have a lifespan of approximately five years however this is not a defined protocol and in depth studies of each treatment system are required as the cleaning

reached 100 l m2 h bar 2 1 1 membranes for the cleaning trials fouled membranes were removed from the module cut into a rectangular shape 0 152 0 071 m 0 0108 m2 and placed in an acrylic module for hydraulic permeability and flux determination the membranes were stored in a container with deionized water before and after each analysis 2 1 2 hydraulic permeability determination the tests for hydraulic permeability were carried out after membranes compaction at 0 59 bar with a recirculation flow rate of 3 2 l min an initial membrane compaction ensures that the variations in hydraulic permeability after exposure to chemical cleaning agents will depend only on the polymer chemical alterations and not on the membrane mechanical deformation permeate flux was determined by the time required for 20 ml filtration of deionized water measured in a graduated cylinder for these experiments the feed cross flow was set at 3 2 l h maintaining the temperature constant at 22 1 c membrane permeability was measured before and after each chemical treatment for comparative purposes the permeability recovery η after cleaning in relation to the nominal permeability provided by the manufacturer 800 l m2h bar was estimated by eqs 1 2 where lp l m2h bar corresponds to the empirical permeability 1 η total 100 1 l p cleaned l p fouled 2 η related to new 100 l p cleaned 800 the permeate flux l m2h and the transmembrane pressure applied 0 59 0 49 0 39 and 0 29 bar were fitted by a linear regression where the angular coefficient represented the membrane permeability 2 1 3 cleaning agents and sequence three fouled membranes were used for preliminary trials identified as s 1 s 2 and s 3 these membranes came from the same fouled membrane sheet the first s 1 naocl ca was washed for 2 h with sodium hypochlorite naocl 5000 ppm and then for 2 h with citric acid ph 2 5 in the second s 2 ca naocl the same process was used but with the reverse cleaning sequence citric acid followed by hypochlorite the third membrane s 3 oa naocl was cleaned with oxalic acid ph 2 5 for 2 h and then with naocl 5000 ppm also for 2 h a recirculation flow of 3 2 l min was considered in all cleaning procedures for each cleaning cycle a membrane sample was collected to analyze the cleaning effects over its morphology and the fouling agents composition by scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6360lv and dispersive energy spectroscopy eds these samples were collected at three distinctive moments for fouled membrane and after each cleaning process 2 1 4 cleaning protocol establishment different cleaning conditions were tested after the cleaning sequence and acid agent were defined the membranes exposure time 2 h and the recirculation flow rate 3 2 l min were kept the same whereas the temperature aeration naocl concentration and ph varied as described in fig 1 sodium percarbonate 500 2000 ppm in a single stage cleaning process and dodecyl sulfate 500 ppm ph 12 after cleaned with oxalic acid ph 2 5 were also investigated the hydraulic permeability was defined as a response variable for each cleaning process and the membranes subjected to the most efficient cleaning process were evaluated by sem and eds 2 2 cleaning effects on membrane lifespan pristine membranes fouling free were considered for these experiments for a better assessment of the chemical agents effect over membrane lifespan the membranes were separated into three pairs each pair was subjected to the same cleaning process one of the membranes used for permeability measurements and the other separated for characterization of its integrity by sem thermogravimetric analysis tga fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy ftir and contact angle upon exposure 2 2 1 membrane cleaning and exposure the first pair of membranes were subjected to a cleaning protocol with citric acid followed by sodium hypochlorite the second and third membrane pairs were cleaned with oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite at room temperature 22 1 c and 40 1 c in a water bath respectively the cleaning sequence was determined after preliminary trials previously described in section 2 1 3 the membranes were first immersed in the acid citric or oxalic ph 2 5 then immersed in sodium hypochlorite solution 5000 ppm for another 2 h each measuring the membrane permeability before and after each cleaning agent exposure the cleaning cycles repeated until the membrane permeability was compromised the membranes integrity was evaluated periodically by sem tga perkin elmer tga 7 heating rate 10 c min from 25 to 1000 c under a nitrogen atmosphere 50 ml min ftir shimadzu prestige 21 and atr module a range of 400 to 4000 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 0 and contact angle θ sessile drop method using a goniometer sca20 version 2 dataphysics solvent deionized water at 23 c the values were taken in triplicate 3 results and discussions 3 1 cleaning sequence and agents for mbr membranes 3 1 1 cleaning sequence fig 2 brings the permeability results of the membranes s 1 naocl ca s 2 ca naocl and s 3 oa naocl before and after each cleaning procedure an effective cleaning process depends on six different mass transfer steps 4 25 the cleaning agent must undergo a series of bulk reactions hydrolysis and other after being introduced 1 then transported to the membrane surface 2 the cleaning agent then interacts with the foulant layer 3 and starts to solubilize and detach foulants 4 the waste cleaning agent with suspended foulants is transported to the fouling layer interface 5 and finally to the bulk solution 6 the permeability recovery was greater when the membrane was first subjected to acid cleaning most probably due to inorganic fouling or inorganic substances inlaid with the organic material after the inorganic fouling was removed the organic fraction is exposed to sodium hypochlorite favoring a higher interaction with the cleaning agent their solubilization and detachment which ultimately increases the cleaning efficiency a first deposition of organic materials is expected and in accordance with conceptual models for fouling formation 26 the foulant agents and the membrane surface interact mainly through hydrophobic attraction which tends to occur preferentially between the higher molecular weight compounds proteins polysaccharides humic acids and other substances either soluble or colloidal and biosolids microorganisms within the wastewater and biological medium and the membrane surface 4 26 afterward inorganic deposition may occur to a lower extent indeed an acid oxidant sequence as oxalic acid sodium hypochlorite seems to have a greater performance compared to the opposite oxidant acid for cleaning membranes used for industrial wastewater treatment recognized for their high content of organic matter 27 however this is not a defined protocol and in depth studies of each treatment system are required as the cleaning sequence remains governed by the feed wastewater quality and foulant types compared to citric acid oxalic acid showed a better efficiency for permeability recovery 86 2 and 90 5 respectively as seen in fig 2 and the microscopy analysis in fig 3 the best efficiency for the acid hypochlorite cleaning sequence was also confirmed by microscopy analysis fig 3 which reveals a lower fouling extension for s 2 ca naocl and s 3 oa naocl over the membrane surface after each cleaning cycle similarly liikanen et al 28 also reported a better performance for flux recovery when oxalic acid 0 2 wt was compared to citric acid 1 6 wt for cleaning nf255 membranes used for drinking water treatment the expectation of inorganic depositions covering the membrane surface was confirmed by eds spectra fig 4 corresponding to eds spectra for fouled and after cleaning procedure for membranes s 1 naocl ca s 2 ca naocl and s 3 oa naocl reveals that inorganic materials were indeed present at fouled membranes after an acid cleaning it is noticed a greater reduction in ions such as iron calcium and phosphorus with peaks of lower intensity for spectra corresponding to s 2 ca naocl and s 3 oa naocl compared to s 1 naocl ca spectra 3 1 2 cleaning protocol establishment after the cleaning sequence and the acid agent were defined oxalic acid sodium hypochlorite experiments were carried out under different temperatures ph and concentrations and the results for permeability recovery were presented in fig 5 besides these cleaning agents sodium percarbonate 500 2000 ppm in a single stage cleaning process and dodecyl sulfate 500 ppm ph 12 after cleaned with oxalic acid ph 2 5 were also investigated however demonstrated no contributions for permeability restoration 3 for that reason the results were omitted and focused on the cleaning agents and conditions with greater performance it is observed that oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite at 40 c was able to recover 92 7 of the initial permeability after cleaning protocol 2285 l m2h bar and 293 recovery compared to the nominal permeability informed by the manufacture from all experimental conditions that was the one with greater performance for permeability recovery the improvement in cleaning performance at higher cleaning temperatures 40 c was also described by wang et al 4 at higher temperatures chemical oxidation kinetics increases exponentially as well as the diffusion rate of the cleaning agents within the fouled layer and membrane polymeric matrix 4 it is thus possible to remove more foulant materials from the membrane surface or from the membrane pores at 40 c for mild fouling conditions heating is not always the best cost effective alternative however the strategy becomes interesting at more intense and severe fouling from the different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite tested 5000 ppm showed a greater performance for permeability recovery 85 2 compared to the initial permeability and 100 compared to the nominal higher sodium hypochlorite concentrations favor bulk reactions and the cleaning agent diffusion towards the fouling layer which explains the results observed however higher concentrations could increase the membrane hydrophilicity lower contact angle and reduce its tensile strength undesired aftereffects that may reduce its lifespan 29 30 the efficiency of oxalic acid hypochlorite at 40 c for membrane cleaning was visualized by sem images fig 6 obtained at different magnifications 1500 and 7000 it can be observed an efficiency in the scaling layer removal that was initially present on the membrane surface for the same sodium hypochlorite concentration 5000 ppm but different conditions aeration and ph 12 the cleaning efficiency decreased from 85 2 to 78 3 compared to initial when aeration was considered and to 60 3 compared to initial at ph 12 these were unexpected results compared to what is current reported in the literature air scouring may serve as an additional contribution for reversible fouling removal as it induces shear stress over the fouling layer responsible for its removal 15 however it could have promoted the oxidizing agent volatilization leading to antagonistic effects when these two strategies were combined most probably their performance for permeability restoration could be better obtained if considered separately other alternatives to improve the contribution of air scouring in mbr membranes cleaning could be also a higher cross flow velocity and shear stress bubbles of greater size different bubble shape and diffusers location and geometry 4 as for aeration it is expected from greater ph values a better efficiency for organic fouling removal 31 however the greater detachment rate and dissolution of the fouling layer at greater sodium hypochlorite concentrations most probably increase the suspended foulants in the bulk solution at greater ph conditions these compounds and microorganisms may disintegrate into fine particles and or soluble organic matter 31 which ultimately may be blocking the uf membrane pores and lead to irreversible fouling that hypothesis points out to antagonistic effects when greater concentrations of sodium hypochlorite and ph conditions are considered and requires an in depth investigation nevertheless it should explain the lower efficiency of permeability recovery at greater ph values 3 2 effect of chemical cleaning onto membrane lifespan 3 2 1 effects on hydraulic permeability the three membranes i citric acid followed by sodium hypochlorite ii oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite 22 1 c and iii oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite 40 1 c were subjected to a sequence of 38 cleaning cycles the behavior of this exposure to cleaning agents was monitored by the membrane hydraulic permeability and the results are shown in fig 7 the normalized flux for the membranes i and ii decreased linearly with the increase in cleaning cycles and thus with exposure to sodium hypochlorite the spearman correlation between the permeability and the exposure to the cleaning agents showed that both membranes i rs 0 974 p 0 001 and ii rs 0 810 p 0 001 significantly reduce their normalized flux when continuously exposed to the cleaning agents the membrane iii however showed no significant correlation with the cleaning cycles rs 0 223 p 0 179 the results from section 3 1 showed that the cleaning efficiency with oxalic acid followed by sodium hypochlorite at 40 c is higher than the same system cleaned at room temperature conditions of greater temperature also contribute to alterations in membrane morphology elongating its pores 32 that would explain the increase in membrane iii flux after different cleaning cycles that were later fouled and followed a similar pattern observed for membranes i and ii nonetheless this higher efficiency observed for membrane iii does not translate into a lower lifespan the decline in membrane permeability and thus in normalized flux along with the exposure to sodium hypochlorite has been documented 30 as an example hajibabania et al 33 reported a similar behavior when pvdf membranes were exposed to sodium hypochlorite the authors attributed the decline in permeability to changes in membrane pore size the difference in the decrease of normalized flux from the membrane i 97 6 exposed to 59 500 ppm h of citric acid and 380 000 ppm h of sodium hypochlorite to membrane ii 82 6 exposed to 15 352 ppm h of oxalic acid and 380 000 ppm h of sodium hypochlorite can be associated with the chemical structure of the cleaning agent citric acid has three carboxyl groups in its chemical structure while oxalic acid has two the higher content of carboxyl groups in the citric acid may have led to a reaction at a higher extent leading to a higher content of this functional group on the membrane surface reducing its normalized flux due to the pore size reduction 3 2 2 membrane surface fig 8 shows sem images from the membrane surface after the first and 38th cleaning cycles the results in fig 8 shows that the membrane surface structure becomes more homogeneous along with the cleaning cycles such changes reinforce the hypothesis previously considered that exposure to chemical cleaning agents leads to structural changes on the membrane surface which influences the permeability besides that more evident morphological changes between the three membranes were not detected which means that other effects at a sub microscopic scale are playing a role in the reduction of permeability nonetheless degradation of the chlorinated polyethylene is expected only at higher temperatures klarić et al 34 showed that only at 240 c that this polymer which constitutes the membrane starts to degrade 3 2 3 thermogravimetric infrared spectroscopy and contact angle analysis tga ftir fig 9 and contact angles analysis fig 10 were performed to better understand possible alterations in the membrane s polymeric matrix after being exposed to oxalic acid and sodium hypochlorite at 40 c the thermal decomposition profile in fig 9a shows a non single step degradation with two main events starting at 250 dehydrochlorination and 400 c polymer matrix degradation 35 independently from the cleaning cycle which suggests that there were no significant changes in the membranes thermal resistance the greater weight loss and the differences observed after 500 c could be attributed to the presence of residual inorganic matter from oxalic acid and sodium hypochlorite that may have accumulated over the membrane along with the cleaning cycles this effect can be seen in the derivate weight loss which shows peaks of higher intensity higher weight loss for all major events from the ftir spectrum it is possible to denote different peaks which correspond to different functional groups related to the membrane polymer pe c chlorinated polyethylene additives and cleaning agents the ch 2 70 cm 1 ccl 609 cm 1 and ch2 1460 cm 1 peaks can be attributed to the membrane polymer the peak at 1729 cm 1 c o can be associated with a common additive on membranes the polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp used for enhancing membrane hydrophilicity lastly the peak at 3430 cm 1 can be associated with the oh stretching from the reactions that occur between the cleaning agent and the membrane surface furthermore the ftir shows that there was no change in functional groups on the membrane surface i e shifts on peaks new peaks nonetheless the intensity of each peak was increasing over the number of cleaning cycles since the ftir analysis was carried out under the same blank the peak intensity can be indicative of the abundance of each bond thus it can be stated that along with cleaning cycles the interaction between the cleaning agent and membrane surface increases the content of most bonds and functional groups which corroborates with the tga results the contact angle θ is an important parameter for determining the membrane surface hydrophilic properties pristine uf membranes usually have a contact angle between 30 and 90 36 which means a high affinity for water 37 furthermore highly hydrophilic membrane surfaces have been discovered to attract a tightly bound water layer which reduces membrane foulant hydrophobic interactions and thus reduces membrane fouling 38 in this study the contact angle increased over the cleaning cycles from 99 to 112 fig 10 which means that the membrane surface started to become hydrophobic more prone to fouling and reduced flux which can explain the decline in membrane permeability similar results were reported by phuntsho et al 37 when an autopsy of a 10 year old polypropylene pp hollow fiber microfiltration membrane from the sydney olympic park water reclamation plant was carried out 3 2 4 theoretical membrane lifespan estimation if we consider that an operating facility could work with up to 50 of permeability decline without expressive alterations of its productive capacity 24 the uf membranes would tolerate 32 cleaning cycles as demonstrated by the empirical results in fig 7 if the membranes were cleaned every three months their expected lifespan would correspond to approximately eight years for membranes cleaned with oxalic acid ph 2 5 and sodium hypochlorite 5000 ppm at 40 c the life span for pvdf membranes was also estimated by fenu et al 24 for mbr operations based on the same concept the authors reported a membrane lifespan of 11 6 years assuming a permeability decline of 62 our estimations though were based on chemical degradation effects only and did not consider a possible membrane degradation by operational conditions wastewater and sludge properties which also affect the membrane lifespan the bench scale results were still promising and appropriate to define a proper cleaning protocol that was applied in a pilot mbr operation treating refinery wastewater 3 3 cleaning protocol applied to pilot mbr operation the pilot hydraulic permeability of the mbr along 1841 days is shown in fig 11 and photos of the plate and frame pilot scale module are shown in fig s1 supplementary material the maximum permeability curve is where the highest permeabilities due to efficient cleanings or low fouling are denoted similarly the lowest permeability curve is where the lowest permeabilities due to inefficient cleanings or high fouling are denoted from this figure it can be noted that the fouling potential increases over time as the time between operations at low and high permeability is gradually reduced which leads to more frequent chemical cleanings the increased need for chemical cleaning is likely to influence these results according to costa et al 39 membrane exposure to chemical agents can lead to a decrease in permeability besides organic and inorganic fouling the estimative of membrane lifespan can be carried out by these two previously mentioned curves highest and lowest permeabilities curve as these two curves follow the permeability they converge to a common point which represents the membrane lifespan a point which chemical cleaning will not be able to restore the membrane permeability this point was found after approximately 1916 days of monitoring which would be about five years from that point on filtration is still theoretically possible but the pressure required to promote a stable is high not operationally viable fenu et al 24 estimated that the membrane lifespan in full scale mbrs treating municipal wastewater was upwards of 10 years this difference in estimated lifespan can be attributed to the higher complexity of the refinery wastewater thus it is highlighted the importance of determining the best cleaning procedure and estimate the membrane lifespan for each application 4 final considerations in order to extend the use of mbr for industrial wastewater treatment it is important to establish stable operating conditions which include appropriate management of membranes permeability from all chemical cleaning protocols oxalic acid ph 2 5 followed by sodium hypochlorite 5000 ppm at 40 c was the most effective in restoring the membrane permeability the greater performance not necessarily implied in a lower membrane lifespan in fact membranes subjected to this cleaning procedure had no substantial impact on its morphology and thermal resistance maintaining its permeability up to 32 chemical cleaning cycles the cleaning protocols were validated in a pilot system employed for refinery wastewater treatment suggesting that the membrane would have a lifespan of approximately five years however this is not a defined protocol and in depth studies of each treatment system are required as the cleaning

13316,the relationship between turbidity t and ultraviolet c uvc disinfection is still not clearly understood as well as no attention has been paid to the contribution of natural organic matter nom the present work assessed the influence of particulate and nom on the uvc disinfection efficiency in terms of e coli and ms2 removal at bench collimated beam cb and flow uvc systems both in the laboratory and in the field colombia the flow uvc reactor was installed as part of a household water treatment hwt system consisting of filtration uvc disinfection tests were performed according to the who standards using fine test dust humic acid ha and ms2 and e coli as microbiological indicators cb results showed a significant decrease in the inactivation rate of ms2 in the presence of small concentrations of ha 3 5 mg l with killing dose increasing a 65 vs non significant effects of turbidity in the range of 0 20 ntu following the same trend in flow uvc tests the inactivation efficiency of ms2 decreased solely in the presence of ha at the same ha concentration and flow rate an increase in turbidity of 17 6 ntu showed a negligible effect conversely in the presence of ha uvt254 dropped from 88 7 0 mg l ha to 73 3 reducing ms2 inactivation by 1 2 log units finally the hwt system could be classified as protective working at flow rates 5 l min however in the presence of 3 5 mg l ha uvt254 75 it presented a limited protection for viruses keywords uvc disinfection turbidity humic acid ms2 drinking water 1 introduction uvc irradiation was first used for water treatment in 1910 1 despite at that time the use of chemical disinfection was generally extended 2 3 uvc irradiation started to gain more attention due to its effectiveness against all waterborne pathogens including cysts of cryptosporidium and giardia and because of in contrast to many of the chemical disinfectants it imparts no taste and odour to the water in addition uvc light does not present risk as a result of overdosing or formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps 4 5 research studies on uvc water disinfection are mainly focused on assessing the effective uvc dose for viruses bacteria and protozoan inactivation which have been widely studied and described in the literature 6 16 these works have shown that while viruses and bacteria spores are the most uvc resistant pathogens vegetative bacteria cells and cysts of giardia and cryptosporidium are more susceptible with lower fluence requirements 17 18 the united states environmental protection agency usepa indicated a required delivery uvc dose of 40 mj cm2 to deal with most of the viruses and spores 18 water quality plays a fundamental role on the uvc disinfection efficiency affecting the transmission of uvc light uvt to the target microorganisms 18 uvt at the wavelength of 254 nm uvt254 is the main water quality parameter used to define uvc disinfection performance 18 uvt254 is affected by scattering and absorbance of uvc light in water so that while particulates and colloidal matter shields pathogens from disinfection and scatters light the dissolved organic fraction absorbs the uvc light as it passes through the water 19 in continuous flow systems dose delivery is not only affected by water quality but also by the flow rate uvc output from the lamp the uvc light distribution inside the reactor chamber and by the reactor hydrodynamics which in turn is affected by its dimensions internal configuration and the flow rate 20 in centralized treatment plants for uvc disinfection systems operation uvc output from the lamp is usually monitored by uvc sensors to measure uvc intensity uvci two approaches are used for uvc systems operation the uvci set point approach which relies on uvci readings to change the lamp output in response to changes in uvci and flow rate 18 and the calculated dose approach in which the required uvc dose is estimated using a dose monitoring algorithm 18 21 that sets the lamp output to maintain the required dose under varying conditions of flow rate and water quality however for point of use uvc reactors usually not equipped with advance monitoring sensors or regulable intensity outputs flow rate is the utmost importance to maintain the required dose 18 lower flow rates allow longer contact time in the reactor and thus higher uvc doses commercial uvc reactors are designed to treat a maximum flow of water and it is usually listed in the product specification as well in the development of new point of use reactors uvc fluence vs flow rate is usually assessed for the system validation and to define its operation conditions 22 24 on the other hand regarding the impact of water quality on uvc efficiency supplementary treatment process might be required upstream to clarify water and significantly improve uvc inactivation such process might include filtration and coagulation to reduce the particulate and organic fraction 18 although flow uvc reactors are widely used very few works investigate the effect of water quality from an optical point of view on uvc disinfection efficiency 25 in this regard hijnen et al 17 reviewed and compared the results of studies carried out with different water sources under similar conditions cb tests strains and uvc dose to assess the effect of water quality from this work when comparing oppenheimer et al 26 and watercare 27 works which were carried out with the secondary effluent of wastewater treatment plants with studies testing deionized tap water 6 8 12 15 28 32 a lower inactivation rate was observed in the secondary effluent than in drinking water in contrast the comparison of data from thompson et al 33 working with secondary effluents showed no inactivation decrease in poliovirus and adenovirus when comparing their inactivation in drinking water in addition no effects of turbidity ranging from 0 2 ntu to 5 3 ntu were observed in poliovirus and ms2 inactivation in batch conditions 33 this was recently confirmed by baldasso et al 34 who showed non significant effect of turbidity 0 5 ntu on ms2 uvc inactivation vs the critical effect of ha 3 5 mg l reducing the inactivation rate of ms2 by 40 in addition no synergistic effects between both parameters at those levels were found 34 under flow conditions it was determined that the uvc disinfection performance of ms2 and e coli was not affected for turbidity 30 ntu and total organic carbon toc 2 mg l 35 36 while turbidity values up to 80 ntu in deionized water and unfiltered natural water sources with values ranging from 2 0 to 22 7 ntu decreased the effectiveness of uvc disinfection as turbidity of the water source increased 37 38 moreover cheng et al 39 results evaluating an individual unit of a photocatalytic membrane reactor equipped with a uvc lamp showed that the irradiation time to get 5 49 lrv of the bacteriophage f2 increased from 54 s at 0 mg l of ha to 85 s at 10 mg l this was attributed to uvc light absorption by ha up to date works assessing the performance of hwt systems based on uvc disinfection or proprietary uvc reactors usually report on turbidity 33 35 36 38 but no analysis or investigations are carried out about the complexity of natural water sources which interfere with uvc radiation in the water matrix and may have a critical role on the efficiency of uvc disinfection despite turbidity has generally been found to adversely affect uvc treatment as it increases 38 the relationship between turbidity and uvc disinfection is not clearly understood at this stage the role of nom always present in environmental surface water has to be also considered as nom modifies turbidity and certainly absorbs light at the uvc wavelengths 26 39 this would be of great importance not only for conventional uvc disinfection applications but also for other emerging water treatment technologies based on the use of uvc including photocatalysis uv h2o2 and the use of uv leds the present work has been developed within the frame of the safewater project gcrf ukri safewater project as part of the design sizing and performance assessment of a hwt system developed and constructed to treat and provide the daily safe water needs for a family in isolated communities of developing countries technological solutions for safe drinking water have a significant potential to address the sdg 6 set by the

is directly and indirectly linked to sdg 1 no poverty sdg 3 good health and well being sdg 5 gender equality and sdg 11 sustainable cities and communities 40 the who international scheme to evaluate

indicators escherichia coli and ms2 bacteriophage in different water quality matrices varying suspended particulate and nom concentrations and operating conditions flow rate and filtration efficiency prior to disinfection to ensure it delivers safe drinking water 2 methodology 2 1 research approach the flow uvc reactor was tested as part of the hwt system consisting of filtration followed by uvc disinfection which was designed to provide safe drinking water in rural communities of mexico and colombia to achieve this firstly the uvc inactivation rate of target microorganisms was assessed through cb tests the uvc doses determined were then confirmed in the flow uvc system at ulster university facilities uk using synthetic water and in the field in rural communities of antioquia colombia using natural water sources for this the who scheme for evaluation of hwt technologies performance 41 was used to determine if the water treatment is either highly protective 4 log reduction

same day of experimentation using a2 fine test dust manufactured by powder technology inc and humic acid sodium salt sigma aldrich test dust is the most used particulate standard to assess filter media and particulate contamination the particles size and chemical makeup of a2 fine test dust is specified by iso 12103 1 42 and its use is recommended by the who to simulate turbidity occurring in natural water 43 on the other hand ha comprises the largest fraction of the nom in natural water 44 and it is commonly used to simulate the dissolved organic fraction of natural surface waters according to who hwt performance testing scheme 41 water matrices with concentrations of 0 and 3 5 mg l of ha and turbidity levels up to 40 10 ntu were selected to test uvc disinfection efficiency these chemicals were suspended test dust or dissolved ha by mechanical stirring in milli q water for all disinfection experiments in the cb and in dechlorinated tap water left out for 24 h for flow system tests in the laboratory 2 3 microorganisms growth and enumeration escherichia coli and ms2 bacteriophage were used as microbiological indicators to test the efficiency of this technology following the who scheme to evaluate hwt systems performance 41 ms2 highly uvc resistant is generally used as a viral surrogate while e coli is the most common faecal indicator analysed in drinking water as well as in disinfection studies and protocols in addition e coli is the indicator established by the who for the verification of the microbiological quality of water intended for human consumption 45 escherichia coli atcc 11229 ms2 atcc 155987 b1 and its e coli host atcc 15597 were obtained from atcc an overnight culture of e coli atcc 11229 concentration of 1012 cfu ml and a ms2 stock solution concentration of 1012 pfu ml were spiked into test water obtaining an initial concentration of 105 cfu ml for e coli and 106 pfu ml for ms2 the overnight cultures of e coli atcc 11229 and e coli host atcc 15597 were prepared from glycerol master stock solutions stored at 80 c first each strain from the master stock solutions was sowing in chromocult coliform agar merck millipore plates which were incubated at 36 2 c for 21 3 h then a single blue colony from each chromocult plate was transferred to falcon tubes containing 15 ml of tryptone soya broth media tsb oxoid the tubes were incubated at 36 2 c for 12 h in a shaker incubator 200 rpm afterwards the liquid suspension was centrifuged at 4 000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was replaced by phosphate borate saline pbs solution oxoid obtaining an e coli atcc 11229 and e coli host atcc 15597 concentration of 1012 cfu ml the membrane filtration technique was employed for the detection and enumeration of escherichia coli samples were filtered in triplicate through cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 45 μm and then transferred to petri dishes with the suitable growth media chromocult coliform agar petri dishes were incubated at 36 2 c for 21 3 h and dark blue to violet colonies were enumerated as e coli with a detection limit of 1 cfu 100 ml ms2 was analysed in triplicate following the double layer agar method 46 a glycerol stock solution of ms2 kept frosted at 80 c and an overnight culture of e coli host were used to perform the experiment for ms2 detection and enumeration 1 ml of sample and 100 μl of e coli host from an overnight culture were poured into bijou tubes with melted sloppy agar this was prepared with tsb and bacteriological agar no 1 oxoid the content of the bijou tubes was poured into tryptone soya agar tsa plates oxoid and then incubated at 36 2 c for 21 3 h lytic plaques were enumerated as ms2 with a detection limit of 1 pfu ml positive controls were performed to ensure stability of ms2 and e coli atcc 11229 cultures during the experimental time for this reason the working solution of ms2 and e coli atcc 11229 was plated at the beginning and at the end of the experiment the negative controls were prepared as follows pbs solution pbs solution and e coli host ms2 working solution e coli atcc 11229 working solution and water matrix to ensure no material bacteria virus and host contamination the disinfection efficiency of the target microorganisms was calculated as follow eq 1 1 lrv log n 0 log n t log 10 n 0 n t where lrv represents the log reduction value obtained after a specific uvc irradiation time n0 is the microorganisms concentration cfu or pfu ml at the initial time and nt is the microorganisms concentration cfu or pfu ml at time t 2 4 collimated beam tests collimated beam cb experiments were performed with a 12 w uvc low pressure mercury lamp monochromatic at 254 nm to investigate the effects of turbidity test dust and organic matter ha on the uvc inactivation of the target microorganisms lamp intensity was measured with a spectroradiometer ocean optics spectroradiometer flms 14462 with an operating range from 200 to 800 nm and an optical resolution of 1 5 nm located at the centre of the surface of the sample obtaining a value of 0 231 mw cm2 the uvc lamp was initially warmed up for 5 min to ensure a relatively stable output a vessel was placed on the horizontal surface beneath the collimated beam system constructed following the standard guidelines 47 it was composed of a 55 cm long cylindric glass tube covered with black paper to assure only vertical incident radiation would arrive to the sample surface and retained vertically in place by a metallic holder the sample was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirring apparatus and a small stirring bar without creating any vortex while exposing the test solution to uvc light the solution volume was 100 ml the vertical path length of the water in the vessel 5 2 cm and the vertical distance from the lamp to the top of the test solution 38 cm e coli response was evaluated in milli q water while ms2 was assessed at different test dust turbidity and ha concentrations experiments with ms2 were carried out at three turbidity levels 0 5 and 20 ntu and two ha concentrations 0 and 3 5 mg l in milli q water table 1 initial concentration of e coli was 105 cfu ml and ms2 was 106 pfu ml twelve uvc dose values were applied between 0 and 320 mj cm2 corresponding to exposure times ranging from 0 to 23 min samples of 1 ml were collected from the vessel after each exposure time and analysed to determine microorganism concentration the effective uvc dose response was calculated by correcting the measured irradiance as proposed by bolton and linden 47 who provided a standardized method to determine uvc doses in bench scale collimated beam apparatus reliably and reproducibly eqs 2 5 2 i c e 0 f r f p f w f d 3 f p i 1 12 e m i e m c 12 4 f

described by the chick watson linear model 48 a modification of the chick model inactivation kinetic was assessed by observing the microorganisms inactivation at different turbidity values and ha concentrations as a function of the elapsed time of the experiment the chick watson model is expressed by eq 6 6 log n t n 0 k t where n 0 is the initial microorganism concentration n t the concentration of microorganisms cfu or pfu ml at the irradiation time t min and k the inactivation rate min 1 moreover student t test confidence level 95 was applied to determine statistical significant differences between uvc doses and inactivation rates k in different experimental conditions 2 5 flow uvc system tests with synthetic water a uvc disinfection reactor ultrarays equipped with a 16 w low pressure uvc lamp philips commercially available for drinking water was used in this study the reactor was made of stainless steel with an external diameter of 6 3 cm and 30 cm of length the lamp sleeve made of quartz was 2 3 cm in diameter and 30 cm of length the distance from the lamp sleeve to the reactor wall was 2 cm and the total volume of the reactor 780 ml the flow uvc reactor is part of the safewater hwt system fig 1 where the uvc system was installed after a sedimentation tank 60 l and a filtration unit and followed by a closed tank 60 l to safely store treated water the filtration unit consisted of 2 10 in pleated filters finerfilters uk of 5 and 1 μm of nominal micron rating scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6010 images of cross sections of the filter elements were taken from pristine cartridges after water matrices synthetic test water preparation in the sedimentation tank raw water was left for 24 h to allow particles sedimentation simulating the real operation conditions in the field the uvc lamp was warmed up for 5 min prior to start of testing the warming up time was obtained based on the spectroradiometer measurements ocean optics spectroradiometer flms 14462 of the output irradiance at 254 nm of the lamp against time according to manufacturer specifications the nominal flow rate of the uvc reactor was 5 l min however due to the quality of the water tested turbidity nom and the high uvc resistance of ms2 a lower flow rate was also tested thus the system was operated at two different flow rates 1 5 l min using a diaphragm pump shurflo 2095 204 112 us tests fs 1 to fs 3 and 2 3 2 l min using another diaphragm pump seaflo sfdp1 012 035 21 china tests fs 4 to fs 10 this also helped with the selection of a low cost pump for its installation in the final safewater hwt system which was based on the actual flow rate required by the uvc reactor to meet the who standards 41 in the worst water quality conditions water samples were taken from the raw water tank before settling to measure the initial turbidity of water sampling point 0 sp0 before sp1 and after sp2 the filtration unit to assess turbidity reduction by settling and cartridge filtration after the uvc reactor sp3 to assess the inactivation efficiency and from the treated water tank to check post treatment contamination sp4 sp4 samples were kept in the dark at room temperature for 24 h fig 1 synthetic test water presented the following characteristics 0 ntu and 0 mg l of ha 15 ntu and 0 mg l of ha 40 ntu and 0 mg l of ha 15 ntu and 3 5 mg l of ha and 40 ntu and 3 5 mg l of ha table 1 it was prepared with tap water antrim uk which was left out for 24 h in the tank for evaporation of chlorine chlorine concentration was measured before starting the experimentation using a portable chlorine measurement photometer exact chlorine plus ms2 and e coli atcc 11229 were spiked into test water given a final concentration of 105 cfu ml for e coli and 106 pfu ml for ms2 pristine filters and dirty filters filters with a cake layer of the test dust formed on their outer surface representing filters after a period of operation were tested to simulate the worst and optimal removal efficiency of the filtration unit respectively 2 6 field testing in colombia water batches of 10 l were collected from la miel 6 08 30 8 n 75 34 26 5 w and santa rita 6 13 49 n 75 36 45 w fig 2 a rivers antioquia colombia sketch map in supplementary materials s 1 1 in clean lid closed containers which were stored in the dark at room temperature for preliminary particles sedimentation water samples presenting an initial concentration of 104 cfu ml of wild e coli strains and natural organic and inorganic particulate and dissolved compounds were spiked with ms2 getting an initial concentration of 106 pfu ml the hwt system tested presenting the same configuration and features of the hwt system previously described fig 1 consisted of a 16 w uvc lamp evans a filtration unit made up of two compact spun polypropylene filters of 5 μm and 1 μm purikor mexico and 150 l tanks fig 2b the uvc lamp was warmed up for 5 min and the water was processed through the system at 4 3 l min by the diaphragm pump seaflo sfdp1 012 035 21 nominal flow rate provided by the pump once installed in the hwt systems installed in the field presenting a flow rate 1 1 l min higher than in the system tested in the laboratory a total of 5 tests were performed in the field 2 using water from la miel river ft field test 1 and ft 2 and 3 from santa rita river ft 3 ft 4 and ft 5 samples were taken from sp1 and sp4 for t hach 2100q uvt254 genesys thermofisher and toc shimadzu 5264 toc vcph analysis and e coli and ms2 enumeration see section 2 3 2 7 water analysis turbidity t and transmittance at 254 nm uvt254 were measured using a turbidimiter hanna hi 93703 and a uv vis spectophotometer jenway 6305 respectively ha concentration in water was prepared by weighing ha and then toc was measured by means of a toc mg l absorbance reference curve at the wavelength of 254 nm which was defined by plotting toc and absorbance values of 10 ha solutions 1 2 3 4 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l reference toc measurements were measured by a shimadzu toc 5000 analyzer at the cb set up t uvt254 and toc were measured before uvc exposure started while microbiological analyses were carried out before and after a specific uvc irradiation time in flow system tests t was measured for the synthetic test water before settling sp0 and before sp1 and after sp2 the filtration unit while uvt254 and toc were measured before the uvc lamp sp2 microbiological analyses were performed in water samples before filtration sp1 before sp2 and after sp3 the uvc lamp and for the treated water tank sp4 the uvc fluence of the flow system or uvc irradiance per surface area mw cm2 was determined by ki iodate actinometry 49 which determines the irradiance in the photoreactor at 254 nm detailed description of the actinometry method and calculations is reported in the supplementary materials s 1 2 the fluence at 254 nm was 5 2 mw cm2 3 results and discussion 3 1 collimated beam tests results ms2 inactivation kinetics at different tested t and ha concentrations are shown in fig 3 the chick watson model showed a statistically significant fitting between the experimental data at all evaluated conditions this is a linear decay of ms2 concentration as a function of the uvc exposure time for all t and ha values the disinfection rate k decreased from 0 27 0 02 min 1 at 0 ntu and 0 mg l of ha to 0 17 0 01 min 1 at 0 ntu and 3 5 mg l of ha indicating a decrease in the uvc disinfection efficiency student t test p value of 0 004 no statistically significant differences were observed in ms2 inactivation rate in the absence of ha when increasing turbidity levels from 0 to 20 4 0 5 ntu student t test p value of 0 111 from fig 3 it can clearly be observed a ms2 removal of 4 lrv after 15 min of uvc treatment and while not significant differences were observed at different turbidity levels with required exposure times ranging from 13 to 15 min when 3 5 mg l of ha were in water a maximum removal of 3 72 0 14 lrv was achieved after 20 3 min as expected e coli was much more sensitive to uvc attaining 4 lrv within 2 8 min k of 1 13 0 05 min 1 in milli q water microbiology control results showed stability of e coli and ms2 cultures over the experimental time as well as no material bacteria virus and host contamination was found in all tests performed the uvc dose required to produce a 4 lrv of ms2 in milli q water 0 ntu was 108 mj cm2 while little differences in the killing dose were found when turbidity increased to 4 7 0 5 ntu 60 mj cm2 and 20 4 0 5 ntu 80 mj cm2 fig 4 however in the case of ha concentration the effect was more pronounced for 3 5 mg l of ha in clear water 0 ntu the uvc killing dose for 4 lrv increased a 65 up to 177 mj cm2 in relation to the absence of ha on the other hand e coli reached 4 lrv after 21 mj cm2 uvc dose fig 4 this initial finding indicated the strong detrimental effect of few mg l of ha on uvc disinfection efficiency compared with the much lower effect of turbidity in the range 0 20 ntu the dose necessary to attain ms2 4 lrv decreased by a 20 3 2 flow uvc experiments with synthetic water table 2 shows the main results obtained from the experiments performed under flow conditions the settling process allowed a maximum particles removal of 30 4 1 52 regarding the filtration unit it was observed that dirty filters achieved 100 turbidity removal for all turbidity levels tested whereas the removal efficiency of pristine filters was lower with an average of 15 2 ms2 and e coli concentration did not decrease during filtration neither in pristine nor dirty filters e coli has a diameter of 1 μm and 0 5 2 μm length and ms2 is of 24 nm of diameter making them difficult to remove by physical methods such as filtration by commercial cartridge filters although the second filter was rated 1 μm by the manufacturer no microorganisms removal was observed even when the filter was covered with fine test dust particles from scanning electron microscope images of pristine pleated filters supplementary materials s 2 1 no significant differences in the pore structure were observed only the thickness of the filter media was different being the 5 μm thicker than the 1 μm filter element the performance of the filtration unit of the hwt system developed within the framework of the safewater project has been reported by afkhami et al 50 in the flow uvc system the uvc dose ranged from a minimum of 47 2 mj cm2 to a maximum of 64 8 mj cm2 at 5 l min and from 79 2 mj cm2 to 98 2 mj cm2 at 3 2 l min 5 lrv reduction was achieved for e coli regardless of the flow rate t or ha levels in water as the final e coli concentration was below the detection limit bdl in all cases table 2 fig 5 a however under the same conditions 5 lrv of ms2 was never reached its reduction varied from a minimum of 1 55 0 58 lrv to a maximum of 3 72 0 14 lrv in the absence of ha with average uvt254 of 88 7 3 33 0 12 3 72 0 14 lrv were achieved when working at 3 2 l min uvc doses of 84 4 96 4 mj cm2 with a minimum of 2 52 0 18 lrv at 5 l min uvc dose of 64 8 mj cm2 moreover nor e coli neither ms2 re growth were observed in treated water stored in the dark at room temperature for 24 h as expected under the same conditions of water quality t ha and initial ms2 concentration the decrease in flow rate and thus the uvc dose increase i e increase residence time and hence increased uvc dose resulted in a higher virus inactivation on the other hand for 3 5 mg l of ha ms2 removal varied from 1 62 0 51 to 2 02 0 55 lrv uvt254 dropped to 73 3 on average and uvc dose dropped between 13 7 to 27 2 with uvc doses ranging from 47 2 to 84 8 mj cm2 as result ms2 reduction was 1 2 log units lower than in the absence of ha uvc dose response does not follow a clear trend since under flow conditions uvc dose distribution inside the reactor is not only affected by water quality t ha but also by the reactor hydrodynamics and the radiation distribution in the uvc photo reactor however the effect of water quality could be assessed from tests performed using reactors of exactly same characteristics in terms of power configuration and dimensions and flow rate so that when turbidity concerned at the same ha concentration and flow rate an increase in turbidity from 0 to 9 1 0 5 or 17 6 0 5 ntu showed a negligible effect on the uvc disinfection efficiency test fs 2 table 2 was performed at 5 l min 3 5 mg l of ha and 13 7 0 5 ntu while test fs 3 was performed at 5 l min 3 5 mg l of ha and 19 7 0 5 ntu getting 1 91 0 21 and 2 02 0 55 lrv respectively tests fs 6 and fs 7 were carried out at 3 2 l min 0 mg l of ha and 4 9 0 5 and 14 0 5 ntu achieving 3 72 0 14 and 3 33 0 12 lrv the same trend was observed comparing tests fs 8 fs 9 and fs 10 these tests were carried out at 3 2 l min 3 5 mg l of ha and 0 0 and 17 6 0 5 ntu achieving 1 55 0 58 1 62 0 51 and 1 83 0 49 lrv respectively fig 5b demonstrates the clear different impact of the two parameters where small concentrations of ha 0 3 5 mg l have a greater effect over ms2 removal performance than those of turbidity 0 20 ntu changes it can be clearly seen that the inactivation of ms2 depends on the presence or absence of ha measured through uvt254 since it remains practically unchanged with varying turbidity levels in water 3 3 field tests results results from field testing are summarized in table 2 the initial turbidity of water from la miel ranged from 2 9 0 5 ntu to 3 5 0 4 ntu while from santa rita river ranged from 2 7 0 5 ntu to 6 8 1 6 ntu with an average particle removal of 70 5 turbidity levels after filtration were below 1 0 0 4 ntu and 1 7 0 4 ntu respectively the highest uvt254 values were found in la miel with 95 7 corresponding with 4 63 0 56 lrv and 5 08 0 35 lrv of ms2 in santa rita river with the lowest uvt254 value of 69 2 ms2 inactivation dropped to 3 51 0 28 lrv e coli concentration was always bdl 4 5 lrv and ms2 reduction was always 3 lrv 3 4 discussion previous works have reported a uvc fluence ranging from 1 to 9 mj cm2 for e coli inactivation 6 8 10 14 28 requiring a uvc dose of 8 4 mj cm2 for 4 lrv a range of 5 139 mj cm2 was indicated for ms2 inactivation 9 10 12 13 15 16 with dose values of 16 mj cm2 34 mj cm2 52 mj cm2 and 71 mj cm2 corresponding to 1 2 3 and 4 lrv this is in agreement with our results where ms2 showed higher resistance to uvc disinfection than e coli however the doses obtained in our study were slightly higher than previously published with required 108 mj cm2 ms2 and 21 mj cm2 e coli to attain 4 lrv in milli q water this could be due to the higher corrected uvc dose values considered for the inactivation experiments which ranged from 0 to 320 mj cm2 compared to those used in past studies 6 8 10 12 16 28 at full scale flow conditions uvc dose always exceeded the minimum of 40 mj cm2 for drinking water treatment recommended by the usepa 18 however it was not enough to get the same inactivation level for ms2 the water optical properties in the uvc region of the spectrum are of huge importance to understand and explain the disinfection results in the presence of dissolved organics nom and or ha and suspended inorganic matter turbidity according to previous authors 35 turbidity and uvc transmittance are the most important water parameters in uvc disinfection uvc transmittance is directly affected by the presence of light absorbing compounds including mainly nom usually dissolved among other chemicals 51 ha together with fulvic acids are the main constituents of nom which strongly absorb uvc and visible radiation and colour natural water resources 52 it is reported that ha small concentrations 3 5 mg l in water may absorb more than the 80 of the uvc radiation 53 on the contrary turbidity agents i e organic or inorganic particulate matter just scatter the light shielding the microorganisms and occasionally absorb uvc radiation reducing the uvc dose delivered over the microbial 54 previous articles report on the effect of turbidity of ms2 uvc inactivation showing non significant effect over the dose for turbidity below 30 ntu 34 35 55 but lower inactivation was reported with turbidity values up to 80 ntu in deionized water 37 this is in agreement with our work where in both experimental systems cb and flow uvc with the same water characteristics ha concentration and microorganisms load and flow rate turbidity up to 20 4 0 5 ntu slightly affected the inactivation efficiency of ms2 regarding ha it has been found as the most important factor to influence the killing uvc dose 34 39 53 on average in the presence of 3 5 mg l of ha in synthetic water uvt254 values were of 73 3 resulting in 1 7 lrv of ms2 vs 3 35 lrv in the absence of ha uvt254 of 88 7 field tests showed a reduction of 1 2 log units on ms2 inactivation when uvt254 dropped from 95 7 0 6 to 69 2 1 7 younis et al 36 tested a proprietary uvc reactor showing a reduction of 4 2 log units on ms2 inactivation when artificially reducing the uvt254 of water from 95 to 70 while the disinfection capacity of the system was not significantly impacted by turbidity values ranging from 0 to 18 ntu recently baldasso et al 34 claimed the critical role of dissolved nom and the irrelevant influence of turbidity on uvc disinfection for uvc transmittances above 77 and turbidity values under 5 ntu our results are in perfect agreement with these findings in addition some works have studied the uvc disinfection efficiency in natural waters just taking turbidity into consideration 35 37 38 when natural waters and especially surface waters are the results of a complex matrix of suspended and dissolved organic and inorganic matter so it might result in a limited interpretation of the contribution of turbidity to uvc disinfection in our study in both experimental configurations the differences in the inactivation efficiency relied on the presence absence of ha in water directly affecting the uvc required dose and thus the inactivation efficiency while turbidity slightly affected finally in order to confirm laboratory results and to assess the performance of the hwt system under real operation conditions field tests were also performed at household level in rural communities of colombia using natural water sources regarding the filtration unit with maximum turbidity levels of 22 3 1 6 ntu after sedimentation in laboratory testing effluent turbidity only reached the who hwt criterion of 5 ntu 45 for dirty filters its efficiency improved over time as a cake built up on its surface 50 on the other hand in field testing using spun filters and with maximum turbidity levels of 6 8 1 6 ntu effluent turbidity always met the who recommended threshold 5 ntu however pleated filters can be washed and reused several times without affecting its performance 50 significantly reducing the cost and improving sustainability of the hwt system in addition same trend was observed in uvc inactivation in both laboratory and field tests e coli was always bdl regardless of the water quality strain and flow rate 3 2 5 l min and 3 lrv of ms2 was achieved when uvt254 75 thus the hwt system was able to meet the who reduction requirements 41 not only in the laboratory but also in field testing natural water sources with natural particulate dissolve organic and inorganic matter and wild bacteria strains even in the worst water quality condition tested in the field santa rita river uvt254 of 69 2 1 7 and t of 6 8 1 6 ntu the system was able to achieve a protective level of 3 51 0 28 viral lrv 4 conclusions the results of this research clearly demonstrated the following 1 despite the detrimental effect of nom on uvc disinfection efficiency is well known the performance assessment of hwt systems based on uvc disinfection or proprietary uvc reactors is usually based on turbidity but no analysis or investigations are carried out about the complexity of natural water sources which interfere with uvc radiation in the water matrix and may have a critical role on their efficiency what is more works studying the uvc inactivation efficiency in natural water generally just monitor turbidity ignoring the complexity of natural water sources which might result in a limited interpretation of the contribution of turbidity to uvc disinfection 2 despite turbidity has generally been found to adversely affect uvc treatment as it increases the disinfection efficiency decreased solely in the presence of ha due to the absorption of uvc at 254 nm by ha molecules while turbidity of 20 4 0 5 ntu did not have a significant effect on uvc inactivation 3 the collimated beam tests in milli q or tap water could not be extrapolated to flow uvc systems operating with natural water sources the nom results showed a strong detrimental effect on uvt254 reducing the effectiveness of uvc disinfection therefore water quality should be considered before application of uvc 4 the effect of t and ha concentration on uvc disinfection efficiency followed the same trend in both experimental configurations collimated beam and flow system therefore the collimated beam results can be used as a preliminary step for the design of flow uvc reactors 5 5 lrv of ms2 was rarely reached in the conditions of this study maximum dose delivered 177 mj cm2 even though the recommended minimum uvc dose of 40 mj cm2 to operate uvc disinfection systems set by the usepa was always exceeded thus 40 mj cm2 might be not sufficient to inactivate uvc resistant microorganisms as viruses and bacteria spores 6 field results confirmed the good performance of the hwt system following both laboratory and field tests the same trend in terms of turbidity removal 15 2 and 100 corresponding with pristine and dirty pleated filters in the laboratory and 70 5 for dirty spun filters in the field and e coli always bdl regardless of the water quality flow rate and strain and ms2 3 lrv for uvt254 75 inactivation 7 regarding the who scheme for evaluation of hwt systems performance and the set of tests performed the system under evaluation could be classified as highly protective and protective high pathogen removal for bacteria and viruses when working at flow rates 5 l min from laboratory testing using synthetic water in the presence of 3 5 mg l of ha uvt254 75 it presented a limited protection for viruses the findings presented in this work resulted from the laboratory testing following the who criteria of performance for this hwt system consisting of filtration and uvc disinfection designed to provide safe drinking water in rural mexico and colombia however regarding the extended use of uvc for drinking water disinfection and the limited number of works addressing the effects of both suspended particulate and nom further research to define the parameters affecting the uvc disinfection performance of potable water is still

13316,the relationship between turbidity t and ultraviolet c uvc disinfection is still not clearly understood as well as no attention has been paid to the contribution of natural organic matter nom the present work assessed the influence of particulate and nom on the uvc disinfection efficiency in terms of e coli and ms2 removal at bench collimated beam cb and flow uvc systems both in the laboratory and in the field colombia the flow uvc reactor was installed as part of a household water treatment hwt system consisting of filtration uvc disinfection tests were performed according to the who standards using fine test dust humic acid ha and ms2 and e coli as microbiological indicators cb results showed a significant decrease in the inactivation rate of ms2 in the presence of small concentrations of ha 3 5 mg l with killing dose increasing a 65 vs non significant effects of turbidity in the range of 0 20 ntu following the same trend in flow uvc tests the inactivation efficiency of ms2 decreased solely in the presence of ha at the same ha concentration and flow rate an increase in turbidity of 17 6 ntu showed a negligible effect conversely in the presence of ha uvt254 dropped from 88 7 0 mg l ha to 73 3 reducing ms2 inactivation by 1 2 log units finally the hwt system could be classified as protective working at flow rates 5 l min however in the presence of 3 5 mg l ha uvt254 75 it presented a limited protection for viruses keywords uvc disinfection turbidity humic acid ms2 drinking water 1 introduction uvc irradiation was first used for water treatment in 1910 1 despite at that time the use of chemical disinfection was generally extended 2 3 uvc irradiation started to gain more attention due to its effectiveness against all waterborne pathogens including cysts of cryptosporidium and giardia and because of in contrast to many of the chemical disinfectants it imparts no taste and odour to the water in addition uvc light does not present risk as a result of overdosing or formation of harmful disinfection by products dbps 4 5 research studies on uvc water disinfection are mainly focused on assessing the effective uvc dose for viruses bacteria and protozoan inactivation which have been widely studied and described in the literature 6 16 these works have shown that while viruses and bacteria spores are the most uvc resistant pathogens vegetative bacteria cells and cysts of giardia and cryptosporidium are more susceptible with lower fluence requirements 17 18 the united states environmental protection agency usepa indicated a required delivery uvc dose of 40 mj cm2 to deal with most of the viruses and spores 18 water quality plays a fundamental role on the uvc disinfection efficiency affecting the transmission of uvc light uvt to the target microorganisms 18 uvt at the wavelength of 254 nm uvt254 is the main water quality parameter used to define uvc disinfection performance 18 uvt254 is affected by scattering and absorbance of uvc light in water so that while particulates and colloidal matter shields pathogens from disinfection and scatters light the dissolved organic fraction absorbs the uvc light as it passes through the water 19 in continuous flow systems dose delivery is not only affected by water quality but also by the flow rate uvc output from the lamp the uvc light distribution inside the reactor chamber and by the reactor hydrodynamics which in turn is affected by its dimensions internal configuration and the flow rate 20 in centralized treatment plants for uvc disinfection systems operation uvc output from the lamp is usually monitored by uvc sensors to measure uvc intensity uvci two approaches are used for uvc systems operation the uvci set point approach which relies on uvci readings to change the lamp output in response to changes in uvci and flow rate 18 and the calculated dose approach in which the required uvc dose is estimated using a dose monitoring algorithm 18 21 that sets the lamp output to maintain the required dose under varying conditions of flow rate and water quality however for point of use uvc reactors usually not equipped with advance monitoring sensors or regulable intensity outputs flow rate is the utmost importance to maintain the required dose 18 lower flow rates allow longer contact time in the reactor and thus higher uvc doses commercial uvc reactors are designed to treat a maximum flow of water and it is usually listed in the product specification as well in the development of new point of use reactors uvc fluence vs flow rate is usually assessed for the system validation and to define its operation conditions 22 24 on the other hand regarding the impact of water quality on uvc efficiency supplementary treatment process might be required upstream to clarify water and significantly improve uvc inactivation such process might include filtration and coagulation to reduce the particulate and organic fraction 18 although flow uvc reactors are widely used very few works investigate the effect of water quality from an optical point of view on uvc disinfection efficiency 25 in this regard hijnen et al 17 reviewed and compared the results of studies carried out with different water sources under similar conditions cb tests strains and uvc dose to assess the effect of water quality from this work when comparing oppenheimer et al 26 and watercare 27 works which were carried out with the secondary effluent of wastewater treatment plants with studies testing deionized tap water 6 8 12 15 28 32 a lower inactivation rate was observed in the secondary effluent than in drinking water in contrast the comparison of data from thompson et al 33 working with secondary effluents showed no inactivation decrease in poliovirus and adenovirus when comparing their inactivation in drinking water in addition no effects of turbidity ranging from 0 2 ntu to 5 3 ntu were observed in poliovirus and ms2 inactivation in batch conditions 33 this was recently confirmed by baldasso et al 34 who showed non significant effect of turbidity 0 5 ntu on ms2 uvc inactivation vs the critical effect of ha 3 5 mg l reducing the inactivation rate of ms2 by 40 in addition no synergistic effects between both parameters at those levels were found 34 under flow conditions it was determined that the uvc disinfection performance of ms2 and e coli was not affected for turbidity 30 ntu and total organic carbon toc 2 mg l 35 36 while turbidity values up to 80 ntu in deionized water and unfiltered natural water sources with values ranging from 2 0 to 22 7 ntu decreased the effectiveness of uvc disinfection as turbidity of the water source increased 37 38 moreover cheng et al 39 results evaluating an individual unit of a photocatalytic membrane reactor equipped with a uvc lamp showed that the irradiation time to get 5 49 lrv of the bacteriophage f2 increased from 54 s at 0 mg l of ha to 85 s at 10 mg l this was attributed to uvc light absorption by ha up to date works assessing the performance of hwt systems based on uvc disinfection or proprietary uvc reactors usually report on turbidity 33 35 36 38 but no analysis or investigations are carried out about the complexity of natural water sources which interfere with uvc radiation in the water matrix and may have a critical role on the efficiency of uvc disinfection despite turbidity has generally been found to adversely affect uvc treatment as it increases 38 the relationship between turbidity and uvc disinfection is not clearly understood at this stage the role of nom always present in environmental surface water has to be also considered as nom modifies turbidity and certainly absorbs light at the uvc wavelengths 26 39 this would be of great importance not only for conventional uvc disinfection applications but also for other emerging water treatment technologies based on the use of uvc including photocatalysis uv h2o2 and the use of uv leds the present work has been developed within the frame of the safewater project gcrf ukri safewater project as part of the design sizing and performance assessment of a hwt system developed and constructed to treat and provide the daily safe water needs for a family in isolated communities of developing countries technological solutions for safe drinking water have a significant potential to address the sdg 6 set by the sustainable development agenda 40 in addition given the huge implications of safe water for public health food security poverty reduction and equality the improvement in water quality and management is directly and indirectly linked to sdg 1 no poverty sdg 3 good health and well being sdg 5 gender equality and sdg 11 sustainable cities and communities 40 the who international scheme to evaluate household water treatment technologies provides health based criteria to evaluate household water treatment technologies intended to treat water for microbiological contaminants 41 it stablishes the characteristics of the water to be tested chlorine concentration ph toc t temperature total dissolve solids and alkalinity and the microbiological indicators escherichia coli in the group of bacteria ms2 coliphage and phix 174 virus and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts protozoa the who scheme also indicates the organisms pretreatment concentration 105 100 ml 108 l and 5 105 l respectively and the reduction requirement to allow the classification of the technologies as highly protective protective or limited protective the safewater hwt technology is based on filtration followed by uvc disinfection 41 the main objective of the present work is to assess the disinfection efficiency of the flow uvc reactor integrated into the safewater hwt system against bacteria and viruses using two indicators escherichia coli and ms2 bacteriophage in different water quality matrices varying suspended particulate and nom concentrations and operating conditions flow rate and filtration efficiency prior to disinfection to ensure it delivers safe drinking water 2 methodology 2 1 research approach the flow uvc reactor was tested as part of the hwt system consisting of filtration followed by uvc disinfection which was designed to provide safe drinking water in rural communities of mexico and colombia to achieve this firstly the uvc inactivation rate of target microorganisms was assessed through cb tests the uvc doses determined were then confirmed in the flow uvc system at ulster university facilities uk using synthetic water and in the field in rural communities of antioquia colombia using natural water sources for this the who scheme for evaluation of hwt technologies performance 41 was used to determine if the water treatment is either highly protective 4 log reduction value lrv of e coli and 5 lrv of ms2 protective 2 lrv of e coli and 3 lrv of ms2 or limited protective when fails to meet the previous criteria 2 2 chemicals synthetic test water was prepared on the same day of experimentation using a2 fine test dust manufactured by powder technology inc and humic acid sodium salt sigma aldrich test dust is the most used particulate standard to assess filter media and particulate contamination the particles size and chemical makeup of a2 fine test dust is specified by iso 12103 1 42 and its use is recommended by the who to simulate turbidity occurring in natural water 43 on the other hand ha comprises the largest fraction of the nom in natural water 44 and it is commonly used to simulate the dissolved organic fraction of natural surface waters according to who hwt performance testing scheme 41 water matrices with concentrations of 0 and 3 5 mg l of ha and turbidity levels up to 40 10 ntu were selected to test uvc disinfection efficiency these chemicals were suspended test dust or dissolved ha by mechanical stirring in milli q water for all disinfection experiments in the cb and in dechlorinated tap water left out for 24 h for flow system tests in the laboratory 2 3 microorganisms growth and enumeration escherichia coli and ms2 bacteriophage were used as microbiological indicators to test the efficiency of this technology following the who scheme to evaluate hwt systems performance 41 ms2 highly uvc resistant is generally used as a viral surrogate while e coli is the most common faecal indicator analysed in drinking water as well as in disinfection studies and protocols in addition e coli is the indicator established by the who for the verification of the microbiological quality of water intended for human consumption 45 escherichia coli atcc 11229 ms2 atcc 155987 b1 and its e coli host atcc 15597 were obtained from atcc an overnight culture of e coli atcc 11229 concentration of 1012 cfu ml and a ms2 stock solution concentration of 1012 pfu ml were spiked into test water obtaining an initial concentration of 105 cfu ml for e coli and 106 pfu ml for ms2 the overnight cultures of e coli atcc 11229 and e coli host atcc 15597 were prepared from glycerol master stock solutions stored at 80 c first each strain from the master stock solutions was sowing in chromocult coliform agar merck millipore plates which were incubated at 36 2 c for 21 3 h then a single blue colony from each chromocult plate was transferred to falcon tubes containing 15 ml of tryptone soya broth media tsb oxoid the tubes were incubated at 36 2 c for 12 h in a shaker incubator 200 rpm afterwards the liquid suspension was centrifuged at 4 000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was replaced by phosphate borate saline pbs solution oxoid obtaining an e coli atcc 11229 and e coli host atcc 15597 concentration of 1012 cfu ml the membrane filtration technique was employed for the detection and enumeration of escherichia coli samples were filtered in triplicate through cellulose nitrate membrane filters 0 45 μm and then transferred to petri dishes with the suitable growth media chromocult coliform agar petri dishes were incubated at 36 2 c for 21 3 h and dark blue to violet colonies were enumerated as e coli with a detection limit of 1 cfu 100 ml ms2 was analysed in triplicate following the double layer agar method 46 a glycerol stock solution of ms2 kept frosted at 80 c and an overnight culture of e coli host were used to perform the experiment for ms2 detection and enumeration 1 ml of sample and 100 μl of e coli host from an overnight culture were poured into bijou tubes with melted sloppy agar this was prepared with tsb and bacteriological agar no 1 oxoid the content of the bijou tubes was poured into tryptone soya agar tsa plates oxoid and then incubated at 36 2 c for 21 3 h lytic plaques were enumerated as ms2 with a detection limit of 1 pfu ml positive controls were performed to ensure stability of ms2 and e coli atcc 11229 cultures during the experimental time for this reason the working solution of ms2 and e coli atcc 11229 was plated at the beginning and at the end of the experiment the negative controls were prepared as follows pbs solution pbs solution and e coli host ms2 working solution e coli atcc 11229 working solution and water matrix to ensure no material bacteria virus and host contamination the disinfection efficiency of the target microorganisms was calculated as follow eq 1 1 lrv log n 0 log n t log 10 n 0 n t where lrv represents the log reduction value obtained after a specific uvc irradiation time n0 is the microorganisms concentration cfu or pfu ml at the initial time and nt is the microorganisms concentration cfu or pfu ml at time t 2 4 collimated beam tests collimated beam cb experiments were performed with a 12 w uvc low pressure mercury lamp monochromatic at 254 nm to investigate the effects of turbidity test dust and organic matter ha on the uvc inactivation of the target microorganisms lamp intensity was measured with a spectroradiometer ocean optics spectroradiometer flms 14462 with an operating range from 200 to 800 nm and an optical resolution of 1 5 nm located at the centre of the surface of the sample obtaining a value of 0 231 mw cm2 the uvc lamp was initially warmed up for 5 min to ensure a relatively stable output a vessel was placed on the horizontal surface beneath the collimated beam system constructed following the standard guidelines 47 it was composed of a 55 cm long cylindric glass tube covered with black paper to assure only vertical incident radiation would arrive to the sample surface and retained vertically in place by a metallic holder the sample was continuously stirred using a magnetic stirring apparatus and a small stirring bar without creating any vortex while exposing the test solution to uvc light the solution volume was 100 ml the vertical path length of the water in the vessel 5 2 cm and the vertical distance from the lamp to the top of the test solution 38 cm e coli response was evaluated in milli q water while ms2 was assessed at different test dust turbidity and ha concentrations experiments with ms2 were carried out at three turbidity levels 0 5 and 20 ntu and two ha concentrations 0 and 3 5 mg l in milli q water table 1 initial concentration of e coli was 105 cfu ml and ms2 was 106 pfu ml twelve uvc dose values were applied between 0 and 320 mj cm2 corresponding to exposure times ranging from 0 to 23 min samples of 1 ml were collected from the vessel after each exposure time and analysed to determine microorganism concentration the effective uvc dose response was calculated by correcting the measured irradiance as proposed by bolton and linden 47 who provided a standardized method to determine uvc doses in bench scale collimated beam apparatus reliably and reproducibly eqs 2 5 2 i c e 0 f r f p f w f d 3 f p i 1 12 e m i e m c 12 4 f

the surface of the sample and the uvc lamp the i c was calculated for each experimental condition and was used to calculate the effective applied uvc fluence in addition inactivation kinetic data were described by the chick watson linear model 48 a modification of the chick model inactivation kinetic was assessed by observing the microorganisms inactivation at different turbidity values and ha concentrations as a function of the elapsed time of the experiment the chick watson model is expressed by eq 6 6 log n t n 0 k t where n 0 is the initial microorganism concentration n t the concentration of microorganisms cfu or pfu ml at the irradiation time t min and k the inactivation rate min 1 moreover student t test confidence level 95 was applied to determine statistical significant differences between uvc doses and inactivation rates k in different experimental conditions 2 5 flow uvc system tests with synthetic water a uvc disinfection reactor ultrarays equipped with a 16 w low pressure uvc lamp philips commercially available for drinking water was used in this study the reactor was made of stainless steel with an external diameter of 6 3 cm and 30 cm of length the lamp sleeve made of quartz was 2 3 cm in diameter and 30 cm of length the distance from the lamp sleeve to the reactor wall was 2 cm and the total volume of the reactor 780 ml the flow uvc reactor is part of the safewater hwt system fig 1 where the uvc system was installed after a sedimentation tank 60 l and a filtration unit and followed by a closed tank 60 l to safely store treated water the filtration unit consisted of 2 10 in pleated filters finerfilters uk of 5 and 1 μm of nominal micron rating scanning electron microscope jeol jsm 6010 images of cross sections of the filter elements were taken from pristine cartridges after water matrices synthetic test water preparation in the sedimentation tank raw water was left for 24 h to allow particles sedimentation simulating the real operation conditions in the field the uvc lamp was warmed up for 5 min prior to start of testing the warming up time was obtained based on the spectroradiometer measurements ocean optics spectroradiometer flms 14462 of the output irradiance at 254 nm of the lamp against time according to manufacturer specifications the nominal flow rate of the uvc reactor was 5 l min however due to the quality of the water tested turbidity nom and the high uvc resistance of ms2 a lower flow rate was also tested thus the system was operated at two different flow rates 1 5 l min using a diaphragm pump shurflo 2095 204 112 us tests fs 1 to fs 3 and 2 3 2 l min using another diaphragm pump seaflo sfdp1 012 035 21 china tests fs 4 to fs 10 this also helped with the selection of a low cost pump for its installation in the final safewater hwt system which was based on the actual flow rate required by the uvc reactor to meet the who standards 41 in the worst water quality conditions water samples were taken from the raw water tank before settling to measure the initial turbidity of water sampling point 0 sp0 before sp1 and after sp2 the filtration unit to assess turbidity reduction by settling and cartridge filtration after the uvc reactor sp3 to assess the inactivation efficiency and from the treated water tank to check post treatment contamination sp4 sp4 samples were kept in the dark at room temperature for 24 h fig 1 synthetic test water presented the following characteristics 0 ntu and 0 mg l of ha 15 ntu and 0 mg l of ha 40 ntu and 0 mg l of ha 15 ntu and 3 5 mg l of ha and 40 ntu and 3 5 mg l of ha table 1 it was prepared with tap water antrim uk which was left out for 24 h in the tank for evaporation of chlorine chlorine concentration was measured before starting the experimentation using a portable chlorine measurement photometer exact chlorine plus ms2 and e coli atcc 11229 were spiked into test water given a final concentration of 105 cfu ml for e coli and 106 pfu ml for ms2 pristine filters and dirty filters filters with a cake layer of the test dust formed on their outer surface representing filters after a period of operation were tested to simulate the worst and optimal removal efficiency of the filtration unit respectively 2 6 field testing in colombia water batches of 10 l were collected from la miel 6 08 30 8 n 75 34 26 5 w and santa rita 6 13 49 n 75 36 45 w fig 2 a rivers antioquia colombia sketch map in supplementary materials s 1 1 in clean lid closed containers which were stored in the dark at room temperature for preliminary particles sedimentation water samples presenting an initial concentration of 104 cfu ml of wild e coli strains and natural organic and inorganic particulate and dissolved compounds were spiked with ms2 getting an initial concentration of 106 pfu ml the hwt system tested presenting the same configuration and features of the hwt system previously described fig 1 consisted of a 16 w uvc lamp evans a filtration unit made up of two compact spun polypropylene filters of 5 μm and 1 μm purikor mexico and 150 l tanks fig 2b the uvc lamp was warmed up for 5 min and the water was processed through the system at 4 3 l min by the diaphragm pump seaflo sfdp1 012 035 21 nominal flow rate provided by the pump once installed in the hwt systems installed in the field presenting a flow rate 1 1 l min higher than in the system tested in the laboratory a total of 5 tests were performed in the field 2 using water from la miel river ft field test 1 and ft 2 and 3 from santa rita river ft 3 ft 4 and ft 5 samples were taken from sp1 and sp4 for t hach 2100q uvt254 genesys thermofisher and toc shimadzu 5264 toc vcph analysis and e coli and ms2 enumeration see section 2 3 2 7 water analysis turbidity t and transmittance at 254 nm uvt254 were measured using a turbidimiter hanna hi 93703 and a uv vis spectophotometer jenway 6305 respectively ha concentration in water was prepared by weighing ha and then toc was measured by means of a toc mg l absorbance reference curve at the wavelength of 254 nm which was defined by plotting toc and absorbance values of 10 ha solutions 1 2 3 4 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l reference toc measurements were measured by a shimadzu toc 5000 analyzer at the cb set up t uvt254 and toc were measured before uvc exposure started while microbiological analyses were carried out before and after a specific uvc irradiation time in flow system tests t was measured for the synthetic test water before settling sp0 and before sp1 and after sp2 the filtration unit while uvt254 and toc were measured before the uvc lamp sp2 microbiological analyses were performed in water samples before filtration sp1 before sp2 and after sp3 the uvc lamp and for the treated water tank sp4 the uvc fluence of the flow system or uvc irradiance per surface area mw cm2 was determined by ki iodate actinometry 49 which determines the irradiance in the photoreactor at 254 nm detailed description of the actinometry method and calculations is reported in the supplementary materials s 1 2 the fluence at 254 nm was 5 2 mw cm2 3 results and discussion 3 1 collimated beam tests results ms2 inactivation kinetics at different tested t and ha concentrations are shown in fig 3 the chick watson model showed a statistically significant fitting between the experimental data at all evaluated conditions this is a linear decay of ms2 concentration as a function of the uvc exposure time for all t and ha values the disinfection rate k decreased from 0 27 0 02 min 1 at 0 ntu and 0 mg l of ha to 0 17 0 01 min 1 at 0 ntu and 3 5 mg l of ha indicating a decrease in the uvc disinfection efficiency student t test p value of 0 004 no statistically significant differences were observed in ms2 inactivation rate in the absence of ha when increasing turbidity levels from 0 to 20 4 0 5 ntu student t test p value of 0 111 from fig 3 it can clearly be observed a ms2 removal of 4 lrv after 15 min of uvc treatment and while not significant differences were observed at different turbidity levels with required exposure times ranging from 13 to 15 min when 3 5 mg l of ha were in water a maximum removal of 3 72 0 14 lrv was achieved after 20 3 min as expected e coli was much more sensitive to uvc attaining 4 lrv within 2 8 min k of 1 13 0 05 min 1 in milli q water microbiology control results showed stability of e coli and ms2 cultures over the experimental time as well as no material bacteria virus and host contamination was found in all tests performed the uvc dose required to produce a 4 lrv of ms2 in milli q water 0 ntu was 108 mj cm2 while little differences in the killing dose were found when turbidity increased to 4 7 0 5 ntu 60 mj cm2 and 20 4 0 5 ntu 80 mj cm2 fig 4 however in the case of ha concentration the effect was more pronounced for 3 5 mg l of ha in clear water 0 ntu the uvc killing dose for 4 lrv increased a 65 up to 177 mj cm2 in relation to the absence of ha on the other hand e coli reached 4 lrv after 21 mj cm2 uvc dose fig 4 this initial finding indicated the strong detrimental effect of few mg l of ha on uvc disinfection efficiency compared with the much lower effect of turbidity in the range 0 20 ntu the dose necessary to attain ms2 4 lrv decreased by a 20 3 2 flow uvc experiments with synthetic water table 2 shows the main results obtained from the experiments performed under flow conditions the settling process allowed a maximum particles removal of 30 4 1 52 regarding the filtration unit it was observed that dirty filters achieved 100 turbidity removal for all turbidity levels tested whereas the removal efficiency of pristine filters was lower with an average of 15 2 ms2 and e coli concentration did not decrease during filtration neither in pristine nor dirty filters e coli has a diameter of 1 μm and 0 5 2 μm length and ms2 is of 24 nm of diameter making them difficult to remove by physical methods such as filtration by commercial cartridge filters although the second filter was rated 1 μm by the manufacturer no microorganisms removal was observed even when the filter was covered with fine test dust particles from scanning electron microscope images of pristine pleated filters supplementary materials s 2 1 no significant differences in the pore structure were observed only the thickness of the filter media was different being the 5 μm thicker than the 1 μm filter element the performance of the filtration unit of the hwt system developed within the framework of the safewater project has been reported by afkhami et al 50 in the flow uvc system the uvc dose ranged from a minimum of 47 2 mj cm2 to a maximum of 64 8 mj cm2 at 5 l min and from 79 2 mj cm2 to 98 2 mj cm2 at 3 2 l min 5 lrv reduction was achieved for e coli regardless of the flow rate t or ha levels in water as the final e coli concentration was below the detection limit bdl in all cases table 2 fig 5 a however under the same conditions 5 lrv of ms2 was never reached its reduction varied from a minimum of 1 55 0 58 lrv to a maximum of 3 72 0 14 lrv in the absence of ha with average uvt254 of 88 7 3 33 0 12 3 72 0 14 lrv were achieved when working at 3 2 l min uvc doses of 84 4 96 4 mj cm2 with a minimum of 2 52 0 18 lrv at 5 l min uvc dose of 64 8 mj cm2 moreover nor e coli neither ms2 re growth were observed in treated water stored in the dark at room temperature for 24 h as expected under the same conditions of water quality t ha and initial ms2 concentration the decrease in flow rate and thus the uvc dose increase i e increase residence time and hence increased uvc dose resulted in a higher virus inactivation on the other hand for 3 5 mg l of ha ms2 removal varied from 1 62 0 51 to 2 02 0 55 lrv uvt254 dropped to 73 3 on average and uvc dose dropped between 13 7 to 27 2 with uvc doses ranging from 47 2 to 84 8 mj cm2 as result ms2 reduction was 1 2 log units lower than in the absence of ha uvc dose response does not follow a clear trend since under flow conditions uvc dose distribution inside the reactor is not only affected by water quality t ha but also by the reactor hydrodynamics and the radiation distribution in the uvc photo reactor however the effect of water quality could be assessed from tests performed using reactors of exactly same characteristics in terms of power configuration and dimensions and flow rate so that when turbidity concerned at the same ha concentration and flow rate an increase in turbidity from 0 to 9 1 0 5 or 17 6 0 5 ntu showed a negligible effect on the uvc disinfection efficiency test fs 2 table 2 was performed at 5 l min 3 5 mg l of ha and 13 7 0 5 ntu while test fs 3 was performed at 5 l min 3 5 mg l of ha and 19 7 0 5 ntu getting 1 91 0 21 and 2 02 0 55 lrv respectively tests fs 6 and fs 7 were carried out at 3 2 l min 0 mg l of ha and 4 9 0 5 and 14 0 5 ntu achieving 3 72 0 14 and 3 33 0 12 lrv the same trend was observed comparing tests fs 8 fs 9 and fs 10 these tests were carried out at 3 2 l min 3 5 mg l of ha and 0 0 and 17 6 0 5 ntu achieving 1 55 0 58 1 62 0 51 and 1 83 0 49 lrv respectively fig 5b demonstrates the clear different impact of the two parameters where small concentrations of ha 0 3 5 mg l have a greater effect over ms2 removal performance than those of turbidity 0 20 ntu changes it can be clearly seen that the inactivation of ms2 depends on the presence or absence of ha measured through uvt254 since it remains practically unchanged with varying turbidity levels in water 3 3 field tests results results from field testing are summarized in table 2 the initial turbidity of water from la miel ranged from 2 9 0 5 ntu to 3 5 0 4 ntu while from santa rita river ranged from 2 7 0 5 ntu to 6 8 1 6 ntu with an average particle removal of 70 5 turbidity levels after filtration were below 1 0 0 4 ntu and 1 7 0 4 ntu respectively the highest uvt254 values were found in la miel with 95 7 corresponding with 4 63 0 56 lrv and 5 08 0 35 lrv of ms2 in santa rita river with the lowest uvt254 value of 69 2 ms2 inactivation dropped to 3 51 0 28 lrv e coli concentration was always bdl 4 5 lrv and ms2 reduction was always 3 lrv 3 4 discussion previous works have reported a uvc fluence ranging from 1 to 9 mj cm2 for e coli inactivation 6 8 10 14 28 requiring a uvc dose of 8 4 mj cm2 for 4 lrv a range of 5 139 mj cm2 was indicated for ms2 inactivation 9 10 12 13 15 16 with dose values of 16 mj cm2 34 mj cm2 52 mj cm2 and 71 mj cm2 corresponding to 1 2 3 and 4 lrv this is in agreement with our results where ms2 showed higher resistance to uvc disinfection than e coli however the doses obtained in our study were slightly higher than previously published with required 108 mj cm2 ms2 and 21 mj cm2 e coli to attain 4 lrv in milli q water this could be due to the higher corrected uvc dose values considered for the inactivation experiments which ranged from 0 to 320 mj cm2 compared to those used in past studies 6 8 10 12 16 28 at full scale flow conditions uvc dose always exceeded the minimum of 40 mj cm2 for drinking water treatment recommended by the usepa 18 however it was not enough to get the same inactivation level for ms2 the water optical properties in the uvc region of the spectrum are of huge importance to understand and explain the disinfection results in the presence of dissolved organics nom and or ha and suspended inorganic matter turbidity according to previous authors 35 turbidity and uvc transmittance are the most important water parameters in uvc disinfection uvc transmittance is directly affected by the presence of light absorbing compounds including mainly nom usually dissolved among other chemicals 51 ha together with fulvic acids are the main constituents of nom which strongly absorb uvc and visible radiation and colour natural water resources 52 it is reported that ha small concentrations 3 5 mg l in water may absorb more than the 80 of the uvc radiation 53 on the contrary turbidity agents i e organic or inorganic particulate matter just scatter the light shielding the microorganisms and occasionally absorb uvc radiation reducing the uvc dose delivered over the microbial 54 previous articles report on the effect of turbidity of ms2 uvc inactivation showing non significant effect over the dose for turbidity below 30 ntu 34 35 55 but lower inactivation was reported with turbidity values up to 80 ntu in deionized water 37 this is in agreement with our work where in both experimental systems cb and flow uvc with the same water characteristics ha concentration and microorganisms load and flow rate turbidity up to 20 4 0 5 ntu slightly affected the inactivation efficiency of ms2 regarding ha it has been found as the most important factor to influence the killing uvc dose 34 39 53 on average in the presence of 3 5 mg l of ha in synthetic water uvt254 values were of 73 3 resulting in 1 7 lrv of ms2 vs 3 35 lrv in the absence of ha uvt254 of 88 7 field tests showed a reduction of 1 2 log units on ms2 inactivation when uvt254 dropped from 95 7 0 6 to 69 2 1 7 younis et al 36 tested a proprietary uvc reactor showing a reduction of 4 2 log units on ms2 inactivation when artificially reducing the uvt254 of water from 95 to 70 while the disinfection capacity of the system was not significantly impacted by turbidity values ranging from 0 to 18 ntu recently baldasso et al 34 claimed the critical role of dissolved nom and the irrelevant influence of turbidity on uvc disinfection for uvc transmittances above 77 and turbidity values under 5 ntu our results are in perfect agreement with these findings in addition some works have studied the uvc disinfection efficiency in natural waters just taking turbidity into consideration 35 37 38 when natural waters and especially surface waters are the results of a complex matrix of suspended and dissolved organic and inorganic matter so it might result in a limited interpretation of the contribution of turbidity to uvc disinfection in our study in both experimental configurations the differences in the inactivation efficiency relied on the presence absence of ha in water directly affecting the uvc required dose and thus the inactivation efficiency while turbidity slightly affected finally in order to confirm laboratory results and to assess the performance of the hwt system under real operation conditions field tests were also performed at household level in rural communities of colombia using natural water sources regarding the filtration unit with maximum turbidity levels of 22 3 1 6 ntu after sedimentation in laboratory testing effluent turbidity only reached the who hwt criterion of 5 ntu 45 for dirty filters its efficiency improved over time as a cake built up on its surface 50 on the other hand in field testing using spun filters and with maximum turbidity levels of 6 8 1 6 ntu effluent turbidity always met the who recommended threshold 5 ntu however pleated filters can be washed and reused several times without affecting its performance 50 significantly reducing the cost and improving sustainability of the hwt system in addition same trend was observed in uvc inactivation in both laboratory and field tests e coli was always bdl regardless of the water quality strain and flow rate 3 2 5 l min and 3 lrv of ms2 was achieved when uvt254 75 thus the hwt system was able to meet the who reduction requirements 41 not only in the laboratory but also in field testing natural water sources with natural particulate dissolve organic and inorganic matter and wild bacteria strains even in the worst water quality condition tested in the field santa rita river uvt254 of 69 2 1 7 and t of 6 8 1 6 ntu the system was able to achieve a protective level of 3 51 0 28 viral lrv 4 conclusions the results of this research clearly demonstrated the following 1 despite the detrimental effect of nom on uvc disinfection efficiency is well known the performance assessment of hwt systems based on uvc disinfection or proprietary uvc reactors is usually based on turbidity but no analysis or investigations are carried out about the complexity of natural water sources which interfere with uvc radiation in the water matrix and may have a critical role on their efficiency what is more works studying the uvc inactivation efficiency in natural water generally just monitor turbidity ignoring the complexity of natural water sources which might result in a limited interpretation of the contribution of turbidity to uvc disinfection 2 despite turbidity has generally been found to adversely affect uvc treatment as it increases the disinfection efficiency decreased solely in the presence of ha due to the absorption of uvc at 254 nm by ha molecules while turbidity of 20 4 0 5 ntu did not have a significant effect on uvc inactivation 3 the collimated beam tests in milli q or tap water could not be extrapolated to flow uvc systems operating with natural water sources the nom results showed a strong detrimental effect on uvt254 reducing the effectiveness of uvc disinfection therefore water quality should be considered before application of uvc 4 the effect of t and ha concentration on uvc disinfection efficiency followed the same trend in both experimental configurations collimated beam and flow system therefore the collimated beam results can be used as a preliminary step for the design of flow uvc reactors 5 5 lrv of ms2 was rarely reached in the conditions of this study maximum dose delivered 177

13317,enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr represents one of the most widely used wastewater systems for treating phosphorous bearing waste streams this study aimed to advance the current understanding of the diversity and interactions of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos playing a key role for the ebpr performance frequently occurring and predominant organisms consisted of paos such as tetrasphaera candidatus accumulibacter acinetobacter pseudomonas and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos such as defluvicoccus microlunatus nakamurella and kineosphaera the degree of immigrating paos gaos carried with the influent was associated with their succession within the ebpr processes ca accumulibacter and nakamurella were transported to a greater degree with the influents of combined and separate sewers respectively although no significant shifts in the pao gao community structure were observed across seasons using conventional ordination based analyses machine learning ml modeling using the pao gao microbiome data could successfully predict the ebpr system s environmental condition water temperature with linear and non linear models r2 of 0 4 0 7 ml based feature importance analysis identified two specific species populations ca accumulibacter pao and defluvicoccus gao strongly correlated with high water temperatures in contrast to the existing understanding based on laboratory experiments the positive association among ca accumulibacter defluvicoccus and the water temperature in full scale ebpr processes was validated with microbial association network analysis as well as the ml based results overall our ml enabled analysis could provide new findings about the interplay between paos and environmental factors which have practical implications for sustainable design and operation of full scale ebpr processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr wastewater treatment polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao glycogen accumulating organisms gao machine learning 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps combine various physicochemical and biological unit processes that serve as barriers to prevent environmental contamination of receiving water bodies enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr systems are designed to eliminate or recover phosphorous p from waste streams p mitigation is vital since excess p released with wastewater effluents into natural waters can cause eutrophication leading to harmful algal blooms and dead ecosystems ebpr systems have been widely used in full scale wwtps worldwide since their introduction in the 1970s 1 ebpr systems benefit from a unique p metabolism in polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos such as tetrasphaera candidatus accumulibacter and acinetobacter paos absorb p storing it as intracellular polyphosphate under aerobic conditions and releasing it under anaerobic conditions as a result ebpr systems employ a treatment train consisting of sequential anaerobic and aerobic tanks accumulated p in the sludge is separated from wastewater effluents in settling tanks that follow the treatment train since ebpr systems can be operated without chemical addition and generate less waste sludge than chemical processes they are considered cost effective and environmentally benign systems despite the long history ebpr processes still suffer from poor performances and unpredictable upsets leading to temporary or irreversible loss of ebpr the poor performances have been often associated with competition between paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos such as candidatus competibacter defluviicoccus and micropruina 2 gaos compete with paos for substrate and thus the enrichment of gaos results in the failure of ebpr a large body of literature reports environmental factors e g water temperature and redox condition affecting the competitive interaction between paos and gaos and thus the ebpr performances paos are considered low range mesophiles or psychrophiles based on cell growth kinetics experiments 3 metabolic modeling results show that paos are favored over gaos at low temperature 20 c while gaos tend to proliferate at high temperature 20 c 4 consistently gaos have competitive advantages over paos for substrate uptake at high temperature 20 30 c causing instable ebpr performance 5 6 at high temperatures the metabolic advantages of gaos over paos are particularly profound in anaerobic conditions rather than aerobic conditions highlighting the effects of redox conditions in regulating the competitive interaction 7 with the previous findings there has been a well known dogma that ebpr processes do not work well for warm wastewaters or in hot climate regions 8 however the previous findings i e unfavorable ebpr at high temperature 20 30 c have been concluded from laboratory experiments 3 6 whereas a recent field survey reports conflicting results that show successful ebpr performances at high temperature of 28 32 c 9 hence whether the negative interaction between paos and water temperature obtained from previous laboratory studies are indeed valid in full scale ebpr systems remains to be investigated diverse members of paos and gaos are found in full scale wwtps at regional and global scales 9 12 implying the presence of their complex interactions previously uncharacterized in laboratory experiments hence research questions to be addressed include the following 1 what specific populations of paos and gaos dominate and drive the ebpr performance in full scale wwtps 2 are the interactions between paos and gaos observed in previous laboratory experiments indeed valid in full scale ebpr processes 3 what is the interplay between paos and other environmental factors such as temperature redox conditions and wastewater influent sources in full scale wwtps this work aimed to address the above questions which has practical significance for decision making when designing and operating ebpr processes to reveal potential complex microbial interactions the present work carried out machine learning ml modeling using microbiome data obtained from full scale ebpr processes ml approaches using microbiome data have great potential for successfully inferring habitat features host health and ecosystem functions 13 15 in addition ml modeling approaches can identify key microbial players governing the functions of biological wastewater systems 16 17 and their complex interactions that could not be detected using conventional ordination based methods 18 19 although there are previous studies reporting the application of ml modeling for predicting the wwtp s system performance 20 the works primarily used operational parameters as data inputs with little attention to wastewater microbiome data i e the key drivers for wastewater treatment performances using ml modeling with wastewater microbiome data the present study was designed to reveal the diversity interaction and spatiotemporal succession of paos in full scale ebpr systems microbial communities of three full scale ebpr processes were examined using 16s rrna gene datasets revealing the effects of influent sources combined vs separate sewers and redox conditions anaerobic ana anoxic ano and aerobic ae on the succession of paos within the ebpr systems ml modeling with linear and non linear algorithms was performed to reveal the interplay among paos gaos and wastewater temperature at 15 30 c in the wwtps co occurrence network analysis using temporal community dynamics data was also performed to validate the ml based conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and 16s rrna gene sequencing the treatment trains of three full scale ebpr processes located in a metropolitan area gyeonggi do of korea were investigated in this study the average wastewater flow rates were 118 147 38 906 and 8319 m3 day for wwtp1 wwtp2 and wwtp3 respectively the three wwtps were operated with an annual water temperature of 22 c table s1 they are schematically described in fig s1 the ebpr trains consisted of at least three biological unit processes ana ano and ae a total of 36 samples were taken from the three full scale ebpr systems wwtp1 wwtp2 and wwtp3 in february 2018 triplicate mixed liquor samples were taken from the three parallel trains of the three biological unit processes ana ano and ae and wastewater influents those from primary settling tanks to the biological units respectively additionally a total of 12 samples were obtained from the anaerobic tanks of wwtp1 at varying water temperature from february 2018 to july 2019 dna extraction from the 48 samples was conducted using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen carlsbad ca usa dna quantity and quality were measured using a nano 400 hangzhou allsheng instruments co hangzhou china dna samples were pcr amplified using a primer targeting the hypervariable v3 v5 region of 16s rrna genes 21 and sequenced using a miseq sequencer macrogen inc south korea 2 2 analytical methods phosphorous and nitrogen compounds were measured using a dr 5000 uv vis spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer s protocol mixed liquor volatile suspended solids vss and total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod were measured following standard methods 22 wastewater quality parameters were measured for the triplicate samples collected at the endpoints of the three parallel treatment trains p release rates were estimated by subtracting po4 3 p of the primary effluent samples from those of the anaerobic tanks p uptake rates were estimated by subtracting po4 3 p of samples taken at aerobic tanks from those of anaerobic tanks 2 3 sequence analysis the miseq sequencing of dna samples from the three ebpr processes resulted in greater than 2 4 million 16s rrna gene sequences the raw pair end 16s rrna gene sequences were pre filtered using a miseq sop pipeline 23 as described previously 24 25 in brief the preprocessed sequences were further processed using chimera vserach for chimeric sequence removal using classify seqs for taxonomic classification and opticlust for clustering operational taxonomic units otus at the 97 nucleotide identity cutoff the analysis pipeline resulted in an otu table with the relative abundance normalized to the total size of a dataset across datasets all otu sequences were searched against a total of 53 sequences of the reference paos and gaos whose phenotypes were putative or experimentally verified 12 using blastn with a cutoff of 97 nucleotide identity and 90 query length coverage the blastn search identified a list of potential paos gaos occurring in the three ebpr systems 2 4 machine learning modeling the schematic representation of the ml regression modeling framework is depicted in fig s2 four regression models linear regression lr support vector regression with linear kernel svrl support vector regression with radial basis function kernel svrrbf and random forest rfr were used in this study for ml modeling these models were chosen because they provided two different linear and non linear algorithms to interpret complex properties from multiple perspectives ml modeling was performed as described previously 13 18 19 using a scikit learn 0 23 2 26 first the otu table dataset with relative abundances of paos gaos obtained from the miseq sop pipeline was randomly divided into training 80 and test 20 sets five cross validations were performed to optimize hyperparameters for each model using a random search within the training dataset 80 of the dataset was used for training and the other 20 was used for validating performance with a range of hyperparameters the hyperparameter that reached the best performance for the validation dataset was selected as the optimized setting this hyperparameter tuning was performed for every ml model as a result each ml model used an optimized hyperparameter to make predictions using the test hold out dataset the performance of the regression model was estimated in this study with two indices r2 and mean square error mse by comparing predicted and actual values feature weights were estimated using a one versus rest approach to estimate the predictive contribution of each feature within the two linear models lr and svrl as performed previously 27 for the non linear models svrrbf and rfr the contribution of a feature for the overall prediction decision was estimated as the shapley additive explanations shap value as suggested previously 28 statistical testing was conducted using the mann whitney u test with a significance threshold of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 diversity and spatial distribution of paos and gaos in full scale ebpr systems wwtp1 receiving combined sewer influents exhibited successful wastewater treatment performance table s1 over the entire sampling period meeting the wastewater effluent quality criteria in korea taxonomic analysis using mothur was performed for the overall wwtp1 community fig s3 proteobacteria dominated the communities 36 followed by baceroidetes 33 actinobacteria 5 3 ca saccharibacteria 5 1 chloroflexi 4 9 verrucomicrobia 3 0 and firmicutes 2 6 fourteen major families were overrepresented which included flavobacteriaceae 6 6 chitinophagaceae 6 5 comamonadaceae 5 3 rhodocyclaceae 4 5 saprospiraceae 4 0 and xanthomonadaceae 3 3 these taxa and their relative abundances were similar to those of activated sludge as communities in the full scale wwtps previously documented 25 29 32 a typical profile of po4 3 p via the treatment train showing release 5 5 7 4 mg p mg vss and uptake 7 7 9 0 mg p mg vss in wwtp1 is described in fig s1 the extent of release and uptake observed in wwtp1 was comparable to the 3 3 16 7 mg p mg vss of p release and 3 6 18 2 mg p mg vss of p uptake previously measured in other full scale ebpr processes 9 sequence homology search of the otu sequences identified a total of 18 putative paos and gaos combined phylogenetic analysis fig 1 revealed otus closely related to paos candidatus accumulibacter otu0012 tetrasphaera otu0030 otu0043 otu0077 otu0388 otu0437 and otu0438 acinetobacter otu0018 pseudomonas otu0106 microlunatus otu0569 malikia otu0654 and gaos defluviicoccus otu0244 micropruina otu0319 nakamurella otu0330 and kineosphaera otu0377 the 18 pao gao community members were plotted based on their occurrence frequency and average relative abundance in the anaerobic tanks over time fig 2a six paos ca accumulibacter t sp two t elogata p putida a johnsonii and two gaos d sp and a kaplicensis frequently occurred 90 and were relatively more abundant 0 01 than the others shifts in the pao gao community among the different redox conditions ana ano and ae were examined using non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds analysis fig 2b the nmds analysis displayed no clear distinction in community structure among the three pao gao communities a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova test showed no significant differences bonferroni corrected p 0 05 in community structure across the differential redox conditions which was consistent with no significant shift in bacterial community structure in three different redox conditions 18 the otus grouped with their potential role paos gaos and those that could be either pao or gao respectively did not significantly differ in their relative abundance among the redox conditions fig 2c the gaos 0 05 of the total were found to be numerically less abundant than the paos 4 2 of the total over the three biological unit processes and in the anaerobic tanks over a year fig 2 while many previously characterized paos inhabited wwtp1 ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera represented the two most abundant paos at least 13 subclades i a through i e and ii a through ii h belonging to ca accumulibacter have been phylogenetically classified their relative abundances in wwtps vary significantly with geographical regions 10 the ca accumulibacter population occurring at 0 7 to 2 6 relative abundance in wwtp1 was closely related to subclade iib with 97 nucleotide identity subclade iib and iic dominate full scale ebpr processes such as anaerobic oxic a o and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o with membrane separation units 9 subclades iib iic iia and i were dominant in the a2o virginia initiative plant vip a o and university of cape town uct processes 33 subclades ia iic and iib were abundant in the a o and modified uct processes 34 subclade iib overrepresented in wwtp1 was among the major subclades widely distributed across different ebpr systems and different countries climates however the association of specific ecotypes with a particular operational environmental condition remains unclear six otus were phylogenetically related to tetrasphaera otu0043 otu0077 otu 0437 and otu0438 affiliated with t elongata otu0030 affiliated with clade 3 and otu0388 affiliated with t japonica among others t elongata otu0043 related to clade 1 occurred frequently and was the most abundant 0 9 relative abundance followed by t sp clade 3 and t elongata populations 0 8 of otu0030 and 0 1 of otu0077 clade 1 the most abundant population in wwtp1 was also the sole tetrasphaera population present in other full scale ebpr processes 9 where in situ ebpr activities were experimentally verified using fluorescence in situ hybridization and metabolite staining methods tetrasphaera encompasses several species populations including t australiensis t jenkinsii t vanveenii and t veronensis in addition to those present in wwtp1 t elongata t japonica and clade 3 while t elongata and t japonica are representative populations abundant in many ebpr processes their metabolic potentials can differ significantly from each other 10 for example t elongata can perform nitrate reduction which has yet to be experimentally confirmed in t japonica t japonica can carry out pha storage while t elongata cannot defluviicoccus sp were the most abundant 0 08 on average among gaos whereas the other four gaos were underrepresented at least four clusters of defluviicoccus have been phylogenetically classified 12 the defluviicoccus population enriched in wwtp1 was closely related with 99 sequence identity to cluster 3 this group has a filamentous morphology associated with bulking which leads to poor sludge settleability 12 overall the 16s rrna gene based profiling revealed the diversity and structure of the pao gao communities at species level in the three individual unit processes of wwtp1 3 2 succession of paos and gaos in ebpr processes effects of redox condition immigration and influent source taxonomic analysis of the pao gao community members in the two full scale ebpr processes wwtp2 and wwtp3 was further performed these treatment plants were located in the same metropolitan area gyeong gi province korea as wwtp1 wwtp2 and wwtp3 treated municipal influents via combined and separate sewer systems respectively wwtp2 and wwtp3 employed a conventional a2o treatment train fig s1 wwtp2 and wwtp3 showed maximum releases 0 62 and 4 82 mg p mg vss respectively and uptakes 3 27 and 7 80 mg p mg vss respectively similar to wwtp1 the taxonomic analysis displays the relative abundances of the pao gao community members in the treatment trains of the three ebpr processes fig 3 no systematic evidence was observed for the differential occurrence of otus among the three different redox conditions a2o within the three ebpr processes the results implied that the paos and gaos might gain selective fitness through repeating cycles of anaerobic feast and aerobic famine conditions not disproportionately from a particular redox condition as suggested previously 35 consistently it is argued that dynamically changing conditions select for metabolically versatile organisms such as paos 36 the substantial relatedness in the community structure may have also resulted from the internal recycling e g 30 50 of recirculation from the secondary settling tank back to the foremost biological unit process within the ebpr processes no enrichment of the pao gao community members was observed using the dna based methods carried out in this study hence these results suggest future studies using multi omics approaches e g metatranscriptomic and metabolomics for identifying differentially active taxa and their in situ metabolic activities during the alternating redox conditions major or minor members of the pao gao community in wwtp1 were also found to be as major or minor ones in both wwtp2 and wwtp3 in addition the community members that were abundant in the influents were generally more abundant in the following ebpr treatment trains hence these results prompted us to investigate the extent to which the immigration of the paos gaos was related to their succession in the ebpr processes we plotted the abundance of the 18 pao gao community members in the influents relative to those within the three ebpr processes fig 4 pearson s correlation analysis was performed to determine the strength of the linear relationship the succession of the pao gao community members within the three ebpr processes was positively correlated 0 61 0 89 of pearson s r with p 0 05 with immigration one exception was acinetobacter which significantly decreased within the ebpr processes 0 14 0 53 relative to the wastewater influents 3 52 11 83 the underrepresentation of acinetobacter within the ebpr processes is in good agreement with their previously documented negative net growth rates 31 pearson s analysis was also carried out for all otus in the three wwtps fig s4 the analysis showed a moderate correlation 0 41 0 76 of pearson s r suggesting that the degree to which immigration affected succession was less pronounced than the pao gao community immigration dispersal represents one major ecological process affecting microbial community assemblies in natural and engineered ecosystems yet microbial community immigration via wastewater influents has been considered insignificant it is thought that immigrating cells are primarily associated with enteric organisms subject to natural decay outside of the host environment as a result their contributions to contaminant removal are believed to be much lower than those microorganisms actively growing and recycled within the wwtps hence biomass in the wastewater influents is rarely considered for design models and operational practices of biological wastewater treatment systems studies have however shown the influence of microbial immigration on community assembly and function in various engineered biological systems time series community analysis revealed detectable contributions of influent microbial communities to the temporal assembly of as communities 37 active nitrifiers are present in municipal wastewater influents and continuous immigration of the influent nitrifiers significantly affects nitrogen removal performance in terms of acclimation and stability 38 hence further experiments determining the in situ ebpr activities exclusively contributed by immigrating paos would help improve the design prediction of ebpr system performances wwtp1 and wwtp2 received domestic sewers mixed with storm rainwater via combined sewer systems whereas wwtp3 received exclusively domestic sewers via separate systems we compared the relative abundances of the immigrating paos gaos between the two types of influent sources shifts in community structure were examined using nmds analysis fig 5a the inter community distance index combined vs separate was 0 49 much lower than intra community distance indices for the combined 0 86 and separate 0 74 sewer communities the permanova test revealed significant differences bonferroni corrected p 0 05 in the community structures between combined and separate sewers the relative abundances of most otus were comparable fig 5b however notable differences in acinetobacter 3 0 times more abundant in the combined and nakamurella 4 1 times more abundant in the separate were observed sewer systems transport organisms from various wastewater sources during which they provide unique environmental niches e g sewer sediments and biofilms for traveling microorganisms to thrive the extent of microbial inputs including biofilm growth on inner pipe surfaces has been previously determined in drinking water distribution networks 39 acinetobacter is the gram negative aerobic alphaproteobacterial genus with more than 30 species taxonomically identified acinetobacter includes clinical populations associated with pathogens and antibiotic resistance it has ecological importance occurring in a variety of soil sediment and freshwater samples 40 the acinetobacter population abundant in combined sewer influents a johnsonii is among the dominant members occurring in environmental samples 41 four species have been taxonomically classified in the nakamurella genus which are often observed in as soils and sediments 42 hence the substantial abundance of acinetobacter and nakamurella in combined sewer sources fig 5 and their known ecological niches previously documented implied their immigration via runoff from natural terrestrial aquatic habitats on the other hand wastewater quality indices showed that po4 3 p ph and cod were significantly p 0 05 higher in separate sewers than combined sewers hence abiotic environmental factors of combined separate sewer systems might exert selective pressures on the pao gao community members overall the comprehensive survey could address the effects of influent sources and redox conditions on the succession of paos and gaos in the three wwtps 3 3 ml modeling insights into complex interactions among paos gaos and water temperature to infer the interplay between the pao gao community and seasonal fluctuations an nmds analysis was first performed with the bray curtis distance metric using the pao gao community data fig 6a the distance indices within each season were 0 79 0 07 spring 0 73 0 10 summer 0 70 0 10 fall and 0 72 0 12 winter which were not significantly higher than those between seasons a permanova test also suggested no significant differences bonferroni corrected p 0 05 of the community structure between the seasons similar results were obtained using other ordination analyses such as principal component pc fig 6b and principal coordinate pco fig 6c analyses these results highlighted no significant temporal alterations in the pao gao community structure observable by using conventional ordination based methods ml regression modeling with supervised learning algorithms was performed to predict water temperature target variable using the same pao gao community data data inputs used in fig 6 predictive performance with optimized hyperparameters tables s2 was assessed using the linear lr and svrl and non linear rfr and svrrbf models respectively the four models were evaluated based on their r2 and mse values fig s5 the coefficients of determination for two non linear models rfr and svrrbf were higher r2 of 0 68 0 69 than the linear models r2 of 0 40 0 47 the predictive performance based on mse values was similar to those based on the r2 values showing lower mse values with svrrbf and rfr 4 7 4 9 than those of lr and svrl 8 2 9 2 regression analysis of model predictions with actual data showed that the svrrbf model had the highest r2 and the lowest mse values fig 7a the water temperature predicted using ml modeling closely simulated the two peaks summer and valleys winter of actual water temperature fig 7b these results strongly suggested that the pao gao community microbiome data can reflect seasonal temperature variability ml modeling can provide predictive categorical decisions or regression by analyzing input data features in addition ml modeling can be used to identify features that contribute to the predictive decision regression and provide quantifiable ranks for their respective contributions to the decision regression the ml based feature important analysis was performed in this study to infer the interactions among paos gaos and water temperature which was not clearly elucidated using the conventional ordination based methods fig 6 the present study used the shap method based on the shapley value concept developed from cooperative game theory 43 the shap method gives a relative impact contribution index shap value to each feature otu in a cooperative coalition of the pao gao community for a particular predictive regression in this case water temperature the shap values of the features were plotted for the two non linear models fig 7c which showed higher predictive capabilities fig s5 the features were ranked in the order of the mean absolute shap value for the given model regression for example for the svrrbf model a johnsonii displayed the highest shap value 0 95 of mean absolute value followed by ca a sp 0 93 t sp 0 62 t elongata 0 56 p putida 0 55 and d sp 0 32 in contrast other taxa had shap values of less than 0 26 the dot plot illustrates whether a feature contributes positively or negatively to water temperature prediction the dot colour shows whether the feature is in high in red or low relative abundance in blue for the direction of the shap value the positive red dots of a feature plotted with positive shap values on the right x axis suggest that the features ca a sp and d sp are associated with an increase in water temperature in contrast the negative blue dots of a feature plotted with negative shap values such as a johnsonii t elongata and t sp suggest an association with decreasing water temperature the shap method employed generates a list of taxa that are indicative of high water temperature and the quantifiable importance of each taxon the direction and magnitude of the shap method guide how the non linear models work to predict the seasonal characteristics next we constructed microbial association networks among the pao gao community and water temperature fig 8 to infer microbial interactions among taxa and environmental factors the association networks were based on pearson s correlation metric with a cutoff of absolute pearson s r 0 5 and p 0 05 ca a sp and d sp were found to have positive associations with water temperature these results are consistent with the fact that these two taxa displayed the highest shap for ml modeling with non linear algorithms fig 7 four members of tetrasphaera were positively related to each other but all four members were negatively associated with one of the gaos d sp two members of tetrasphaera were associated negatively with a kaplicensis and no members of tetrasphara were significantly associated with ca a sp both ml modeling and microbial network analysis collectively suggested that the interactions among paos gaos and water temperature were population specific our study showed in contrast to the previous laboratory results the positive association between ca accumulibacter and high water temperature the enrichment of ca accumulibacter with increasing temperature is supported by multiple lines of evidence involving linear and non linear algorithms such as ml modeling and network analyses in figs 7 and 8 as aforementioned in the introduction numerous laboratory experiments suggest that paos ca accumulibacter may not be successful at higher water temperatures 3 6 a previous field survey using a polyphosphate kinase 1 ppk1 gene primer 34 reports that ca accumulibacter clade ii positively correlates with temperature while the overall ca accumulibacter community remains stable over the seasons in another field investigation ca accumulibacter is found to be dominant in full scale ebpr processes in tropical countries such as singapore at 28 32 c 9 therefore our and previous field surveys consistently support the succession of specific ca accumulibacter populations with high water temperature at least in full scale wwtps 3 4 implication and practical consideration for managing full scale ebpr processes our study showed that the interactions of paos with gaos and water temperature respectively in full scale wwtps can be population specific further some pao populations ca accumulibacter subclade iib could be successful at high temperatures even with the presence of gao populations defluvicoccus cluster 3 in contrast to the existing knowledge the results of this study based on field surveys with other recent laboratory results 44 45 have practical implications since these results would be supportive for the installation of a ebpr process for treating warm wastewaters or in hot climate regions which is contradictory to the well known dogma about ebpr processes 8 it should be noted that although temperature variation can directly shape the pao gao community it can result in changes to other environmental factors affecting the community assembly while wastewaters travel from domestic and industrial sources to wwtps various natural transformations of organic matter occur in sewer networks a certain fraction 15 of natural organic matter may naturally transform in sewer networks 46 substantial amounts of volatile fatty acids vfas are detectable in wastewater influents in korea 47 the formation of vfas in sewer networks varies by seasonal changes and tends to increase during warm periods 48 acetate and propionate two major vfas in sewer influents can affect the performance of ebpr processes 46 48 notably propionate increases with in situ fermentation in long sewer networks and at warmer temperatures while acetate decreases 46 fermentative paos tetrasphaera and gaos micropruina can ferment amino acids and sugars whereas canonical paos and gaos require vfas as primary substrates for example tetrasphaera is capable of aerobic p uptake and anaerobic fermentation of sugars and amino acids without polyhydroxyalkanoates pha cycling the latter mechanism is not present in the classical pao ca accumulibacter 49 among the various vfas propionate is thought to provide selective fitness for the survival of both ca accumulibacter and defluvicoccus 50 the latter of which was found to correlate with water temperature in our study figs 7 and 8 overall these results show that water temperature affects the strength and type of vfas within sewer networks and the individual or combined factors further influence on the pao gao community assembly we conjecture that the interplay between the pao gao community and the influent vfas can be marked in ebpr systems such as wwtp1 3 in this study that have no external carbon sources those often used in anoxic tanks for enhancing denitrification therefore the results of this study suggest future monitoring campaigns for the types and concentrations of vfas in wastewater influents over time in relation to the pao gao interaction the ml enabled investigation performed in this study informed the predictable pattern of the diversity occurrence of paos over time which would not had been observed with laboratory experiments using single pao isolates the predictive understanding of paos has implications and practical considerations for sustainable management of full scale ebpr processes a recent study suggests that ml modeling using operational parameters data inputs can predict the performance of a biological nutrient removal process 51 in addition to typical abiotic parameters our study showed that microbiome data could be also successfully used for predicting an operating condition of a wwtp although uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for ml modeling was not performed in this study the analysis will be effective for enhancing ml modeling performance when dealing with datasets including noisy or uncertain data the present study reported that different keystone pao species populations persisted and dominated the pao community of the full scale wwtps upon seasonal variations one of the frequent operational problems of full scale wwtps in korea and other countries include the poor wastewater effluent quality not meeting the discharge standard associated with p removal hence when system upset and poor performance associated with p removal are detected in full scale ebpr processes by daily weekly monitoring practices the predictive understanding of paos would help wastewater engineers operators determine which paos to be closely examined with a high priority to find out the cause of the poor performance further given the known physiology of each pao associated with its primary substrate e g vfas amino acids and sugars the predictive understanding would also help wastewater engineers operators develop appropriate

13317,enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr represents one of the most widely used wastewater systems for treating phosphorous bearing waste streams this study aimed to advance the current understanding of the diversity and interactions of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos playing a key role for the ebpr performance frequently occurring and predominant organisms consisted of paos such as tetrasphaera candidatus accumulibacter acinetobacter pseudomonas and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos such as defluvicoccus microlunatus nakamurella and kineosphaera the degree of immigrating paos gaos carried with the influent was associated with their succession within the ebpr processes ca accumulibacter and nakamurella were transported to a greater degree with the influents of combined and separate sewers respectively although no significant shifts in the pao gao community structure were observed across seasons using conventional ordination based analyses machine learning ml modeling using the pao gao microbiome data could successfully predict the ebpr system s environmental condition water temperature with linear and non linear models r2 of 0 4 0 7 ml based feature importance analysis identified two specific species populations ca accumulibacter pao and defluvicoccus gao strongly correlated with high water temperatures in contrast to the existing understanding based on laboratory experiments the positive association among ca accumulibacter defluvicoccus and the water temperature in full scale ebpr processes was validated with microbial association network analysis as well as the ml based results overall our ml enabled analysis could provide new findings about the interplay between paos and environmental factors which have practical implications for sustainable design and operation of full scale ebpr processes graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr wastewater treatment polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao glycogen accumulating organisms gao machine learning 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps combine various physicochemical and biological unit processes that serve as barriers to prevent environmental contamination of receiving water bodies enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr systems are designed to eliminate or recover phosphorous p from waste streams p mitigation is vital since excess p released with wastewater effluents into natural waters can cause eutrophication leading to harmful algal blooms and dead ecosystems ebpr systems have been widely used in full scale wwtps worldwide since their introduction in the 1970s 1 ebpr systems benefit from a unique p metabolism in polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos such as tetrasphaera candidatus accumulibacter and acinetobacter paos absorb p storing it as intracellular polyphosphate under aerobic conditions and releasing it under anaerobic conditions as a result ebpr systems employ a treatment train consisting of sequential anaerobic and aerobic tanks accumulated p in the sludge is separated from wastewater effluents in settling tanks that follow the treatment train since ebpr systems can be operated without chemical addition and generate less waste sludge than chemical processes they are considered cost effective and environmentally benign systems despite the long history ebpr processes still suffer from poor performances and unpredictable upsets leading to temporary or irreversible loss of ebpr the poor performances have been often associated with competition between paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos such as candidatus competibacter defluviicoccus and micropruina 2 gaos compete with paos for substrate and thus the enrichment of gaos results in the failure of ebpr a large body of literature reports environmental factors e g water temperature and redox condition affecting the competitive interaction between paos and gaos and thus the ebpr performances paos are considered low range mesophiles or psychrophiles based on cell growth kinetics experiments 3 metabolic modeling results show that paos are favored over gaos at low temperature 20 c while gaos tend to proliferate at high temperature 20 c 4 consistently gaos have competitive advantages over paos for substrate uptake at high temperature 20 30 c causing instable ebpr performance 5 6 at high temperatures the metabolic advantages of gaos over paos are particularly profound in anaerobic conditions rather than aerobic conditions highlighting the effects of redox conditions in regulating the competitive interaction 7 with the previous findings there has been a well known dogma that ebpr processes do not work well for warm wastewaters or in hot climate regions 8 however the previous findings i e unfavorable ebpr at high temperature 20 30 c have been concluded from laboratory experiments 3 6 whereas a recent field survey reports conflicting results that show successful ebpr performances at high temperature of 28 32 c 9 hence whether the negative interaction between paos and water temperature obtained from previous laboratory studies are indeed valid in full scale ebpr systems remains to be investigated diverse members of paos and gaos are found in full scale wwtps at regional and global scales 9 12 implying the presence of their complex interactions previously uncharacterized in laboratory experiments hence research questions to be addressed include the following 1 what specific populations of paos and gaos dominate and drive the ebpr performance in full scale wwtps 2 are the interactions between paos and gaos observed in previous laboratory experiments indeed valid in full scale ebpr processes 3 what is the interplay between paos and other environmental factors such as temperature redox conditions and wastewater influent sources in full scale wwtps this work aimed to address the above questions which has practical significance for decision making when designing and operating ebpr processes to reveal potential complex microbial interactions the present work carried out machine learning ml modeling using microbiome data obtained from full scale ebpr processes ml approaches using microbiome data have great potential for successfully inferring habitat features host health and ecosystem functions 13 15 in addition ml modeling approaches can identify key microbial players governing the functions of biological wastewater systems 16 17 and their complex interactions that could not be detected using conventional ordination based methods 18 19 although there are previous studies reporting the application of ml modeling for predicting the wwtp s system performance 20 the works primarily used operational parameters as data inputs with little attention to wastewater microbiome data i e the key drivers for wastewater treatment performances using ml modeling with wastewater microbiome data the present study was designed to reveal the diversity interaction and spatiotemporal succession of paos in full scale ebpr systems microbial communities of three full scale ebpr processes were examined using 16s rrna gene datasets revealing the effects of influent sources combined vs separate sewers and redox conditions anaerobic ana anoxic ano and aerobic ae on the succession of paos within the ebpr systems ml modeling with linear and non linear algorithms was performed to reveal the interplay among paos gaos and wastewater temperature at 15 30 c in the wwtps co occurrence network analysis using temporal community dynamics data was also performed to validate the ml based conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and 16s rrna gene sequencing the treatment trains of three full scale ebpr processes located in a metropolitan area gyeonggi do of korea were investigated in this study the average wastewater flow rates were 118 147 38 906 and 8319 m3 day for wwtp1 wwtp2 and wwtp3 respectively the three wwtps were operated with an annual water temperature of 22 c table s1 they are schematically described in fig s1 the ebpr trains consisted of at least three biological unit processes ana ano and ae a total of 36 samples were taken from the three full scale ebpr systems wwtp1 wwtp2 and wwtp3 in february 2018 triplicate mixed liquor samples were taken from the three parallel trains of the three biological unit processes ana ano and ae and wastewater influents those from primary settling tanks to the biological units respectively additionally a total of 12 samples were obtained from the anaerobic tanks of wwtp1 at varying water temperature from february 2018 to july 2019 dna extraction from the 48 samples was conducted using a dneasy powersoil kit qiagen carlsbad ca usa dna quantity and quality were measured using a nano 400 hangzhou allsheng instruments co hangzhou china dna samples were pcr amplified using a primer targeting the hypervariable v3 v5 region of 16s rrna genes 21 and sequenced using a miseq sequencer macrogen inc south korea 2 2 analytical methods phosphorous and nitrogen compounds were measured using a dr 5000 uv vis spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer s protocol mixed liquor volatile suspended solids vss and total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod and chemical oxygen demand cod were measured following standard methods 22 wastewater quality parameters were measured for the triplicate samples collected at the endpoints of the three parallel treatment trains p release rates were estimated by subtracting po4 3 p of the primary effluent samples from those of the anaerobic tanks p uptake rates were estimated by subtracting po4 3 p of samples taken at aerobic tanks from those of anaerobic tanks 2 3 sequence analysis the miseq sequencing of dna samples from the three ebpr processes resulted in greater than 2 4 million 16s rrna gene sequences the raw pair end 16s rrna gene sequences were pre filtered using a miseq sop pipeline 23 as described previously 24 25 in brief the preprocessed sequences were further processed using chimera vserach for chimeric sequence removal using classify seqs for taxonomic classification and opticlust for clustering operational taxonomic units otus at the 97 nucleotide identity cutoff the analysis pipeline resulted in an otu table with the relative abundance normalized to the total size of a dataset across datasets all otu sequences were searched against a total of 53 sequences of the reference paos and gaos whose phenotypes were putative or experimentally verified 12 using blastn with a cutoff of 97 nucleotide identity and 90 query length coverage the blastn search identified a list of potential paos gaos occurring in the three ebpr systems 2 4 machine learning modeling the schematic representation of the ml regression modeling framework is depicted in fig s2 four regression models linear regression lr support vector regression with linear kernel svrl support vector regression with radial basis function kernel svrrbf and random forest rfr were used in this study for ml modeling these models were chosen because they provided two different linear and non linear algorithms to interpret complex properties from multiple perspectives ml modeling was performed as described previously 13 18 19 using a scikit learn 0 23 2 26 first the otu table dataset with relative abundances of paos gaos obtained from the miseq sop pipeline was randomly divided into training 80 and test 20 sets five cross validations were performed to optimize hyperparameters for each model using a random search within the training dataset 80 of the dataset was used for training and the other 20 was used for validating performance with a range of hyperparameters the hyperparameter that reached the best performance for the validation dataset was selected as the optimized setting this hyperparameter tuning was performed for every ml model as a result each ml model used an optimized hyperparameter to make predictions using the test hold out dataset the performance of the regression model was estimated in this study with two indices r2 and mean square error mse by comparing predicted and actual values feature weights were estimated using a one versus rest approach to estimate the predictive contribution of each feature within the two linear models lr and svrl as performed previously 27 for the non linear models svrrbf and rfr the contribution of a feature for the overall prediction decision was estimated as the shapley additive explanations shap value as suggested previously 28 statistical testing was conducted using the mann whitney u test with a significance threshold of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 diversity and spatial distribution of paos and gaos in full scale ebpr systems wwtp1 receiving combined sewer influents exhibited successful wastewater treatment performance table s1 over the entire sampling period meeting the wastewater effluent quality criteria in korea taxonomic analysis using mothur was performed for the overall wwtp1 community fig s3 proteobacteria dominated the communities 36 followed by baceroidetes 33 actinobacteria 5 3 ca saccharibacteria 5 1 chloroflexi 4 9 verrucomicrobia 3 0 and firmicutes 2 6 fourteen major families were overrepresented which included flavobacteriaceae 6 6 chitinophagaceae 6 5 comamonadaceae 5 3 rhodocyclaceae 4 5 saprospiraceae 4 0 and xanthomonadaceae 3 3 these taxa and their relative abundances were similar to those of activated sludge as communities in the full scale wwtps previously documented 25 29 32 a typical profile of po4 3 p via the treatment train showing release 5 5 7 4 mg p mg vss and uptake 7 7 9 0 mg p mg vss in wwtp1 is described in fig s1 the extent of release and uptake observed in wwtp1 was comparable to the 3 3 16 7 mg p mg vss of p release and 3 6 18 2 mg p mg vss of p uptake previously measured in other full scale ebpr processes 9 sequence homology search of the otu sequences identified a total of 18 putative paos and gaos combined phylogenetic analysis fig 1 revealed otus closely related to paos candidatus accumulibacter otu0012 tetrasphaera otu0030 otu0043 otu0077 otu0388 otu0437 and otu0438 acinetobacter otu0018 pseudomonas otu0106 microlunatus otu0569 malikia otu0654 and gaos defluviicoccus otu0244 micropruina otu0319 nakamurella otu0330 and kineosphaera otu0377 the 18 pao gao community members were plotted based on their occurrence frequency and average relative abundance in the anaerobic tanks over time fig 2a six paos ca accumulibacter t sp two t elogata p putida a johnsonii and two gaos d sp and a kaplicensis frequently occurred 90 and were relatively more abundant 0 01 than the others shifts in the pao gao community among the different redox conditions ana ano and ae were examined using non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds analysis fig 2b the nmds analysis displayed no clear distinction in community structure among the three pao gao communities a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova test showed no significant differences bonferroni corrected p 0 05 in community structure across the differential redox conditions which was consistent with no significant shift in bacterial community structure in three different redox conditions 18 the otus grouped with their potential role paos gaos and those that could be either pao or gao respectively did not significantly differ in their relative abundance among the redox conditions fig 2c the gaos 0 05 of the total were found to be numerically less abundant than the paos 4 2 of the total over the three biological unit processes and in the anaerobic tanks over a year fig 2 while many previously characterized paos inhabited wwtp1 ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera represented the two most abundant paos at least 13 subclades i a through i e and ii a through ii h belonging to ca accumulibacter have been phylogenetically classified their relative abundances in wwtps vary significantly with geographical regions 10 the ca accumulibacter population occurring at 0 7 to 2 6 relative abundance in wwtp1 was closely related to subclade iib with 97 nucleotide identity subclade iib and iic dominate full scale ebpr processes such as anaerobic oxic a o and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o with membrane separation units 9 subclades iib iic iia and i were dominant in the a2o virginia initiative plant vip a o and university of cape town uct processes 33 subclades ia iic and iib were abundant in the a o and modified uct processes 34 subclade iib overrepresented in wwtp1 was among the major subclades widely distributed across different ebpr systems and different countries climates however the association of specific ecotypes with a particular operational environmental condition remains unclear six otus were phylogenetically related to tetrasphaera otu0043 otu0077 otu 0437 and otu0438 affiliated with t elongata otu0030 affiliated with clade 3 and otu0388 affiliated with t japonica among others t elongata otu0043 related to clade 1 occurred frequently and was the most abundant 0 9 relative abundance followed by t sp clade 3 and t elongata populations 0 8 of otu0030 and 0 1 of otu0077 clade 1 the most abundant population in wwtp1 was also the sole tetrasphaera population present in other full scale ebpr processes 9 where in situ ebpr activities were experimentally verified using fluorescence in situ hybridization and metabolite staining methods tetrasphaera encompasses several species populations including t australiensis t jenkinsii t vanveenii and t veronensis in addition to those present in wwtp1 t elongata t japonica and clade 3 while t elongata and t japonica are representative populations abundant in many ebpr processes their metabolic potentials can differ significantly from each other 10 for example t elongata can perform nitrate reduction which has yet to be experimentally confirmed in t japonica t japonica can carry out pha storage while t elongata cannot defluviicoccus sp were the most abundant 0 08 on average among gaos whereas the other four gaos were underrepresented at least four clusters of defluviicoccus have been phylogenetically classified 12 the defluviicoccus population enriched in wwtp1 was closely related with 99 sequence identity to cluster 3 this group has a filamentous morphology associated with bulking which leads to poor sludge settleability 12 overall the 16s rrna gene based profiling revealed the diversity and structure of the pao gao communities at species level in the three individual unit processes of wwtp1 3 2 succession of paos and gaos in ebpr processes effects of redox condition immigration and influent source taxonomic analysis of the pao gao community members in the two full scale ebpr processes wwtp2 and wwtp3 was further performed these treatment plants were located in the same metropolitan area gyeong gi province korea as wwtp1 wwtp2 and wwtp3 treated municipal influents via combined and separate sewer systems respectively wwtp2 and wwtp3 employed a conventional a2o treatment train fig s1 wwtp2 and wwtp3 showed maximum releases 0 62 and 4 82 mg p mg vss respectively and uptakes 3 27 and 7 80 mg p mg vss respectively similar to wwtp1 the taxonomic analysis displays the relative abundances of the pao gao community members in the treatment trains of the three ebpr processes fig 3 no systematic evidence was observed for the differential occurrence of otus among the three different redox conditions a2o within the three ebpr processes the results implied that the paos and gaos might gain selective fitness through repeating cycles of anaerobic feast and aerobic famine conditions not disproportionately from a particular redox condition as suggested previously 35 consistently it is argued that dynamically changing conditions select for metabolically versatile organisms such as paos 36 the substantial relatedness in the community structure may have also resulted from the internal recycling e g 30 50 of recirculation from the secondary settling tank back to the foremost biological unit process within the ebpr processes no enrichment of the pao gao community members was observed using the dna based methods carried out in this study hence these results suggest future studies using multi omics approaches e g metatranscriptomic and metabolomics for identifying differentially active taxa and their in situ metabolic activities during the alternating redox conditions major or minor members of the pao gao community in wwtp1 were also found to be as major or minor ones in both wwtp2 and wwtp3 in addition the community members that were abundant in the influents were generally more abundant in the following ebpr treatment trains hence these results prompted us to investigate the extent to which the immigration of the paos gaos was related to their succession in the ebpr processes we plotted the abundance of the 18 pao gao community members in the influents relative to those within the three ebpr processes fig 4 pearson s correlation analysis was performed to determine the strength of the linear relationship the succession of the pao gao community members within the three ebpr processes was positively correlated 0 61 0 89 of pearson s r with p 0 05 with immigration one exception was acinetobacter which significantly decreased within the ebpr processes 0 14 0 53 relative to the wastewater influents 3 52 11 83 the underrepresentation of acinetobacter within the ebpr processes is in good agreement with their previously documented negative net growth rates 31 pearson s analysis was also carried out for all otus in the three wwtps fig s4 the analysis showed a moderate correlation 0 41 0 76 of pearson s r suggesting that the degree to which immigration affected succession was less pronounced than the pao gao community immigration dispersal represents one major ecological process affecting microbial community assemblies in natural and engineered ecosystems yet microbial community immigration via wastewater influents has been considered insignificant it is thought that immigrating cells are primarily associated with enteric organisms subject to natural decay outside of the host environment as a result their contributions to contaminant removal are believed to be much lower than those microorganisms actively growing and recycled within the wwtps hence biomass in the wastewater influents is rarely considered for design models and operational practices of biological wastewater treatment systems studies have however shown the influence of microbial immigration on community assembly and function in various engineered biological systems time series community analysis revealed detectable contributions of influent microbial communities to the temporal assembly of as communities 37 active nitrifiers are present in municipal wastewater influents and continuous immigration of the influent nitrifiers significantly affects nitrogen removal performance in terms of acclimation and stability 38 hence further experiments determining the in situ ebpr activities exclusively contributed by immigrating paos would help improve the design prediction of ebpr system performances wwtp1 and wwtp2 received domestic sewers mixed with storm rainwater via combined sewer systems whereas wwtp3 received exclusively domestic sewers via separate systems we compared the relative abundances of the immigrating paos gaos between the two types of influent sources shifts in community structure were examined using nmds analysis fig 5a the inter community distance index combined vs separate was 0 49 much lower than intra community distance indices for the combined 0 86 and separate 0 74 sewer communities the permanova test revealed significant differences bonferroni corrected p 0 05 in the community structures between combined and separate sewers the relative abundances of most otus were comparable fig 5b however notable differences in acinetobacter 3 0 times more abundant in the combined and nakamurella 4 1 times more abundant in the separate were observed sewer systems transport organisms from various wastewater sources during which they provide unique environmental niches e g sewer sediments and biofilms for traveling microorganisms to thrive the extent of microbial inputs including biofilm growth on inner pipe surfaces has been previously determined in drinking water distribution networks 39 acinetobacter is the gram negative aerobic alphaproteobacterial genus with more than 30 species taxonomically identified acinetobacter includes clinical populations associated with pathogens and antibiotic resistance it has ecological importance occurring in a variety of soil sediment and freshwater samples 40 the acinetobacter population abundant in combined sewer influents a johnsonii is among the dominant members occurring in environmental samples 41 four species have been taxonomically classified in the nakamurella genus which are often observed in as soils and sediments 42 hence the substantial abundance of acinetobacter and nakamurella in combined sewer sources fig 5 and their known ecological niches previously documented implied their immigration via runoff from natural terrestrial aquatic habitats on the other hand wastewater quality indices showed that po4 3 p ph and cod were significantly p 0 05 higher in separate sewers than combined sewers hence abiotic environmental factors of combined separate sewer systems might exert selective pressures on the pao gao community members overall the comprehensive survey could address the effects of influent sources and redox conditions on the succession of paos and gaos in the three wwtps 3 3 ml modeling insights into complex interactions among paos gaos and water temperature to infer the interplay between the pao gao community and seasonal fluctuations an nmds analysis was first performed with the bray curtis distance metric using the pao gao community data fig 6a the distance indices within each season were 0 79 0 07 spring 0 73 0 10 summer 0 70 0 10 fall and 0 72 0 12 winter which were not significantly higher than those between seasons a permanova test also suggested no significant differences bonferroni corrected p 0 05 of the community structure between the seasons similar results were obtained using other ordination analyses such as principal component pc fig 6b and principal coordinate pco fig 6c analyses these results highlighted no significant temporal alterations in the pao gao community structure observable by using conventional ordination based methods ml regression modeling with supervised learning algorithms was performed to predict water temperature target variable using the same pao gao community data data inputs used in fig 6 predictive performance with optimized hyperparameters tables s2 was assessed using the linear lr and svrl and non linear rfr and svrrbf models respectively the four models were evaluated based on their r2 and mse values fig s5 the coefficients of determination for two non linear models rfr and svrrbf were higher r2 of 0 68 0 69 than the linear models r2 of 0 40 0 47 the predictive performance based on mse values was similar to those based on the r2 values showing lower mse values with svrrbf and rfr 4 7 4 9 than those of lr and svrl 8 2 9 2 regression analysis of model predictions with actual data showed that the svrrbf model had the highest r2 and the lowest mse values fig 7a the water temperature predicted using ml modeling closely simulated the two peaks summer and valleys winter of actual water temperature fig 7b these results strongly suggested that the pao gao community microbiome data can reflect seasonal temperature variability ml modeling can provide predictive categorical decisions or regression by analyzing input data features in addition ml modeling can be used to identify features that contribute to the predictive decision regression and provide quantifiable ranks for their respective contributions to the decision regression the ml based feature important analysis was performed in this study to infer the interactions among paos gaos and water temperature which was not clearly elucidated using the conventional ordination based methods fig 6 the present study used the shap method based on the shapley value concept developed from cooperative game theory 43 the shap method gives a relative impact contribution index shap value to each feature otu in a cooperative coalition of the pao gao community for a particular predictive regression in this case water temperature the shap values of the features were plotted for the two non linear models fig 7c which showed higher predictive capabilities fig s5 the features were ranked in the order of the mean absolute shap value for the given model regression for example for the svrrbf model a johnsonii displayed the highest shap value 0 95 of mean absolute value followed by ca a sp 0 93 t sp 0 62 t elongata 0 56 p putida 0 55 and d sp 0 32 in contrast other taxa had shap values of less than 0 26 the dot plot illustrates whether a feature contributes positively or negatively to water temperature prediction the dot colour shows whether the feature is in high in red or low relative abundance in blue for the direction of the shap value the positive red dots of a feature plotted with positive shap values on the right x axis suggest that the features ca a sp and d sp are associated with an increase in water temperature in contrast the negative blue dots of a feature plotted with negative shap values such as a johnsonii t elongata and t sp suggest an association with decreasing water temperature the shap method employed generates a list of taxa that are indicative of high water temperature and the quantifiable importance of each taxon the direction and magnitude of the shap method guide how the non linear models work to predict the seasonal characteristics next we constructed microbial association networks among the pao gao community and water temperature fig 8 to infer microbial interactions among taxa and environmental factors the association networks were based on pearson s correlation metric with a cutoff of absolute pearson s r 0 5 and p 0 05 ca a sp and d sp were found to have positive associations with water temperature these results are consistent with the fact that these two taxa displayed the highest shap for ml modeling with non linear algorithms fig 7 four members of tetrasphaera were positively related to each other but all four members were negatively associated with one of the gaos d sp two members of tetrasphaera were associated negatively with a kaplicensis and no members of tetrasphara were significantly associated with ca a sp both ml modeling and microbial network analysis collectively suggested that the interactions among paos gaos and water temperature were population specific our study showed in contrast to the previous laboratory results the positive association between ca accumulibacter and high water temperature the enrichment of ca accumulibacter with increasing temperature is supported by multiple lines of evidence involving linear and non linear algorithms such as ml modeling and network analyses in figs 7 and 8 as aforementioned in the introduction numerous laboratory experiments suggest that paos ca accumulibacter may not be successful at higher water temperatures 3 6 a previous field survey using a polyphosphate kinase 1 ppk1 gene primer 34 reports that ca accumulibacter clade ii positively correlates with temperature while the overall ca accumulibacter community remains stable over the seasons in another field investigation ca accumulibacter is found to be dominant in full scale ebpr processes in tropical countries such as singapore at 28 32 c 9 therefore our and previous field surveys consistently support the succession of specific ca accumulibacter populations with high water temperature at least in full scale wwtps 3 4 implication and practical consideration for managing full scale ebpr processes our study showed that the interactions of paos with gaos and water temperature respectively in full scale wwtps can be population specific further some pao populations ca accumulibacter subclade iib could be successful at high temperatures even with the presence of gao populations defluvicoccus cluster 3 in contrast to the existing knowledge the results of this study based on field surveys with other recent laboratory results 44 45 have practical implications since these results would be supportive for the installation of a ebpr process for treating warm wastewaters or in hot climate regions which is contradictory to the well known dogma about ebpr processes 8 it should be noted that although temperature variation can directly shape the pao gao community it can result in changes to other environmental factors affecting the community assembly while wastewaters travel from domestic and industrial sources to wwtps various natural transformations of organic matter occur in sewer networks a certain fraction 15 of natural organic matter may naturally transform in sewer networks 46 substantial amounts of volatile fatty acids vfas are detectable in wastewater influents in korea 47 the formation of vfas in sewer networks varies by seasonal changes and tends to increase during warm periods 48 acetate and propionate two major vfas in sewer influents can affect the performance of ebpr processes 46 48 notably propionate increases with in situ fermentation in long sewer networks and at warmer temperatures while acetate decreases 46 fermentative paos tetrasphaera and gaos micropruina can ferment amino acids and sugars whereas canonical paos and gaos require vfas as primary substrates for example tetrasphaera is capable of aerobic p uptake and anaerobic fermentation of sugars and amino acids without polyhydroxyalkanoates pha cycling the latter mechanism is not present in the classical pao ca accumulibacter 49 among the various vfas propionate is thought to provide selective fitness for the survival of both ca accumulibacter and defluvicoccus 50 the latter of which was found to correlate with water temperature in our study figs 7 and 8 overall these results show that water temperature affects the strength and type of vfas within sewer networks and the individual or combined factors further influence on the pao gao community assembly we conjecture that the interplay between the pao gao community and the influent vfas can be marked in ebpr systems such as wwtp1 3 in this study that have no external carbon sources those often used in anoxic tanks for enhancing denitrification therefore the results of this study suggest future monitoring campaigns for the types and concentrations of vfas in wastewater influents over time in relation to the pao gao interaction the ml enabled investigation performed in this study informed the predictable pattern of the diversity occurrence of paos over time which would not had been observed with laboratory experiments using single pao isolates the predictive understanding of paos has implications and practical considerations for sustainable management of full scale ebpr processes a recent study suggests that ml modeling using operational parameters data inputs can predict the performance of a biological nutrient removal process 51 in addition to typical abiotic parameters our study showed that microbiome data could be also successfully used for predicting an operating condition of a wwtp although uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for ml modeling was not performed in this study the analysis will be effective for enhancing ml modeling performance when dealing with datasets including noisy or uncertain data the present study reported that different keystone pao species populations persisted and dominated the pao community of the full scale wwtps upon seasonal variations one of the frequent operational problems of full scale wwtps in korea and other countries include the poor wastewater effluent quality not meeting the discharge standard associated with p removal hence when system upset and poor performance associated with p removal are detected in full scale ebpr processes by daily weekly monitoring practices the predictive understanding of paos would help wastewater engineers operators determine which paos to be closely examined with a high priority to find out the cause of the poor performance further given

13318,this study reports the electrochemical oxidation of methyl paraben mep in synthetic wastes in the presence of surfactants using boron doped diamond bdd anode and the interfering effect of the surfactants in mep removal the selected surfactants cationic anionic and neutral were used at critical micellar concentrations cmc and below with measurements performed to evaluate the removal rates of mep and total organic carbon toc the effects of current density 15 30 and 45 ma cm 2 surfactant concentration and initial ph on the efficiency of the electrochemical oxidation process were analyzed at low concentrations the interfering effect of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds was greater than that of the cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab the complete mineralization of mep sds was achieved at 45 ma cm 2 in 2 h this was attributed to the generation of persulfate radicals at current densities higher than 15 ma cm 2 genapol c 100 genapol exerted less interference during the mineralization of mep genapol compared to the systems containing other surfactants at cmc mep removal was favored by the use of a basic medium the increase in surfactant concentration decreased the efficiency of mep and toc removal due to the formation of micelles and the intensity of mep surfactant interactions apart from the increase in organic load in the system ctab interacted more with the ionic form of mep in the basic medium compared to the other surfactants all these factors influenced the mineralization of organic compounds in the systems keywords methyl paraben mep surfactants boron doped diamond bdd critical micellar concentration cmc 1 introduction soil contamination has become a major environmental concern over the past few decades apart from affecting ecosystems soil contamination can alter the quality of groundwater or make the water unsuitable for human consumption 1 in view of that when chemical contaminants accidentally spill into the soil one needs to use efficient techniques capable of removing the contaminants from the soil and prevent the spread of pollution 2 3 one of the external remediation techniques that have been employed for the treatment of chemical contaminants in the soil is soil washing this technique involves the use of liquids usually aqueous solutions with different types of extractors organic compounds acids surfactants etc to remove chemical pollutants from the soil the contaminated soil is mixed with the water containing the extractors in an agitated extraction unit after washing soil particles are expected to settle and the washing solution can be separated and regenerated or sent to a landfill 4 although several studies published in the literature have proposed different mechanisms for the extraction of contaminants from the soil only few of these studies have effectively demonstrated how to recover washed solutions or products resulting from the soil washing process 4 5 soil washing techniques have been used for the treatment of soil contaminated by pollutants such as organochlorine compounds 6 10 herbicides acetochlor alachlor meth alachlor dimethenamid 11 phenanthrene 12 among other highly contaminating compounds the washing of the soil with surfactants enables one to extract the contaminants from the soil and this paves the way toward the further treatment of the soil leading to the efficiency in contaminants removal of 60 99 4 depending on the nature of the pollutant to be extracted a wide range of solvents can be applied in the soil washing mechanism some of the solvents applied in this mechanism have included synthetic surfactants biosurfactants and organic solvents such as cyclodextrin alcohols petroleum ether fractions among others 4 5 surfactants have been widely applied in the soil washing mechanism because they exhibit low surface tension in aqueous solutions and have been found to improve the solubility of persistent environmental pollutants present in the soil surfactants are amphipathic organic molecules that present both polar and non polar parts 13 based on the group present in the polar head 14 surfactants can be classified as anionic cationic non ionic and amphoteric compounds and they can behave as acid or base according to the ph of the medium 13 15 surfactants have been widely used for the removal of contaminants in the soil due to their highly efficient ability to capture contaminating molecules the present work aimed to study the treatment of effluents from soil washing based on the application of synthetic effluents to simulate an effluent from soil washing methyl paraben in bicarbonate medium was used in the presence of three surfactants which consisted of the following i the anionic group sodium dodecyl sulfate sds ii the cationic group cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and iii the non ionic group genapol c 100 1 1 genapol c 100 is a natural fatty alcohol ethoxylate based on linear carbon chains used as a wetting dispersing and emulsifying agent genapol table 1 anionic surfactants have a negative charge in the polar part of the molecule this region has oxygen atoms of high electronegativity which attract electrons from neighboring carbons and hydrogens and this further contributes toward increasing the negative polarity of the region thus the negative charges are concentrated at the end of the anionic surfactant increasing its ability to attract water molecules hence anionic surfactants are found to be highly soluble in water in addition anionic surfactants are strongly influenced by the presence of electrolytes in the solution solubilized salts or extreme ph values 15 cationic surfactants on the other hand have a positive charge in the molar part of the molecule this type of surfactants is relatively more toxic in aquatic environments compared to other types of surfactants the high degree of toxicity observed in cationic surfactants can be attributed to the presence of quaternary nitrogen in the polar part of the surfactants in addition the physical chemical characteristics of cationic surfactants can be influenced by the presence of electrolytes in the solution and by extreme ph values 15 nonionic surfactants are widely used in biodegradation processes due to their lack of charges and low critical micellar concentration cmc these characteristics help minimize any toxic effects 16 and favor the anodic oxidation of the by products 17 genapol is an aliphatic chain alcohol which is composed of alkyl chains of 9 18 carbon atoms and 5 23 ethoxylated groups this alcohol can be found in different environments and at varying concentrations 18 one of the essentially relevant properties of surfactants is the critical micellar concentration cmc this is an intrinsic property of each surfactant and represents the concentration at which the process involving the formation of micelles begins the use of high concentrations of surfactants to solubilize polluting substances results in the generation of effluents with greater complexity which are more difficult to treat than the contaminants themselves 19 20 thus the amount of surfactant required to solubilize pollutants is an important factor to consider particularly in soil remediation processes because the application of a high concentration of surfactants into the soil can cause serious damage to the environment if the surfactants are discarded into water bodies 19 surfactants are also widely used in various cleaning and beauty products and thus interact with different molecules including parabens which are commonly found in water bodies due to their widespread use 21 25 in the present study methyl paraben mep was chosen as a model molecule for this class of contaminants as it is a harmful molecule that can cause imbalances in hormonal systems substances like parabens are widely used as preservatives in foods cosmetics personal care products and even in drugs because of their low cost 24 26 27 as a result the occurrence of these substances in aqueous media and also in soils has been increasingly frequent and they can interact with surfactants in the case of soil cleaning and form compounds with a higher degree of danger 28 32 the interaction of the mep with the surfactants can effectively influence the degradation of mep this interaction can lead to a reduction in both the energy efficiency and the degree of mineralization furthermore the countless by products formed in the interaction between the mep and the surfactants can be relatively more toxic than the mep 33 35 the traditional techniques applied in water and sewage treatment plants are not highly efficient when it comes to the removal of the contaminants of emerging concern cecs present in water 36 thus different alternative methods have been proposed for the remediation of these compounds that contaminate soil and water among the alternative techniques applied include biological 37 39 and chemical processes 40 41 advanced oxidation processes aop 42 47 and advanced electrochemical oxidation processes eaop 36 48 50 compared to the other alternative treatment processes eaops have been found to exhibit high efficiency when it comes to the removal of cecs such as parabens from the environment 51 56 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have been widely employed for the treatment of contaminants in water due to their ease of operation scale up facilities high efficiency in removing organic pollutants and relatively lower energy consumption 56 59 the electro generation of hydroxyl radicals oh occurs on the surfaces of non active electrodes such as bdd during the electrolysis of water eq 1 these radicals which are physisorbed on the anode surface can react with organic molecules and promote the mineralization of the compounds eq 2 1 h 2 o ddb bdd oh h e 2 r m oh c o 2 h 2 o boron doped diamond bdd has been found to be very efficient when employed as anode in flow reactors this efficiency of bdd is attributed to the presence of physisorbed hydroxyl radicals on its surface oh which provides the anode with oxidation potential of 2 2 2 6 in acid media 58 a number of studies that employed bdd anodes for the removal of contaminants reported to have obtained close to 100 efficiency in terms of the removal of organic phenols dyes acetylsalicylic acid oxalic formic acid and preservatives most of these studies mainly employed anodic oxidation with relatively low current for the treatment of the compounds of interest 60 64 while silicon has been widely used as a substrate for bdd anodes because its higher adhesion to the bdd film and lower thermal expansion coefficient cetsi 2 5 10 60 c 1 65 more recently other materials including ti ta and nb have been used as substrate for presenting good electrical conductivity and mechanical resistance 66 some of these materials which have been more recently employed as substrates for bdd anodes have been shown to have some non negligible advantages over silicon for instance niobium has been found to be easier to use as bdd substrate in terms of scaling up eaops to industrial levels compared to silicon 57 67 several studies reported in the literature have shown that bdd anodes supported on niobium nb bdd exhibit greater efficiency when it comes to the treatment of textile effluents drugs carboxylic acids and methyl paraben 64 66 68 69 thus the present study aimed to evaluate the interfering effect of three types of surfactants during the degradation of mep based on the application a nb bdd anode reactor the study sought to evaluate the influence of the surfactants on mep degradation based on the variation of current density and surfactant concentration below cmc and at cmc as well as the effect of the variation of ph for the systems in the presence and absence of the surfactants furthermore to better assess the effectiveness of the treatment technique proposed in this study the general current efficiency and energy consumption per unit of mass were calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated effluent the simulated effluent was prepared using 0 3 l ultrapure water milli q millipore resistivity 18 mω 200 mg l 1 of methyl paraben cas 99 76 3 sigma aldrich 500 mg l 1 sodium bicarbonate cas 144 55 8 synth and one of the surfactants the following surfactants were employed in the experiments sodium dodecyl sulfate sds cas 151 21 3 hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab cas 57 09 0 and genapol c 100 genapol cas 61791 13 7 all the surfactants were used in different concentrations considering the respective critical micellar concentrations cmc all the surfactants were acquired from sigma aldrich 2 2 determination of the critical micellar concentration cmc of the surfactants the critical micellar concentration cmc values for all the three selected surfactants were determined using sodium bicarbonate medium in the presence of mep the cmc values were determined by conductivity techniques table 1 due to the neutral character of genapol we were unable to determine its experimental cmc through conductivity based on the results shown in table 2 the cmc value obtained for the sds in aqueous medium was found to be in agreement with the values reported in the literature 70 71 the cmc value obtained for sds was found to drop sharply in the medium containing bicarbonate and methyl paraben from 8 8 to 1 6 and 1 4 10 3 mol l 1 there were no significant variations in the cmc value obtained for ctab in the medium applied bicarbonate in the presence of methyl paraben the studies involving the use of genapol did not take concentrations below the cmc into account as these would require small amounts of the surfactant leading to a significant increase in weighing errors in view of that the surfactant concentration employed for the analysis of the effect of the applied current density was 0 08 10 3 mol l 1 2 3 experimental set up electrochemical oxidation experiments were carried out in a condias gmbh reactor with five circular sets of electrodes in series and each set was composed of a porous nb bdd anode with active area ca 4 1 cm2 disposed between two stainless steel cathodes with the aid of a peristaltic pump operating at 9 ml s 1 the reactor was connected to a glass reservoir with a capacity of 0 5 l and a stabilized dc power supply as shown in fig 1 2 4 analytical procedure 2 4 1 determination of mep the shimadzu multispec 1501 spectrometer was used for the conduct of spectrometric analyses the spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm the aliquots were diluted 13 5 ratio of 160 μl of sample to 2 ml of water given that the mep peak varied according to the ph value the calibration curves were constructed taking into account the different maximum wavelengths λ máx thus for the systems containing mep λ máx 255 nm was employed for ph 3 and 8 while λ máx 295 nm was employed for ph 11 72 73 2 4 2 determination of sds concentration to determine the concentration of sds an adapted technique was employed based on the simplified methodology proposed by jurado et al 74 the methodology involved the reaction of the sds with sodium tetraborate phenolphthalein methylene blue and chloroform and the complex formed sds methylene blue was extracted and transferred into the organic phase subsequently the aqueous phase obtained was diluted and analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer using a 10 ml test tube the sample containing the sds was diluted 100 times this was followed by the addition of 200 μl of sodium tetraborate solution 4 6 drops of phenolphthalein 100 μl of methylene blue and 4 ml of chloroform in this order soon afterwards the tube was shaken vigorously for 1 min and left idle for 5 min the spectral reading was done using a shimadzu multispec 1501 spectrophotometer with λ máx of 656 nm 2 4 3 determination of residual persulfate ions the methodology proposed by liang et al 75 was used to determine persulfate ions s2o8 2 for the systems containing sds this method involved in situ chemical oxidation isco technology in which s2o8 2 was made to undergo reaction with ki in the presence of nahco3 forming a yellow iodine solution which exhibited maximum absorption λ máx between 288 and 353 nm aliquots of 250 μl of the samples were mixed with 2 ml of the isco solution 1 20 nahco3 ki respectively so the concentration of persulfate varied from 2 to 44 μmol l 1 the samples were diluted 10 times homogenized and left idle for 15 min before the uv vis spectral measurements were performed the calibration plots were constructed using λ máx 353 nm as recommended by liang et al 75 the analysis of mineralization efficiency was conducted by total organic carbon toc using the shimadzu toc vcph total organic carbon analyzer made in japan the chemical oxygen demand cod of the sds samples was determined using a digestion spectrophotometry dichromate method thus a 2 5 ml sample was added to a digestion solution potassium dichromate and a catalyst solution silver sulfate this mixture was subjected to digestion for 120 min at 150 c using a drb200 hach reactor and the cod measurement performed using a dr890 hach colorimeter 2 5 general current efficiency and energy consumption the general current efficiency gce in was estimated for each simulated effluent at a given electrolysis time t s using the following equation 3 gce 2 67 toc i toc f f v s 8 i t 100 where vs is the volume of treated solution l f is the faraday constant 96

electrolysis time under three different applied current densities j app ma cm 2 in the absence and presence of the surfactants sds ctab and genapol the results obtained showed that in the absence of the surfactants the degradation of mep follows a pseudo first order kinetics fig 1s with the constant rate k obs 10 4 s 1 dependent on the applied current density 64 77 table 1s shows the values obtained for k obs mep removal rate toc removal rate gce and ec under each applied current density in the presence of surfactants changes were observed in the kinetics of mep removal this showed that the surfactants played an interfering role in terms of the removal of mep at the current density of 15 ma cm 2 fig 2a the mep ctab mixture exhibited the greatest interfering effect during electrolysis with k obs 2 2 10 4 s 1 and 94 9 mep removal rate in 2 h of electrolysis the mep genapol and mep sds systems presented less interfering effect compared to the mep ctab system with mep removal rates of 64 8 60 2 and 37 3 obtained for the mep genapol mep sds and mep ctab systems respectively in one hour of electrolysis see table 1s at the current density of 30 ma cm 2 fig 2b both the systems containing sds and ctab recorded similar interfering effects with k obs 4 10 4 s 1 and mep removal rates of 78 4 and 71 2 in 1 h of electrolysis interestingly the mep genapol system presented a mep removal profile quite similar to that of the system containing only mep with mep removal rate of about 82 mep genapol and k obs 5 4 10 4 s 1 by increasing the current density to 45 ma cm 2 fig 2c there was a significant reduction in the interfering effect of the surfactants with different surfactant mixtures recording similar k obs values and mep removal rates ranging from 82 to 86 in 1 h of electrolysis see fig 2c and table 1s as can be observed in fig 2 in general an increase in the current density resulted in a decrease in the interfering effect of the surfactants in terms of mep removal furthermore with the current density increase a considerable increase in the mineralization of systems containing surfactants occurred as well an increase in current density caused a more significant effect in the mep sds and mep ctab systems compared to the mep genapol system the application of a current density of 45 ma cm 2 led to toc removal rates of 69 6 93 3 and 84 6 for mep sds mep ctab and mep genapol systems respectively in one hour of electrolysis fig 3 however the application of high current densities ranging from 15 to 45 ma cm 2 implies the use of high electrical charges ranging from 3 8 to 11 5 103c l 1 for the degradation of the compound of interest in a short period of time in 1 h this means that a greater portion of energy is lost through secondary reactions eqs 5 7 as demonstrated by lanzarini lopes et al 78 thus the gce eq 3 and ec kw h gtoc 1 eq 4 were estimated in order to gain a better understanding of the results obtained 5 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 6 2 oh h 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o fig 4 shows the occurrence of a significant reduction in gce along with an increase in ec kw h gtoc 1 based on the applied current density for all the systems investigated with regard to the mineralization of mep the application of current density of 15 ma cm 2 in 2 h of electrolysis led to an increase in current efficiency and a decrease in energy consumption fig 4 the systems containing ctab and genapol obtained gce and ce values very close to those obtained for mep this evidenced the low influence of these surfactants on the mineralization of organic compounds caused by the low concentration attributed to ctab 0 1 10 3 mol l 1 and genapol 0 08 10 3 mol l 1 although the mep sds system presented remarkable results among the systems investigated here this system recorded the highest gce and the lowest ec compared to the other systems the results presented by the mep sds system may be attributed to the formation of persulfate radicals due to the increase in current density 79 also the amount of organic load removed from the mep sds system 140 2 mg l 1 at the current density of 15 ma cm 2 was slightly higher compared to the systems composed of mep ctab mep genapol and mep only presenting removed toc of 132 6 116 7 and 119 4 mg l 1 respectively in two hours of electrolysis based on the results obtained from fig 4 the lowest current density was chosen for the conduct of subsequent experiments the results obtained also enabled us to optimize parameters such as electrolysis time efficiency and operating costs during the scaling up process of the electrochemical apparatus 78 80 3 2 sds oxidation to study the influence of the anionic surfactant sds on the removal of mep the surfactant was subjected to degradation in nahco3 medium by application of the current densities of 15 30 and 45 ma cm 2 the degradation of the surfactant and the changes in chemical oxygen demand cod were monitored over a 2 h period of electrolysis table 3 the results obtained from this degradation analysis showed that an increase in current density did not promote an increase in the rate of sds removal however there was a gradual increase in cod removal efficiency with an improvement of 11 when the current density was increased from 30 to 45 ma cm 2 looking at fig 5 one will observe that there was a significant increase in the concentration of persulfate in the solution when the current density was increased from 15 to 45 ma cm 2 with cod removal efficiencies of 62 8 and 83 0 respectively table 3 mohebrad et al 81 studied the effect of current density on sds degradation where they observed an improvement in the removal of the surfactant with the application of low current densities ranging from 0 75 to 6 15 ma cm 2 the authors found the current density of 3 125 ma cm 2 as the ideal current density for the removal of sds a comparative analysis of these results shows that the removal rate of sds does not change with the increase in current density from 15 to 30 ma cm 2 table 3 escalona durán et al 82 also found a dependent relationship between the production of oxidizing species and the current density according to escalona durán et al 2020 the application of a current density of 60 ma cm 2 instead of 20 ma cm 2 led to a greater accumulation of persulfate radical and a 25 improvement in the degradation of sds the improvement in the surfactant removal was attributed to the presence of high amount of oxidizing species hydroxyl and persulfate radicals produced by the non active anode 2 82 according to the results obtained fig 5 the electrolysis of a solution containing sds in a bicarbonate medium tends to release persulfate radicals in solution with an increase in current density which would explain the increase in gce however it was not possible to quantify the persulfate generated during electrolysis in the mep sds system a fact that can be attributed to the presence of mep degradation by products 3 44 64 it is worth noting that the surfactant also has a chain of 12 carbons the presence of this chain of carbons yields a large amount of organic load that is expected to be consumed by the oxidizing species generated in the solution 3 82 83 3 3 concentration effect to gain a better understanding of the interfering effect of the surfactants on the removal of mep experiments were carried out using solutions containing mep and the surfactants at cmc for sds and ctab and at above cmc for genapol in nahco3 medium table 2 to conduct these experiments the current density of 15 ma cm 2 was applied in order to avoid the formation of foam and the consequent loss of organic matter during the electrolysis it is worth pointing out that the application of the current density of 15 ma cm 2 promoted a higher gce and lower ec in previous experiments conducted using low concentrations of surfactants fig 6 shows the kinetics of the systems in the presence and absence of the surfactants at cmc and above cmc fig 7 shows the toc removal rates of the system with mep only and for the systems composed of mep surfactants at different concentrations based on the results obtained in these analyses it can be confirmed that the degradation of mep followed a pseudo first order kinetics with k obs 4 4 10 4 s 1 as mentioned previously in addition there was a 1 7 2 and 2 3 fold decrease in the value of k obs 10 4 s 1 for the systems containing sds ctab and genapol respectively in comparison with the k obs values obtained for the system containing only mep for the systems containing ctab and genapol the value of k obs was calculated after 36 min looking at figs 6 and 7 and tables 1s and 2s one can conclude that an increase in the concentration of the surfactants led to a significant reduction in toc and mep removal rates as well as in the constant rate kobs 10 4 s 1 the interfering effects may have been triggered by two factors one of these factors is the increase in organic load with the increase in the surfactant concentration as shown in table 3s when the ctab concentration was increased from 0 1 to 0 91 10 3 mol l 1 there was an increase of 141 4 in the amount of organic matter in toc concentration and this caused a 69 drop in the toc removal rate and a decrease of 22 7 in mep removal rate as shown in table 1s and 2s the other factor has to do with the formation of micelles between the contaminant and the surfactant hindering the removal of mep and toc this can be found to have occurred noticeably in the systems containing cationic surfactant ctab which had more affinity with the mep molecule in its ionic form phi 8 this affinity promoted stronger bonds between the mep and ctab molecules the results obtained from the mep removal rates showed that the system containing ctab presented mep removal rate of 71 81 while the system with sds exhibited mep removal rate of 88 74 in addition the cationic surfactant presented relatively lower toc removal rate 43 9 compared to the anionic surfactant 63 1 after 3 h of electrolysis fig 3s this result showed that there was clearly a significant interaction between the ctab and mep genapol was used in a concentration close to its cmc of 0 075 10 3 mol l 1 in h2o with equivalent toc of approximately 12 56 mg l 1 a comparison of the mep removal rates obtained for the solution containing only mep and the solution containing mep genapol showed that the latter exhibited a 1 3 fold reduction in k obs 10 4 s 1 and a slight decay in mep removal compared to the former precisely the mep genapol recorded a mep removal rate of 94 36 in 2 h of electrolysis see fig 1s and table 1s the mep genapol 0 08 10 3 mol l 1 system presented a slight decrease of around 11 6 in the toc removal rate compared to the system containing mep only see fig 7 this decrease was equivalent to the increase in toc promoted by the addition of a non ionic surfactant in the system table 3s furthermore the sample containing genapol exhibited total toc removal in the solution after 3 h of electrolysis however the application of a higher concentration of genapol 0 5 10 3 mol l 1 in the mep genapol system see table 3s led to a decrease in the mineralization of the system 54 4 with a reduction in both the value of kobs 1 8 10 4 s 1 and the mep removal rate 13 2 compared to the results obtained from the application of a lower concentration of genapol 0 08 10 3 mol l 1 tables 1s and 2s as a neutral surfactant genapol does not interact ionically with the mep molecule and does not significantly interfere in mep removal when applied at low concentration in the same way as the ctab however genapol exerts a more evident suppression effect in the removal of high concentration mep thus the concentration of the surfactant and the degree of interaction between the mep molecule and the surfactant are among the key factors that can significantly interfere in the removal of the organic pollutant as well as in the efficiency of mineralization during the anodic oxidation process under the application of the bdd nb anode the application of a higher concentration of surfactants leads to the formation of micelles and a higher initial concentration of toc micelles act as an interfering agent in the removal process once a protective environment is formed around the organic pollutant leading to a reduction in the availability of target molecules for bdd oh 84 one should note however that free micelle compounds surfactant monomers can still be oxidized and mep removal is likely to occur even when one employs a current density of 15 ma cm 2 and a higher concentration of surfactant the results obtained from the 3 h of electrolysis showed mep removal of 92 2 77 9 and 87 7 for the systems containing sds ctab and genapol respectively fig 3s for purposes of comparison trelluet al 76 employed bdd based anodic oxidation at the current density of 2 1 ma cm 2 for the degradation of phenanthrene anthracene pyrene and fluoranthene in the presence of a neutral surfactant tw80 it took the authors 23 h of treatment to degrade 83 90 77 and 75 of the compounds respectively this shows that the reactor employed in our present study fig 1 is highly efficient for the removal of contaminants in the presence of different types of surfactants using a relatively low current density and a short time of electrolysis 3 4 the effect of ph as can be observed in fig 8 mep λ 254 nm remained in its original form when the ph applied was between 3 and 6 5 one will note that even in nahco3 medium the bicarbonate ions hco3 will not be present in the solution due to the acidification of the solution with h2so4 this can be demonstrated by the following equation 8 h 2 s o 4 nahc o 3 na 2 s o 4 c o 2 h 2 o between ph 6 5 to 8 0 one observes the occurrence of a transition with the coexistence of two forms of mep when its molecule resonates λ 255 nm and when the molecule is in its ionic form at λ 296 nm with the pka nahco3 6 5 the bicarbonate starts to influence the formation of the ionic form of mep when the medium becomes more basic the cation na tends to bind to the oh of the medium thus mep undergoes resonance and accepts na and it subsequently assumes its ionic form λ 296 nm with the addition of naoh to adjust the basic ph naoh may remain in the solution at the inflection point when λ 269 7 nm the two ionic species of mep coexist at this point called the isobestic point the probability of forming the basic or acidic species of mep is equal some previous studies reported in the literature have described the chemical structures of mep associated with uv spectra in naoh medium 73 in phosphate medium with ph 7 and acid medium 72 85 as shown by bledzka et al 86 the transition process of mep at different ph values fig 8 is similar to that of butyl paraben bledzka et al 86 show the absorbance spectra of butyl paraben at different ph values based on these data the authors were able to determine the acid base equilibrium constant fig 9 shows the kinetics of mep in acid ph 3 and basic ph 8 and 11 medium here one will observe that the application of ph 3 and 8 yielded similar results in terms of the removal of mep however the application of a more alkaline medium led to faster removal of mep with a mep removal rate of 99 2 obtained in 2 h of electrolysis table 2s this result was obtained in an alkaline medium at ph 11 in this condition the ionic form of mep remains in the solution and as it is more unstable it becomes easier to degrade fig 10 shows the removal of mep as a function of time min for the systems containing mep only and mep surfactants where the surfactants were applied at cmc or above cmc table 2 the results obtained showed that the removal of mep in both media followed the sequence mep mep sds mep ctab mep genapol in an acidic environment there was a dramatic decline in conductivity with the transformation of nahco3 to co2 under these conditions electrolysis is impaired by the deficiency of electron transfer and this makes it difficult for the current to pass through the electrolytic medium in this case the system with sds was favored by the presence of sulfate ions released by this molecule a faster rate of pollutants degradation was observed in the basic environment for all the systems investigated table 2s the results obtained for toc removal in 2 h of electrolysis fig 11 showed a significant increase in the mineralization of the organic pollutants for the system with and without surfactants when the ph of the solution was changed from 3 to 8 the ph 11 provided a slight increase in toc removal for the solution containing sds on the other hand for the solutions containing ctab and genapol the toc removal increased respectively 17 5 and 20 when the value of ph increased from 3 to 11 table 2s these results show that mep can be easily degraded when it is in the ionic form apart from that the interaction of mep with surfactants leads to the formation of products that may be more difficult to be mineralized 72 86 4 conclusions based on the discussions presented it can be concluded that several factors influence the electrochemical degradation of mep in the presence of surfactants with the use of bdd anodes among which i the nature of the surfactant when the surfactant is ionic with the opposite charge to the ionic form of the pollutant the interaction with the pollutant molecule is promoted forming micelles that are more difficult to break this occurred with the system containing mep ctab 0 91 10 3 mol l 1 ii electrolysis

13318,this study reports the electrochemical oxidation of methyl paraben mep in synthetic wastes in the presence of surfactants using boron doped diamond bdd anode and the interfering effect of the surfactants in mep removal the selected surfactants cationic anionic and neutral were used at critical micellar concentrations cmc and below with measurements performed to evaluate the removal rates of mep and total organic carbon toc the effects of current density 15 30 and 45 ma cm 2 surfactant concentration and initial ph on the efficiency of the electrochemical oxidation process were analyzed at low concentrations the interfering effect of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds was greater than that of the cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab the complete mineralization of mep sds was achieved at 45 ma cm 2 in 2 h this was attributed to the generation of persulfate radicals at current densities higher than 15 ma cm 2 genapol c 100 genapol exerted less interference during the mineralization of mep genapol compared to the systems containing other surfactants at cmc mep removal was favored by the use of a basic medium the increase in surfactant concentration decreased the efficiency of mep and toc removal due to the formation of micelles and the intensity of mep surfactant interactions apart from the increase in organic load in the system ctab interacted more with the ionic form of mep in the basic medium compared to the other surfactants all these factors influenced the mineralization of organic compounds in the systems keywords methyl paraben mep surfactants boron doped diamond bdd critical micellar concentration cmc 1 introduction soil contamination has become a major environmental concern over the past few decades apart from affecting ecosystems soil contamination can alter the quality of groundwater or make the water unsuitable for human consumption 1 in view of that when chemical contaminants accidentally spill into the soil one needs to use efficient techniques capable of removing the contaminants from the soil and prevent the spread of pollution 2 3 one of the external remediation techniques that have been employed for the treatment of chemical contaminants in the soil is soil washing this technique involves the use of liquids usually aqueous solutions with different types of extractors organic compounds acids surfactants etc to remove chemical pollutants from the soil the contaminated soil is mixed with the water containing the extractors in an agitated extraction unit after washing soil particles are expected to settle and the washing solution can be separated and regenerated or sent to a landfill 4 although several studies published in the literature have proposed different mechanisms for the extraction of contaminants from the soil only few of these studies have effectively demonstrated how to recover washed solutions or products resulting from the soil washing process 4 5 soil washing techniques have been used for the treatment of soil contaminated by pollutants such as organochlorine compounds 6 10 herbicides acetochlor alachlor meth alachlor dimethenamid 11 phenanthrene 12 among other highly contaminating compounds the washing of the soil with surfactants enables one to extract the contaminants from the soil and this paves the way toward the further treatment of the soil leading to the efficiency in contaminants removal of 60 99 4 depending on the nature of the pollutant to be extracted a wide range of solvents can be applied in the soil washing mechanism some of the solvents applied in this mechanism have included synthetic surfactants biosurfactants and organic solvents such as cyclodextrin alcohols petroleum ether fractions among others 4 5 surfactants have been widely applied in the soil washing mechanism because they exhibit low surface tension in aqueous solutions and have been found to improve the solubility of persistent environmental pollutants present in the soil surfactants are amphipathic organic molecules that present both polar and non polar parts 13 based on the group present in the polar head 14 surfactants can be classified as anionic cationic non ionic and amphoteric compounds and they can behave as acid or base according to the ph of the medium 13 15 surfactants have been widely used for the removal of contaminants in the soil due to their highly efficient ability to capture contaminating molecules the present work aimed to study the treatment of effluents from soil washing based on the application of synthetic effluents to simulate an effluent from soil washing methyl paraben in bicarbonate medium was used in the presence of three surfactants which consisted of the following i the anionic group sodium dodecyl sulfate sds ii the cationic group cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and iii the non ionic group genapol c 100 1 1 genapol c 100 is a natural fatty alcohol ethoxylate based on linear carbon chains used as a wetting dispersing and emulsifying agent genapol table 1 anionic surfactants have a negative charge in the polar part of the molecule this region has oxygen atoms of high electronegativity which attract electrons from neighboring carbons and hydrogens and this further contributes toward increasing the negative polarity of the region thus the negative charges are concentrated at the end of the anionic surfactant increasing its ability to attract water molecules hence anionic surfactants are found to be highly soluble in water in addition anionic surfactants are strongly influenced by the presence of electrolytes in the solution solubilized salts or extreme ph values 15 cationic surfactants on the other hand have a positive charge in the molar part of the molecule this type of surfactants is relatively more toxic in aquatic environments compared to other types of surfactants the high degree of toxicity observed in cationic surfactants can be attributed to the presence of quaternary nitrogen in the polar part of the surfactants in addition the physical chemical characteristics of cationic surfactants can be influenced by the presence of electrolytes in the solution and by extreme ph values 15 nonionic surfactants are widely used in biodegradation processes due to their lack of charges and low critical micellar concentration cmc these characteristics help minimize any toxic effects 16 and favor the anodic oxidation of the by products 17 genapol is an aliphatic chain alcohol which is composed of alkyl chains of 9 18 carbon atoms and 5 23 ethoxylated groups this alcohol can be found in different environments and at varying concentrations 18 one of the essentially relevant properties of surfactants is the critical micellar concentration cmc this is an intrinsic property of each surfactant and represents the concentration at which the process involving the formation of micelles begins the use of high concentrations of surfactants to solubilize polluting substances results in the generation of effluents with greater complexity which are more difficult to treat than the contaminants themselves 19 20 thus the amount of surfactant required to solubilize pollutants is an important factor to consider particularly in soil remediation processes because the application of a high concentration of surfactants into the soil can cause serious damage to the environment if the surfactants are discarded into water bodies 19 surfactants are also widely used in various cleaning and beauty products and thus interact with different molecules including parabens which are commonly found in water bodies due to their widespread use 21 25 in the present study methyl paraben mep was chosen as a model molecule for this class of contaminants as it is a harmful molecule that can cause imbalances in hormonal systems substances like parabens are widely used as preservatives in foods cosmetics personal care products and even in drugs because of their low cost 24 26 27 as a result the occurrence of these substances in aqueous media and also in soils has been increasingly frequent and they can interact with surfactants in the case of soil cleaning and form compounds with a higher degree of danger 28 32 the interaction of the mep with the surfactants can effectively influence the degradation of mep this interaction can lead to a reduction in both the energy efficiency and the degree of mineralization furthermore the countless by products formed in the interaction between the mep and the surfactants can be relatively more toxic than the mep 33 35 the traditional techniques applied in water and sewage treatment plants are not highly efficient when it comes to the removal of the contaminants of emerging concern cecs present in water 36 thus different alternative methods have been proposed for the remediation of these compounds that contaminate soil and water among the alternative techniques applied include biological 37 39 and chemical processes 40 41 advanced oxidation processes aop 42 47 and advanced electrochemical oxidation processes eaop 36 48 50 compared to the other alternative treatment processes eaops have been found to exhibit high efficiency when it comes to the removal of cecs such as parabens from the environment 51 56 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have been widely employed for the treatment of contaminants in water due to their ease of operation scale up facilities high efficiency in removing organic pollutants and relatively lower energy consumption 56 59 the electro generation of hydroxyl radicals oh occurs on the surfaces of non active electrodes such as bdd during the electrolysis of water eq 1 these radicals which are physisorbed on the anode surface can react with organic molecules and promote the mineralization of the compounds eq 2 1 h 2 o ddb bdd oh h e 2 r m oh c o 2 h 2 o boron doped diamond bdd has been found to be very efficient when employed as anode in flow reactors this efficiency of bdd is attributed to the presence of physisorbed hydroxyl radicals on its surface oh which provides the anode with oxidation potential of 2 2 2 6 in acid media 58 a number of studies that employed bdd anodes for the removal of contaminants reported to have obtained close to 100 efficiency in terms of the removal of organic phenols dyes acetylsalicylic acid oxalic formic acid and preservatives most of these studies mainly employed anodic oxidation with relatively low current for the treatment of the compounds of interest 60 64 while silicon has been widely used as a substrate for bdd anodes because its higher adhesion to the bdd film and lower thermal expansion coefficient cetsi 2 5 10 60 c 1 65 more recently other materials including ti ta and nb have been used as substrate for presenting good electrical conductivity and mechanical resistance 66 some of these materials which have been more recently employed as substrates for bdd anodes have been shown to have some non negligible advantages over silicon for instance niobium has been found to be easier to use as bdd substrate in terms of scaling up eaops to industrial levels compared to silicon 57 67 several studies reported in the literature have shown that bdd anodes supported on niobium nb bdd exhibit greater efficiency when it comes to the treatment of textile effluents drugs carboxylic acids and methyl paraben 64 66 68 69 thus the present study aimed to evaluate the interfering effect of three types of surfactants during the degradation of mep based on the application a nb bdd anode reactor the study sought to evaluate the influence of the surfactants on mep degradation based on the variation of current density and surfactant concentration below cmc and at cmc as well as the effect of the variation of ph for the systems in the presence and absence of the surfactants furthermore to better assess the effectiveness of the treatment technique proposed in this study the general current efficiency and energy consumption per unit of mass were calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated effluent the simulated effluent was prepared using 0 3 l ultrapure water milli q millipore resistivity 18 mω 200 mg l 1 of methyl paraben cas 99 76 3 sigma aldrich 500 mg l 1 sodium bicarbonate cas 144 55 8 synth and one of the surfactants the following surfactants were employed in the experiments sodium dodecyl sulfate sds cas 151 21 3 hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab cas 57 09 0 and genapol c 100 genapol cas 61791 13 7 all the surfactants were used in different concentrations considering the respective critical micellar concentrations cmc all the surfactants were acquired from sigma aldrich 2 2 determination of the critical micellar concentration cmc of the surfactants the critical micellar concentration cmc values for all the three selected surfactants were determined using sodium bicarbonate medium in the presence of mep the cmc values were determined by conductivity techniques table 1 due to the neutral character of genapol we were unable to determine its experimental cmc through conductivity based on the results shown in table 2 the cmc value obtained for the sds in aqueous medium was found to be in agreement with the values reported in the literature 70 71 the cmc value obtained for sds was found to drop sharply in the medium containing bicarbonate and methyl paraben from 8 8 to 1 6 and 1 4 10 3 mol l 1 there were no significant variations in the cmc value obtained for ctab in the medium applied bicarbonate in the presence of methyl paraben the studies involving the use of genapol did not take concentrations below the cmc into account as these would require small amounts of the surfactant leading to a significant increase in weighing errors in view of that the surfactant concentration employed for the analysis of the effect of the applied current density was 0 08 10 3 mol l 1 2 3 experimental set up electrochemical oxidation experiments were carried out in a condias gmbh reactor with five circular sets of electrodes in series and each set was composed of a porous nb bdd anode with active area ca 4 1 cm2 disposed between two stainless steel cathodes with the aid of a peristaltic pump operating at 9 ml s 1 the reactor was connected to a glass reservoir with a capacity of 0 5 l and a stabilized dc power supply as shown in fig 1 2 4 analytical procedure 2 4 1 determination of mep the shimadzu multispec 1501 spectrometer was used for the conduct of spectrometric analyses the spectra were recorded in the wavelength range of 200 to 800 nm the aliquots were diluted 13 5 ratio of 160 μl of sample to 2 ml of water given that the mep peak varied according to the ph value the calibration curves were constructed taking into account the different maximum wavelengths λ máx thus for the systems containing mep λ máx 255 nm was employed for ph 3 and 8 while λ máx 295 nm was employed for ph 11 72 73 2 4 2 determination of sds concentration to determine the concentration of sds an adapted technique was employed based on the simplified methodology proposed by jurado et al 74 the methodology involved the reaction of the sds with sodium tetraborate phenolphthalein methylene blue and chloroform and the complex formed sds methylene blue was extracted and transferred into the organic phase subsequently the aqueous phase obtained was diluted and analyzed by a uv vis spectrophotometer using a 10 ml test tube the sample containing the sds was diluted 100 times this was followed by the addition of 200 μl of sodium tetraborate solution 4 6 drops of phenolphthalein 100 μl of methylene blue and 4 ml of chloroform in this order soon afterwards the tube was shaken vigorously for 1 min and left idle for 5 min the spectral reading was done using a shimadzu multispec 1501 spectrophotometer with λ máx of 656 nm 2 4 3 determination of residual persulfate ions the methodology proposed by liang et al 75 was used to determine persulfate ions s2o8 2 for the systems containing sds this method involved in situ chemical oxidation isco technology in which s2o8 2 was made to undergo reaction with ki in the presence of nahco3 forming a yellow iodine solution which exhibited maximum absorption λ máx between 288 and 353 nm aliquots of 250 μl of the samples were mixed with 2 ml of the isco solution 1 20 nahco3 ki respectively so the concentration of persulfate varied from 2 to 44 μmol l 1 the samples were diluted 10 times homogenized and left idle for 15 min before the uv vis spectral measurements were performed the calibration plots were constructed using λ máx 353 nm as recommended by liang et al 75 the analysis of mineralization efficiency was conducted by total organic carbon toc using the shimadzu toc vcph total organic carbon analyzer made in japan the chemical oxygen demand cod of the sds samples was determined using a digestion spectrophotometry dichromate method thus a 2 5 ml sample was added to a digestion solution potassium dichromate and a catalyst solution silver sulfate this mixture was subjected to digestion for 120 min at 150 c using a drb200 hach reactor and the cod measurement performed using a dr890 hach colorimeter 2 5 general current efficiency and energy consumption the general current efficiency gce in was estimated for each simulated effluent at a given electrolysis time t s using the following equation 3 gce 2 67 toc i toc f f v s 8 i t 100 where vs is the volume of treated solution l f is the faraday constant 96

electrolysis time under three different applied current densities j app ma cm 2 in the absence and presence of the surfactants sds ctab and genapol the results obtained showed that in the absence of the surfactants the degradation of mep follows a pseudo first order kinetics fig 1s with the constant rate k obs 10 4 s 1 dependent on the applied current density 64 77 table 1s shows the values obtained for k obs mep removal rate toc removal rate gce and ec under each applied current density in the presence of surfactants changes were observed in the kinetics of mep removal this showed that the surfactants played an interfering role in terms of the removal of mep at the current density of 15 ma cm 2 fig 2a the mep ctab mixture exhibited the greatest interfering effect during electrolysis with k obs 2 2 10 4 s 1 and 94 9 mep removal rate in 2 h of electrolysis the mep genapol and mep sds systems presented less interfering effect compared to the mep ctab system with mep removal rates of 64 8 60 2 and 37 3 obtained for the mep genapol mep sds and mep ctab systems respectively in one hour of electrolysis see table 1s at the current density of 30 ma cm 2 fig 2b both the systems containing sds and ctab recorded similar interfering effects with k obs 4 10 4 s 1 and mep removal rates of 78 4 and 71 2 in 1 h of electrolysis interestingly the mep genapol system presented a mep removal profile quite similar to that of the system containing only mep with mep removal rate of about 82 mep genapol and k obs 5 4 10 4 s 1 by increasing the current density to 45 ma cm 2 fig 2c there was a significant reduction in the interfering effect of the surfactants with different surfactant mixtures recording similar k obs values and mep removal rates ranging from 82 to 86 in 1 h of electrolysis see fig 2c and table 1s as can be observed in fig 2 in general an increase in the current density resulted in a decrease in the interfering effect of the surfactants in terms of mep removal furthermore with the current density increase a considerable increase in the mineralization of systems containing surfactants occurred as well an increase in current density caused a more significant effect in the mep sds and mep ctab systems compared to the mep genapol system the application of a current density of 45 ma cm 2 led to toc removal rates of 69 6 93 3 and 84 6 for mep sds mep ctab and mep genapol systems respectively in one hour of electrolysis fig 3 however the application of high current densities ranging from 15 to 45 ma cm 2 implies the use of high electrical charges ranging from 3 8 to 11 5 103c l 1 for the degradation of the compound of interest in a short period of time in 1 h this means that a greater portion of energy is lost through secondary reactions eqs 5 7 as demonstrated by lanzarini lopes et al 78 thus the gce eq 3 and ec kw h gtoc 1 eq 4 were estimated in order to gain a better understanding of the results obtained 5 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 6 2 oh h 2 o 2 7 h 2 o 2 oh ho 2 h 2 o fig 4 shows the occurrence of a significant reduction in gce along with an increase in ec kw h gtoc 1 based on the applied current density for all the systems investigated with regard to the mineralization of mep the application of current density of 15 ma cm 2 in 2 h of electrolysis led to an increase in current efficiency and a decrease in energy consumption fig 4 the systems containing ctab and genapol obtained gce and ce values very close to those obtained for mep this evidenced the low influence of these surfactants on the mineralization of organic compounds caused by the low concentration attributed to ctab 0 1 10 3 mol l 1 and genapol 0 08 10 3 mol l 1 although the mep sds system presented remarkable results among the systems investigated here this system recorded the highest gce and the lowest ec compared to the other systems the results presented by the mep sds system may be attributed to the formation of persulfate radicals due to the increase in current density 79 also the amount of organic load removed from the mep sds system 140 2 mg l 1 at the current density of 15 ma cm 2 was slightly higher compared to the systems composed of mep ctab mep genapol and mep only presenting removed toc of 132 6 116 7 and 119 4 mg l 1 respectively in two hours of electrolysis based on the results obtained from fig 4 the lowest current density was chosen for the conduct of subsequent experiments the results obtained also enabled us to optimize parameters such as electrolysis time efficiency and operating costs during the scaling up process of the electrochemical apparatus 78 80 3 2 sds oxidation to study the influence of the anionic surfactant sds on the removal of mep the surfactant was subjected to degradation in nahco3 medium by application of the current densities of 15 30 and 45 ma cm 2 the degradation of the surfactant and the changes in chemical oxygen demand cod were monitored over a 2 h period of electrolysis table 3 the results obtained from this degradation analysis showed that an increase in current density did not promote an increase in the rate of sds removal however there was a gradual increase in cod removal efficiency with an improvement of 11 when the current density was increased from 30 to 45 ma cm 2 looking at fig 5 one will observe that there was a significant increase in the concentration of persulfate in the solution when the current density was increased from 15 to 45 ma cm 2 with cod removal efficiencies of 62 8 and 83 0 respectively table 3 mohebrad et al 81 studied the effect of current density on sds degradation where they observed an improvement in the removal of the surfactant with the application of low current densities ranging from 0 75 to 6 15 ma cm 2 the authors found the current density of 3 125 ma cm 2 as the ideal current density for the removal of sds a comparative analysis of these results shows that the removal rate of sds does not change with the increase in current density from 15 to 30 ma cm 2 table 3 escalona durán et al 82 also found a dependent relationship between the production of oxidizing species and the current density according to escalona durán et al 2020 the application of a current density of 60 ma cm 2 instead of 20 ma cm 2 led to a greater accumulation of persulfate radical and a 25 improvement in the degradation of sds the improvement in the surfactant removal was attributed to the presence of high amount of oxidizing species hydroxyl and persulfate radicals produced by the non active anode 2 82 according to the results obtained fig 5 the electrolysis of a solution containing sds in a bicarbonate medium tends to release persulfate radicals in solution with an increase in current density which would explain the increase in gce however it was not possible to quantify the persulfate generated during electrolysis in the mep sds system a fact that can be attributed to the presence of mep degradation by products 3 44 64 it is worth noting that the surfactant also has a chain of 12 carbons the presence of this chain of carbons yields a large amount of organic load that is expected to be consumed by the oxidizing species generated in the solution 3 82 83 3 3 concentration effect to gain a better understanding of the interfering effect of the surfactants on the removal of mep experiments were carried out using solutions containing mep and the surfactants at cmc for sds and ctab and at above cmc for genapol in nahco3 medium table 2 to conduct these experiments the current density of 15 ma cm 2 was applied in order to avoid the formation of foam and the consequent loss of organic matter during the electrolysis it is worth pointing out that the application of the current density of 15 ma cm 2 promoted a higher gce and lower ec in previous experiments conducted using low concentrations of surfactants fig 6 shows the kinetics of the systems in the presence and absence of the surfactants at cmc and above cmc fig 7 shows the toc removal rates of the system with mep only and for the systems composed of mep surfactants at different concentrations based on the results obtained in these analyses it can be confirmed that the degradation of mep followed a pseudo first order kinetics with k obs 4 4 10 4 s 1 as mentioned previously in addition there was a 1 7 2 and 2 3 fold decrease in the value of k obs 10 4 s 1 for the systems containing sds ctab and genapol respectively in comparison with the k obs values obtained for the system containing only mep for the systems containing ctab and genapol the value of k obs was calculated after 36 min looking at figs 6 and 7 and tables 1s and 2s one can conclude that an increase in the concentration of the surfactants led to a significant reduction in toc and mep removal rates as well as in the constant rate kobs 10 4 s 1 the interfering effects may have been triggered by two factors one of these factors is the increase in organic load with the increase in the surfactant concentration as shown in table 3s when the ctab concentration was increased from 0 1 to 0 91 10 3 mol l 1 there was an increase of 141 4 in the amount of organic matter in toc concentration and this caused a 69 drop in the toc removal rate and a decrease of 22 7 in mep removal rate as shown in table 1s and 2s the other factor has to do with the formation of micelles between the contaminant and the surfactant hindering the removal of mep and toc this can be found to have occurred noticeably in the systems containing cationic surfactant ctab which had more affinity with the mep molecule in its ionic form phi 8 this affinity promoted stronger bonds between the mep and ctab molecules the results obtained from the mep removal rates showed that the system containing ctab presented mep removal rate of 71 81 while the system with sds exhibited mep removal rate of 88 74 in addition the cationic surfactant presented relatively lower toc removal rate 43 9 compared to the anionic surfactant 63 1 after 3 h of electrolysis fig 3s this result showed that there was clearly a significant interaction between the ctab and mep genapol was used in a concentration close to its cmc of 0 075 10 3 mol l 1 in h2o with equivalent toc of approximately 12 56 mg l 1 a comparison of the mep removal rates obtained for the solution containing only mep and the solution containing mep genapol showed that the latter exhibited a 1 3 fold reduction in k obs 10 4 s 1 and a slight decay in mep removal compared to the former precisely the mep genapol recorded a mep removal rate of 94 36 in 2 h of electrolysis see fig 1s and table 1s the mep genapol 0 08 10 3 mol l 1 system presented a slight decrease of around 11 6 in the toc removal rate compared to the system containing mep only see fig 7 this decrease was equivalent to the increase in toc promoted by the addition of a non ionic surfactant in the system table 3s furthermore the sample containing genapol exhibited total toc removal in the solution after 3 h of electrolysis however the application of a higher concentration of genapol 0 5 10 3 mol l 1 in the mep genapol system see table 3s led to a decrease in the mineralization of the system 54 4 with a reduction in both the value of kobs 1 8 10 4 s 1 and the mep removal rate 13 2 compared to the results obtained from the application of a lower concentration of genapol 0 08 10 3 mol l 1 tables 1s and 2s as a neutral surfactant genapol does not interact ionically with the mep molecule and does not significantly interfere in mep removal when applied at low concentration in the same way as the ctab however genapol exerts a more evident suppression effect in the removal of high concentration mep thus the concentration of the surfactant and the degree of interaction between the mep molecule and the surfactant are among the key factors that can significantly interfere in the removal of the organic pollutant as well as in the efficiency of mineralization during the anodic oxidation process under the application of the bdd nb anode the application of a higher concentration of surfactants leads to the formation of micelles and a higher initial concentration of toc micelles act as an interfering agent in the removal process once a protective environment is formed around the organic pollutant leading to a reduction in the availability of target molecules for bdd oh 84 one should note however that free micelle compounds surfactant monomers can still be oxidized and mep removal is likely to occur even when one employs a current density of 15 ma cm 2 and a higher concentration of surfactant the results obtained from the 3 h of electrolysis showed mep removal of 92 2 77 9 and 87 7 for the systems containing sds ctab and genapol respectively fig 3s for purposes of comparison trelluet al 76 employed bdd based anodic oxidation at the current density of 2 1 ma cm 2 for the degradation of phenanthrene anthracene pyrene and fluoranthene in the presence of a neutral surfactant tw80 it took the authors 23 h of treatment to degrade 83 90 77 and 75 of the compounds respectively this shows that the reactor employed in our present study fig 1 is highly efficient for the removal of contaminants in the presence of different types of surfactants using a relatively low current density and a short time of electrolysis 3 4 the effect of ph as can be observed in fig 8 mep λ 254 nm remained in its original form when the ph applied was between 3 and 6 5 one will note that even in nahco3 medium the bicarbonate ions hco3 will not be present in the solution due to the acidification of the solution with h2so4 this can be demonstrated by the following equation 8 h 2 s o 4 nahc o 3 na 2 s o 4 c o 2 h 2 o between ph 6 5 to 8 0 one observes the occurrence of a transition with the coexistence of two forms of mep when its molecule resonates λ 255 nm and when the molecule is in its ionic form at λ 296 nm with the pka nahco3 6 5 the bicarbonate starts to influence the formation of the ionic form of mep when the medium becomes more basic the cation na tends to bind to the oh of the medium thus mep undergoes resonance and accepts na and it subsequently assumes its ionic form λ 296 nm with the addition of naoh to adjust the basic ph naoh may remain in the solution at the inflection point when λ 269 7 nm the two ionic species of mep coexist at this point called the isobestic point the probability of forming the basic or acidic species of mep is equal some previous studies reported in the literature have described the chemical structures of mep associated with uv spectra in naoh medium 73 in phosphate medium with ph 7 and acid medium 72 85 as shown by bledzka et al 86 the transition process of mep at different ph values fig 8 is similar to that of butyl paraben bledzka et al 86 show the absorbance spectra of butyl paraben at different ph values based on these data the authors were able to determine the acid base equilibrium constant fig 9 shows the kinetics of mep in acid ph 3 and basic ph 8 and 11 medium here one will observe that the application of ph 3 and 8 yielded similar results in terms of the removal of mep however the application of a more alkaline medium led to faster removal of mep with a mep removal rate of 99 2 obtained in 2 h of electrolysis table 2s this result was obtained in an alkaline medium at ph 11 in this condition the ionic form of mep remains in the solution and as it is more unstable it becomes easier to degrade fig 10 shows the removal of mep as a function of time min for the systems containing mep only and mep surfactants where the surfactants were applied at cmc or above cmc table 2 the results obtained showed that the removal of mep in both media followed the sequence mep mep sds mep ctab mep genapol in an acidic environment there was a dramatic decline in conductivity with the transformation of nahco3 to co2 under these conditions electrolysis is impaired by the deficiency of electron transfer and this makes it difficult for the current to pass through the electrolytic medium in this case the system with sds was favored by the presence of sulfate ions released by this molecule a faster rate of pollutants degradation was observed in the basic environment for all the systems investigated table 2s the results obtained for toc removal in 2 h of electrolysis fig 11 showed a significant increase in the mineralization of the organic pollutants for the system with and without surfactants when the ph of the solution was changed from 3 to 8 the ph 11 provided a slight increase in toc removal for the solution containing sds on the other hand for the solutions containing ctab and genapol the toc removal increased respectively 17 5 and 20 when the value of ph increased from 3 to 11 table 2s these results show that mep can be easily degraded when it is in the ionic form apart from that the interaction of mep with surfactants leads to the formation of products that may be more difficult to be mineralized 72 86 4 conclusions based on the discussions presented it can be concluded that several factors influence the electrochemical degradation of mep in the presence of surfactants with the use of bdd anodes among which i the nature of the surfactant when the surfactant is ionic with the opposite charge to the ionic form of the pollutant the interaction with the pollutant molecule is promoted forming micelles that are more difficult to break this occurred with the system containing mep ctab 0 91 10 3 mol l 1 ii electrolysis conditions j ma cm 2 increasing the current density leads to an increase in the reaction rate however it decreases the overall current efficiency and considerably increases the energy consumption for systems containing mep mep ctab and mep genapol iii surfactant concentration when close to cmc it implies a reduction in the removal efficiency of mep and toc under this condition it takes more than 3 h for the total mineralization of the organic compounds in solution iv ph of the medium when varying from acid ph 3 to alkaline ph 8 and 11 there is an increase in mineralization in systems containing mep surfactants and the degradation of the solution containing only mep was favored at ph 11 in nahco3 medium declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13319,in this research sodium dodecyl sulfate sds separation from aqueous solutions using hierarchical porous zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 carbon fiber zif 8 carbon fiber nanosorbent was assessed by batch and column process the characterization of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was conducted by x ray diffractometer xrd and field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem in addition the influence of ph on the adsorption batch studies was investigated the quantity and quality of sds uptake by zif 8 carbon fiber were studied based on ultraviolet visible spectroscopy measurements and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra aside from that a practical process involving column of the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent to remove sds was performed dynamically it was found that the loading of zif 8 nanoparticles on carbon fiber struts increased the hydrophobicity of carbon fiber and its contact angle with water increased from 90 to 150 besides the results of ftir confirmed successful adsorption of sds onto zif 8 carbon fiber surfaces which is believed to be governed by both electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interactions in addition the results of batch experiments illustrated that adsorption of sds onto zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent is rapid with an equilibrium time of 30 min and follows a first order kinetic model r 2 0 9944 furthermore the langmuir isotherm model was best fitted adsorption equilibrium r 2 0 9899 at different ph values the results revealed the removal quantity after five cycles was decreased by 20 for sds removal moreover the maximum adsorption capacity of sds on the zif 8 carbon fiber was obtained 377 7 mg g at the optimal conditions the column adsorption experiments showed that inline sds removal is possible graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zif 8 carbon fiber sds column process kinetic adsorption isotherm 1 introduction different volumes of wastewater during various production processes at industries are produced which need to be removed quickly to prevent their release into the environment 1 3 the surfactant concentration should be reduced to environmental standards at different stages of water discharge to the environment surfactants are a large group of pollutants added by humans to aqueous environments surfactants are found in commonly used products such as detergents soaps pharmaceuticals personal care products and in industries such as leather products 4 5 surfactants are divided into different types according to their ionic properties including cationic anionic nonionic and amphoteric 6 the most widely used group of surfactants are anionic surfactants which make up about 90 of all ionic surfactants 4 7 one of the most anionic surfactants widely used in commercial cleaners is sodium dodecyl sulfate sds a synthetic surfactant with a 12 carbon hydrocarbon chain 8 9 the surfactant molecule has a hydrophobic non polar tail and a hydrophilic polar head 10 as a result the release of this pollutant into aqueous environments seems inevitable discharge of wastewater to the environment and use of sewage sludge as a fertilizer on agricultural lands cause the entry of surfactants into the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem 11 12 the entrance of these compounds into the environment especially the aquatic ecosystem leads to problems such as toxicity to animals and humans pollution of water and lakes dangerous effects on aquatic and plants increased algae and foam production therefore the removal of surfactants is necessary before discharging the effluent to the environment 13 the sodium dodecyl sulfate sds is one of the most abundant surfactants in the anion group that may accumulate in the human body 14 the most common ozonation process to remove surfactants on a real scale is very costly and challenging 15 due to the strong antimicrobial properties of some surfactants it is impossible to use biological methods to remove this contaminant at high concentrations 16 therefore it seems that adsorption is an appropriate technology to remove this contaminant and is more practical than other known methods due to the simplicity of preparation easy handling and favorable costs 17 so far various materials such as activated carbon 18 silica 19 and alumina 20 have been used in the adsorption process the multiple problems such as the high cost and the possibility of activating and reviving them have led researchers to seek new adsorbents 21 22 various studies have been investigated in this field from many years ago until now in 1999 hana et al 23 investigated the biodegradation of sds using biofilm of pseudomonas c12b on a glass support the results showed the formation of the biofilm on glass beads with reasonable effectiveness to reduce sds concentration below 10 mg ml in 2010 gao et al 24 researched sds adsorption by surfaces of zinc selenide znse and a fe2o3 the uptake studies confirmed hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction as dominate adsorption mechanisms the equilibrium adsorption was carried out to the a fe2o3 surface within a few minutes whereas adsorption to the znse was a much slower process in 2018 nagwanshi et al 25 examined the activated charcoal to remove sds the treated alkali activated charcoal as the adsorbent bed was exposed better results than untreated and acid activated charcoal the modeling of adsorption behavior revealed that the langmuir adsorption was better fitted with the empirical data than the freundlich adsorption isotherm in 2019 pravin et al 26 studied sds removal using activated coconut shell adsorbent the adsorbent was modified using phosphoric acid as an activation agent the modeling results showed a pseudo second order kinetic model and the langmuir model provided a better fit with monolayer adsorption nanotechnology as a common technology has recently been used to purify and remove pollutants 27 nanoporous materials can be used to adsorb different types of pollutants with fantastic features such as large surface area small size crystalline shape and high lattice order resulting in very high reactivity 28 29 in recent years metal organic frameworks mofs have drawn considerable attention due to their ability to eliminate contaminants such as heavy metals 30 radionuclides 31 surfactants 32 hazardous organic and inorganic compounds 33 34 zeolitic imidazole frameworks zifs with a much widespread range of pore sizes and well defined shapes and sizes have attracted much attention they have been tested for sensing 35 drug delivery 36 gas storage 37 electrochemical supercapacitors 38 catalysis 39 40 dye degradation 41 42 wastewater treatment 43 and oil absorption 44 zifs are a group of hierarchical porous materials in which zn is connected to organic ligands such as 2 methylimidazolite benzimidazole etc through organo metallic bonds 45 zif 8 has the potential for being used as an adsorbate of water pollutants 44 46 48 in addition sds with applications in various industries is still used in many fields therefore sds is considered a problematic type of surfactant contamination compared to other surfactants in conclusion sds could be a representative to approximate the adsorption capacity of the zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 carbon fiber zif 8 carbon fiber to surfactants the schematic of the research process is shown in fig 1 in this study removing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds as contamination in water is examined using the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent by batch and column process first the zif 8 carbon fiber is synthesized and characterized then the effect of ph on the amount of sds adsorption onto the zif 8 carbon fiber in a batch system is studied furthermore the effect of variables such as sds concentration and inflow rate in a fixed bed column is evaluated the quantitative and qualitative adsorption results of sds are measured by the uv vis spectrophotometer and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir respectively in addition adsorption equilibrium models langmuir freundlich and temkin and adsorption kinetic models first order and second order are studied in this process column adsorption behavior is studied based on the standard models of thomas yoon nelson and clark to evaluate the continuous adsorption mechanism 2 experimental method 2 1 materials 2 methylimidazole

purchased from afzir tehran iran hydrochloric acid solution hcl 37 wt and ammonia solution nh4oh 25 wt were used to adjust the ph and were supplied from merck germany all materials were used as received without additional purification 2 2 synthesis of zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was produced in situ by one step method including synthesis and deposition of zif 8 nanostructure on layered carbon fiber by a simple dip coating protocol as detailed in our previous study 44 first zinc nitrate and 2 methyl imidazole with a stoichiometric ratio of 1 2 were dissolved in two separate solutions of 30 ml methanol at room temperature then the zinc nitrate solution was added to the 2 methyl imidazole solution slowly and stirred for 10 min afterward the carbon fiber substrate with a fixed number of layers was dipped into the solution gradually for 2 h the coating process was repeated 4 times to achieve better coverage of the carbon fiber substrate the zif 8 carbon fiber was washed 3 times with methanol to clear any defective coatings and finally dried at 80 c for 12 h the experiments were repeated three times under controlled conditions and the final results were reported with 5 error 2 3 analysis and characterization the morphology of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent was explored using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi s4160 model tokyo japan the crystallite structure of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was determined by x ray diffractometer xrd equinox3000 inel paris france with 2θ from 0 to 90 cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 20 ma scherrer equation eq 1 was used to calculate the average crystal diameter of the samples 49 1 d 0 9 λ β cos θ where λ is the radiation

obtained using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in the range 400 to 4000 cm 1at 4 cm 1resolutions with an average of 32 scans kbr pellets on 27 tensor model bruker co germany 2 4 adsorption procedure and models first the critical micelle concentration cmc of sds was determined by measuring the surface tension of sds aqueous solution with different concentrations the surface tension was recorded on a processor tensiometer k12 germany which uses the plate method uv vis spectrophotometer varian australia pty ltd cary 100 conc australia was used to measure sds concentration a uv vis calibration curve of sds aqueous concentration was established based on absorbance at 291nm corresponding to a maximum sds absorbance in order to reduce errors a stock solution of 500 mg l was prepared and then diluted to lower concentrations all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 1 c in addition the effect of ph 2 12 on sds uptake was investigated the ph of the aqueous sds solution was adjusted by adding hydrochloric acid hcl in the acidic range and ammonium hydroxide nh4oh in the basic range tests were repeated at least three times and the average results were reported together with the 95 confidence interval the sds uptake effectiveness r was calculated by eq 2 2 r c i c e c i 100 where c i mg l denotes the initial sds concentration and c e mg l is sds concentration at equilibrium to study the reusability of the zif 8 carbon fiber washing with heat treatment was used the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent was recovered using 0 25 m naoh solution zif 8 carbon fiber was washed with naoh solution for 30 min under 150 rpm of stirring followed by heat treatment of the recovered adsorbent at 80 c for 6 h to study adsorption kinetics batch experiments were performed in these experiments a constant mass 1 g of the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent was added to 1000 ml of 400 mg l aqueous sds solution a 10 ml sample of the solutions was collected for uv vis measurements every 5 min sds concentration as function of time was recorded with the help of the calibration curve fig s1 the following models were studied to describe the kinetics of adsorption the linear form of the first order kinetic model is presented by eq 3 50 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where q t mg g denotes the amount adsorbed per 1 g adsorbent at a given time q e is adsorption per 1

eq 6 51 6 q e c i c e v w where w is the amount of adsorbent g batch experiments were also performed to study the adsorption isotherms models of adsorption isotherms of langmuir temkin and freundlich

column adsorption experiments as depicted in fig 2 a cylindrical column of 3 cm diameter and 15 cm height was packed with 4 g of zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent solutions of different sds

solution was pumped upward the column from a storage tank using a pump tests were repeated at least three times and the average results were reported together with the 95 confidence interval the dynamic experiments were performed according to table s1 where four levels for the adsorbate concentration and the flow rate of sds solution were tested analysis of the obtained data was performed by

as shown in fig 3 44 the xrd pattern of carbon fiber shows two main peaks which is in good agreement with previous literature 59 the peaks for zif 8 carbon fiber correspond to 011 002 112 022 013 222 114 233 134 044 244 and 235 lattice planes confirming a successful synthesis of zif 8 crystals onto the carbon fiber substrate as also depicted in the literature 60 the average crystallite size of zif 8 particles was 27 4 nm as obtained from scherrer s equation eq 1 at the peak corresponding to 2θ 6 43 fe sem micrographs in fig 4a portray the smooth surface of carbon fiber with cylindrical shapes of 2 5 μm diameters the carbon fiber struts create pore sizes ranging from 10 to 50 μm 44 fig 4b d shows the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite at different magnifications the zif 8 nanoparticles with particle sizes ranging between 30 to 50 nm appear aggregated onto the carbon fiber support accordingly the zif 8 coating imparts surface roughness and increases the hydrophobicity of the carbon fiber surface the water contact angle wca of the carbon fiber and zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was 90 and 150 respectively as shown in fig s2 the properties of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent are detailed in table 1 table 1 shows high pore volume and specific surface area for zif 8 carbon fiber indicating that the zif 8 carbon fiber is an efficient adsorbent the average pores sizes of 1 6 and 3 8 nm are obtained by the barrett joyner halenda bjh curve with two peaks 3 2 adsorption results 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics and isotherms fig 5 suggests that 30 min of 200 rpm mixing was sufficient to achieve equilibrium for sds adsorption onto the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent to assess the ph effect on sds adsorption batch adsorption tests were performed at various ph values as depicted in fig 6 the adsorption effectiveness of sds decreases with increasing ph the equilibrium uptake on the other hand monotonically increases with increasing ph from 2 to 5 whereas monotonically decreases with increasing ph between 7 to 12 therefore ph of 5 was considered as the optimum value for sds uptake by zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite which corresponds to the maximum uptake of 377 7 mg g since carbon fiber was completely covered by zif 8 fig 3 the adsorption capacity is controlled by zif 8 literature findings 61 showed that zif 8 displays the highest stability over a ph range of 5 12 for ph 5 the structure of zif 8 becomes unstable and zn2 ions are released into the solution which effectively reduces the performance of the adsorbent in addition phpzc point of zero charge determines the amount of adsorbent charge and thus affects adsorbent performance due to changes in adsorbent adsorbate interactions phpzc of zif 8 is 9 8 as reported in the literature 61 62 at ph above phpzc zif 8 is negatively charged whereas below phzpc zif 8 is positively charged 63 on the other hand at low ph the acid form of sds predominates which limits the dissociation of sds and hence its electrostatic interaction with the charged zif 8 surface at high ph sds is fully dissociated and carries a negatively charged head group since it is an anionic surfactant accordingly at high ph electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbent and adsorbate predominates which limits sds uptake at low ph on the other hand the low stability of zif 8 and the limited dissociation of sds limited the uptake a sweet spot corresponding to the highest uptake is found at ph 5 64 potential mechanisms for sds adsorption from the aqueous solution by zif 8 carbon fiber are ion exchange ion coupling hydrophobic bonding as well as adsorption using facilitated by electron polarization hydrogen bonding and adsorption using dispersion forces 26 following the ion coupling theory the ions in the surfactant are adsorbed on vacancies with opposite charges the schematic of the adsorption using electrostatic force is shown in fig 7a when the zif 8 coverage is immersed in aqueous solution some active sites such as znoh and the protonated n atoms e g cnh2 cnh groups are created at ph 5 through protonated reaction the positive active sites are able to adsorb the negative sds species via electrostatic attraction efficiently 65 the hydrophobic interaction is another mechanism for adsorption and is schematically illustrated in fig 7b when the hydrophobe zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite is introduced in the aqueous solution water molecules rearrange their molecular structure and rebuild their hydrogen bonds surrounding the hydrophobe with minimum interaction with hydrophobic surface 66 the ftir spectra of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite sds and zif 8 carbon fiber right after adsorption and after three times washing with water and drying at 80 c are given in fig 8 the zif 8 carbon fiber ftir spectrum incorporates the stretching vibration of the oh at 3428 cm 1 67 the absorption band 2922 cm 1 is identified as the stretching vibrations of the ch group in the methylene chains and the imidazole ring in the zif 8 whereas the band at 1146 cm 1 is identified for the aromatic cn stretching mode 44 68 furthermore the band at 996 cm 1 is probably reported for ring deformation 69 the absorption band at 2853 cm 1 relates to ch group in the methylene chains the peak at 1625 cm 1 relates to the stretching vibration mode of cc or cn 68 70 the peaks at 1458 cm 1 and 1377 cm 1 are related to bending modes of the ch and ch3 respectively the bending vibration of methylene ch2 is assigned to the absorption band at 722 cm 1 for the carbon fiber 70 accordingly all the zif 8 ftir spectra are in agreement with reference peaks found in the literatures 71 72 in fig 8b the peak at 3468 cm 1 is the hoh stretching the peaks at 2922 and 2865 are belong to the stretching bands of ch2 and peak at 1470 cm 1 belongs to vibrating band of ch the peak at 1220 cm 1 is related to skeletal vibration of so bridge stretching the peak at 1082 cm 1 is so stretching the peaks at 833 and 634 cm 1 belong to the asymmetric bending of ch in ch2 group 73 74 the peaks of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite with sds surfactant show successful adsorption of sds molecules onto zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite both the spectra of zif 8 carbon fiber with sds and the washed zif 8 carbon fiber with sds are similar suggesting strong sds adsorption onto zif 8 carbon fiber fig 8d adsorption kinetic was investigated to better understand the effect of concentration on the time required to achieve equilibrium and the governing rate model table 2 summarizes the outcome of fitting the first order and the second order kinetic models to the experimental data of sds adsorption table 2 suggests that the first order kinetic model fits the adsorption results to a better extent r 2 between 0 9921 and 0 9988 than the second order r 2 between 0 9439 and 0 9774 for all values of initial concentrations 150 400 mg l it is noted that the second order kinetic model assumes chemical adsorption or chemisorption is the rate controlling step hence the adsorption rate depends on adsorption capacity instead of the concentration of adsorbate 75 76 the first order kinetic model assumes that the adsorption rate with time is proportional to the difference in saturation concentration and the adsorption amount directly it is commonly observed that the adsorption occurs by diffusion mechanism through the interface 77 78 to study sds adsorption equilibrium freundlich langmuir and temkin models were applied the parameters of the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms for sds adsorption are reported in table 3 the correlation coefficient r 2 was used to select the best fit the r 2 for the langmuir isotherm was 0 9899 the values of r 2 for the freundlich and temkin isotherms were obtained 0 7996 and 0 8553 respectively this suggests that monolayer adsorption likely best fits sds adsorption onto the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent the affinity of sds to the surface of the adsorbent is determined by the unitless constant separation factor or equilibrium parameter r l as given by eq 17 79 17 r l 1 1 k l c i r l value indicates the favorability of adsorption for the optimal adsorption r l should be 0 r l 1 whereas for linear adsorption form r l 1 for adverse adsorption r l 1 and r l 0 are encountered inefficiency and irreversibility respectively 79 80 3 2 2 optimizing the column adsorption 3 2 2 1 influence of inflow rate fig 9 shows the breakthrough curves for sds adsorption at different input flow rate as the inlet flow rate increases the breakthrough time c c 0 0 05 and exhaustion time c c 0 0 95 decrease the contact time with the adsorbent in the column is reduced by increasing the inflow rate for a given inflow concentration c 0 hence the residence time corresponding to high inflow rates does not allow for diffusion of sds into the pores of the zif 8 carbon fiber which decreases the volume of the sds solution being treated breakthrough time and volume are reduced accordingly as shown in fig 9 for larger inflow rates 30 ml min 50 ml min a sharper breakthrough curve is obtained given the fast migration of sds solution through the column past the adsorbent inflow rate of 20 ml min rather than 15 ml min was selected as the optimum since it helps achieving higher wastewater treatment rates table 4 shows sds column adsorption parameters at different sds solution inflow rates with increasing inflow rate the maximum capacity q total and the equilibrium capacity of the column q eq exp are decreased in addition as the inflow rate increased the total removal percent of the adsorbate y decreased from 91 5 to 76 1 this behavior is attributed to the insufficient residence time of sds solution in the column to diffuse into the active sites of the zif 8 cf nanocomposite although higher flow rates help achieving effective bulk mixing they impact pore diffusion to a much less extent 3 2 2 2 influence of sds concentration fig 10 shows the breakthrough curves for sds adsorption at different influent sds concentrations the results show that by increasing the initial sds concentration the breakthrough time c c 0 0 05 and exhaustion time c c 0 0 95 decrease as the concentration of sds increases sharper breakthrough curves are obtained indicating a shorter mass transfer zone this is due to the faster saturation of the adsorbent at higher sds concentrations the adsorption process consists of three stages the migration of sds molecules from the bulk solution to the adsorbent surface followed by the diffusion of the adsorbate into the pores and lastly the adsorption onto an active site 81 increasing the bulk concentration of sds increases the driving force for pore diffusion which is likely the rate limiting step this conclusion is also supported by the minor impact of sds solution flow rate on adsorption kinetics as reported earlier table 5 shows the results obtained from sds adsorption at different influent sds concentrations the results showed that with increasing sds concentration the maximum capacity q total and the equilibrium capacity of the column q eq exp increase slightly but the adsorption efficiency decreases with increasing the inflow concentration of sds from 200 to 500 mg l the column capacity only increased a little from 1510 mg to 1520 mg while the column capacity was approximately constant the sds adsorption efficiency decreased from 94 3 to 84 4 this behavior is due to saturating the column with adsorbed sds the removal of sds by adsorption onto zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite is comparable to other methods used by the literature higher sds removal capacity by zif 8 carbon fiber was obtained than removal values reported by hana et al 23 who investigated the biodegradation of sds using biofilm of pseudomonas c12b on a glass support gong et al 82 reported the elimination of sds from water using water hyacinth plant over many days sds could be eliminated after 12 day treatment of 10 mg l sds solution whereas 99 1 sds removal could be removed for 20 mg l solution in the presence of 0 4 mg l chromolaena odorata l extract in other studies natural armenian zeolite with hydrophobic properties showed an adsorption capacity for sds of 113 mg g 83 chitosan hydrogel beads in the presence of crystal violet dye showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 76 9 mg g for sds 84 3 2 3 column data analysis yoon nelson 54 thomas 55 and clark 56 models were studied to investigate the kinetics of column adsorption comparison of model predictions and the experiments are shown in fig 11 table 6 presents the fitted parameters of the column adsorption kinetic models generally all the models achieved high coefficients of determination r 2 0 96 per table 6 the thomas model assumes langmuir equilibrium isotherm with no axial dispersion in the column also thomas model assumes the kinetics of adsorption is governed by a second order kinetics 57 the results show that q o values increased with increasing the input flow concentration whereas k th values decreased as noted earlier better column performance is achieved at higher sds concentration likely due to the higher driving force for pore diffusion 85 the values of the yoon nelson model parameters τ and k yn are also given in table 6 yoon nelson s model describes monolayer adsorption with the probability of sds breakthrough or adsorption proportional to the reduction rate and the possibility of every adsorbate molecule adsorption 56 when the inflow concentration increases k yn increases too while τ decreases at higher sds concentrations the competition between adsorption of sds molecules increases resulting in overall increased adsorption 86 furthermore for the clark model the value of the parameter r increases with increasing sds concentration while the value of a decreased the adsorption rate was improved owing to the high concentration gradient between the adsorbent and sds solution creating a great driving force for the adsorption process the recycling of the adsorbent depends on the desorption or regeneration efficiency of the adsorbent the adsorption of sds onto the zif 8 carbon fiber depends on the properties of the adsorbent the adsorbate and the solution especially the surface charge and the ph of the solution 87 the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent was successfully regenerated by mixing with 0 25 m aqueous naoh solution 30 ml 1 g as stated earlier phzpc of the zif 8 is 9 8 61 beyond this value both the surface of the adsorbent and sds are negatively charged thus aqueous naoh could be used for the regeneration of adsorbent according to our tests the sds uptake effectiveness after five cycles decreased only by 20 a feasible adsorption process needs to be efficient economic and environmentally benign removal of surfactants from water using adsorption is highly efficient cost effective environmentally friendly and easy to operate 88 89 in this work improved adsorbent is prepared by depositing zif 8 nanostructures onto the carbon fiber substrate is introduced and tested in situ zif 8 carbon fiber preparation with minimum use of chemicals reduces the cost of adsorbent zif 8 carbon fiber featured high rates of adsorption kinetics high uptake and efficient regeneration 4 conclusions in this study the sds uptake from aqueous solution by the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite produced from precipitation method was investigated in a batch system static and continuous adsorption in a column dynamic the effect of ph on sds adsorption quantity in the batch system was investigated further the effect of sds concentration and inflow rate were studied in the column system to obtain the optimal conditions with high effectiveness the structural analysis showed the crystalline diameter of 27 4 nm and particle size ranging between 30 and 50 nm for the zif 8 nanoparticles the coating of zif 8 nanoparticles on the carbon fiber struts enhanced the hydrophobicity of the zif 8 carbon fiber with wca of 150 the sds adsorption mechanism into the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was based on the hydrophobic interaction of the hydrocarbon tail and the electrostatic forces of the polar head group with the zif 8 carbon fiber surface the results of batch experiments illustrated that adsorption of sds onto the zif 8 carbon fiber is rapid with an equilibrium time of 30 min the maximum sds adsorption capacity of 377 7 mg g was obtained from the batch system at an optimum ph value of 5 in addition the results revealed that the langmuir isotherm was better fitted with empirical data r 2 0 9899 rather than the freundlich and temkin models it was also a good fit between experimental kinetic data and the first order kinetic model r 2 0 9944 the results of recycling showed the separation capacity after five cycles was decreased by 20 for sds removal finally modeling of sds adsorption in the

13319,in this research sodium dodecyl sulfate sds separation from aqueous solutions using hierarchical porous zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 carbon fiber zif 8 carbon fiber nanosorbent was assessed by batch and column process the characterization of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was conducted by x ray diffractometer xrd and field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem in addition the influence of ph on the adsorption batch studies was investigated the quantity and quality of sds uptake by zif 8 carbon fiber were studied based on ultraviolet visible spectroscopy measurements and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra aside from that a practical process involving column of the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent to remove sds was performed dynamically it was found that the loading of zif 8 nanoparticles on carbon fiber struts increased the hydrophobicity of carbon fiber and its contact angle with water increased from 90 to 150 besides the results of ftir confirmed successful adsorption of sds onto zif 8 carbon fiber surfaces which is believed to be governed by both electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interactions in addition the results of batch experiments illustrated that adsorption of sds onto zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent is rapid with an equilibrium time of 30 min and follows a first order kinetic model r 2 0 9944 furthermore the langmuir isotherm model was best fitted adsorption equilibrium r 2 0 9899 at different ph values the results revealed the removal quantity after five cycles was decreased by 20 for sds removal moreover the maximum adsorption capacity of sds on the zif 8 carbon fiber was obtained 377 7 mg g at the optimal conditions the column adsorption experiments showed that inline sds removal is possible graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zif 8 carbon fiber sds column process kinetic adsorption isotherm 1 introduction different volumes of wastewater during various production processes at industries are produced which need to be removed quickly to prevent their release into the environment 1 3 the surfactant concentration should be reduced to environmental standards at different stages of water discharge to the environment surfactants are a large group of pollutants added by humans to aqueous environments surfactants are found in commonly used products such as detergents soaps pharmaceuticals personal care products and in industries such as leather products 4 5 surfactants are divided into different types according to their ionic properties including cationic anionic nonionic and amphoteric 6 the most widely used group of surfactants are anionic surfactants which make up about 90 of all ionic surfactants 4 7 one of the most anionic surfactants widely used in commercial cleaners is sodium dodecyl sulfate sds a synthetic surfactant with a 12 carbon hydrocarbon chain 8 9 the surfactant molecule has a hydrophobic non polar tail and a hydrophilic polar head 10 as a result the release of this pollutant into aqueous environments seems inevitable discharge of wastewater to the environment and use of sewage sludge as a fertilizer on agricultural lands cause the entry of surfactants into the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem 11 12 the entrance of these compounds into the environment especially the aquatic ecosystem leads to problems such as toxicity to animals and humans pollution of water and lakes dangerous effects on aquatic and plants increased algae and foam production therefore the removal of surfactants is necessary before discharging the effluent to the environment 13 the sodium dodecyl sulfate sds is one of the most abundant surfactants in the anion group that may accumulate in the human body 14 the most common ozonation process to remove surfactants on a real scale is very costly and challenging 15 due to the strong antimicrobial properties of some surfactants it is impossible to use biological methods to remove this contaminant at high concentrations 16 therefore it seems that adsorption is an appropriate technology to remove this contaminant and is more practical than other known methods due to the simplicity of preparation easy handling and favorable costs 17 so far various materials such as activated carbon 18 silica 19 and alumina 20 have been used in the adsorption process the multiple problems such as the high cost and the possibility of activating and reviving them have led researchers to seek new adsorbents 21 22 various studies have been investigated in this field from many years ago until now in 1999 hana et al 23 investigated the biodegradation of sds using biofilm of pseudomonas c12b on a glass support the results showed the formation of the biofilm on glass beads with reasonable effectiveness to reduce sds concentration below 10 mg ml in 2010 gao et al 24 researched sds adsorption by surfaces of zinc selenide znse and a fe2o3 the uptake studies confirmed hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic attraction as dominate adsorption mechanisms the equilibrium adsorption was carried out to the a fe2o3 surface within a few minutes whereas adsorption to the znse was a much slower process in 2018 nagwanshi et al 25 examined the activated charcoal to remove sds the treated alkali activated charcoal as the adsorbent bed was exposed better results than untreated and acid activated charcoal the modeling of adsorption behavior revealed that the langmuir adsorption was better fitted with the empirical data than the freundlich adsorption isotherm in 2019 pravin et al 26 studied sds removal using activated coconut shell adsorbent the adsorbent was modified using phosphoric acid as an activation agent the modeling results showed a pseudo second order kinetic model and the langmuir model provided a better fit with monolayer adsorption nanotechnology as a common technology has recently been used to purify and remove pollutants 27 nanoporous materials can be used to adsorb different types of pollutants with fantastic features such as large surface area small size crystalline shape and high lattice order resulting in very high reactivity 28 29 in recent years metal organic frameworks mofs have drawn considerable attention due to their ability to eliminate contaminants such as heavy metals 30 radionuclides 31 surfactants 32 hazardous organic and inorganic compounds 33 34 zeolitic imidazole frameworks zifs with a much widespread range of pore sizes and well defined shapes and sizes have attracted much attention they have been tested for sensing 35 drug delivery 36 gas storage 37 electrochemical supercapacitors 38 catalysis 39 40 dye degradation 41 42 wastewater treatment 43 and oil absorption 44 zifs are a group of hierarchical porous materials in which zn is connected to organic ligands such as 2 methylimidazolite benzimidazole etc through organo metallic bonds 45 zif 8 has the potential for being used as an adsorbate of water pollutants 44 46 48 in addition sds with applications in various industries is still used in many fields therefore sds is considered a problematic type of surfactant contamination compared to other surfactants in conclusion sds could be a representative to approximate the adsorption capacity of the zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 carbon fiber zif 8 carbon fiber to surfactants the schematic of the research process is shown in fig 1 in this study removing sodium dodecyl sulfate sds as contamination in water is examined using the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent by batch and column process first the zif 8 carbon fiber is synthesized and characterized then the effect of ph on the amount of sds adsorption onto the zif 8 carbon fiber in a batch system is studied furthermore the effect of variables such as sds concentration and inflow rate in a fixed bed column is evaluated the quantitative and qualitative adsorption results of sds are measured by the uv vis spectrophotometer and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir respectively in addition adsorption equilibrium models langmuir freundlich and temkin and adsorption kinetic models first order and second order are studied in this process column adsorption behavior is studied based on the standard models of thomas yoon nelson and clark to evaluate the continuous adsorption mechanism 2 experimental method 2 1 materials 2 methylimidazole

purchased from afzir tehran iran hydrochloric acid solution hcl 37 wt and ammonia solution nh4oh 25 wt were used to adjust the ph and were supplied from merck germany all materials were used as received without additional purification 2 2 synthesis of zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was produced in situ by one step method including synthesis and deposition of zif 8 nanostructure on layered carbon fiber by a simple dip coating protocol as detailed in our previous study 44 first zinc nitrate and 2 methyl imidazole with a stoichiometric ratio of 1 2 were dissolved in two separate solutions of 30 ml methanol at room temperature then the zinc nitrate solution was added to the 2 methyl imidazole solution slowly and stirred for 10 min afterward the carbon fiber substrate with a fixed number of layers was dipped into the solution gradually for 2 h the coating process was repeated 4 times to achieve better coverage of the carbon fiber substrate the zif 8 carbon fiber was washed 3 times with methanol to clear any defective coatings and finally dried at 80 c for 12 h the experiments were repeated three times under controlled conditions and the final results were reported with 5 error 2 3 analysis and characterization the morphology of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent was explored using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi s4160 model tokyo japan the crystallite structure of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was determined by x ray diffractometer xrd equinox3000 inel paris france with 2θ from 0 to 90 cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 20 ma scherrer equation eq 1 was used to calculate the average crystal diameter of the samples 49 1 d 0 9 λ β cos θ where λ is the radiation

adsorption procedure and models first the critical micelle concentration cmc of sds was determined by measuring the surface tension of sds aqueous solution with different concentrations the surface tension was recorded on a processor tensiometer k12 germany which uses the plate method uv vis spectrophotometer varian australia pty ltd cary 100 conc australia was used to measure sds concentration a uv vis calibration curve of sds aqueous concentration was established based on absorbance at 291nm corresponding to a maximum sds absorbance in order to reduce errors a stock solution of 500 mg l was prepared and then diluted to lower concentrations all experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 1 c in addition the effect of ph 2 12 on sds uptake was investigated the ph of the aqueous sds solution was adjusted by adding hydrochloric acid hcl in the acidic range and ammonium hydroxide nh4oh in the basic range tests were repeated at least three times and the average results were reported together with the 95 confidence interval the sds uptake effectiveness r was calculated by eq 2 2 r c i c e c i 100 where c i mg l denotes the initial sds concentration and c e mg l is sds concentration at equilibrium to study the reusability of the zif 8 carbon fiber washing with heat treatment was used the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent was recovered using 0 25 m naoh solution zif 8 carbon fiber was washed with naoh solution for 30 min under 150 rpm of stirring followed by heat treatment of the recovered adsorbent at 80 c for 6 h to study adsorption kinetics batch experiments were performed in these experiments a constant mass 1 g of the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent was added to 1000 ml of 400 mg l aqueous sds solution a 10 ml sample of the solutions was collected for uv vis measurements every 5 min sds concentration as function of time was recorded with the help of the calibration curve fig s1 the following models were studied to describe the kinetics of adsorption the linear form of the first order kinetic model is presented by eq 3 50 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t where q t mg g denotes the amount adsorbed per 1 g adsorbent at a given time q e is adsorption per 1

eq 6 51 6 q e c i c e v w where w is the amount of adsorbent g batch experiments were also performed to study the adsorption isotherms models of adsorption isotherms of langmuir temkin and freundlich

column adsorption experiments as depicted in fig 2 a cylindrical column of 3 cm diameter and 15 cm height was packed with 4 g of zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent solutions of different sds

as shown in fig 3 44 the xrd pattern of carbon fiber shows two main peaks which is in good agreement with previous literature 59 the peaks for zif 8 carbon fiber correspond to 011 002 112 022 013 222 114 233 134 044 244 and 235 lattice planes confirming a successful synthesis of zif 8 crystals onto the carbon fiber substrate as also depicted in the literature 60 the average crystallite size of zif 8 particles was 27 4 nm as obtained from scherrer s equation eq 1 at the peak corresponding to 2θ 6 43 fe sem micrographs in fig 4a portray the smooth surface of carbon fiber with cylindrical shapes of 2 5 μm diameters the carbon fiber struts create pore sizes ranging from 10 to 50 μm 44 fig 4b d shows the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite at different magnifications the zif 8 nanoparticles with particle sizes ranging between 30 to 50 nm appear aggregated onto the carbon fiber support accordingly the zif 8 coating imparts surface roughness and increases the hydrophobicity of the carbon fiber surface the water contact angle wca of the carbon fiber and zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was 90 and 150 respectively as shown in fig s2 the properties of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent are detailed in table 1 table 1 shows high pore volume and specific surface area for zif 8 carbon fiber indicating that the zif 8 carbon fiber is an efficient adsorbent the average pores sizes of 1 6 and 3 8 nm are obtained by the barrett joyner halenda bjh curve with two peaks 3 2 adsorption results 3 2 1 adsorption kinetics and isotherms fig 5 suggests that 30 min of 200 rpm mixing was sufficient to achieve equilibrium for sds adsorption onto the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent to assess the ph effect on sds adsorption batch adsorption tests were performed at various ph values as depicted in fig 6 the adsorption effectiveness of sds decreases with increasing ph the equilibrium uptake on the other hand monotonically increases with increasing ph from 2 to 5 whereas monotonically decreases with increasing ph between 7 to 12 therefore ph of 5 was considered as the optimum value for sds uptake by zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite which corresponds to the maximum uptake of 377 7 mg g since carbon fiber was completely covered by zif 8 fig 3 the adsorption capacity is controlled by zif 8 literature findings 61 showed that zif 8 displays the highest stability over a ph range of 5 12 for ph 5 the structure of zif 8 becomes unstable and zn2 ions are released into the solution which effectively reduces the performance of the adsorbent in addition phpzc point of zero charge determines the amount of adsorbent charge and thus affects adsorbent performance due to changes in adsorbent adsorbate interactions phpzc of zif 8 is 9 8 as reported in the literature 61 62 at ph above phpzc zif 8 is negatively charged whereas below phzpc zif 8 is positively charged 63 on the other hand at low ph the acid form of sds predominates which limits the dissociation of sds and hence its electrostatic interaction with the charged zif 8 surface at high ph sds is fully dissociated and carries a negatively charged head group since it is an anionic surfactant accordingly at high ph electrostatic repulsion between the adsorbent and adsorbate predominates which limits sds uptake at low ph on the other hand the low stability of zif 8 and the limited dissociation of sds limited the uptake a sweet spot corresponding to the highest uptake is found at ph 5 64 potential mechanisms for sds adsorption from the aqueous solution by zif 8 carbon fiber are ion exchange ion coupling hydrophobic bonding as well as adsorption using facilitated by electron polarization hydrogen bonding and adsorption using dispersion forces 26 following the ion coupling theory the ions in the surfactant are adsorbed on vacancies with opposite charges the schematic of the adsorption using electrostatic force is shown in fig 7a when the zif 8 coverage is immersed in aqueous solution some active sites such as znoh and the protonated n atoms e g cnh2 cnh groups are created at ph 5 through protonated reaction the positive active sites are able to adsorb the negative sds species via electrostatic attraction efficiently 65 the hydrophobic interaction is another mechanism for adsorption and is schematically illustrated in fig 7b when the hydrophobe zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite is introduced in the aqueous solution water molecules rearrange their molecular structure and rebuild their hydrogen bonds surrounding the hydrophobe with minimum interaction with hydrophobic surface 66 the ftir spectra of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite sds and zif 8 carbon fiber right after adsorption and after three times washing with water and drying at 80 c are given in fig 8 the zif 8 carbon fiber ftir spectrum incorporates the stretching vibration of the oh at 3428 cm 1 67 the absorption band 2922 cm 1 is identified as the stretching vibrations of the ch group in the methylene chains and the imidazole ring in the zif 8 whereas the band at 1146 cm 1 is identified for the aromatic cn stretching mode 44 68 furthermore the band at 996 cm 1 is probably reported for ring deformation 69 the absorption band at 2853 cm 1 relates to ch group in the methylene chains the peak at 1625 cm 1 relates to the stretching vibration mode of cc or cn 68 70 the peaks at 1458 cm 1 and 1377 cm 1 are related to bending modes of the ch and ch3 respectively the bending vibration of methylene ch2 is assigned to the absorption band at 722 cm 1 for the carbon fiber 70 accordingly all the zif 8 ftir spectra are in agreement with reference peaks found in the literatures 71 72 in fig 8b the peak at 3468 cm 1 is the hoh stretching the peaks at 2922 and 2865 are belong to the stretching bands of ch2 and peak at 1470 cm 1 belongs to vibrating band of ch the peak at 1220 cm 1 is related to skeletal vibration of so bridge stretching the peak at 1082 cm 1 is so stretching the peaks at 833 and 634 cm 1 belong to the asymmetric bending of ch in ch2 group 73 74 the peaks of the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite with sds surfactant show successful adsorption of sds molecules onto zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite both the spectra of zif 8 carbon fiber with sds and the washed zif 8 carbon fiber with sds are similar suggesting strong sds adsorption onto zif 8 carbon fiber fig 8d adsorption kinetic was investigated to better understand the effect of concentration on the time required to achieve equilibrium and the governing rate model table 2 summarizes the outcome of fitting the first order and the second order kinetic models to the experimental data of sds adsorption table 2 suggests that the first order kinetic model fits the adsorption results to a better extent r 2 between 0 9921 and 0 9988 than the second order r 2 between 0 9439 and 0 9774 for all values of initial concentrations 150 400 mg l it is noted that the second order kinetic model assumes chemical adsorption or chemisorption is the rate controlling step hence the adsorption rate depends on adsorption capacity instead of the concentration of adsorbate 75 76 the first order kinetic model assumes that the adsorption rate with time is proportional to the difference in saturation concentration and the adsorption amount directly it is commonly observed that the adsorption occurs by diffusion mechanism through the interface 77 78 to study sds adsorption equilibrium freundlich langmuir and temkin models were applied the parameters of the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms for sds adsorption are reported in table 3 the correlation coefficient r 2 was used to select the best fit the r 2 for the langmuir isotherm was 0 9899 the values of r 2 for the freundlich and temkin isotherms were obtained 0 7996 and 0 8553 respectively this suggests that monolayer adsorption likely best fits sds adsorption onto the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite adsorbent the affinity of sds to the surface of the adsorbent is determined by the unitless constant separation factor or equilibrium parameter r l as given by eq 17 79 17 r l 1 1 k l c i r l value indicates the favorability of adsorption for the optimal adsorption r l should be 0 r l 1 whereas for linear adsorption form r l 1 for adverse adsorption r l 1 and r l 0 are encountered inefficiency and irreversibility respectively 79 80 3 2 2 optimizing the column adsorption 3 2 2 1 influence of inflow rate fig 9 shows the breakthrough curves for sds adsorption at different input flow rate as the inlet flow rate increases the breakthrough time c c 0 0 05 and exhaustion time c c 0 0 95 decrease the contact time with the adsorbent in the column is reduced by increasing the inflow rate for a given inflow concentration c 0 hence the residence time corresponding to high inflow rates does not allow for diffusion of sds into the pores of the zif 8 carbon fiber which decreases the volume of the sds solution being treated breakthrough time and volume are reduced accordingly as shown in fig 9 for larger inflow rates 30 ml min 50 ml min a sharper breakthrough curve is obtained given the fast migration of sds solution through the column past the adsorbent inflow rate of 20 ml min rather than 15 ml min was selected as the optimum since it helps achieving higher wastewater treatment rates table 4 shows sds column adsorption parameters at different sds solution inflow rates with increasing inflow rate the maximum capacity q total and the equilibrium capacity of the column q eq exp are decreased in addition as the inflow rate increased the total removal percent of the adsorbate y decreased from 91 5 to 76 1 this behavior is attributed to the insufficient residence time of sds solution in the column to diffuse into the active sites of the zif 8 cf nanocomposite although higher flow rates help achieving effective bulk mixing they impact pore diffusion to a much less extent 3 2 2 2 influence of sds concentration fig 10 shows the breakthrough curves for sds adsorption at different influent sds concentrations the results show that by increasing the initial sds concentration the breakthrough time c c 0 0 05 and exhaustion time c c 0 0 95 decrease as the concentration of sds increases sharper breakthrough curves are obtained indicating a shorter mass transfer zone this is due to the faster saturation of the adsorbent at higher sds concentrations the adsorption process consists of three stages the migration of sds molecules from the bulk solution to the adsorbent surface followed by the diffusion of the adsorbate into the pores and lastly the adsorption onto an active site 81 increasing the bulk concentration of sds increases the driving force for pore diffusion which is likely the rate limiting step this conclusion is also supported by the minor impact of sds solution flow rate on adsorption kinetics as reported earlier table 5 shows the results obtained from sds adsorption at different influent sds concentrations the results showed that with increasing sds concentration the maximum capacity q total and the equilibrium capacity of the column q eq exp increase slightly but the adsorption efficiency decreases with increasing the inflow concentration of sds from 200 to 500 mg l the column capacity only increased a little from 1510 mg to 1520 mg while the column capacity was approximately constant the sds adsorption efficiency decreased from 94 3 to 84 4 this behavior is due to saturating the column with adsorbed sds the removal of sds by adsorption onto zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite is comparable to other methods used by the literature higher sds removal capacity by zif 8 carbon fiber was obtained than removal values reported by hana et al 23 who investigated the biodegradation of sds using biofilm of pseudomonas c12b on a glass support gong et al 82 reported the elimination of sds from water using water hyacinth plant over many days sds could be eliminated after 12 day treatment of 10 mg l sds solution whereas 99 1 sds removal could be removed for 20 mg l solution in the presence of 0 4 mg l chromolaena odorata l extract in other studies natural armenian zeolite with hydrophobic properties showed an adsorption capacity for sds of 113 mg g 83 chitosan hydrogel beads in the presence of crystal violet dye showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 76 9 mg g for sds 84 3 2 3 column data analysis yoon nelson 54 thomas 55 and clark 56 models were studied to investigate the kinetics of column adsorption comparison of model predictions and the experiments are shown in fig 11 table 6 presents the fitted parameters of the column adsorption kinetic models generally all the models achieved high coefficients of determination r 2 0 96 per table 6 the thomas model assumes langmuir equilibrium isotherm with no axial dispersion in the column also thomas model assumes the kinetics of adsorption is governed by a second order kinetics 57 the results show that q o values increased with increasing the input flow concentration whereas k th values decreased as noted earlier better column performance is achieved at higher sds concentration likely due to the higher driving force for pore diffusion 85 the values of the yoon nelson model parameters τ and k yn are also given in table 6 yoon nelson s model describes monolayer adsorption with the probability of sds breakthrough or adsorption proportional to the reduction rate and the possibility of every adsorbate molecule adsorption 56 when the inflow concentration increases k yn increases too while τ decreases at higher sds concentrations the competition between adsorption of sds molecules increases resulting in overall increased adsorption 86 furthermore for the clark model the value of the parameter r increases with increasing sds concentration while the value of a decreased the adsorption rate was improved owing to the high concentration gradient between the adsorbent and sds solution creating a great driving force for the adsorption process the recycling of the adsorbent depends on the desorption or regeneration efficiency of the adsorbent the adsorption of sds onto the zif 8 carbon fiber depends on the properties of the adsorbent the adsorbate and the solution especially the surface charge and the ph of the solution 87 the zif 8 carbon fiber adsorbent was successfully regenerated by mixing with 0 25 m aqueous naoh solution 30 ml 1 g as stated earlier phzpc of the zif 8 is 9 8 61 beyond this value both the surface of the adsorbent and sds are negatively charged thus aqueous naoh could be used for the regeneration of adsorbent according to our tests the sds uptake effectiveness after five cycles decreased only by 20 a feasible adsorption process needs to be efficient economic and environmentally benign removal of surfactants from water using adsorption is highly efficient cost effective environmentally friendly and easy to operate 88 89 in this work improved adsorbent is prepared by depositing zif 8 nanostructures onto the carbon fiber substrate is introduced and tested in situ zif 8 carbon fiber preparation with minimum use of chemicals reduces the cost of adsorbent zif 8 carbon fiber featured high rates of adsorption kinetics high uptake and efficient regeneration 4 conclusions in this study the sds uptake from aqueous solution by the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite produced from precipitation method was investigated in a batch system static and continuous adsorption in a column dynamic the effect of ph on sds adsorption quantity in the batch system was investigated further the effect of sds concentration and inflow rate were studied in the column system to obtain the optimal conditions with high effectiveness the structural analysis showed the crystalline diameter of 27 4 nm and particle size ranging between 30 and 50 nm for the zif 8 nanoparticles the coating of zif 8 nanoparticles on the carbon fiber struts enhanced the hydrophobicity of the zif 8 carbon fiber with wca of 150 the sds adsorption mechanism into the zif 8 carbon fiber nanocomposite was based on the hydrophobic interaction of the hydrocarbon tail and the electrostatic forces of the polar head group with the zif 8 carbon fiber surface the results of batch experiments illustrated that adsorption of sds onto the zif 8 carbon fiber is rapid with an equilibrium time of 30 min the maximum sds adsorption capacity of 377 7 mg g was obtained from the batch system at an optimum ph value of 5 in addition the results revealed that the langmuir isotherm was better fitted with empirical data r 2 0 9899 rather than the freundlich and temkin models it was also a good fit between experimental kinetic data and the first order kinetic model r 2 0 9944 the results of recycling showed the separation capacity after five cycles was decreased by 20 for sds removal finally modeling of sds adsorption in the continuous system showed that the yoon nelson thomas and clark models are in good agreement with the column adsorption process with coefficient of determination r 2 0 96 0 99 nomenclature sds sodium
