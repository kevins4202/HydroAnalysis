5005,subsurface pipe drainage spd has been widely applied in arid and semiarid regions to control soil salinization to increase the accuracy of hydrus 2d simulations in spd three effective strategies including the resistance layer rl actual infiltration surface ais and equivalent radius er treatments were proposed to replace the standard seepage boundary ssb for subsurface pipes in hydrus 2d first the accuracy of the three strategies was calibrated using laboratory experiments with the multi objective calibration method of the pest program second additional laboratory experiments were conducted to validate the three strategies the rl ais and er strategies obtained a relatively high simulation accuracy in terms of the soil salt content ssc soil water content swc and drainage and salt discharge processes that was significantly higher than that obtained with the standard seepage boundary ssb strategy moreover compared with the ais er and ssb strategies the rl strategy attained the highest simulation accuracy regarding the water drainage root mean square error rmse 3 42 l mean absolute error mae 2 91 l and salt discharge rmse 0 12 kg mae 0 11 kg in spd the relative position of the subsurface pipe has an important effect on the desalting rate of the clay layer cl based on the spd simulation by hydrus 2d with the rl strategy we recommend placing the subsurface pipe below the clay layer to obtain the best water drainage and salt discharge effects in regions containing cls furthermore a positive logarithmic relationship between the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe and the cl saturated hydraulic conductivity was found r2 0 99 future research should focus on the upper and lower boundary conditions of hydrus 2d to further increase the spd simulation accuracy keywords hydrus 2d subsurface pipe boundary clay layer soil salinization 1 introduction soil salinization is a global agricultural environmental issue that not only inhibits crop growth and reduces the crop yield and quality but also decreases fertilizer use efficiency and increases the soil nutrient loss risk xinjiang is a large agricultural region in china nearly one third of the existing cultivated land is damaged by salinity and soil salinization has become an obstacle to the development of agricultural economy subsurface pipe drainage spd and ditch drainage are often applied to control the groundwater level and reduce the soil salinity in saline regions ritzema et al 2008 however compared with ditch drainage spd improves the land use efficiency and facilitates agricultural mechanization additionally spd increases the lateral discharge of salt and thus enhances the salt discharge efficiency bahçeci and nacar 2009 an unreasonable layout of subsurface pipes often causes increased soil nutrient loss and chemical pollution levels therefore it is necessary to accurately quantify the soil water and salt transport processes of spd systems to optimize the layout of subsurface pipes and the leaching scheme the layout of subsurface pipes including the spacing burial depth and diameter of the pipes has been proven to affect the salt discharge in spd and many studies have focused on these points salo et al 2019 yu et al 2018 bonaiti and borin 2010 conducted a study on the drainage capacity of subsurface irrigation and spd in northeast italy and found that when the distance between pipes was 8 m the drainage effect of these pipes achieved the best performance after considering drainage in farmlands with mulched drip irrigation it was determined that a better salinity leaching effect in areas with a smaller distance between subsurface pipes was achieved through spd he et al 2016 similar findings were also reported by zhang et al 2014 and mastrocicco et al 2013 wang et al 2006 noted that shallow pipe drainage effectively reduced the salt content in the upper soil thus increasing the crop yield li et al 2016 indicated that the desalination rate of the soil above the pipe increased with the burial depth tao et al 2016 improved the spd process by using a filter consisting of high permeability materials moreover filipović et al 2014 demonstrated that spd with gravel trenches attained a higher performance in reducing waterlogging and runoff than conventional spd however such experiments are usually costly and time consuming and the results are typically specific to the local soil texture and lack universality additionally due to the multiple layout parameters in the spd process forkutsa et al 2009 it is difficult to conduct systematic quantitative experiments to assess these influencing factors therefore it is necessary to quickly and systematically investigate the water and salt transport processes in the spd system with a numerical model thereby optimizing the spd layout currently the commonly used models considering the layout in spd and solute transport include hydrus 2d drainmod swat and dual permeability type models ebrahimian and noory 2015 applied hydrus 2d to simulate subsurface drainage in paddy fields and found that the measured values were in good agreement with the simulated values wahba and christen 2006 used drainmod to simulate the influence of the buried pipe depth and spacing on groundwater level control similarly luo et al 2010 simulated the transport of nitrate nitrogen in the spd with drainmod n among these models the basis of the drainmod model is a simple total water and salt balance the input parameters are relatively few in number but the specific process of water and solute movement in soil is less extensively described at the field scale the dual permeability model has been widely implemented to simulate subsurface drainage gerke and vangenuchten 1993 gerke and köhne 2004 nonetheless the parameter determination is limited in contrast hydrus 2d can accurately simulate the water transport process in two dimensional unsaturated soils under flexible boundary conditions tang 2011 therefore many studies have applied hydrus 2d for spd simulations castanheira and serralheiro 2010 found that subsurface drainage was effective for soil conservation and reduced the salinization risk via hydrus 2d simulations mante et al 2018 determined the number of field workable days with spd using hydrus 2d qian et al 2019 evaluated the performance of spd with hydrus 2d based on the soil salt and water contents and they observed that the model accuracy in the spd process could be improved by calibrating the final results of the soil profile gärdenäs et al 2006 applied equivalent nodal sinks in a structured finite element mesh to represent drains by adopting adjusted hydraulic conductivity values kohler et al 2001 extended the swms 2d model by adding a macropore flow component and an entrance head in the drainage boundary condition and found that the model simulated discharge and solute transport processes suitably the simulation accuracy in these studies has been acceptable as reported and the model was mainly calibrated from the perspective of the soil water and salt contents and other chemical transport characteristics abbaspour et al 2001 novak et al 2003 kohne and gerke 2005 previous studies have also mainly applied standard seepage boundaries for subsurface pipes table 1 however the drainage capacity of the standard seepage boundary is much higher than that of an actual subsurface pipe and it is difficult to simulate the pipe drainage process by only considering the standard seepage boundary li et al 2016 thus it is important to apply new boundary conditions based on ssb for subsurface pipes to increase the simulation accuracy for the spd process in hydrus 2d clay layers cls are very common in saline soils in arid and semiarid regions previous studies have demonstrated that cls usually occur below 60 cm in the soil profile with notable water retention which could hinder water and salt transport liu et al 2013a d angelo et al 2014 accordingly the cl is another important factor influencing the drainage and salt removal efficiencies of spd bakken et al 2009 however previous researchers have primarily focused on the layout of subsurface pipes in homogeneous soils while few studies have considered the spd layout in the presence of cls yang et al 2019 in addition the field experiments on subsurface pipe drainage applied in the cl regions are time consuming and labor intensive therefore it is important to evaluate the effect of subsurface pipe drainage on salt discharge through the hydrus 2d model this study aimed to increase the accuracy of the hydrus 2d model for the spd system and to test its applicability in soils with cls first three strategies including resistance layer rl actual infiltration surface ais and equivalent radius er were proposed to replace the standard seepage boundary ssb for the spd process in hydrus 2d second hydrus 2d with different subsurface pipe boundaries was evaluated against experimental data thereafter the effect of the subsurface pipe layout on water and salt transport in the field in the presence of cls was determined based on hydrus 2d simulations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design two experiments were conducted in the agricultural water conservancy and water environment laboratory at wuhan university to calibrate and verify the accuracy of the model simulation results the experimental equipment included a leaching tank fig 1 and its length width and height were 150 51 and 95 cm respectively to control the water depth and ensure continuous leaching conditions during flooding irrigation six spillway holes φ 7 5 mm were drilled in the front surface and two side surfaces of the leaching tank at a distance of 3 5 cm from the top a corrugated pipe with a 3 opening rate was buried at the center of the front of the leaching tank 65 cm below the top the slope of the pipe was 2 the outer diameter of the pipe was 54 mm and the inner diameter was 50 mm the pipe was wrapped with a layer of permeable nonwoven fabric to prevent soil particles from clogging the drainage holes in the subsurface pipe soil samples were collected in alar 40 33 58 n 79 49 32 e xinjiang province china where spd is implemented to reduce soil salinization the soil particle size distribution was measured by a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments co ltd uk and the soil bulk density was determined by collecting undisturbed soil using a cutting ring table 2 the soil was air dried and pretreated to remove impurities with a 2 mm soil sieve because spd has been applied for 5 years to control soil salinization at the site where the soil samples were collected the soil salinity was relatively low ece 4 ds m 1 to reduce the impact of salt removal by spd in highly saline soil 4 286 kg nacl was weighed and dissolved in 11 84 kg of water the nacl solubility measured in the laboratory was approximately 36 2 g per 100 g water at 25 c and the nacl solution was then diluted and mixed into the soil samples in layers to simulate the field soil distribution the soil was placed in the drainage tank in layers moreover the soil was compacted every 5 cm finally the soil in the drainage tank was divided into 4 layers and each layer had a thickness of 20 cm the bulk density of each layer was maintained the same as that in the field in the calibration experiment the total irrigation amount was 19 2 cm the ponding water lasted for 19 5 h and the surface ponding water was uniformly distributed across the surface soil at the infiltration stage drainage started after 4 2 h of irrigation which lasted for 85 8 h two weeks after the end of the calibration experiment the validation experiment was conducted in the second experiment the total irrigation amount was 9 2 cm the ponding water persisted for 9 6 h and drainage started after 1 6 h of irrigation which lasted for 58 4 h the inflow flux of the ponding water was measured by a plexiglass scale and recorded every 30 min the spd discharge was measured through a tipping flowmeter qt 100 ml beijing china and drainage samples were collected every 30 min to measure the electrical conductivity ec the soil samples were obtained at a distance of 35 cm from the subsurface pipe along the horizontal direction within 24 h after the end of drainage along the longitudinal direction soil samples at depths of 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 and 75 cm were collected with a soil drill the volume of each soil sample was 20 cm3 all soil samples were electronically measured to determine their wet weight and then dried in a hot air oven dhg 9030a shanghai china at 105 c for 8 h after drying the dry weight of each sample was measured to calculate the soil moisture content and 15 g of each soil sample was collected ground sieved through a 1 mm sieve and then placed in a 150 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 75 ml of deionized water the water soil mass ratio 1 5 the erlenmeyer flask was shaken on an oscillator thz 98a shanghai china after standing for 24 h the ec of the water extract was measured with a conductivity meter dds 307 shanghai thunder magnetic instrument factory the total soluble salt tds content was calculated from the extracted ec1 5 value and the relationship between the soil salt content ssc and ec1 5 was calibrated using the drying residue method as follows heng et al 2018 1 tds 4 3 e c 1 5 0 6118 r 2 0 97 where tds is the ssc g kg 1 and e c 1 5 is the ec value ds m 1 2 2 the basic theory of hydrus 2d in this study hydrus 2d software was used to simulate the dynamic changes in soil water and salt under the condition of spd it can simulate two or three dimensional axisymmetric flow conditions based on numerical solutions of partial differential equations with the finite element method šimůnek et al 2016 hydrus 2d is often adopted to simulate soil moisture and solute transport processes and the simulation results perform well under many conditions including those reported by patel and rajput 2008 liu et al 2013a liu et al 2013b and wang et al 2014 in the hydrus 2d model a two dimensional saturated unsaturated richards equation šimůnek et al 2011 was adopted to describe soil water movement 2 θ t x k θ θ x z k θ θ z k θ z s where θ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 k θ is the

conditions were considered for the subsurface pipe in this study fig 2 in the first case as a contrast ssb with a subsurface pipe of the actual radius was considered fig 2a second a rl was included in addition to a subsurface pipe with a 1 cm ring width rw to simulate the combined interface of nonwoven fabric and corrugated pipe fig 2b the inner ring represented the seepage boundary moreover the rl did not exist in the actual experiment but it represented the hypothetical soil layer reducing the outflow of the subsurface pipe reflecting the resistance due to the nonwoven fabric and the small opening rate of the subsurface pipe in the rl strategy the rl saturated hydraulic conductivity was much lower than that of the soil layer containing the subsurface pipe next considering that the actual infiltration surface was very small due to the low actual opening rate 3 of the subsurface pipe impermeable boundaries were alternately added to the seepage boundary of the subsurface pipe in which the length of the seepage boundary part was approximately one third of the drain circumference of the subsurface pipe fig 2c in the fourth case the seepage boundary was directly adapted however considering the head loss and actual drainage area the er was adopted to replace the actual radius of the subsurface pipe fig 2d the er of the subsurface pipe was calculated with the following equation dierickx 1980 6 α e c 2 π 2 r o ln 2 c π β v c 4 π r o c 2 π β v ln r o r o 1 2 π ln r o r o 7 r ef r o exp 2 π α e where α e is the resistance factor r o is the outer radius of the

in this study the er of the subsurface pipe is 0 2 cm 2 4 initial and boundary conditions in the calibration experiment the initial water and salt contents of each soil layer in the simulation area were measured before and after filling the tank after filling the water content of each soil layer was roughly equal table 2 two weeks after the end of the first experiment the validation experiment was conducted since the periphery and bottom of the tank used in the experiment were impermeable the left and right boundaries and lower boundaries of the simulated two dimensional domain were defined as impermeable boundaries in this experiment the water head at the upper boundary gradually decreased over time according to the measured inflow data the upper boundary was set as a mixed boundary consisting of variable flux and atmospheric boundaries at the calibration stage during the first 19 5 h the boundary was defined as a variable flux boundary and during the last 70 5 h the boundary was set as an atmospheric boundary and the total water inflow was 19 2 cm at the validation stage the boundary was set as a variable flux boundary during the first 9 6 h while it was defined as an atmospheric boundary during the last 50 4 h and the total water inflow equaled 9 2 cm the specific settings are shown in fig 3 2 5 calibration and validation in this numerical simulation the time unit was the hour and the simulation periods lasted 90 calibration and 60 validation hours the initial input soil parameters were calculated by the artificial neural network calculation tool rosetta in hydrus 2d based on the measured bulk density and particle size distribution of each soil layer specifically the initial hydraulic parameters of the rl were set to be the same as those of the 40 60 cm soil layer before calibration in addition we only calibrated the original strategy ssb and then applied the calibrated parameters as the final input of the three strategies the rl ais and er strategies hence we could use the same set of hydraulic parameters gärdenäs et al 2006 to assess the simulation accuracy of the newly proposed strategies in the ssb process at the calibration stage the drainage and salt discharge processes were first calibrated and the final salt and water contents of the soil profile were then obtained specifically in the simulation process the cumulative drainage of the subsurface pipe over 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 and 75 h was extracted as was the cumulative salt discharge over 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 h in addition observation points were set at depths of 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 and 75 cm the salt and water contents of the final soil profile at the observation points were also acquired subsequently the measured values were compared with the simulated values by the pest multi objective correction method zeng et al 2016 in this method an external program was written in fortran this external program could call certain exe files in hydrus 2d and pest in each run fig 4 each call would change the k s and θ s values in the selector in input file of hydrus 2d moreover the variation scale of these parameters ranged from 0 9 to 1 1 when the simulated values were sufficiently similar to the measured values the values of the calibrated parameters would be selected from the run as the values of the final input parameters of the four strategies thereafter the calibration programming was stopped specifically when the calibration process was completed the hydraulic parameters of the rl strategy were separately calibrated to reduce the influence due to the various orders of magnitude the measured values of each group were normalized between 0 and 1 the initial rosetta and calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are listed in table 3 after the parameters were calibrated the second experiment was conducted for model validation 2 6 application considering the clay layer in different scenarios over the years due to the deep buried groundwater less rainfall and shallow tillage depth hao et al 2009 han et al 2015 the clay layer often exists in the soil at a depth of 0 6 1 2 m in xinjiang china due to long term drip irrigation under plastic film the salt above the clay layer is gradually accumulating yang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 only by conventional leaching the desalination effect of the clay layer was very poor due to its strong water retention and it often caused significant waste of water resources chen et al 2012 therefore it is very important to study the effect on promoting the leaching of salt by subsurface pipe drainage the buried depth and cl occurrence are important factors influencing the drainage and salt discharge in spd twelve different two dimensional scenarios were simulated to investigate the water and salt drainage in the spd process in farmlands containing cls the first four scenarios simulated the effect of the buried depth combined with the cl on the performance of the subsurface pipe a cl was usually observed in the 0 6 1 4 m soil layers in our study area heng et al 2018 in this study the thickness of the cl was 20 cm and the position of the cl was set to 90 110 cm based on jafari talukolaee et al 2015 and engineering practice the buried depth of the subsurface pipe was set to 0 7 0 8 1 3 and 1 5 m the other eight scenarios investigated the effect of the cl saturated hydraulic conductivity on the performance of the subsurface pipe based on the research of leong et al 1999 the saturated hydraulic conductivity of heavy clay is generally less than 5 cm d 1 in this study the cl saturated hydraulic conductivity was set to 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 2 4 3 3 6 and 4 8 cm d 1 the position of the cl ranged from 90 to 110 cm and the buried depth of the subsurface pipe was set to 1 3 m the diameter of the subsurface pipe was 10 cm and the boundary type was consistent with that of the rl strategy the simulation duration was 20 d similar to the field experiment conducted by li et al 2016 in xinjiang province china the upper boundary was set as a variable flux boundary for 1 5 d and the total flux was 40 cm subsequently an atmospheric boundary was defined for 6 20 d the distance between the subsurface pipes was 6 m and the groundwater buried depth was 3 m according to the principle of symmetry the final simulation area was 300 500 cm2 the defined soil hydraulic parameters are summarized in table 4 2 7 statistical analysis three indicators including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and determination coefficient r2 were considered to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model 1 rmse 8 rmse i 1 n a i b i 2 n 2 mae 9 mae i 1 n a i b i n 3 determination coefficient r2 10 r 2 1 i 1 n a i b i 2 i 1 n a i a 2 where n is the total number of data points a i is the measured value b i is the simulated value and a is the mean of the measured value if the rmse and mae are close to 0 the model attains a high performance the rmse is particularly useful when the model errors follow a normal distribution while the mae is more suitable for models with a uniform error distribution in contrast the r2 value is between 0 and 1 and it is acceptable when the value is larger than 0 5 an r2 closer to 1 indicates a good correlation between the simulated and measured value of model performance the soil desalination rate and spd rate were adopted to evaluate the performance of the subsurface pipe which can be expressed as 1 soil desalination rate 11 n s 1 s 2 s 1 2 spd rate 12 λ w 1 w 2 w 1 where s 1 and s 2 are the initial and final sscs respectively g kg 1 and w 1 and w 2 are the irrigation and drainage rates respectively 3 results 3 1 model performance the statistical results of the laboratory experiment simulations with the ssb rl ais and er strategies are listed in table 5 and a comparison of the simulated and measured values of the cumulative water flux cwf cumulative salt flux csf soil water content swc and soil salt content ssc is shown in figs 5 6 with regard to the ssb strategy it was clear that the csf was greatly overestimated at the early stage while at the later stage it was slightly higher than that observed at the calibration and validation stages however a better performance was attained with the rl ais and er strategies where the drainage process was almost consistent with the observed process based on the estimated values of the four strategies for the drainage process the rmse and mae of the rl strategy were 3 42 and 2 91 l respectively which were lower than those of the ais er and ssb strategies and the determination coefficient r2 of the rl strategy was 0 97 which was the largest this result shows that the rl strategy performs the best when simulating the drainage process similar to the drainage process fig 5b and 6b the rl strategy produced the smallest rmse and mae values and largest r2 value at both the calibration and validation stages among the four strategies which indicates that the rl strategy performed better in the cumulative salt flux simulations in addition the statistical results of the ais strategy rmse 0 16 kg mae 0 14 kg and r2 0 97 were similar to those of the er strategy rmse 0 15 kg mae 0 13 kg and r2 0 95 which reveals a higher accuracy than that of the ssb strategy in the cumulative salt flux simulations at the calibration stage therefore the three newly proposed strategies could predict the water drainage and salt discharge process better than the ssb strategy in the spd system the final ssc and swc profiles at the end of the drainage process for the four subsurface pipe boundaries are shown in figs 5c d and 6c d respectively during calibration the four strategies slightly underestimated the soil desalinization rate at depths from 0 to 60 cm but the simulated salinity values in the soil profile at depths from 60 to 80 cm agreed well with the measured values overall for the four strategies the simulated values of the soil salinity distribution were almost consistent with the observed values as indicated in table 5 the rmse mae and r2 ranges of the salt content simulations for the four strategies were 1 62 1 71 g kg 1 1 40 1 63 g kg 1 and 0 93 0 95 respectively during calibration and 0 11 0 21 g kg 1 0 069 0 19 g kg 1 and 0 84 0 88 respectively during validation therefore the four strategies attain a high accuracy in simulating the soil salinity distribution in the soil profile with regard to the soil water content the rmse and mae values of the four strategies were small which indicates a high accuracy of the four strategies however the r2 values of the ais treatment were only 0 78 calibration and 0 72 validation which were slightly larger than those of the ssb strategy indicating that the ais treatment still needs to be improved in terms of simulating the soil moisture profile overall it is concluded that the results of simulated soil moisture and salinity were satisfactory overall the rl strategy performed the best for simulating the cumulative water flux cumulative salt flux soil salt content and soil water content than the ssb ais and er strategies 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis the rl approach was found to be the best strategy to apply hydrus 2d for spd simulation among the four strategies table 5 the rl parameters of this strategy including ks and rw are two key factors that influence the simulation accuracy of the strategy however in various simulation domains ks and rw may be different therefore the sensitivity of the cumulative water flux cumulative salt flux soil salt content and soil water content to the parameters of ks and rw was analyzed in our study as indicated in table 6 a 50 change in ks and rw resulted in cwf and csf changes respectively ranging from 3 1 to 4 6 and 3 4 4 5 respectively and 0 6 7 14 and 0 73 7 38 changes respectively in the ssc and swc furthermore it was shown that the cwf and csf exhibited a higher sensitivity to ks while the ssc and swc were more sensitive to rw as revealed in table 6 3 3 application considering the clay layer as shown in fig 7 a b the cwf and csf of the subsurface pipe increased with increasing burial depth of the subsurface pipe however the water retention capacity of the cl decreased with increasing burial depth of the pipe fig 7d in addition the soil desalination rate of the cultivated layer above 1 m also increased with increasing burial depth fig 7c moreover the desalinization rate of the soil above the cl was notable but the position of the cl at 90 110 cm resulted in distinct salt accumulation in the scenarios in which the pipe was buried above the cl in contrast the cl also revealed the desalinization state in scenarios where the pipe was buried below the cl additionally the drainage and salt discharge rates in the spd process below the cl were 1 23 1 64 and 2 40 3 58 times respectively higher than those in the spd process above the cl therefore the pipe should be buried below the cl to drain more soil salt via spd in areas containing cls moreover it was found that the cl saturated hydraulic conductivity ks was a key parameter in spd as shown in fig 8 a b the cwf and csf increased with increasing ks of the cl furthermore the desalination rate of the soil above the subsurface pipe also increased with increasing cl ks value fig 8c however the final water content of the soil profile did not notably change with the change in the ks value of the cl fig 8d to determine the quantitative relationship between the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the cl and the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe the relationship between the ks values of different cls and the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe was fitted which was a logarithmic increase function fig 9 the fitting equation is 14 w r 0 44 ln k s 0 37 0 043 r 2 0 99 where w r is the pipe drainage rate and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the cl cm d 1 4 discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation boundary setting is a key issue in numerical simulation to obtain a suitable modeling performance tang 2011 amin salehi et al 2017 in previous studies the standard seepage boundary ssb was mostly applied for subsurface pipes in hydrus 2d castanheira and serralheiro 2010 ebrahimian and noory 2015 which will immediately discharge water when the surrounding soil is saturated šimůnek et al 2014 since the actual opening rate of the subsurface pipe is relatively low e g 3 in this study the ssb cannot characterize the actual drainage capacity of a subsurface pipe due to the high drainage capacity of the ssb most of the water and salt in the soil can be drained within a short time fig 5a b which would result in the simulated drainage process being inconsistent with the observed process and the overestimation of the actual drainage effect of subsurface pipes hence hydrus 2d could only simulate the general trend but not the dynamic amount during the entire drainage process of the subsurface pipe which was comparable to the findings of li et al 2016 however based on the standard option of hydrus 2d we can still implement some strategies to accurately simulate the outflow process of subsurface pipes therefore given the drainage characteristics of the seepage boundary and the physical structure and actual drainage area of the subsurface pipe we proposed three strategies the rl ais and er treatments to generalize the boundary of the subsurface pipe to increase the accuracy of hydrus 2d for spd simulations our study indicated that all three boundaries the er ais and rl treatments could accurately simulate the salt distribution in the soil profile the r2 and rmse values between the simulated and measured salt contents ranged from 1 62 to 1 71 g 1 kg and from 1 40 to 1 48 g 1 kg respectively similar to the er treatment to best describe drains in numerical models fipps et al 1986 selected four methods to represent a drain in finite element solutions of the richards equation and one of the methods successfully simulated the drainage process by applying a hole with the same effective radius as that of the drain pipe in a finite element mesh mante et al 2018 changed the diameter of the field drainage tile from 0 1 to 0 01 m to consider the partial permeability of the corrugated pipe and obtain more accurate simulation results thus the actual opening rate of the subsurface pipe could be characterized by the total permeability of the effective radius representing the partial permeability of the original radius dierickx 1980 additionally compared with the representation of drains by equivalent nodal sinks gärdenäs et al 2006 the ais treatment was more directly established to characterize the actual infiltration surface of the subsurface pipe by partial seepage drainage nodes our study achieved similar cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux accuracies with the er and ais treatments compared with the ssb strategy both the ais and er treatments reduced the drainage volume of the permeation boundary by decreasing the drainage area of the subsurface pipe boundary due to the reduction in displacement in the earlier period the simulation accuracy of the cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux obtained with the ais and er treatments was increased over the ssb level the better reproduction of the shapes of the cumulative water and salt fluxes is evident in fig 5 however the water conductivity of the seepage boundary adopted in these treatments was the same as that adopted in the ssb strategy high water conductivity may still cause a higher drainage capacity of the subsurface pipe than that in the actual situation šimůnek et al 2011 the simulation accuracy in regard to the cwf and csf of the ais and er treatments should be further improved the process simulated with the rl strategy was almost consistent with the observed process in the cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux simulations which represents a notable improvement over the ais er and ssb strategies at the calibration stage the r2 values of the rl strategy for the cwf and csf evaluation were the largest 0 97 and 0 98 respectively additionally the rl strategy attained the smallest rmse 3 42 l and 0 12 kg respectively and mae 2 91 l and 0 11 kg respectively values in both the cwf and csf simulations among the four strategies the reason was that although the drainage capacity of the seepage boundary was very high the velocity of the water flowing through the rl was relatively low due to its low ks obia et al 2018 therefore in this method the water inflow from the rl was reduced thus decreasing the drainage capacity of the seepage boundary which is different from the results of the study by heinen 2014 who reduced the displacement of a single drain node by adding a correction factor moreover similar results were also obtained in studies on the addition of outsourcing material to improve the spd simulation effect öztekin 2002 tao et al 2019 therefore we recommend the rl method in hydrus 2d as the subsurface pipe boundary to increase the accuracy of spd simulations in addition the ring width should not exceed the thickness of the soil layer containing the pipe otherwise it may impose a greater impact on the soil physical properties and eventually cause simulation errors 4 2 effects of the clay layer studies have demonstrated that the buried depth of the subsurface pipe and soil texture were two important factors influencing the salt removal effect via pipe drainage liang et al 2015 xin et al 2016 qian et al 2019 yang et al 2016 investigated the salt transport in different soil textures under drip irrigation in xinjiang china the results showed that the desalination rate of sand was higher than that of clay and that the depth of 60 cm was critical for clay soil salinity decreased above it and increased below it our study showed that salt accumulated in the cl when the subsurface pipe was buried above it this occurred because the ks value of the cl was low which caused a clear blocking effect on the leaching of salt in the upper soil layer and salt finally accumulated in the cl when pipe drainage ceased due to the water retention effect of the cl chen et al 2012 however the cl was notably desalted when the subsurface pipe was located below it this occurred because more water and salt could be drained by the subsurface pipe when it was buried below the cl in addition due to the promotion of water leaching by spd more salt from the soil layer above the cl could pass through it under the action of gravity water flow gupta 2002 ritzema et al 2008 therefore to obtain the best performance of the subsurface pipe we suggest burying the subsurface pipe below the cl our results indicate that the performance of the subsurface pipe in spd depended on the ks value of the cl the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe could be improved by increasing the cl ks value this was observed because with increasing ks the permeability of the cl increased and the remaining water above the cl decreased baram et al 2012 yidana and koffie 2014 as replenishment water was added to the upper soil the water flux passing through the subsurface pipe also increased therefore the drainage and salt discharge processes of the subsurface pipe would increase and a higher drainage rate would lead to a higher soil profile desalination rate above the subsurface pipe yang et al 2019 additionally the study indicates that ks and the drainage rate exhibited a positive logarithmic relationship eq 14 this relationship can be applied to evaluate the spd effect when implementing subsurface pipes in regions containing cls furthermore we can also evaluate the feasibility of applying the spd process for salt discharge with reasonable water leaching by estimating the drainage rate more precisely when the ks value of the cl is high the same amount of soil salt can be discharged by subsurface pipes with less leaching of water due to the higher drainage rate in engineering practice additionally to achieve the best salt discharge effect other measures such as ditches and shafts combined with subsurface pipes may also be considered afruzi et al 2014 he et al 2016 5 conclusion overall three strategies the resistance layer actual infiltration surface and equivalent radius treatments were proposed to generalize the subsurface pipe boundary in hydrus 2d and the simulated cumulative water flux cumulative salt flux soil salt content and soil water content values were evaluated against experimental observations among the three strategies the rl treatment yielded the most accurate drainage and salt discharge process simulation results in spd in general the three newly proposed strategies could provide theoretical guidance for the application of a subsurface pipe drainage system to discharge salt in arid and semi arid areas in addition the influence of the cl on the effect of pipe drainage was simulated in this study the results indicated that to realize a distinct desalting effect in the soil above the cl the subsurface pipe should be buried below the cl however further research should be conducted to concretely determine the buried depth of the subsurface pipe below the cl in addition the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the cl exhibited a positive correlation with the drainage efficiency of the subsurface pipe therefore the drainage efficiency of subsurface pipes should be fully estimated before they are buried in regions containing cls to maximize their benefits more experiments are also needed to verify and improve the accuracy of the rl treatment in the simulation of spd combined with the cl treatment in hydrus 2d additionally in this study when simulating the field scale spd process the lower boundary was set as a no flux boundary in the simulation domain which is different from previous studies and more experiments are necessary to verify this approach we also suggest considering soil salt dynamics and the setting of the upper boundary simultaneously to evaluate and improve the accuracy of hydrus 2d in spd simulations with the rl treatment in future studies the newly proposed strategies in this paper were calibrated under flood irrigation conditions in the future

5005,subsurface pipe drainage spd has been widely applied in arid and semiarid regions to control soil salinization to increase the accuracy of hydrus 2d simulations in spd three effective strategies including the resistance layer rl actual infiltration surface ais and equivalent radius er treatments were proposed to replace the standard seepage boundary ssb for subsurface pipes in hydrus 2d first the accuracy of the three strategies was calibrated using laboratory experiments with the multi objective calibration method of the pest program second additional laboratory experiments were conducted to validate the three strategies the rl ais and er strategies obtained a relatively high simulation accuracy in terms of the soil salt content ssc soil water content swc and drainage and salt discharge processes that was significantly higher than that obtained with the standard seepage boundary ssb strategy moreover compared with the ais er and ssb strategies the rl strategy attained the highest simulation accuracy regarding the water drainage root mean square error rmse 3 42 l mean absolute error mae 2 91 l and salt discharge rmse 0 12 kg mae 0 11 kg in spd the relative position of the subsurface pipe has an important effect on the desalting rate of the clay layer cl based on the spd simulation by hydrus 2d with the rl strategy we recommend placing the subsurface pipe below the clay layer to obtain the best water drainage and salt discharge effects in regions containing cls furthermore a positive logarithmic relationship between the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe and the cl saturated hydraulic conductivity was found r2 0 99 future research should focus on the upper and lower boundary conditions of hydrus 2d to further increase the spd simulation accuracy keywords hydrus 2d subsurface pipe boundary clay layer soil salinization 1 introduction soil salinization is a global agricultural environmental issue that not only inhibits crop growth and reduces the crop yield and quality but also decreases fertilizer use efficiency and increases the soil nutrient loss risk xinjiang is a large agricultural region in china nearly one third of the existing cultivated land is damaged by salinity and soil salinization has become an obstacle to the development of agricultural economy subsurface pipe drainage spd and ditch drainage are often applied to control the groundwater level and reduce the soil salinity in saline regions ritzema et al 2008 however compared with ditch drainage spd improves the land use efficiency and facilitates agricultural mechanization additionally spd increases the lateral discharge of salt and thus enhances the salt discharge efficiency bahçeci and nacar 2009 an unreasonable layout of subsurface pipes often causes increased soil nutrient loss and chemical pollution levels therefore it is necessary to accurately quantify the soil water and salt transport processes of spd systems to optimize the layout of subsurface pipes and the leaching scheme the layout of subsurface pipes including the spacing burial depth and diameter of the pipes has been proven to affect the salt discharge in spd and many studies have focused on these points salo et al 2019 yu et al 2018 bonaiti and borin 2010 conducted a study on the drainage capacity of subsurface irrigation and spd in northeast italy and found that when the distance between pipes was 8 m the drainage effect of these pipes achieved the best performance after considering drainage in farmlands with mulched drip irrigation it was determined that a better salinity leaching effect in areas with a smaller distance between subsurface pipes was achieved through spd he et al 2016 similar findings were also reported by zhang et al 2014 and mastrocicco et al 2013 wang et al 2006 noted that shallow pipe drainage effectively reduced the salt content in the upper soil thus increasing the crop yield li et al 2016 indicated that the desalination rate of the soil above the pipe increased with the burial depth tao et al 2016 improved the spd process by using a filter consisting of high permeability materials moreover filipović et al 2014 demonstrated that spd with gravel trenches attained a higher performance in reducing waterlogging and runoff than conventional spd however such experiments are usually costly and time consuming and the results are typically specific to the local soil texture and lack universality additionally due to the multiple layout parameters in the spd process forkutsa et al 2009 it is difficult to conduct systematic quantitative experiments to assess these influencing factors therefore it is necessary to quickly and systematically investigate the water and salt transport processes in the spd system with a numerical model thereby optimizing the spd layout currently the commonly used models considering the layout in spd and solute transport include hydrus 2d drainmod swat and dual permeability type models ebrahimian and noory 2015 applied hydrus 2d to simulate subsurface drainage in paddy fields and found that the measured values were in good agreement with the simulated values wahba and christen 2006 used drainmod to simulate the influence of the buried pipe depth and spacing on groundwater level control similarly luo et al 2010 simulated the transport of nitrate nitrogen in the spd with drainmod n among these models the basis of the drainmod model is a simple total water and salt balance the input parameters are relatively few in number but the specific process of water and solute movement in soil is less extensively described at the field scale the dual permeability model has been widely implemented to simulate subsurface drainage gerke and vangenuchten 1993 gerke and köhne 2004 nonetheless the parameter determination is limited in contrast hydrus 2d can accurately simulate the water transport process in two dimensional unsaturated soils under flexible boundary conditions tang 2011 therefore many studies have applied hydrus 2d for spd simulations castanheira and serralheiro 2010 found that subsurface drainage was effective for soil conservation and reduced the salinization risk via hydrus 2d simulations mante et al 2018 determined the number of field workable days with spd using hydrus 2d qian et al 2019 evaluated the performance of spd with hydrus 2d based on the soil salt and water contents and they observed that the model accuracy in the spd process could be improved by calibrating the final results of the soil profile gärdenäs et al 2006 applied equivalent nodal sinks in a structured finite element mesh to represent drains by adopting adjusted hydraulic conductivity values kohler et al 2001 extended the swms 2d model by adding a macropore flow component and an entrance head in the drainage boundary condition and found that the model simulated discharge and solute transport processes suitably the simulation accuracy in these studies has been acceptable as reported and the model was mainly calibrated from the perspective of the soil water and salt contents and other chemical transport characteristics abbaspour et al 2001 novak et al 2003 kohne and gerke 2005 previous studies have also mainly applied standard seepage boundaries for subsurface pipes table 1 however the drainage capacity of the standard seepage boundary is much higher than that of an actual subsurface pipe and it is difficult to simulate the pipe drainage process by only considering the standard seepage boundary li et al 2016 thus it is important to apply new boundary conditions based on ssb for subsurface pipes to increase the simulation accuracy for the spd process in hydrus 2d clay layers cls are very common in saline soils in arid and semiarid regions previous studies have demonstrated that cls usually occur below 60 cm in the soil profile with notable water retention which could hinder water and salt transport liu et al 2013a d angelo et al 2014 accordingly the cl is another important factor influencing the drainage and salt removal efficiencies of spd bakken et al 2009 however previous researchers have primarily focused on the layout of subsurface pipes in homogeneous soils while few studies have considered the spd layout in the presence of cls yang et al 2019 in addition the field experiments on subsurface pipe drainage applied in the cl regions are time consuming and labor intensive therefore it is important to evaluate the effect of subsurface pipe drainage on salt discharge through the hydrus 2d model this study aimed to increase the accuracy of the hydrus 2d model for the spd system and to test its applicability in soils with cls first three strategies including resistance layer rl actual infiltration surface ais and equivalent radius er were proposed to replace the standard seepage boundary ssb for the spd process in hydrus 2d second hydrus 2d with different subsurface pipe boundaries was evaluated against experimental data thereafter the effect of the subsurface pipe layout on water and salt transport in the field in the presence of cls was determined based on hydrus 2d simulations 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design two experiments were conducted in the agricultural water conservancy and water environment laboratory at wuhan university to calibrate and verify the accuracy of the model simulation results the experimental equipment included a leaching tank fig 1 and its length width and height were 150 51 and 95 cm respectively to control the water depth and ensure continuous leaching conditions during flooding irrigation six spillway holes φ 7 5 mm were drilled in the front surface and two side surfaces of the leaching tank at a distance of 3 5 cm from the top a corrugated pipe with a 3 opening rate was buried at the center of the front of the leaching tank 65 cm below the top the slope of the pipe was 2 the outer diameter of the pipe was 54 mm and the inner diameter was 50 mm the pipe was wrapped with a layer of permeable nonwoven fabric to prevent soil particles from clogging the drainage holes in the subsurface pipe soil samples were collected in alar 40 33 58 n 79 49 32 e xinjiang province china where spd is implemented to reduce soil salinization the soil particle size distribution was measured by a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments co ltd uk and the soil bulk density was determined by collecting undisturbed soil using a cutting ring table 2 the soil was air dried and pretreated to remove impurities with a 2 mm soil sieve because spd has been applied for 5 years to control soil salinization at the site where the soil samples were collected the soil salinity was relatively low ece 4 ds m 1 to reduce the impact of salt removal by spd in highly saline soil 4 286 kg nacl was weighed and dissolved in 11 84 kg of water the nacl solubility measured in the laboratory was approximately 36 2 g per 100 g water at 25 c and the nacl solution was then diluted and mixed into the soil samples in layers to simulate the field soil distribution the soil was placed in the drainage tank in layers moreover the soil was compacted every 5 cm finally the soil in the drainage tank was divided into 4 layers and each layer had a thickness of 20 cm the bulk density of each layer was maintained the same as that in the field in the calibration experiment the total irrigation amount was 19 2 cm the ponding water lasted for 19 5 h and the surface ponding water was uniformly distributed across the surface soil at the infiltration stage drainage started after 4 2 h of irrigation which lasted for 85 8 h two weeks after the end of the calibration experiment the validation experiment was conducted in the second experiment the total irrigation amount was 9 2 cm the ponding water persisted for 9 6 h and drainage started after 1 6 h of irrigation which lasted for 58 4 h the inflow flux of the ponding water was measured by a plexiglass scale and recorded every 30 min the spd discharge was measured through a tipping flowmeter qt 100 ml beijing china and drainage samples were collected every 30 min to measure the electrical conductivity ec the soil samples were obtained at a distance of 35 cm from the subsurface pipe along the horizontal direction within 24 h after the end of drainage along the longitudinal direction soil samples at depths of 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 and 75 cm were collected with a soil drill the volume of each soil sample was 20 cm3 all soil samples were electronically measured to determine their wet weight and then dried in a hot air oven dhg 9030a shanghai china at 105 c for 8 h after drying the dry weight of each sample was measured to calculate the soil moisture content and 15 g of each soil sample was collected ground sieved through a 1 mm sieve and then placed in a 150 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 75 ml of deionized water the water soil mass ratio 1 5 the erlenmeyer flask was shaken on an oscillator thz 98a shanghai china after standing for 24 h the ec of the water extract was measured with a conductivity meter dds 307 shanghai thunder magnetic instrument factory the total soluble salt tds content was calculated from the extracted ec1 5 value and the relationship between the soil salt content ssc and ec1 5 was calibrated using the drying residue method as follows heng et al 2018 1 tds 4 3 e c 1 5 0 6118 r 2 0 97 where tds is the ssc g kg 1 and e c 1 5 is the ec value ds m 1 2 2 the basic theory of hydrus 2d in this study hydrus 2d software was used to simulate the dynamic changes in soil water and salt under the condition of spd it can simulate two or three dimensional axisymmetric flow conditions based on numerical solutions of partial differential equations with the finite element method šimůnek et al 2016 hydrus 2d is often adopted to simulate soil moisture and solute transport processes and the simulation results perform well under many conditions including those reported by patel and rajput 2008 liu et al 2013a liu et al 2013b and wang et al 2014 in the hydrus 2d model a two dimensional saturated unsaturated richards equation šimůnek et al 2011 was adopted to describe soil water movement 2 θ t x k θ θ x z k θ θ z k θ z s where θ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 k θ is the

conditions were considered for the subsurface pipe in this study fig 2 in the first case as a contrast ssb with a subsurface pipe of the actual radius was considered fig 2a second a rl was included in addition to a subsurface pipe with a 1 cm ring width rw to simulate the combined interface of nonwoven fabric and corrugated pipe fig 2b the inner ring represented the seepage boundary moreover the rl did not exist in the actual experiment but it represented the hypothetical soil layer reducing the outflow of the subsurface pipe reflecting the resistance due to the nonwoven fabric and the small opening rate of the subsurface pipe in the rl strategy the rl saturated hydraulic conductivity was much lower than that of the soil layer containing the subsurface pipe next considering that the actual infiltration surface was very small due to the low actual opening rate 3 of the subsurface pipe impermeable boundaries were alternately added to the seepage boundary of the subsurface pipe in which the length of the seepage boundary part was approximately one third of the drain circumference of the subsurface pipe fig 2c in the fourth case the seepage boundary was directly adapted however considering the head loss and actual drainage area the er was adopted to replace the actual radius of the subsurface pipe fig 2d the er of the subsurface pipe was calculated with the following equation dierickx 1980 6 α e c 2 π 2 r o ln 2 c π β v c 4 π r o c 2 π β v ln r o r o 1 2 π ln r o r o 7 r ef r o exp 2 π α e where α e is the resistance factor r o is the outer radius of the

in this study the er of the subsurface pipe is 0 2 cm 2 4 initial and boundary conditions in the calibration experiment the initial water and salt contents of each soil layer in the simulation area were measured before and after filling the tank after filling the water content of each soil layer was roughly equal table 2 two weeks after the end of the first experiment the validation experiment was conducted since the periphery and bottom of the tank used in the experiment were impermeable the left and right boundaries and lower boundaries of the simulated two dimensional domain were defined as impermeable boundaries in this experiment the water head at the upper boundary gradually decreased over time according to the measured inflow data the upper boundary was set as a mixed boundary consisting of variable flux and atmospheric boundaries at the calibration stage during the first 19 5 h the boundary was defined as a variable flux boundary and during the last 70 5 h the boundary was set as an atmospheric boundary and the total water inflow was 19 2 cm at the validation stage the boundary was set as a variable flux boundary during the first 9 6 h while it was defined as an atmospheric boundary during the last 50 4 h and the total water inflow equaled 9 2 cm the specific settings are shown in fig 3 2 5 calibration and validation in this numerical simulation the time unit was the hour and the simulation periods lasted 90 calibration and 60 validation hours the initial input soil parameters were calculated by the artificial neural network calculation tool rosetta in hydrus 2d based on the measured bulk density and particle size distribution of each soil layer specifically the initial hydraulic parameters of the rl were set to be the same as those of the 40 60 cm soil layer before calibration in addition we only calibrated the original strategy ssb and then applied the calibrated parameters as the final input of the three strategies the rl ais and er strategies hence we could use the same set of hydraulic parameters gärdenäs et al 2006 to assess the simulation accuracy of the newly proposed strategies in the ssb process at the calibration stage the drainage and salt discharge processes were first calibrated and the final salt and water contents of the soil profile were then obtained specifically in the simulation process the cumulative drainage of the subsurface pipe over 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 and 75 h was extracted as was the cumulative salt discharge over 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 h in addition observation points were set at depths of 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 and 75 cm the salt and water contents of the final soil profile at the observation points were also acquired subsequently the measured values were compared with the simulated values by the pest multi objective correction method zeng et al 2016 in this method an external program was written in fortran this external program could call certain exe files in hydrus 2d and pest in each run fig 4 each call would change the k s and θ s values in the selector in input file of hydrus 2d moreover the variation scale of these parameters ranged from 0 9 to 1 1 when the simulated values were sufficiently similar to the measured values the values of the calibrated parameters would be selected from the run as the values of the final input parameters of the four strategies thereafter the calibration programming was stopped specifically when the calibration process was completed the hydraulic parameters of the rl strategy were separately calibrated to reduce the influence due to the various orders of magnitude the measured values of each group were normalized between 0 and 1 the initial rosetta and calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are listed in table 3 after the parameters were calibrated the second experiment was conducted for model validation 2 6 application considering the clay layer in different scenarios over the years due to the deep buried groundwater less rainfall and shallow tillage depth hao et al 2009 han et al 2015 the clay layer often exists in the soil at a depth of 0 6 1 2 m in xinjiang china due to long term drip irrigation under plastic film the salt above the clay layer is gradually accumulating yang et al 2016 liu et al 2019 only by conventional leaching the desalination effect of the clay layer was very poor due to its strong water retention and it often caused significant waste of water resources chen et al 2012 therefore it is very important to study the effect on promoting the leaching of salt by subsurface pipe drainage the buried depth and cl occurrence are important factors influencing the drainage and salt discharge in spd twelve different two dimensional scenarios were simulated to investigate the water and salt drainage in the spd process in farmlands containing cls the first four scenarios simulated the effect of the buried depth combined with the cl on the performance of the subsurface pipe a cl was usually observed in the 0 6 1 4 m soil layers in our study area heng et al 2018 in this study the thickness of the cl was 20 cm and the position of the cl was set to 90 110 cm based on jafari talukolaee et al 2015 and engineering practice the buried depth of the subsurface pipe was set to 0 7 0 8 1 3 and 1 5 m the other eight scenarios investigated the effect of the cl saturated hydraulic conductivity on the performance of the subsurface pipe based on the research of leong et al 1999 the saturated hydraulic conductivity of heavy clay is generally less than 5 cm d 1 in this study the cl saturated hydraulic conductivity was set to 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 2 4 3 3 6 and 4 8 cm d 1 the position of the cl ranged from 90 to 110 cm and the buried depth of the subsurface pipe was set to 1 3 m the diameter of the subsurface pipe was 10 cm and the boundary type was consistent with that of the rl strategy the simulation duration was 20 d similar to the field experiment conducted by li et al 2016 in xinjiang province china the upper boundary was set as a variable flux boundary for 1 5 d and the total flux was 40 cm subsequently an atmospheric boundary was defined for 6 20 d the distance between the subsurface pipes was 6 m and the groundwater buried depth was 3 m according to the principle of symmetry the final simulation area was 300 500 cm2 the defined soil hydraulic parameters are summarized in table 4 2 7 statistical analysis three indicators including the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and determination coefficient r2 were considered to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model 1 rmse 8 rmse i 1 n a i b i 2 n 2 mae 9 mae i 1 n a i b i n 3 determination coefficient r2 10 r 2 1 i 1 n a i b i 2 i 1 n a i a 2 where n is the total number of data points a i is the measured value b i is the simulated value and a is the mean of the measured value if the rmse and mae are close to 0 the model attains a high performance the rmse is particularly useful when the model errors follow a normal distribution while the mae is more suitable for models with a uniform error distribution in contrast the r2 value is between 0 and 1 and it is acceptable when the value is larger than 0 5 an r2 closer to 1 indicates a good correlation between the simulated and measured value of model performance the soil desalination rate and spd rate were adopted to evaluate the performance of the subsurface pipe which can be expressed as 1 soil desalination rate 11 n s 1 s 2 s 1 2 spd rate 12 λ w 1 w 2 w 1 where s 1 and s 2 are the initial and final sscs respectively g kg 1 and w 1 and w 2 are the irrigation and drainage rates respectively 3 results 3 1 model performance the statistical results of the laboratory experiment simulations with the ssb rl ais and er strategies are listed in table 5 and a comparison of the simulated and measured values of the cumulative water flux cwf cumulative salt flux csf soil water content swc and soil salt content ssc is shown in figs 5 6 with regard to the ssb strategy it was clear that the csf was greatly overestimated at the early stage while at the later stage it was slightly higher than that observed at the calibration and validation stages however a better performance was attained with the rl ais and er strategies where the drainage process was almost consistent with the observed process based on the estimated values of the four strategies for the drainage process the rmse and mae of the rl strategy were 3 42 and 2 91 l respectively which were lower than those of the ais er and ssb strategies and the determination coefficient r2 of the rl strategy was 0 97 which was the largest this result shows that the rl strategy performs the best when simulating the drainage process similar to the drainage process fig 5b and 6b the rl strategy produced the smallest rmse and mae values and largest r2 value at both the calibration and validation stages among the four strategies which indicates that the rl strategy performed better in the cumulative salt flux simulations in addition the statistical results of the ais strategy rmse 0 16 kg mae 0 14 kg and r2 0 97 were similar to those of the er strategy rmse 0 15 kg mae 0 13 kg and r2 0 95 which reveals a higher accuracy than that of the ssb strategy in the cumulative salt flux simulations at the calibration stage therefore the three newly proposed strategies could predict the water drainage and salt discharge process better than the ssb strategy in the spd system the final ssc and swc profiles at the end of the drainage process for the four subsurface pipe boundaries are shown in figs 5c d and 6c d respectively during calibration the four strategies slightly underestimated the soil desalinization rate at depths from 0 to 60 cm but the simulated salinity values in the soil profile at depths from 60 to 80 cm agreed well with the measured values overall for the four strategies the simulated values of the soil salinity distribution were almost consistent with the observed values as indicated in table 5 the rmse mae and r2 ranges of the salt content simulations for the four strategies were 1 62 1 71 g kg 1 1 40 1 63 g kg 1 and 0 93 0 95 respectively during calibration and 0 11 0 21 g kg 1 0 069 0 19 g kg 1 and 0 84 0 88 respectively during validation therefore the four strategies attain a high accuracy in simulating the soil salinity distribution in the soil profile with regard to the soil water content the rmse and mae values of the four strategies were small which indicates a high accuracy of the four strategies however the r2 values of the ais treatment were only 0 78 calibration and 0 72 validation which were slightly larger than those of the ssb strategy indicating that the ais treatment still needs to be improved in terms of simulating the soil moisture profile overall it is concluded that the results of simulated soil moisture and salinity were satisfactory overall the rl strategy performed the best for simulating the cumulative water flux cumulative salt flux soil salt content and soil water content than the ssb ais and er strategies 3 2 parameter sensitivity analysis the rl approach was found to be the best strategy to apply hydrus 2d for spd simulation among the four strategies table 5 the rl parameters of this strategy including ks and rw are two key factors that influence the simulation accuracy of the strategy however in various simulation domains ks and rw may be different therefore the sensitivity of the cumulative water flux cumulative salt flux soil salt content and soil water content to the parameters of ks and rw was analyzed in our study as indicated in table 6 a 50 change in ks and rw resulted in cwf and csf changes respectively ranging from 3 1 to 4 6 and 3 4 4 5 respectively and 0 6 7 14 and 0 73 7 38 changes respectively in the ssc and swc furthermore it was shown that the cwf and csf exhibited a higher sensitivity to ks while the ssc and swc were more sensitive to rw as revealed in table 6 3 3 application considering the clay layer as shown in fig 7 a b the cwf and csf of the subsurface pipe increased with increasing burial depth of the subsurface pipe however the water retention capacity of the cl decreased with increasing burial depth of the pipe fig 7d in addition the soil desalination rate of the cultivated layer above 1 m also increased with increasing burial depth fig 7c moreover the desalinization rate of the soil above the cl was notable but the position of the cl at 90 110 cm resulted in distinct salt accumulation in the scenarios in which the pipe was buried above the cl in contrast the cl also revealed the desalinization state in scenarios where the pipe was buried below the cl additionally the drainage and salt discharge rates in the spd process below the cl were 1 23 1 64 and 2 40 3 58 times respectively higher than those in the spd process above the cl therefore the pipe should be buried below the cl to drain more soil salt via spd in areas containing cls moreover it was found that the cl saturated hydraulic conductivity ks was a key parameter in spd as shown in fig 8 a b the cwf and csf increased with increasing ks of the cl furthermore the desalination rate of the soil above the subsurface pipe also increased with increasing cl ks value fig 8c however the final water content of the soil profile did not notably change with the change in the ks value of the cl fig 8d to determine the quantitative relationship between the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks of the cl and the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe the relationship between the ks values of different cls and the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe was fitted which was a logarithmic increase function fig 9 the fitting equation is 14 w r 0 44 ln k s 0 37 0 043 r 2 0 99 where w r is the pipe drainage rate and k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the cl cm d 1 4 discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation boundary setting is a key issue in numerical simulation to obtain a suitable modeling performance tang 2011 amin salehi et al 2017 in previous studies the standard seepage boundary ssb was mostly applied for subsurface pipes in hydrus 2d castanheira and serralheiro 2010 ebrahimian and noory 2015 which will immediately discharge water when the surrounding soil is saturated šimůnek et al 2014 since the actual opening rate of the subsurface pipe is relatively low e g 3 in this study the ssb cannot characterize the actual drainage capacity of a subsurface pipe due to the high drainage capacity of the ssb most of the water and salt in the soil can be drained within a short time fig 5a b which would result in the simulated drainage process being inconsistent with the observed process and the overestimation of the actual drainage effect of subsurface pipes hence hydrus 2d could only simulate the general trend but not the dynamic amount during the entire drainage process of the subsurface pipe which was comparable to the findings of li et al 2016 however based on the standard option of hydrus 2d we can still implement some strategies to accurately simulate the outflow process of subsurface pipes therefore given the drainage characteristics of the seepage boundary and the physical structure and actual drainage area of the subsurface pipe we proposed three strategies the rl ais and er treatments to generalize the boundary of the subsurface pipe to increase the accuracy of hydrus 2d for spd simulations our study indicated that all three boundaries the er ais and rl treatments could accurately simulate the salt distribution in the soil profile the r2 and rmse values between the simulated and measured salt contents ranged from 1 62 to 1 71 g 1 kg and from 1 40 to 1 48 g 1 kg respectively similar to the er treatment to best describe drains in numerical models fipps et al 1986 selected four methods to represent a drain in finite element solutions of the richards equation and one of the methods successfully simulated the drainage process by applying a hole with the same effective radius as that of the drain pipe in a finite element mesh mante et al 2018 changed the diameter of the field drainage tile from 0 1 to 0 01 m to consider the partial permeability of the corrugated pipe and obtain more accurate simulation results thus the actual opening rate of the subsurface pipe could be characterized by the total permeability of the effective radius representing the partial permeability of the original radius dierickx 1980 additionally compared with the representation of drains by equivalent nodal sinks gärdenäs et al 2006 the ais treatment was more directly established to characterize the actual infiltration surface of the subsurface pipe by partial seepage drainage nodes our study achieved similar cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux accuracies with the er and ais treatments compared with the ssb strategy both the ais and er treatments reduced the drainage volume of the permeation boundary by decreasing the drainage area of the subsurface pipe boundary due to the reduction in displacement in the earlier period the simulation accuracy of the cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux obtained with the ais and er treatments was increased over the ssb level the better reproduction of the shapes of the cumulative water and salt fluxes is evident in fig 5 however the water conductivity of the seepage boundary adopted in these treatments was the same as that adopted in the ssb strategy high water conductivity may still cause a higher drainage capacity of the subsurface pipe than that in the actual situation šimůnek et al 2011 the simulation accuracy in regard to the cwf and csf of the ais and er treatments should be further improved the process simulated with the rl strategy was almost consistent with the observed process in the cumulative water flux and cumulative salt flux simulations which represents a notable improvement over the ais er and ssb strategies at the calibration stage the r2 values of the rl strategy for the cwf and csf evaluation were the largest 0 97 and 0 98 respectively additionally the rl strategy attained the smallest rmse 3 42 l and 0 12 kg respectively and mae 2 91 l and 0 11 kg respectively values in both the cwf and csf simulations among the four strategies the reason was that although the drainage capacity of the seepage boundary was very high the velocity of the water flowing through the rl was relatively low due to its low ks obia et al 2018 therefore in this method the water inflow from the rl was reduced thus decreasing the drainage capacity of the seepage boundary which is different from the results of the study by heinen 2014 who reduced the displacement of a single drain node by adding a correction factor moreover similar results were also obtained in studies on the addition of outsourcing material to improve the spd simulation effect öztekin 2002 tao et al 2019 therefore we recommend the rl method in hydrus 2d as the subsurface pipe boundary to increase the accuracy of spd simulations in addition the ring width should not exceed the thickness of the soil layer containing the pipe otherwise it may impose a greater impact on the soil physical properties and eventually cause simulation errors 4 2 effects of the clay layer studies have demonstrated that the buried depth of the subsurface pipe and soil texture were two important factors influencing the salt removal effect via pipe drainage liang et al 2015 xin et al 2016 qian et al 2019 yang et al 2016 investigated the salt transport in different soil textures under drip irrigation in xinjiang china the results showed that the desalination rate of sand was higher than that of clay and that the depth of 60 cm was critical for clay soil salinity decreased above it and increased below it our study showed that salt accumulated in the cl when the subsurface pipe was buried above it this occurred because the ks value of the cl was low which caused a clear blocking effect on the leaching of salt in the upper soil layer and salt finally accumulated in the cl when pipe drainage ceased due to the water retention effect of the cl chen et al 2012 however the cl was notably desalted when the subsurface pipe was located below it this occurred because more water and salt could be drained by the subsurface pipe when it was buried below the cl in addition due to the promotion of water leaching by spd more salt from the soil layer above the cl could pass through it under the action of gravity water flow gupta 2002 ritzema et al 2008 therefore to obtain the best performance of the subsurface pipe we suggest burying the subsurface pipe below the cl our results indicate that the performance of the subsurface pipe in spd depended on the ks value of the cl the drainage rate of the subsurface pipe could be improved by increasing the cl ks value this was observed because with increasing ks the permeability of the cl increased and the remaining water above the cl decreased baram et al 2012 yidana and koffie 2014 as replenishment water was added to the upper soil the water flux passing through the subsurface pipe also increased therefore the drainage and salt discharge processes of the subsurface pipe would increase and a higher drainage rate would lead to a higher soil profile desalination rate above the subsurface pipe yang et al 2019 additionally the study indicates that ks and the drainage rate exhibited a positive logarithmic relationship eq 14 this relationship can be applied to evaluate the spd effect when implementing subsurface pipes in regions containing cls furthermore we can also evaluate the feasibility of applying the spd process for salt discharge with reasonable water leaching by estimating the drainage rate more precisely when the ks value of the cl is high the same amount of soil salt can be discharged by subsurface pipes with less leaching of water due to the higher drainage rate in engineering practice additionally to achieve the best salt discharge effect other measures such as ditches and shafts combined with subsurface pipes may also be considered afruzi et al 2014 he et al 2016 5 conclusion overall three strategies the resistance layer actual infiltration surface and equivalent radius treatments were proposed to generalize the subsurface pipe boundary in hydrus 2d and the simulated cumulative water flux cumulative salt flux soil salt content and soil water content values were evaluated against experimental observations among the three strategies the rl treatment yielded the most accurate drainage and salt discharge process simulation results in spd in general the three newly proposed strategies could provide theoretical guidance for the application of a subsurface pipe drainage system to discharge salt in arid and semi arid areas in addition the influence of the cl on the effect of pipe drainage was simulated in this study the results indicated that to realize a distinct desalting effect in the soil above the cl the subsurface pipe should be buried below the cl however further research should be conducted to concretely determine the buried depth of the subsurface pipe below the cl in addition the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the cl exhibited a positive correlation with the drainage efficiency of the subsurface pipe therefore the drainage efficiency of subsurface pipes should be fully estimated before they are buried in regions containing cls to maximize their benefits more experiments are also needed to verify and improve the accuracy of the rl treatment in the simulation of spd combined with the cl treatment in hydrus 2d additionally in this study when simulating the field scale spd process the lower boundary was set as a no flux boundary in the simulation domain which is different from previous studies and more experiments are necessary to verify this approach we also suggest considering soil salt dynamics and the setting of the upper boundary simultaneously to evaluate and improve the accuracy of hydrus 2d in spd simulations with the rl treatment in future studies the newly proposed strategies in this paper were calibrated under flood irrigation conditions in the future the strategies need to be tested under different irrigation conditions e g drip irrigation intermittent irrigation and different climate conditions credit authorship contribution statement yi liu

5006,accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et and its components is essential for a deep understanding of hydrological processes in semi arid regions in this study an improved shuttleworth wallace model i e swh model was applied to simulate et and its components over the growing season in four consecutive years 2013 to 2016 for mobile dunes in china s horqin sandy land the performance of the model was validated using the measurements of eddy covariance ec technology and micro lysimeter the modeled et was in good agreement with the measured et at both half hourly and daily timescales and the modeled soil evaporation e was consistent with the micro lysimeter measurements e accounted for the major fraction of et in the mobile dune ecosystem with e et being 0 62 0 84 0 82 and 0 61 for the 2013 to 2016 growing seasons respectively during the vigorous growing stage the monthly e et was mainly controlled by the leaf area index lai in wet years while water became the limiting factor for e et in dry years at a half hourly timescale e et was primarily controlled by canopy stomatal conductance and soil moisture content but when soil moisture content was lower than the wilting point e et depended solely on the soil moisture content when soil moisture content was between the wilting point and the field capacity e et was mainly controlled by soil moisture content in the early and late growing stages but by canopy stomatal conductance in the vigorous growing stage when soil moisture content exceeded the field capacity e et was primarily controlled by canopy stomatal conductance keywords evapotranspiration canopy stomatal conductance soil moisture content shuttleworth wallace model sand dune 1 introduction environmental changes at global and regional scales have caused significant changes in hydrological processes in arid and semi arid regions and evapotranspiration et processes involving the water energy and biogeochemical cycles have subsequently become suject of a great deal of research in the fields such as hydrology ecology and meteorology zhang et al 2011 li et al 2013 kool et al 2014 et which is a composite term used to refer to evaporation e from the soil surface transpiration t from the canopy and interception evaporation i from the canopy is comprehensively affected by vegetation biophysical properties soil moisture condition and meteorological condition xiong et al 2019 making the estimation and partition of et a challenge especially in arid and semi arid regions with their typically heterogeneous underlying surface in semi arid regions the hydrological processes are dominated by vertical water movement i e precipitation evapotranspiration and infiltration bao et al 2020 on the global scale et accounts for approximately 60 70 of the overall precipitation but this ratio can exceed 90 in arid regions oki and kanae 2006 the large area of the bare soil surface in arid and semi arid regions means that soil evaporation is a major component of evapotranspiration so quantifying et and its components is critical not only for research into the associated eco hydrological processes and mechanisms but also for practical applications such as water management in arid and semi arid regions at present the methods used to measure et and its components generally include eddy covariance sap flow lysimeter isotopes and gas exchange chambers allen and grime 1995 williams et al 2004 zhang et al 2005 stannard and weltz 2006 morana et al 2009 sutanto et al 2014 wei et al 2015 ma and song 2019 because these measurements are not only costly but also suffer from unavoidable limitations with regard to both time and space scales modeling is becoming a popular tool for long term studies of et processes nevertheless ensuring the accuracy of these models can be challenging especially for dune ecosystems with highly heterogeneous underlying surface conditions building on the original penman monteith model monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 proposed the shuttleworth wallace s w model i e s w model which considers evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from the canopy separately the s w model gained rapid acceptance due to its exact description of the physical mechanism of evapotranspiration and its good performance stannard 1993 kato et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 although the canopy stomatal resistance is critical for the accuracy of the s w model it has not been optimized in previous studies nichols 1992 anadranistakis et al 2000 gash and shuttleworth 2007 hu et al 2009 were among the first to address this by incorporating the ball berry stomatal conductance model ball et al 1987 into the s w model their proposed swh model achieved good performance in farmland grassland and forest ecosystems hu et al 2009 2013 yang et al 2018 but has not yet been applied in a dune ecosystem with sparse vegetation it is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the model for dune ecosystems the horqin sandy land one of the four major sandy areas in china is a typical semi arid region with an area of about 50 600 km2 duan et al 2011 due to climate change and unhelpful human activities the dune area is continuing to expand feng and fu 2013 and water has become a major constraint affecting residents and economic development alike making rational planning of water resources is critical for sustainable development in horqin sandy land chen et al 2014 li et al 2016 however partitioning et into soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration is the basis for rational water resources planning williams et al 2004 although many studies have focused on the estimation of et in arid and semi arid regions zhang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 large gaps in the research remain for dune ecosystems with sparse et observation networks and complex underlying surface conditions in arid and semi arid regions hampering efforts to develop accurate simulation of et and its components for dune ecosystems furthermore for dune ecosystems with sparse vegetation the proportion of each component e and t in et remains unclear and the controlling mechanism of the e et is poorly understood clarifying e et and its controlling factors are of great significance not only for a deep understanding of the response mechanisms of eco hydrological processes to climate and environmental changes but also for evaluating the productivity and water use efficiency in dune ecosystems therefore this study attempts to achieve the following objectives i using the measurements of eddy covariance ec technology and micro lysimeter during four growing seasons 2013 2016 to evaluate the applicability of the swh model for dune ecosystems ii applying the swh model to accurately quantify et and its components for mobile dunes and to reveal the special eco hydrological processes for dune ecosystems and iii identifying the key controlling factors for e et in dune ecosystems 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this study was carried out at the agula ecohydrological experimental station in the southeastern of horqin sandy land latitude 43o18 48 43o21 2 n

october ii three times a month during the vigorous growing stage i e june july and august according to the differences in underlying surface and vegetation conditions nine 3 m 3 m vegetation survey samples were collected to determine the average lai within the area measured by the ec system 2 2 3 soil evaporation measurements to validate the modeled soil evaporation we also measured soil evaporation for 22 days from may to august in 2015 using six micro lysimeters a widely used method for et partitioning liu et al 2002 li et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 the micro lysimeters each with an inner diameter of 10 cm and a height of 20 cm were weighted in the morning between 7 00 and 7 30 and evening between 18 00 and 18 30 each day using electronic balances with 0 01 g precision 2 3 model the shuttleworth and wallace s w model regards the canopy and soil surface as two independent and interacting water vapor sources hence the total evapotranspiration is calculated as follows 1 λ e t λ

shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the key factors in this model are the accurate estimation of the canopy stomatal resistance r s c and the soil surface resistance r s s in this study r s c was estimated as in hu et al 2009 12 r s c 1 g 0 a 1 f θ p n h s c s 13 f θ 0 θ θ w θ θ w θ f θ w θ w θ θ f 1 θ θ f where g 0 and a 1 are the empirical parameters p n is the photosynthetic rate which is replaced by

the soil surface resistance r s s was estimated as 14 r s s b 1 θ s θ b 2 b 3 where θ s is the saturated moisture content of the surface soil and b 1 b 2 b 3 are empirical parameters the four empirical parameters i e a 1 b 1 b 2 b 3 were estimated by the monte carlo algorithm in matlab as follows 1 a rough range was set for each parameter here a 1 1 100 b 1 and b 2 1 3 and b 3 1 1000 2 10 000 monte carlo simulations were performed within the set range of parameters 3 the slope k and determinant coefficient r2 were computed after each simulation using a linear regression equation between the modeled et and measured et 4 depending on the results of step 2 the 100 sets of parameters with highest r2 were acquired where k fell within the range 0 95 1 05 and 5 steps 2 and 3 were repeated for the 100 sets of a 1 b 1 b 2 and b 3 to obtain the 10 sets with the most successful parameters where r2 was infinitely near 1 and k lay in the range 0 99 1 01 the mean of the 10 sets of parameters was then regarded as the optimal parameter sets table 1 and used to run the swh model 2 4 evaluation of model performance in this study the statistical metrics including the determinant coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and index of agreement ia were used to evaluate the performance of the model r2 rmse and ia are described as follows 15 r 2 i 1 n o i o e i e 2 i 1 n o i o 2

value and n is the number of observations 3 results 3 1 performance of swh model at the half hour timescale the swh model performed well in the calibration stage with the lowest r2 above 0 845 and the slope k close to 1 table 1 in the validation stage the scatter plots of the modeled et and measured et confirmed that the swh model simulated et well at the half hour timescale with the r2 ia and rmse computed as 0 85 0 95 and 0 03 mm h respectively although the model underestimated et slightly by about 4 k 0 96 fig 2 a nine days three each from the early growing stage vigorous growing stage and late growing stage were selected to validate the performance of the model in simulating the diurnal variation of et at each growing stage the results showed that the performance of the swh model was good with the r2 and ia above 0 86 and 0 96 respectively and the highest rmse at 0 028 mm h table 2 the diurnal variation characteristics of the modeled et were consistent with the measured et in each growing stage fig 3 indicating that the swh model can indeed describe et processes well in mobile dune ecosystems 3 2 performance of swh model at the daily timescale fig 2b shows that swh model also estimated et successfully at the daily timescale with r2 rmse and ia between the measurements and simulations being 0 83 0 32 mm d and 0 95 respectively the slope k indicated that the model underestimated et by about 8 at a daily timescale but the seasonal variation characteristics of the modeled et were highly consistent with those of the measured et fig 4 the seasonal dynamics of et in 2013 and 2016 were more obvious than in 2014 and 2015 fig 4 which was generally consistent with the precipitation characteristics in those years table 3 and fig 5 these findings clearly demonstrate that the characteristics of et are to some degree determined by the precipitation and its distribution in dune ecosystems with sparse vegetation daily et varied between 0 01 mm d and 4 15 mm d from 2013 to 2016 but most were concentrated within 2 mm d the mean daily precipitation from 2013 to 2016 was 2 32 mm d 1 67 mm d 1 9 mm d and 2 34 mm d respectively and the mean daily et for the same years was 0 98 mm d 0 66 mm d 0 77 mm d and 1 13 mm d respectively this result provides further evidence that the et in desertification regions primarily comes from precipitation which determines the intensity of the et the performance of the swh model in simulating e is shown in fig 2c the result showed the modeled e is in good agreement with the measured e r2 0 85 and rmse 0 12 mm d and the modeled e tends to distribute around the 1 1 line which indicate that the model can indeed be used as an effective tool to partition et 3 3 monthly variation of et e t and e et e accounted for the majority of the et in the dune ecosystem and the variation in et was generally consistent with that of e meaning that e plays a leading role in the variation of et fig 5 the data presented in table 3 show that during the growing seasons from 2013 to 2016 e et was 0 62 0 84 0 82 and 0 61 table 3 respectively which means that most of the water was lost through soil evaporation water use efficiency is therefore low in mobile dunes with sparse vegetation the peaks in the e and t curves during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2016 showed that the maximum values for e and t occurred in august with good water and vegetation conditions in the vigorous growing stages of 2013 and 2016 with abundant precipitation the trend in the variation of e et was generally the mirror image of that for lai decreasing with increasing lai with the lowest values of e et appeared in august under good vegetation conditions fig 5a and d in the vigorous growing stages of 2014 and 2015 when the precipitation levels were lower et and its components remained low and the variation trend for e et was consistent with that for precipitation fig 5b and c the seasonal droughts in july 2014 and july 2015 fig 5b and c meant that e and et both decreased with e et falling to its lowest values i e 0 77 and 0 70 respectively largely due to the formation of a dry sand layer during dry periods in desertification regions a thick dry sand layer about 10 cm deep appears on the surface of the soil in dunes covered with low vegetation during rainless seasons increasing the soil surface resistance and reducing e because of this dry sand layer the main source of soil evaporation is now the deep soil water philip and de vries 1957 which is vaporized in the dry sand layer and then evaporates into the atmosphere in the form of water vapor diffusion significantly retarding e as e is the major component of et any decrease in e also decreases et and e et the change of e et in wet years is more obvious than that in dry years fig 5 indicating that the contribution of t to et increases under good vegetation conditions and abundant precipitation furthermore the hydrological processes in desertification regions are highly sensitive to climate change and the ecosystems have adapted accordingly 3 4 controlling factors of e et this study investigated the effect of soil moisture content θ and canopy stomatal conductance gsc on e et at a half hour timescale to clarify the main factors controlling e et under different soil moisture content and vegetation conditions the effects of θ and gsc on e et were analyzed at different growing stages under the following three soil moisture conditions 1 a soil moisture content lower than the wilting point θ θ w 2 a soil moisture content between the wilting point and field capacity θ w θ θ f and 3 a soil moisture content higher than the field capacity θ θ f when the soil moisture content was lower than the wilting point i e θ θw gsc reached its minimum eqs 12 and 13 and e et was controlled solely by θ during all three growing stages fig 6 a and b there was a logarithmic relationship between e et and θ and e et increased with the increaing θ when the soil moisture content was between the wilting point and the field capacity i e θ w θ θ f e et was primarily controlled by θ and gsc had little effect on e et in the early and late growing stages with low lai and gsc fig 7 a and b in the vigorous growing stage as lai and vegetation coverage increased the vegetation roots gradually extended down to deeper soil levels increasing the vegetation s transpiration capacity and the water absorption capacity of the vegetation roots and resulting in a decreasing trend in e et with increasing θ and gsc fig 7c and d in this phase e et exhibited an obvious logarithmic relationship with gsc and the r2 between e et and gsc reached 0 85 much higher than that between e et and θ indicating that e et was mainly being controlled by gsc this occurred because the increase in vegetation levels enhanced photosynthesis and gpp thus strengthening the regulatory role of gsc on et and e et when the soil moisture content exceeded the field capacity i e θ θ f e et decreased with the increasing θ and gsc once again exhibiting an obvious logarithmic relationship with θ and gsc the lowest r2 between e et and gsc was above 0 82 which was higher than that between e et and θ fig 8 with e et again being mainly controlled by gsc this occurred because the canopy stomatal conductance and vegetation s transpiration capacity both increase significantly when supplied with sufficient water strengthening the effect of gsc on et and e et in addition whenever there is sufficient soil moisture annual desert type vegetation with shallow root systems appear in mobile dunes as the annual desert type vegetation mainly absorbs surface soil moisture for transpiration this reduces the water supply that is available for e thus weakening the effect of θ on e et this result indicates that e et of a dune ecosystem with sparse vegetation is primarily controlled by vegetation conditions when soil moisture is no longer a limiting factor 4 discussion 4 1 performance and uncertainties of the model in this study ec technology and micro lysimeter were used to confirm the accuracy of the swh model in simulating and partitioning et in a mobile dune ecosystem with low vegetation coverage compared with the other models often utilized in arid and semi arid regions kato et al 2004 li et al 2010 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 the performance of the swh model was better for both half hour and daily timescales this was not unexpected for the following reasons 1 in conjunction with the ball berry model the swh model considers the coupling relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance and thus more accurately characterizes the physiological process of vegetation transpiration 2 the parameters for soil surface resistance and canopy stomatal resistance were calibrated using the monte carlo method which is critical for the performance of the model 3 the transpiration of desert vegetation comes mainly from soil moisture han et al 2018 yinglian et al 2019 and the effect of soil moisture content on stomatal conductance was considered in this model and 4 compared with previous studies li et al 2010 2013 zhu et al 2013 yang et al 2018 the data time series for model calibration and validation used in this study were longer further improving the reliability of the model in monte carlo simulations such as the one conducted here for the swh model the selection of an appropriate range of parameters in this case b 1 b 2 b 3 and a 1 is crucial for the model performance in previous similar research hu et al 2009 2013 yang et al 2018 the range of b 1 and b 2 was taken to be 1 5 but this range deemed unsuitable for this study as preliminary calculations revealed that with this range of values the model consistently underestimated et yielding a poor performance this may be because there is a very low surface soil moisture content in mobile dunes so large values of b 1 and b 2 overestimate the soil surface resistance leading to the underestimation of both e and et instead we found the performance of the swh model to be good when b 1 and b 2 were in a smaller range of 1 3 this suggests that adjusting the range of key parameters under different landform vegetation and climate conditions should be considered in order to improve the performance of the swh model since the model was run with the fixed parameters this may have resulted in the underestimation of et fig 2 several studies have shown that the seasonal change of vegetation and meteorological conditions may lead to seasonal variations in some model parameters e g a 1 wever et al 2002 hu et al 2009 we therefore applied the data from the validation stage to simulate the parameters the results showed that the accuracy of the model could indeed be improved with the modeled et much closer to the measured et k 0 99 and a better r2 r2 0 86 therefore further research will focus on establishing a dynamic parameter estimation model to achieve the parameters change with vegetation and meteorological conditions thus further improving the accuracy of the model 4 2 variation of e et over the four growing seasons from 2013 to 2016 the monthly e et varied from 0 47 to 0 98 with an overall mean value of 0 72 in an experiment in which they partitioned et for shrub steppe communities in a semi arid region scott et al 2006 showed that e et varied between 0 3 and 0 8 over the growing season hu et al 2009 simulated et and its components for the semi arid grassland finding e et varied between 0 3 and 0 7 over the growing season due to the low vegetation coverage in our study area the variation in the range of e et found in this study was higher than that either of these groups suggesting that under the similar hydrometeorological conditions the vegetation condition determines the level of e et to some extent zhao et al 2016 and yu et al 2018 simulated the et and its components for desert shrub communities in arid regions their study areas had mean annual precipitation levels of 111 mm and 125 mm respectively both reported that e et averaged around 0 3 over the growing season much lower than our results this may be due to the amount of precipitation and the vegetation species in their study areas due to the scant precipitation in arid regions there is a dry sand layer lying on the soil surface throughout the entire growing season xiong et al 2019 which largely prevents evaporation from the soil shrubs in arid regions are also more deeply rooted and as a result in the water supply for t was more plentiful than that for e because of the soil moisture in deep layers was more abundant than at the surface xu et al 2017 yu et al 2018 in this study the vegetation in the mobile dunes was dominated by semi shrub and herbaceous plants with shallow roots such as artemisia halodendron and artemisia frigida so the water consumption was lower than that of the shrubs in the earlier studies moreover the precipitation in our study was more abundant a mean annual precipitation of 389 mm than that in arid regions resulting in a higher e the differences in the e et ratios between desert ecosystems in semi arid regions and arid regions shows that despite the similar underlying surface conditions the vegetation species and hydrometeorological conditions have a serious impact on e et 4 3 controlling factors of e et the controlling factors of e et varied for different vegetation and water conditions for the mobile dune ecosystem we found that the controlling mechanisms of e et during the vigorous growing stage were changed by water conditions under water deficit conditions e et was dominated by the water condition increasing with increasing soil moisture and precipitation during the vigorous growing stage figs 5b and c and 6 b which is consistent with findings reported by both scott et al 2006 and hu et al 2009 on the one hand the stomatal conductance of desert vegetation remains at a low level to reduce water consumption during dry periods thus weakening the effect of t on et and ensuring the variation of e determined e et on the other hand e is mainly controlled by the water conditions in arid and semi arid regions scott et al 2006 so any change in e et depends on the soil moisture and precipitation many studies have indicated that under good water conditions e et was mainly controlled by vegetation conditions i e stomatal conductance and lai during the vigorous growing stage liu et al 2002 hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 similar results were found in this study figs 5a and d 7c and d and 8c and d this is mainly because the stomatal conductance and lai increased with a sufficient water supply zhao et al 2016 which increases the effect of t on et hence the factors that control t also strengthen its regulatory role on e et the mechanisms through which stomatal conductance and lai affect e et are as follows 1 as stomatal conductance increases the vegetation transpiration also increases gradually which reduces the soil moisture supply for e so the contribution of t to et increases 2 the net radiation received by the soil surface decreases with increasing lai which reduces the energy source available for e and 3 the aerodynamic resistance between the soil and the canopy gradually increases with increasing lai which slows down the e to some extent 5 conclusions in this study the swh model was calibrated and validated using eddy covariance technology and micro lysimeter a good model performance was obtained for simulating both et and e indicating the swh model is indeed suitable for estimating et and its components for a dune ecosystem with sparse vegetation in semi arid regions the variation trend and intensity of et are primarily controlled by precipitation in a dune ecosystem soil evaporation is a major component of evapotranspiration in mobile dunes with e et varying between 0 61 and 0 84 across the four growing seasons from 2013 to 2016 during the vigorous growing stage lai is the main controlling factor for monthly e et in wet years while water became the limiting factor for monthly e et in dry years soil moisture content and canopy stomatal conductance are the key factors controlling e et at a half hour timescale for a dune ecosystem with sparse vegetation the results of this study provide a useful theoretical basis for vegetation restoration and ecological protection efforts in regions suffering from desertification regions credit authorship contribution statement yongzhi bao data curation formal analysis

5006,accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et and its components is essential for a deep understanding of hydrological processes in semi arid regions in this study an improved shuttleworth wallace model i e swh model was applied to simulate et and its components over the growing season in four consecutive years 2013 to 2016 for mobile dunes in china s horqin sandy land the performance of the model was validated using the measurements of eddy covariance ec technology and micro lysimeter the modeled et was in good agreement with the measured et at both half hourly and daily timescales and the modeled soil evaporation e was consistent with the micro lysimeter measurements e accounted for the major fraction of et in the mobile dune ecosystem with e et being 0 62 0 84 0 82 and 0 61 for the 2013 to 2016 growing seasons respectively during the vigorous growing stage the monthly e et was mainly controlled by the leaf area index lai in wet years while water became the limiting factor for e et in dry years at a half hourly timescale e et was primarily controlled by canopy stomatal conductance and soil moisture content but when soil moisture content was lower than the wilting point e et depended solely on the soil moisture content when soil moisture content was between the wilting point and the field capacity e et was mainly controlled by soil moisture content in the early and late growing stages but by canopy stomatal conductance in the vigorous growing stage when soil moisture content exceeded the field capacity e et was primarily controlled by canopy stomatal conductance keywords evapotranspiration canopy stomatal conductance soil moisture content shuttleworth wallace model sand dune 1 introduction environmental changes at global and regional scales have caused significant changes in hydrological processes in arid and semi arid regions and evapotranspiration et processes involving the water energy and biogeochemical cycles have subsequently become suject of a great deal of research in the fields such as hydrology ecology and meteorology zhang et al 2011 li et al 2013 kool et al 2014 et which is a composite term used to refer to evaporation e from the soil surface transpiration t from the canopy and interception evaporation i from the canopy is comprehensively affected by vegetation biophysical properties soil moisture condition and meteorological condition xiong et al 2019 making the estimation and partition of et a challenge especially in arid and semi arid regions with their typically heterogeneous underlying surface in semi arid regions the hydrological processes are dominated by vertical water movement i e precipitation evapotranspiration and infiltration bao et al 2020 on the global scale et accounts for approximately 60 70 of the overall precipitation but this ratio can exceed 90 in arid regions oki and kanae 2006 the large area of the bare soil surface in arid and semi arid regions means that soil evaporation is a major component of evapotranspiration so quantifying et and its components is critical not only for research into the associated eco hydrological processes and mechanisms but also for practical applications such as water management in arid and semi arid regions at present the methods used to measure et and its components generally include eddy covariance sap flow lysimeter isotopes and gas exchange chambers allen and grime 1995 williams et al 2004 zhang et al 2005 stannard and weltz 2006 morana et al 2009 sutanto et al 2014 wei et al 2015 ma and song 2019 because these measurements are not only costly but also suffer from unavoidable limitations with regard to both time and space scales modeling is becoming a popular tool for long term studies of et processes nevertheless ensuring the accuracy of these models can be challenging especially for dune ecosystems with highly heterogeneous underlying surface conditions building on the original penman monteith model monteith 1965 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 proposed the shuttleworth wallace s w model i e s w model which considers evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from the canopy separately the s w model gained rapid acceptance due to its exact description of the physical mechanism of evapotranspiration and its good performance stannard 1993 kato et al 2004 zhang et al 2008 although the canopy stomatal resistance is critical for the accuracy of the s w model it has not been optimized in previous studies nichols 1992 anadranistakis et al 2000 gash and shuttleworth 2007 hu et al 2009 were among the first to address this by incorporating the ball berry stomatal conductance model ball et al 1987 into the s w model their proposed swh model achieved good performance in farmland grassland and forest ecosystems hu et al 2009 2013 yang et al 2018 but has not yet been applied in a dune ecosystem with sparse vegetation it is necessary to evaluate the applicability of the model for dune ecosystems the horqin sandy land one of the four major sandy areas in china is a typical semi arid region with an area of about 50 600 km2 duan et al 2011 due to climate change and unhelpful human activities the dune area is continuing to expand feng and fu 2013 and water has become a major constraint affecting residents and economic development alike making rational planning of water resources is critical for sustainable development in horqin sandy land chen et al 2014 li et al 2016 however partitioning et into soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration is the basis for rational water resources planning williams et al 2004 although many studies have focused on the estimation of et in arid and semi arid regions zhang et al 2016 xu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 large gaps in the research remain for dune ecosystems with sparse et observation networks and complex underlying surface conditions in arid and semi arid regions hampering efforts to develop accurate simulation of et and its components for dune ecosystems furthermore for dune ecosystems with sparse vegetation the proportion of each component e and t in et remains unclear and the controlling mechanism of the e et is poorly understood clarifying e et and its controlling factors are of great significance not only for a deep understanding of the response mechanisms of eco hydrological processes to climate and environmental changes but also for evaluating the productivity and water use efficiency in dune ecosystems therefore this study attempts to achieve the following objectives i using the measurements of eddy covariance ec technology and micro lysimeter during four growing seasons 2013 2016 to evaluate the applicability of the swh model for dune ecosystems ii applying the swh model to accurately quantify et and its components for mobile dunes and to reveal the special eco hydrological processes for dune ecosystems and iii identifying the key controlling factors for e et in dune ecosystems 2 material and methods 2 1 study site this study was carried out at the agula ecohydrological experimental station in the southeastern of horqin sandy land latitude 43o18 48 43o21 2 n

samples were collected to determine the average lai within the area measured by the ec system 2 2 3 soil evaporation measurements to validate the modeled soil evaporation we also measured soil evaporation for 22 days from may to august in 2015 using six micro lysimeters a widely used method for et partitioning liu et al 2002 li et al 2010 zhao et al 2015 the micro lysimeters each with an inner diameter of 10 cm and a height of 20 cm were weighted in the morning between 7 00 and 7 30 and evening between 18 00 and 18 30 each day using electronic balances with 0 01 g precision 2 3 model the shuttleworth and wallace s w model regards the canopy and soil surface as two independent and interacting water vapor sources hence the total evapotranspiration is calculated as follows 1 λ e t λ

shuttleworth and wallace 1985 the key factors in this model are the accurate estimation of the canopy stomatal resistance r s c and the soil surface resistance r s s in this study r s c was estimated as in hu et al 2009 12 r s c 1 g 0 a 1 f θ p n h s c s 13 f θ 0 θ θ w θ θ w θ f θ w θ w θ θ f 1 θ θ f where g 0 and a 1 are the empirical parameters p n is the photosynthetic rate which is replaced by

the soil surface resistance r s s was estimated as 14 r s s b 1 θ s θ b 2 b 3 where θ s is the saturated moisture content of the surface soil and b 1 b 2 b 3 are empirical parameters the four empirical parameters i e a 1 b 1 b 2 b 3 were estimated by the monte carlo algorithm in matlab as follows 1 a rough range was set for each parameter here a 1 1 100 b 1 and b 2 1 3 and b 3 1 1000 2 10 000 monte carlo simulations were performed within the set range of parameters 3 the slope k and determinant coefficient r2 were computed after each simulation using a linear regression equation between the modeled et and measured et 4 depending on the results of step 2 the 100 sets of parameters with highest r2 were acquired where k fell within the range 0 95 1 05 and 5 steps 2 and 3 were repeated for the 100 sets of a 1 b 1 b 2 and b 3 to obtain the 10 sets with the most successful parameters where r2 was infinitely near 1 and k lay in the range 0 99 1 01 the mean of the 10 sets of parameters was then regarded as the optimal parameter sets table 1 and used to run the swh model 2 4 evaluation of model performance in this study the statistical metrics including the determinant coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and index of agreement ia were used to evaluate the performance of the model r2 rmse and ia are described as follows 15 r 2 i 1 n o i o e i e 2 i 1 n o i o 2

value and n is the number of observations 3 results 3 1 performance of swh model at the half hour timescale the swh model performed well in the calibration stage with the lowest r2 above 0 845 and the slope k close to 1 table 1 in the validation stage the scatter plots of the modeled et and measured et confirmed that the swh model simulated et well at the half hour timescale with the r2 ia and rmse computed as 0 85 0 95 and 0 03 mm h respectively although the model underestimated et slightly by about 4 k 0 96 fig 2 a nine days three each from the early growing stage vigorous growing stage and late growing stage were selected to validate the performance of the model in simulating the diurnal variation of et at each growing stage the results showed that the performance of the swh model was good with the r2 and ia above 0 86 and 0 96 respectively and the highest rmse at 0 028 mm h table 2 the diurnal variation characteristics of the modeled et were consistent with the measured et in each growing stage fig 3 indicating that the swh model can indeed describe et processes well in mobile dune ecosystems 3 2 performance of swh model at the daily timescale fig 2b shows that swh model also estimated et successfully at the daily timescale with r2 rmse and ia between the measurements and simulations being 0 83 0 32 mm d and 0 95 respectively the slope k indicated that the model underestimated et by about 8 at a daily timescale but the seasonal variation characteristics of the modeled et were highly consistent with those of the measured et fig 4 the seasonal dynamics of et in 2013 and 2016 were more obvious than in 2014 and 2015 fig 4 which was generally consistent with the precipitation characteristics in those years table 3 and fig 5 these findings clearly demonstrate that the characteristics of et are to some degree determined by the precipitation and its distribution in dune ecosystems with sparse vegetation daily et varied between 0 01 mm d and 4 15 mm d from 2013 to 2016 but most were concentrated within 2 mm d the mean daily precipitation from 2013 to 2016 was 2 32 mm d 1 67 mm d 1 9 mm d and 2 34 mm d respectively and the mean daily et for the same years was 0 98 mm d 0 66 mm d 0 77 mm d and 1 13 mm d respectively this result provides further evidence that the et in desertification regions primarily comes from precipitation which determines the intensity of the et the performance of the swh model in simulating e is shown in fig 2c the result showed the modeled e is in good agreement with the measured e r2 0 85 and rmse 0 12 mm d and the modeled e tends to distribute around the 1 1 line which indicate that the model can indeed be used as an effective tool to partition et 3 3 monthly variation of et e t and e et e accounted for the majority of the et in the dune ecosystem and the variation in et was generally consistent with that of e meaning that e plays a leading role in the variation of et fig 5 the data presented in table 3 show that during the growing seasons from 2013 to 2016 e et was 0 62 0 84 0 82 and 0 61 table 3 respectively which means that most of the water was lost through soil evaporation water use efficiency is therefore low in mobile dunes with sparse vegetation the peaks in the e and t curves during the growing seasons of 2013 and 2016 showed that the maximum values for e and t occurred in august with good water and vegetation conditions in the vigorous growing stages of 2013 and 2016 with abundant precipitation the trend in the variation of e et was generally the mirror image of that for lai decreasing with increasing lai with the lowest values of e et appeared in august under good vegetation conditions fig 5a and d in the vigorous growing stages of 2014 and 2015 when the precipitation levels were lower et and its components remained low and the variation trend for e et was consistent with that for precipitation fig 5b and c the seasonal droughts in july 2014 and july 2015 fig 5b and c meant that e and et both decreased with e et falling to its lowest values i e 0 77 and 0 70 respectively largely due to the formation of a dry sand layer during dry periods in desertification regions a thick dry sand layer about 10 cm deep appears on the surface of the soil in dunes covered with low vegetation during rainless seasons increasing the soil surface resistance and reducing e because of this dry sand layer the main source of soil evaporation is now the deep soil water philip and de vries 1957 which is vaporized in the dry sand layer and then evaporates into the atmosphere in the form of water vapor diffusion significantly retarding e as e is the major component of et any decrease in e also decreases et and e et the change of e et in wet years is more obvious than that in dry years fig 5 indicating that the contribution of t to et increases under good vegetation conditions and abundant precipitation furthermore the hydrological processes in desertification regions are highly sensitive to climate change and the ecosystems have adapted accordingly 3 4 controlling factors of e et this study investigated the effect of soil moisture content θ and canopy stomatal conductance gsc on e et at a half hour timescale to clarify the main factors controlling e et under different soil moisture content and vegetation conditions the effects of θ and gsc on e et were analyzed at different growing stages under the following three soil moisture conditions 1 a soil moisture content lower than the wilting point θ θ w 2 a soil moisture content between the wilting point and field capacity θ w θ θ f and 3 a soil moisture content higher than the field capacity θ θ f when the soil moisture content was lower than the wilting point i e θ θw gsc reached its minimum eqs 12 and 13 and e et was controlled solely by θ during all three growing stages fig 6 a and b there was a logarithmic relationship between e et and θ and e et increased with the increaing θ when the soil moisture content was between the wilting point and the field capacity i e θ w θ θ f e et was primarily controlled by θ and gsc had little effect on e et in the early and late growing stages with low lai and gsc fig 7 a and b in the vigorous growing stage as lai and vegetation coverage increased the vegetation roots gradually extended down to deeper soil levels increasing the vegetation s transpiration capacity and the water absorption capacity of the vegetation roots and resulting in a decreasing trend in e et with increasing θ and gsc fig 7c and d in this phase e et exhibited an obvious logarithmic relationship with gsc and the r2 between e et and gsc reached 0 85 much higher than that between e et and θ indicating that e et was mainly being controlled by gsc this occurred because the increase in vegetation levels enhanced photosynthesis and gpp thus strengthening the regulatory role of gsc on et and e et when the soil moisture content exceeded the field capacity i e θ θ f e et decreased with the increasing θ and gsc once again exhibiting an obvious logarithmic relationship with θ and gsc the lowest r2 between e et and gsc was above 0 82 which was higher than that between e et and θ fig 8 with e et again being mainly controlled by gsc this occurred because the canopy stomatal conductance and vegetation s transpiration capacity both increase significantly when supplied with sufficient water strengthening the effect of gsc on et and e et in addition whenever there is sufficient soil moisture annual desert type vegetation with shallow root systems appear in mobile dunes as the annual desert type vegetation mainly absorbs surface soil moisture for transpiration this reduces the water supply that is available for e thus weakening the effect of θ on e et this result indicates that e et of a dune ecosystem with sparse vegetation is primarily controlled by vegetation conditions when soil moisture is no longer a limiting factor 4 discussion 4 1 performance and uncertainties of the model in this study ec technology and micro lysimeter were used to confirm the accuracy of the swh model in simulating and partitioning et in a mobile dune ecosystem with low vegetation coverage compared with the other models often utilized in arid and semi arid regions kato et al 2004 li et al 2010 li et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 the performance of the swh model was better for both half hour and daily timescales this was not unexpected for the following reasons 1 in conjunction with the ball berry model the swh model considers the coupling relationship between photosynthesis and stomatal conductance and thus more accurately characterizes the physiological process of vegetation transpiration 2 the parameters for soil surface resistance and canopy stomatal resistance were calibrated using the monte carlo method which is critical for the performance of the model 3 the transpiration of desert vegetation comes mainly from soil moisture han et al 2018 yinglian et al 2019 and the effect of soil moisture content on stomatal conductance was considered in this model and 4 compared with previous studies li et al 2010 2013 zhu et al 2013 yang et al 2018 the data time series for model calibration and validation used in this study were longer further improving the reliability of the model in monte carlo simulations such as the one conducted here for the swh model the selection of an appropriate range of parameters in this case b 1 b 2 b 3 and a 1 is crucial for the model performance in previous similar research hu et al 2009 2013 yang et al 2018 the range of b 1 and b 2 was taken to be 1 5 but this range deemed unsuitable for this study as preliminary calculations revealed that with this range of values the model consistently underestimated et yielding a poor performance this may be because there is a very low surface soil moisture content in mobile dunes so large values of b 1 and b 2 overestimate the soil surface resistance leading to the underestimation of both e and et instead we found the performance of the swh model to be good when b 1 and b 2 were in a smaller range of 1 3 this suggests that adjusting the range of key parameters under different landform vegetation and climate conditions should be considered in order to improve the performance of the swh model since the model was run with the fixed parameters this may have resulted in the underestimation of et fig 2 several studies have shown that the seasonal change of vegetation and meteorological conditions may lead to seasonal variations in some model parameters e g a 1 wever et al 2002 hu et al 2009 we therefore applied the data from the validation stage to simulate the parameters the results showed that the accuracy of the model could indeed be improved with the modeled et much closer to the measured et k 0 99 and a better r2 r2 0 86 therefore further research will focus on establishing a dynamic parameter estimation model to achieve the parameters change with vegetation and meteorological conditions thus further improving the accuracy of the model 4 2 variation of e et over the four growing seasons from 2013 to 2016 the monthly e et varied from 0 47 to 0 98 with an overall mean value of 0 72 in an experiment in which they partitioned et for shrub steppe communities in a semi arid region scott et al 2006 showed that e et varied between 0 3 and 0 8 over the growing season hu et al 2009 simulated et and its components for the semi arid grassland finding e et varied between 0 3 and 0 7 over the growing season due to the low vegetation coverage in our study area the variation in the range of e et found in this study was higher than that either of these groups suggesting that under the similar hydrometeorological conditions the vegetation condition determines the level of e et to some extent zhao et al 2016 and yu et al 2018 simulated the et and its components for desert shrub communities in arid regions their study areas had mean annual precipitation levels of 111 mm and 125 mm respectively both reported that e et averaged around 0 3 over the growing season much lower than our results this may be due to the amount of precipitation and the vegetation species in their study areas due to the scant precipitation in arid regions there is a dry sand layer lying on the soil surface throughout the entire growing season xiong et al 2019 which largely prevents evaporation from the soil shrubs in arid regions are also more deeply rooted and as a result in the water supply for t was more plentiful than that for e because of the soil moisture in deep layers was more abundant than at the surface xu et al 2017 yu et al 2018 in this study the vegetation in the mobile dunes was dominated by semi shrub and herbaceous plants with shallow roots such as artemisia halodendron and artemisia frigida so the water consumption was lower than that of the shrubs in the earlier studies moreover the precipitation in our study was more abundant a mean annual precipitation of 389 mm than that in arid regions resulting in a higher e the differences in the e et ratios between desert ecosystems in semi arid regions and arid regions shows that despite the similar underlying surface conditions the vegetation species and hydrometeorological conditions have a serious impact on e et 4 3 controlling factors of e et the controlling factors of e et varied for different vegetation and water conditions for the mobile dune ecosystem we found that the controlling mechanisms of e et during the vigorous growing stage were changed by water conditions under water deficit conditions e et was dominated by the water condition increasing with increasing soil moisture and precipitation during the vigorous growing stage figs 5b and c and 6 b which is consistent with findings reported by both scott et al 2006 and hu et al 2009 on the one hand the stomatal conductance of desert vegetation remains at a low level to reduce water consumption during dry periods thus weakening the effect of t on et and ensuring the variation of e determined e et on the other hand e is mainly controlled by the water conditions in arid and semi arid regions scott et al 2006 so any change in e et depends on the soil moisture and precipitation many studies have indicated that under good water conditions e et was mainly controlled by vegetation conditions i e stomatal conductance and lai during the vigorous growing stage liu et al 2002 hu et al 2009 zhu et al 2013 similar results were found in this study figs 5a and d 7c and d and 8c and d this is mainly because the stomatal conductance and lai increased with a sufficient water supply zhao et al 2016 which increases the effect of t on et hence the factors that control t also strengthen its regulatory role on e et the mechanisms through which stomatal conductance and lai affect e et are as follows 1 as stomatal conductance increases the vegetation transpiration also increases gradually which reduces the soil moisture supply for e so the contribution of t to et increases 2 the net radiation received by the soil surface decreases with increasing lai which reduces the energy source available for e and 3 the aerodynamic resistance between the soil and the canopy gradually increases with increasing lai which slows down the e to some extent 5 conclusions in this study the swh model was calibrated and validated using eddy covariance technology and micro lysimeter a good model performance was obtained for simulating both et and e indicating the swh model is indeed suitable for estimating et and its components for a dune ecosystem with sparse vegetation in semi arid regions the variation trend and intensity of et are primarily controlled by precipitation in a dune ecosystem soil evaporation is a major component of evapotranspiration in mobile dunes with e et varying between 0 61 and 0 84 across the four growing seasons from 2013 to 2016 during the vigorous growing stage lai is the main controlling factor for monthly e et in wet years while water became the limiting factor for monthly e et in dry years soil moisture content and canopy stomatal conductance are the key factors controlling e et at a half hour timescale for a dune ecosystem with sparse vegetation the results of this study provide a useful theoretical basis for vegetation restoration and ecological protection efforts in regions suffering from desertification regions credit authorship contribution statement yongzhi bao data curation formal analysis

at department of applied physics meteorology university of barcelona barcelona spain department of applied physics meteorology university of barcelona barcelona spain surface precipitation phase spp discrimination at the ground level rain or snow is a key step in numerous meteorological and hydrological applications previous studies have undertaken this by comparing surface observations such as air temperature relative humidity and wet bulb temperature with concurrent present weather observations of the precipitation phase to derive thresholds for discrimination purposes the first objective of this study was to examine schemes for precipitation phase discrimination at the ground level using data interpolated from a network of automatic weather stations covering an area of complex terrain the second objective was to combine the spp interpolated fields with precipitation estimates from single polarisation weather radar which provide precipitation occurrence information but not precipitation phase type to obtain a real time spp product finally the third objective was to evaluate the role of citizen science and crowd sourced observations in the monitoring of snowfall events with spp schemes results from nine cold seasons oct may indicated that out of the seven spp schemes tested against 7 702 quality controlled present weather observations in catalonia ne spain those including information on air saturation conditions provided the best results a wet bulb temperature threshold of 0 7 c produced the best discrimination for snow vs no snow with a pierce skill score of 0 77 finally the spp product was used with two case studies demonstrating its added value and pending challenges for real time applications keywords precipitation phase threshold temperature wet bulb temperature weather radar citizen science 1 introduction surface precipitation phase spp discrimination at the ground level rain snow or a mixture of both hereafter referred to as sleet is fundamental in many meteorological and hydrological applications such as the surveillance of heavy rainfall precipitation runoff modelling and snow avalanche forecasting several studies have undertaken spp discrimination using different methodologies and predictors harpold et al 2017 these strategies vary in the type of information used to classify the precipitation phase some use surface observations e g gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 dai 2008 others are based on additional atmospheric characteristics such as microphysics schemes from numerical weather prediction models e g fernández gonzález et al 2015 tapiador et al 2019 or vertical temperature profiles e g bourgouin 2000 wandishin et al 2005 while some include data from dual polarisation weather radars e g ryzhkov and zrnic 1998 schuur et al 2012 the methodology involving surface observations used in this study has produced notable results across different regions gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 chen et al 2014 froidurot et al 2014 and involve the use of atmospheric variables such as air temperature or dew point temperature to classify the precipitation phase by establishing a predetermined threshold for example if air temperature exceeds a selected threshold the precipitation is labelled as rain otherwise it is classified as snow a preliminary air temperature threshold could be 0 0 c since it corresponds to the freezing point but snow is usually reported at warmer air temperatures two physical effects melting and evaporation explain the presence of snow at warmer temperatures harpold et al 2017 when snowflakes fall through a layer with saturated air conditions where the temperature is above freezing the melting of the snowflakes extracts heat from their surroundings thereby cooling the environment kain et al 2000 however under unsaturated air conditions the dominant effect is evaporation in this case there is a flux of latent heat to the snowflake from the surrounding air cooling the temperature of the air adjacent to the snowflake kain et al 2000 when evaporation ceases the temperature of the snowflake is that of the wet bulb temperature lumb 1961 in both cases the probability of solid precipitation particles maintaining their phase throughout their path to the surface increases for this reason the following variables that take into account the moisture content of air have also been considered when establishing thresholds to discriminate the precipitation phase relative humidity together with air temperature koistinen and saltikoff 1998 the dew point temperature feiccabrino and lundberg 2009 and the wet bulb temperature froidurot et al 2014 these schemes especially those based on air temperature are widely used in hydrological models to calculate the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow and rain such as the penn state integrated hydrologic modeling system phim jepsen et al 2016 the distributed hydrological model dhm shrestha et al 2014 and the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelnin hbv sikorska and seibert 2018 in addition to its application in hydrological models spp information can be merged with data from weather radars when data from dual polarisation radars are not available these combined data indicate the extent intensity and spatial distribution of the precipitation together with its phase becoming a key tool in the monitoring of snowfall events koistinen and saltikoff 1998 schmid and mathis 2004 gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 saltikoff 2012 this diagnostic tool can provide critical information to meteorological services and decision makers especially in regions where there is occasional snowfall at low altitudes such as catalonia ne spain fig 1 this nw mediterranean region is characterised by complex terrain and areas with high population densities where low altitude snowfall can have a high socio economic impact for instance the events of march 2010 bech et al 2013 llasat et al 2014 february 2015 and february 2018 led to 58 000 1 090 and 3 608 phone calls respectively from the general public to the emergency services due to power outages trapped vehicles collapsed roofs and public transport problems among other reasons therefore this study aimed to determine the best schemes and thresholds for precipitation phase discrimination in order to provide an spp product that can improve emergency management as well as the diagnostic and surveillance tasks of winter weather events different sources of surface based precipitation phase observations were used to achieve the following objectives 1 performance analysis of the different schemes and thresholds for precipitation phase discrimination at the surface level with quality controlled surface based observations 2 evaluation of the role of citizen science and social network observations in the monitoring of snow events and 3 implementation of a real time spp product providing the necessary tools for diagnosing and surveillance tasks the results are shown for the study region catalonia ne spain using data from the meteorological service of catalonia smc the methodology implemented can be applied to other regions that have surface observations and radar data available using the open source software developed for this purpose pypros casellas et al 2019 the rest of the paper is organised as follows the study region and the data employed are described in section 2 while the precipitation phase discrimination methodologies and the validation strategy are presented in section 3 section 4 provides the validation results of the different sources of precipitation phase observations including those from citizen science with threshold based schemes using information on air moisture content outperforming the rest two low altitude snowfall events were examined in depth regarding the performance of the spp schemes from which the following question arose should the threshold parameters be adjusted at the event scale this is discussed in section 5 which also describes the implementation of a real time spp product as well as considerations for future studies 2 data 2 1 study site the study region catalonia is located in the ne iberian peninsula sw europe and is bordered by the pyrenees mountain range to the n the ebre valley to the w and the mediterranean sea to the e and s fig 1 the region has an area of 32 000 km2 and presents marked orographic variability which yields strong contrasts of precipitation and temperature the highest mountains exceed 3 000 m above sea level a s l in the north contrasting with the lower coastal mountain ranges 500 1 000 m a s l and some inland plains snowfalls occur regularly from late autumn to early spring concentrating mainly in the mountainous regions however they are occasionally reported to occur at lower altitudes below 700 m a s l where the socio economic impact may be high due to vulnerable infrastructures and the high population densities e g cities containing up to 250 000 inhabitants and the barcelona metropolitan area containing 5 million inhabitants bech et al 2013 llasat et al 2014 2 2 surface observations 2 2 1 temperature and humidity fields the methodologies used in this study to discriminate between rain sleet and snow section 3 1 require surface meteorological data the surface observations of air temperature t a and dew point temperature t d were obtained from 185 automatic weather stations aws fig 1a of the xarxa d estacions meteorològiques automàtiques xema network which have an irregular spatial distribution and a 30 min temporal resolution serra et al 2016 that reports the mean value for each 30 min period 0 to 30 min past the hour and 30 min past the hour to 0 most of the xema stations 160 are located in flat areas as the altitude increases the density of the aws decreases with 12 stations located at medium altitudes and 12 in high mountainous areas 2 000 m a s l fig 1a b however the precipitation phase was not reported at the locations of the aws therefore it was necessary to interpolate temperature and humidity fields to estimate their values this was achieved using a spatial interpolation methodology that is based on linear regression with anomaly correction and clustering using both discrete meteorological observations and a digital terrain model casellas et al 2020 interpolated fields were obtained with a spatial and temporal resolution of 250 m and 30 min respectively and included the following meteorological variables t a t d relative humidity rh and wet bulb temperature t w rh was derived from t a and t d lawrence 2005 and t w from t a t d and air pressure sadeghi et al 2013 since altitude differences although small yield variations in t w values 2 2 2 weather radar data weather radar observations were obtained from the xarxa de radars meteorològics xrad which consists of four single polarisation c band doppler weather radars located at specific locations to minimise radar beam blockage by orographic features bech et al 2003 trapero et al 2009 the product used in this study is the lowest height of the composite reflectivity of the four weather radars obtained after performing a number of automatic quality control procedures to optimise the accuracy of the surface precipitation mass estimates sánchez diezma et al 2002 bech et al 2005 franco et al 2006 altube et al 2015 the product has a temporal resolution of 6 min and a spatial resolution of 1 km 2 2 3 precipitation phase present weather observations of the precipitation phase rain sleet and snow were used in this study available sources included automatic instruments such as disdrometers and manual reports from observers trained meteorological staff meteorological spotters and social networks the quality of the source was determined by assessing the following location uncertainty temporal uncertainty and the quality control procedures applied the number of observations and the available period of each source are presented in table 1 including nivobs xom obs xom spo isd pars and twitter which are defined below nivobs xarxa d observadors nivometeorològics de catalunya provides at least one present weather observation per day as well as other measurements such as the cloud base height snow drift and fresh snow accumulation stations are located across the pyrenees range fig 1c red squares and their data are quality controlled by the cartographic and geological institute of catalonia icgc data are presented according to the international nimet code which is the standard codification used for nivo meteorological observations in the pyrenees mountains andorra france and spain resembling that of synop gavaldà et al 2014 apodaka et al 2018 xom xarxa d observadors meteorològics consists of 233 trained meteorological volunteers who are grouped as observers xom obs 137 members or spotters xom spo 94 members ripoll et al 2016 the observers report different meteorological observations including present weather from manual weather stations every day at 07 00 utc the spotters provide information about in situ relevant meteorological phenomena not necessarily always at a fixed location such as snow hail or fog the observers and spotters although part of xom are considered separately as explained in section 3 2 since the locations of the observers are fixed fig 1c black dots whereas those of the spotters may vary with only the town centre provided in their reports in addition information from the xom obs is quality controlled with daily monthly and annual protocols by smc staff ensuring consistency and comparing against the meteorological situation of that moment with remote sensing data satellite and weather radar products and information from the xema network isd stands for integrated surface database smith et al 2011 and compiles hourly airport reports metars and synoptic surface observations synops from more than 20 000 stations around the globe the present study included data produced by the spanish meteorological agency aemet from eight stations between 2010 and 2018 five from the catalan airports barcelona el prat sabadell reus girona costa brava and lleida alguaire and three from manned observatories talarn tortosa and lleida see fig 1c green triangles isd data were filtered according to the quality of the observation parameter provided in the datasets lott 2004 finally pars stands for parsivel observations parsivel is a laser disdrometer that provides not only automated present weather precipitation phase records but also the ranges of the precipitation particle size and fall speed löffler mang and blahak 2001 bloemink and lanzinger 2005 the university of barcelona has one unit installed gonzalez et al 2019 at an altitude of 1 100 m a s l in the pyrenees fig 1c yellow diamond parsivel data were filtered with a sensor status parameter indicating the quality of the observation twitter an online social network service was also used as can be seen in table 1 the amount of reports or tweets regarding snow largely exceed those for rain and sleet mainly because low altitude snowfall is a relatively unusual event in the region two types of tweets were considered reports with a geolocation and those containing the name of the town or location a ski resort a neighbourhood or the name of a hotel both types were processed to assign the coordinates of the indicated location to each observation nivobs twitter and xom observations correspond mostly to daytime hours while isd and pars are reported every hour considering the latter two sources no diurnal cycle of precipitation phase was found in our dataset based on the location and temporal uncertainty as well as the quality control procedures data from the nivobs xom obs isd and pars were considered to be of high quality in this study 3 methodology 3 1 precipitation phase classification three types of classification strategies based on surface meteorological information were used depending on how the precipitation phase discrimination was performed 1 one using a single threshold for physical variables such as air temperature liu 2008 2 another approach using two thresholds for physical variables liu et al 2018 and 3 one involving a logistic formula to derive probabilities koistinen and saltikoff 1998 on which thresholds were also applied the single threshold st approach is the simplest one and classifies precipitation into two types rain and snow for example when considering the air temperature if this temperature is cooler equal or warmer than the threshold the precipitation is labelled as snow rain fig 2 a similar strategy is followed by the dual threshold dt approach but with three precipitation phases classified rain snow and sleet this procedure yields more realistic results than the single threshold approach since a diffuse boundary is expected between rain and snow finally the third methodology considers results from an empirical formulation that takes into account t a and rh indicating the probability that the precipitation is snow p snow defined in eq 1 as follows 1 p snow 1 1 1 e 22 2 7 t a 0 2 rh this equation was originally developed in finland koistinen and saltikoff 1998 dt ks hereafter to determine the probability of rain p rain 1 p snow and was later applied and tested in other regions such as norway gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 the swiss alps froidurot et al 2014 spain bech et al 2014 and china chen et al 2014 for practical reasons it is formulated here as the probability of the precipitation being snow at a given air temperature and relative humidity to account for three different precipitation phases two probability thresholds were set initially 33 and 66 koistinen and saltikoff 1998 the three approaches for precipitation phase discrimination are summarised in table 2 3 2 adjustment and validation strategy the validation was separated into two parts depending on the source of the precipitation phase observations and an additional analysis was performed using two case studies 3 2 1 threshold determination the first part of the validation consisted of using only quality controlled present weather observations which included data from nivobs isd metars and synops and xom obs each observation was compared with the nearest pixel of the estimated precipitation phase field obtained through interpolation section 2 2 1 with a spatial resolution of 250 m since the interpolated fields were built using 30 min averages of the aws observations and as the present weather observations were not averaged but mostly reported either at 00 or 30 min past the hour the mean of the preceding and subsequent interpolated fields including the time of the observation was used the different methodologies presented in section 3 1 were compared in terms of verifying deterministic event forecasts that is defining a contingency table comparing all possible cases of the observation and the forecast table a1 for example the discrimination of snow individually was evaluated by comparing observations of snow vs no snow that is snow against sleet and rain events two skill scores suitable for multi categorical forecasts jolliffe and stephenson 2012 were selected to determine the thresholds that separated the positive and negative events the pierce skill score pss table a2 for the single threshold schemes and the gerrity skill score gss gerrity 1992 for the dual threshold schemes appendix a each precipitation phase considered was evaluated individually and compared against the others threshold determination consisted of evaluating each methodology table 2 by varying the corresponding meteorological variable within a range from 5 c to 5 c in 0 1 c steps for single and dual threshold schemes and from 0 to 100 in 1 steps for the koistinen saltikoff method the thresholds that maximised the pss and gss scores were selected in addition three skill scores were selected to characterise the schemes for precipitation phase discrimination probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and frequency bias index fbi jolliffe and stephenson 2012 table a2 3 2 2 citizen science and crowd sourced data value assessment once the best performing thresholds and schemes were selected the second part of the validation evaluated the reliability and role of the xom spo data and observations on social networks both sources have some issues that must be taken into account first the time of the observation may not exactly coincide with the time the reported event occurred second the location of the observation can be misleading since the spotter may be reporting an event that is occurring at their vicinity and not at the indicated location for instance being at the bottom of a valley but reporting snow at a higher altitude third the precipitation phase reported could be a misclassification therefore the assessment procedure resembled that of the other sources section 3 2 1 but including spatial fuzzy verification ebert 2008 thus different areas around the locations of the observations were considered if a single pixel inside the defined area agreed with the precipitation phase observed this was considered a hit 3 2 3 case studies two low altitude snowfall events were selected to analyse the performance of the schemes at the event scale and to examine how snow rain and rain snow transitions were described by the precipitation phase estimates in addition to comparing the precipitation phase observed with the estimated one the coverage of the present weather observations of the precipitation fields derived from the weather radar xrad was also evaluated as the radar observations have a temporal resolution of 6 min a temporal fuzzy scheme was adopted for a single observation and the time when it was reported the coinciding as well as the two preceding and the subsequent radar images were selected this approach tried to account for different effects such as the time that the precipitation takes to reach the ground from the moment it is observed by the radar especially if it is in the form of snow and possible advection below the radar observation mittermaier et al 2004 lauri et al 2012 saltikoff 2012 4 results 4 1 precipitation phase and air temperature before evaluating the different schemes for precipitation phase discrimination described in section 3 1 the present weather observations were narrowed down based on their t a like in ding et al 2014 and froidurot et al 2014 to establish the t a range of the study each precipitation phase observation was linked to its corresponding t a estimation obtained from the nearest pixel of the interpolated air temperature field fig 3 shows the precipitation phase when the t a is between 10 c and 10 c the range where the precipitation phases overlap falls approximately between 7 5 c and 5 0 c which was adopted as the range of this study this range included 7 702 observations of which 2 952 were snow 415 sleet and 4 335 rain the range selected was consistent with those of previous studies 3 c to 5 c in froidurot et al 2014 4 c to 8 c in liu et al 2018 8 c to 8 c in jennings et al 2018 and 10 c to 10 c in ding et al 2014 4 2 threshold determination 4 2 1 single threshold a pss score of 0 77 was obtained for the st t w scheme using t w 0 7 c t w was the best performing meteorological variable among the single threshold methodologies st in table 3 the pod and far showed high and low values respectively table 3 for both snow and rain the t w threshold obtained was similar to that of sims and liu 2015 over land 1 0 c and of froidurot et al 2014 1 c it also fell within the range of thresholds reported by behrangi et al 2018 0 6 c 1 0 c regarding the t a and t d the latter performed better in terms of the pss and exhibited the highest pod for snow table 3 the best t a threshold obtained in this study 1 3 c was in agreement with the threshold of 1 0 c found for sweden feiccabrino and lundberg 2009 and northern usa feiccabrino et al 2012 and that of 1 1 c reported for the czech republic hynčica and huth 2019 it was also similar to the values reported by sims and liu 2015 1 6 c and liu 2008 2 0 c furthermore it was comparable to those used in different hydrological models such as the threshold of 1 0 c reported in quéno et al 2018 and azam et al 2019 the t d threshold in this study was similar to those of other studies such as the threshold of 0 0 c used by marks et al 2013 in a mountain basin in the usa and 0 1 c applied by feiccabrino and lundberg 2009 in sweden 4 2 2 dual threshold the results from the dual threshold methodologies dt table 3 showed that the best schemes discriminating rain sleet and snow were dt ks and dt t w with a gss of 0 73 compared to that of 0 68 and 0 70 for dt t a and dt t d respectively the dt t w and dt ks methodologies produced practically the same results for the pss the largest differences between the two methodologies arose in the pod and far scores for the rain and snow categories the dt ks scheme showed a higher pod for rain 0 87 compared to that of dt t w 0 84 table 3 the dt t w scheme exhibited a pod of 0 89 for snow which was four points higher than that of dt ks table 3 the small differences between the methodologies in terms of the gss and pss could be due to the similar boundaries in the t a vs rh plane that can be seen in fig 2 by contrast the dt t d scheme was completely different presenting a lower slope fig 2 and consequently yielding the highest and lowest pod for snow and rain respectively based on the results presented in table 3 the best pss and pod scores were obtained with the single threshold methodologies however they do not account for the mixed phase transition between rain and snow for this purpose sleet observations were valuable to define the boundaries between rain and snow among the seven schemes considered st t w dt t w and dt ks stood above the rest 4 3 value assessment of citizen science and crowd sourced data the interest from the general public for severe weather is increased when weather warnings are issued as found for the united states and the word tornado on twitter ripberger et al 2014 studying human responses to physical stimuli weber and ross 1978 found that the greater the level of change in the stimulus compared to a given background value the greater the human response this principle was applied to a climate change study which found that people s sensitivity to extreme weather events was proportional to the situation they normally experienced i e the larger the change the greater the impact sisco et al 2017 thus this study took advantage of the exceptionality of low altitude snow events in catalonia by gathering precipitation phase observations from twitter together with those from the smc spotter network however there were far fewer rain and sleet observations on twitter and on the spotter network compared to snow observations therefore only the snow observations were considered for this reason only the pod score was calculated when the nearest pixel 250 m was considered the pod obtained was 0 77 for the xom spo observations and 0 70 for twitter when the area was expanded to 3 km2 the pod was 0 90 for xom spo and 0 84 for twitter both of these pod scores are notable highlighting the importance and the value of non conventional real time observations in weather surveillance moreover if the area considered for the fuzzy verification was extended to 30 km2 similar to the mean area of the catalan towns the pod values obtained were 0 94 for xom spo and 0 89 for twitter fig 4 shows an example of citizen science and crowd sourced observations for an event on 28th february 2018 although a few observations did not agree with the estimated form of precipitation the vast majority coincided with the estimates fig 4 including the progressive displacement of the snowfall towards the north of the region therefore both citizen science and crowd sourced observations are reliable and provide important information since they cover a wider area than the fixed isd and xom obs observations in addition they are mostly concentrated in populated areas and close to critical infrastructures such as highways train lines and schools nevertheless care must be taken when using crowd sourced data due to their inherent issues schuster et al 2005 saltikoff et al 2010 reeves et al 2014 4 4 case studies 4 4 1 7th 8th march 2010 in march 2010 one of the most important low altitude snowfall events in recent years in catalonia took place not only from a meteorological point of view aran et al 2010 but also for the damages it caused llasat et al 2014 this event has been widely studied from different points of view the social impact amaro et al 2010 the weather warnings issued vilaclara et al 2010 the meteorological conditions aran et al 2010 and the occurrence of thundersnow bech et al 2013 the event was characterised by the passage of a cold and dry air mass from central europe and a low air pressure centre that formed se of the catalan coast which advected warmer and humid air from the mediterranean sea common in low altitude snowfall events in the region bech et al 2013 the situation is illustrated in fig 5a b based on era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 at the coast sea level snow depths ranged from 4 to 15 cm reaching 60 cm at 500 m a s l on the coastal hills these depths had not been reported since 1992 llasat et al 2014 the event started in the afternoon of 7th march in the sw of catalonia progressively spreading to the whole region during 8th march before finally being restricted to the ne sector the isd and xom obs gathered 277 observations from this event of which 132 corresponded to snow 29 to sleet and 116 to rain these together with their air temperature and relative humidity estimates are shown in fig 6 a fig 6b displays the precipitation phase field on 8th march 2010 at 07 00 utc based on the dt t w scheme with a threshold of 0 7 c for snow and 1 0 c for rain there was general agreement between the precipitation phase observations and the estimated field even for the spatial precipitation phase transition snow sleet and rain observed in the surroundings of reus and barcelona however there were some observations that clearly did not fit with the estimates especially the locations with rain observations that were surrounded extensively by snow areas fig 6b the dt ks and dt t w schemes produced a pss of 0 66 and 0 65 respectively and a relatively high pod for snow vs no snow observations when using the event optimised thresholds the snow threshold shifted from 40 to 32 for the dt ks scheme and from 0 7 c to 0 9 c for the dt t w scheme table 4 these changes increased the pod and pss scores for both schemes table 4 suggesting that despite applying predetermined thresholds different meteorological conditions at the event scale may lead to variability in the thresholds used to discriminate between rain and snow one reason for this could be the limitation of the schemes to capture variations in vertical temperature profiles feiccabrino et al 2015 the weather reports from the four airports of barcelona el prat girona costa brava sabadell and reus fig 6c indicated that at least one rain to snow transition occurred during the event allowing us to test the ability of the diagnostic scheme to deal with changing conditions in sabadell there was a slow transition from rain to snow with several hours of sleet that was only interrupted by some rain the dt ks scheme represented by the black line and the shaded colours in fig 6c sabadell captured the sleet observations together with the transient change to rain even though it managed to identify sleet the dt ks scheme estimated the occurrence of snow too early at the girona costa brava and reus airports fig 6c girona costa brava and reus the precipitation phase estimates were mostly in agreement with the observations including the snow sleet rain snow transition in girona costa brava at around 06 00 utc on 8th march 2010 finally at the barcelona el prat airport the scheme failed to identify the rain to snow transition properly because the ks values were between the thresholds for rain and snow indicated by the yellow shade in fig 6c during the observations of snow nevertheless the misclassification was in general marginal and the ks value was close to the established thresholds compared to the reports the results also indicated that 98 of the present weather observations were covered by the precipitation fields detected by the weather radar when compared to the nearest pixel of the composite reflectivity thus 271 of the 277 quality controlled observations were included in the spp product combining the precipitation phase and mask fields 4 4 2 26th 28th february 2018 between 26th and 28th february 2018 two low altitude snowfall events took place in catalonia on the 26th and 27th february during the first snowfall event the snow was restricted to the ne sector of the region with snow accumulations at 500 m a s l of up to 26 cm this was due to the arrival of a polar continental air mass that did not cover the entire iberian peninsula but led to air temperature values of around 7 c at the 850 hpa level fig 5c d on 28th february the second snowfall event occurred this was a more general and widespread snowfall event associated with the passage of a warm front bullón and fernández 2019 advection of humid air from the south fig 5c d favoured by an atlantic low pressure located west of the iberian peninsula and warmer than the siberian one facilitated substantial precipitation across catalonia especially in the pyrenees the snowfall followed a sw to ne path with snow occurring at around 100 m a s l or even 0 m a s l in the early morning and at 1 000 m a s l during the day snow accumulations were 5 to 10 cm in the coastal and pre coastal ranges more than 40 cm on the peaks of the pyrenees and 20 to 30 cm in the pre pyrenees range and in the central part of catalonia this event was evaluated by considering 431 observations from between 26th and 28th february of which 191 corresponded to snow 17 to sleet and 223 to rain shown in the t a vs rh plane in fig 7 a both the dt ks and dt t w methodologies produced a similar pss of 0 78 for rain and 0 74 for snow table 5 as in section 4 4 1 the event optimised thresholds were adjusted this optimisation increased the far but this was compensated by the increase in the pod and pss scores for snow vs no snow observations table 5 fig 7b presents an example of the dt ks field for this event for 28th february 2018 at 07 00 utc it can be seen that more than half of the region was experiencing snowfall except for the central coastline and the southern sector despite some exceptions there was generally good agreement between the dt ks field and the observations especially in the boundaries between rain and snow transitions from rain to snow and vice versa are shown in fig 7c for example in barcelona there were three of these transitions first on 27th february at 12 00 utc the dt ks and dt t w not shown schemes failed to identify the transition indeed the schemes estimated it three hours too early in this case it snowed at relatively warm temperatures 2 0 c to 3 0 c and relatively high rh 80 to 90 the black line in the barcelona el prat graph is far from the thresholds for rain and snow suggesting that the scheme clearly attributed the precipitation phase to rain however this did not occur in sabadell or reus in sabadell it estimated rain and sleet instead of the snow that was observed however the dt ks value was closer to the thresholds for sabadell than for barcelona by contrast the snow to rain transition was mostly captured by the dt ks scheme in reus fig 7c shows that all the present weather observations reported during 28th february included precipitation phase transitions in lleida girona costa brava and sabadell the dt ks scheme was able to reproduce approximately the observed transitions in talarn despite the dt ks scheme not estimating the time of the transition correctly the snow and rain thresholds worked reasonably well the rain snow rain transition at the barcelona el prat airport on 28th february at 06 00 utc was captured almost perfectly by the dt ks scheme in this case however the dt t d scheme failed to identify the sharp transition in barcelona el prat but performed better for reus and similarly to dt ks in sabadell fig 8 the results indicated that 75 of the present weather observations were covered by the precipitation fields detected by the weather radar when compared to the nearest pixel of the composite reflectivity if an area of 5 x 5 px 1 px is 1 km2 surrounding the location of the observations was taken into account this increased to 82 during the first hours of the event the dt ks and dt t w not shown schemes failed to capture properly the precipitation phase due to a combination of high air temperatures and high rh however the dt t d scheme captured this well since it diagnoses snow at warmer air temperatures figs 2 and 8 however for 28th february the dt ks and dt t w schemes performed better than the dt t d scheme this suggests that there is no unique methodology that fully covers the precise nature of rain to snow transitions indicating that these schemes are unable to capture variations in vertical temperature profiles feiccabrino et al 2015 in this case the dt t d scheme performed well in the first part of the event but failed in the middle and final parts of it 4 5 implementation of a real time spp product the implementation of a real time spp product for monitoring and surveillance must provide sufficient and clear information to decision makers analysis of individual events as described in section 4 4 can lead to different optimal thresholds with differences not only at the event scale but also in the intra event periods therefore the real time spp product must reflect the variability observed allowing decision makers to modify the predetermined thresholds within a restricted range or schemes to discriminate between snow sleet and rain in accordance with the precipitation phase observations furthermore the implementation must take into account the end users thresholds that maximise the validation scores may not meet all the needs of the end users since decision makers may be less concerned about the far if this is compensated by an increase in the pod manzato 2007 the methodologies described have been implemented for real time operations at the meteorological service of catalonia where schemes using the wet bulb temperature and variable thresholds have been used this can be easily adopted elsewhere with the open source software package pypros standing for precipitation type rain or snow scripts tutorials and documentation can be found in casellas et al 2019 5 discussion froidurot et al 2014 suggested the need to analyse schemes for precipitation phase discrimination using estimated instead of measured data allowing applications at a catchment scale in this study only estimated t a t d rh and t w values were used the t a and t d fields were obtained from the spatial interpolation of aws observations while rh and t w were calculated from the aforementioned fields the results showed that including information on humidity clearly increased performance table 3 indicating that schemes that take into account air saturation conditions play an important role in precipitation phase discrimination the obtained results table 3 are comparable with those reported in previous studies for example gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 obtained a pod of 0 85 0 97 and a far of 0 05 0 15 for rain snow schmid and mathis 2004 reported a pod of 0 98 0 89 and a far of 0 19 0 01 for rain snow while froidurot et al 2014 obtained a csi of 0 84 for rain compared to the 0 78 identified in this study one of the limitations of the study was the relatively low number of simultaneous observations of spp t a and t d which were only available in the synop and metar locations these data were gathered from the isd and used to assess the agreement between the thresholds and the performance of the schemes using observed and interpolated data the results demonstrated that the optimised thresholds and the corresponding pss values for the isd locations fig 1c green triangles were similar for the interpolated and observed data for the dt t w and dt ks schemes table 6 the other schemes provided comparable results not shown one of the reasons behind these results could be the interpolation method applied including the residual correction which led to the interpolated field values being equal to those of the observations at their locations therefore this enabled the schemes to be tested with estimated values and provided added value through the use of information on humidity when applying the schemes at a catchment or regional scale despite the reasonably good performance of the spp schemes there were some limitations first the vertical temperature profiles play a key role in determining the precipitation phase at the surface level bourgouin 2000 through the effects of melting evaporation and refreezing these processes are not considered when only surface information is used second some threshold variability was observed not only at the inter event scale but also at the intra event scale suggesting that the parameters of the schemes should be adjusted according to the event this is in agreement with the findings of cortinas et al 2002 and wandishin et al 2005 who noted that no vertical temperature profile based algorithm discriminating the spp outperformed the other algorithms all the time this variability was addressed in the implementation of the real time spp product by using different thresholds despite the simplicity of the schemes used they produced good results that could be improved in further studies by including vertical temperature profiles which would provide key information about possible warm or cold layers above the surface as well as a more extensive database of case studies to check for possible relationships between the scheme thresholds and event characteristics an option to enlarge this precipitation phase observation database could be achieved through citizen science and crowdsourcing whose role experienced in recent years an increasing trend in earth observation topics fritz et al 2017 such as heavy precipitation events spruce et al 2020 natural disasters guan and chen 2014 and catchment modelling starkey et al 2017 mping elmore et al 2014 cocorahs reges et al 2016 and wow wow metoffice gov uk are examples of well established user friendly applications that citizens can use to report weather observations another option to gather observations is the use of social networks such as twitter or facebook in this study precipitation phase observations were retrieved from twitter exhibiting good results still more observations could have been gathered with an active campaign such as snowtweets king et al 2009 or picking up hailstones farnell and rigo 2020 campaigns which encouraged citizens to use specific hashtags to report snow and hail size respectively these are examples of how people can provide valuable information using applications not specifically developed for citizen science purposes therefore active campaigns using a specific communication strategy such as comparing a forecast to a well known past event can engage and motivate citizens to report weather related observations during particular events lambrecht et al 2019 in addition it is also important to assure that the observations reported by citizens are needed appreciated and acknowledged reges et al 2016 the combination of citizen science and the installation of present weather sensors at key locations could improve the management of risks transport infrastructure and road safety 6 summary and conclusions this paper studied the application of different schemes for precipitation phase discrimination to evaluate their performances and suitability for a real time spp product compared to previous studies that developed and analysed schemes based on concurrent meteorological measurements and precipitation phase observations the present study used interpolated air temperature and dew point estimates in addition the role of citizen science and crowd sourced data regarding precipitation classification among rain sleet and snow was assessed finally a proposal on the implementation of a real time spp product was presented the following conclusions arose from the study out of all the schemes considered in this study those incorporating information on air humidity even that estimated through interpolation performed better than those considering air temperature alone the single threshold air temperature scheme st t a widely used in hydrological models resulted in a threshold of 1 3 c the two best schemes from a statistical point of view when three types of precipitation rain sleet and snow are considered were the dual threshold wet bulb temperature dt t w and koistinen saltikoff dt ks schemes with both including information on humidity and temperature citizen science and crowd sourced observations presented a high probability of detection pod indicating their potential in the monitoring of low altitude snow events the analyses of individual events showed that small modifications in the defined thresholds may improve the schemes suggesting that they should be adapted to specific events the implementation of a real time surface precipitation phase product should consider variability in the optimum thresholds observed at the inter and intra event scales credit authorship contribution statement enric casellas methodology software validation writing original draft joan

sleet and snow can be represented by a contingency table table a1 accounting for the correctly classified correctly rejected missed and false alarm events for example for the rain no rain case a corresponds to correctly classified d and i to correctly rejected c and g to missed and b and e to false alarm occurrences from these values skill scores calculated are listed in table a2 for the rain no rain case for the snow no snow and sleet no sleet cases formulas in table a2 must be changed accordingly when only two categories are considered such as rain and snow sleet column and row values are set to null that is collapsing the contingency table from 3 x 3 to 2 x 2 therefore e f g h and i in skill score formulas table a2 are set to 0 for the rain no rain case gerrity skill score gss indicated for multi categorical forecasts jolliffe and stephenson 2012 is used solely for dual threshold schemes to find the best thresholds that properly separate the three precipitation phase considered gss is a modification of a score defined by gandin and murphy gandin and murphy 1992 introduced by gerrity 1992 which uses a scoring matrix based on the sample probabilities making the score truly equitable a characteristic of using gss is that penalizes misclassification differently depending on the distance from the correct category a complete description of gss calculation can be found in jolliffe and stephenson 2012

at department of applied physics meteorology university of barcelona barcelona spain department of applied physics meteorology university of barcelona barcelona spain surface precipitation phase spp discrimination at the ground level rain or snow is a key step in numerous meteorological and hydrological applications previous studies have undertaken this by comparing surface observations such as air temperature relative humidity and wet bulb temperature with concurrent present weather observations of the precipitation phase to derive thresholds for discrimination purposes the first objective of this study was to examine schemes for precipitation phase discrimination at the ground level using data interpolated from a network of automatic weather stations covering an area of complex terrain the second objective was to combine the spp interpolated fields with precipitation estimates from single polarisation weather radar which provide precipitation occurrence information but not precipitation phase type to obtain a real time spp product finally the third objective was to evaluate the role of citizen science and crowd sourced observations in the monitoring of snowfall events with spp schemes results from nine cold seasons oct may indicated that out of the seven spp schemes tested against 7 702 quality controlled present weather observations in catalonia ne spain those including information on air saturation conditions provided the best results a wet bulb temperature threshold of 0 7 c produced the best discrimination for snow vs no snow with a pierce skill score of 0 77 finally the spp product was used with two case studies demonstrating its added value and pending challenges for real time applications keywords precipitation phase threshold temperature wet bulb temperature weather radar citizen science 1 introduction surface precipitation phase spp discrimination at the ground level rain snow or a mixture of both hereafter referred to as sleet is fundamental in many meteorological and hydrological applications such as the surveillance of heavy rainfall precipitation runoff modelling and snow avalanche forecasting several studies have undertaken spp discrimination using different methodologies and predictors harpold et al 2017 these strategies vary in the type of information used to classify the precipitation phase some use surface observations e g gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 dai 2008 others are based on additional atmospheric characteristics such as microphysics schemes from numerical weather prediction models e g fernández gonzález et al 2015 tapiador et al 2019 or vertical temperature profiles e g bourgouin 2000 wandishin et al 2005 while some include data from dual polarisation weather radars e g ryzhkov and zrnic 1998 schuur et al 2012 the methodology involving surface observations used in this study has produced notable results across different regions gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 chen et al 2014 froidurot et al 2014 and involve the use of atmospheric variables such as air temperature or dew point temperature to classify the precipitation phase by establishing a predetermined threshold for example if air temperature exceeds a selected threshold the precipitation is labelled as rain otherwise it is classified as snow a preliminary air temperature threshold could be 0 0 c since it corresponds to the freezing point but snow is usually reported at warmer air temperatures two physical effects melting and evaporation explain the presence of snow at warmer temperatures harpold et al 2017 when snowflakes fall through a layer with saturated air conditions where the temperature is above freezing the melting of the snowflakes extracts heat from their surroundings thereby cooling the environment kain et al 2000 however under unsaturated air conditions the dominant effect is evaporation in this case there is a flux of latent heat to the snowflake from the surrounding air cooling the temperature of the air adjacent to the snowflake kain et al 2000 when evaporation ceases the temperature of the snowflake is that of the wet bulb temperature lumb 1961 in both cases the probability of solid precipitation particles maintaining their phase throughout their path to the surface increases for this reason the following variables that take into account the moisture content of air have also been considered when establishing thresholds to discriminate the precipitation phase relative humidity together with air temperature koistinen and saltikoff 1998 the dew point temperature feiccabrino and lundberg 2009 and the wet bulb temperature froidurot et al 2014 these schemes especially those based on air temperature are widely used in hydrological models to calculate the fraction of precipitation that falls as snow and rain such as the penn state integrated hydrologic modeling system phim jepsen et al 2016 the distributed hydrological model dhm shrestha et al 2014 and the hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelnin hbv sikorska and seibert 2018 in addition to its application in hydrological models spp information can be merged with data from weather radars when data from dual polarisation radars are not available these combined data indicate the extent intensity and spatial distribution of the precipitation together with its phase becoming a key tool in the monitoring of snowfall events koistinen and saltikoff 1998 schmid and mathis 2004 gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 saltikoff 2012 this diagnostic tool can provide critical information to meteorological services and decision makers especially in regions where there is occasional snowfall at low altitudes such as catalonia ne spain fig 1 this nw mediterranean region is characterised by complex terrain and areas with high population densities where low altitude snowfall can have a high socio economic impact for instance the events of march 2010 bech et al 2013 llasat et al 2014 february 2015 and february 2018 led to 58 000 1 090 and 3 608 phone calls respectively from the general public to the emergency services due to power outages trapped vehicles collapsed roofs and public transport problems among other reasons therefore this study aimed to determine the best schemes and thresholds for precipitation phase discrimination in order to provide an spp product that can improve emergency management as well as the diagnostic and surveillance tasks of winter weather events different sources of surface based precipitation phase observations were used to achieve the following objectives 1 performance analysis of the different schemes and thresholds for precipitation phase discrimination at the surface level with quality controlled surface based observations 2 evaluation of the role of citizen science and social network observations in the monitoring of snow events and 3 implementation of a real time spp product providing the necessary tools for diagnosing and surveillance tasks the results are shown for the study region catalonia ne spain using data from the meteorological service of catalonia smc the methodology implemented can be applied to other regions that have surface observations and radar data available using the open source software developed for this purpose pypros casellas et al 2019 the rest of the paper is organised as follows the study region and the data employed are described in section 2 while the precipitation phase discrimination methodologies and the validation strategy are presented in section 3 section 4 provides the validation results of the different sources of precipitation phase observations including those from citizen science with threshold based schemes using information on air moisture content outperforming the rest two low altitude snowfall events were examined in depth regarding the performance of the spp schemes from which the following question arose should the threshold parameters be adjusted at the event scale this is discussed in section 5 which also describes the implementation of a real time spp product as well as considerations for future studies 2 data 2 1 study site the study region catalonia is located in the ne iberian peninsula sw europe and is bordered by the pyrenees mountain range to the n the ebre valley to the w and the mediterranean sea to the e and s fig 1 the region has an area of 32 000 km2 and presents marked orographic variability which yields strong contrasts of precipitation and temperature the highest mountains exceed 3 000 m above sea level a s l in the north contrasting with the lower coastal mountain ranges 500 1 000 m a s l and some inland plains snowfalls occur regularly from late autumn to early spring concentrating mainly in the mountainous regions however they are occasionally reported to occur at lower altitudes below 700 m a s l where the socio economic impact may be high due to vulnerable infrastructures and the high population densities e g cities containing up to 250 000 inhabitants and the barcelona metropolitan area containing 5 million inhabitants bech et al 2013 llasat et al 2014 2 2 surface observations 2 2 1 temperature and humidity fields the methodologies used in this study to discriminate between rain sleet and snow section 3 1 require surface meteorological data the surface observations of air temperature t a and dew point temperature t d were obtained from 185 automatic weather stations aws fig 1a of the xarxa d estacions meteorològiques automàtiques xema network which have an irregular spatial distribution and a 30 min temporal resolution serra et al 2016 that reports the mean value for each 30 min period 0 to 30 min past the hour and 30 min past the hour to 0 most of the xema stations 160 are located in flat areas as the altitude increases the density of the aws decreases with 12 stations located at medium altitudes and 12 in high mountainous areas 2 000 m a s l fig 1a b however the precipitation phase was not reported at the locations of the aws therefore it was necessary to interpolate temperature and humidity fields to estimate their values this was achieved using a spatial interpolation methodology that is based on linear regression with anomaly correction and clustering using both discrete meteorological observations and a digital terrain model casellas et al 2020 interpolated fields were obtained with a spatial and temporal resolution of 250 m and 30 min respectively and included the following meteorological variables t a t d relative humidity rh and wet bulb temperature t w rh was derived from t a and t d lawrence 2005 and t w from t a t d and air pressure sadeghi et al 2013 since altitude differences although small yield variations in t w values 2 2 2 weather radar data weather radar observations were obtained from the xarxa de radars meteorològics xrad which consists of four single polarisation c band doppler weather radars located at specific locations to minimise radar beam blockage by orographic features bech et al 2003 trapero et al 2009 the product used in this study is the lowest height of the composite reflectivity of the four weather radars obtained after performing a number of automatic quality control procedures to optimise the accuracy of the surface precipitation mass estimates sánchez diezma et al 2002 bech et al 2005 franco et al 2006 altube et al 2015 the product has a temporal resolution of 6 min and a spatial resolution of 1 km 2 2 3 precipitation phase present weather observations of the precipitation phase rain sleet and snow were used in this study available sources included automatic instruments such as disdrometers and manual reports from observers trained meteorological staff meteorological spotters and social networks the quality of the source was determined by assessing the following location uncertainty temporal uncertainty and the quality control procedures applied the number of observations and the available period of each source are presented in table 1 including nivobs xom obs xom spo isd pars and twitter which are defined below nivobs xarxa d observadors nivometeorològics de catalunya provides at least one present weather observation per day as well as other measurements such as the cloud base height snow drift and fresh snow accumulation stations are located across the pyrenees range fig 1c red squares and their data are quality controlled by the cartographic and geological institute of catalonia icgc data are presented according to the international nimet code which is the standard codification used for nivo meteorological observations in the pyrenees mountains andorra france and spain resembling that of synop gavaldà et al 2014 apodaka et al 2018 xom xarxa d observadors meteorològics consists of 233 trained meteorological volunteers who are grouped as observers xom obs 137 members or spotters xom spo 94 members ripoll et al 2016 the observers report different meteorological observations including present weather from manual weather stations every day at 07 00 utc the spotters provide information about in situ relevant meteorological phenomena not necessarily always at a fixed location such as snow hail or fog the observers and spotters although part of xom are considered separately as explained in section 3 2 since the locations of the observers are fixed fig 1c black dots whereas those of the spotters may vary with only the town centre provided in their reports in addition information from the xom obs is quality controlled with daily monthly and annual protocols by smc staff ensuring consistency and comparing against the meteorological situation of that moment with remote sensing data satellite and weather radar products and information from the xema network isd stands for integrated surface database smith et al 2011 and compiles hourly airport reports metars and synoptic surface observations synops from more than 20 000 stations around the globe the present study included data produced by the spanish meteorological agency aemet from eight stations between 2010 and 2018 five from the catalan airports barcelona el prat sabadell reus girona costa brava and lleida alguaire and three from manned observatories talarn tortosa and lleida see fig 1c green triangles isd data were filtered according to the quality of the observation parameter provided in the datasets lott 2004 finally pars stands for parsivel observations parsivel is a laser disdrometer that provides not only automated present weather precipitation phase records but also the ranges of the precipitation particle size and fall speed löffler mang and blahak 2001 bloemink and lanzinger 2005 the university of barcelona has one unit installed gonzalez et al 2019 at an altitude of 1 100 m a s l in the pyrenees fig 1c yellow diamond parsivel data were filtered with a sensor status parameter indicating the quality of the observation twitter an online social network service was also used as can be seen in table 1 the amount of reports or tweets regarding snow largely exceed those for rain and sleet mainly because low altitude snowfall is a relatively unusual event in the region two types of tweets were considered reports with a geolocation and those containing the name of the town or location a ski resort a neighbourhood or the name of a hotel both types were processed to assign the coordinates of the indicated location to each observation nivobs twitter and xom observations correspond mostly to daytime hours while isd and pars are reported every hour considering the latter two sources no diurnal cycle of precipitation phase was found in our dataset based on the location and temporal uncertainty as well as the quality control procedures data from the nivobs xom obs isd and pars were considered to be of high quality in this study 3 methodology 3 1 precipitation phase classification three types of classification strategies based on surface meteorological information were used depending on how the precipitation phase discrimination was performed 1 one using a single threshold for physical variables such as air temperature liu 2008 2 another approach using two thresholds for physical variables liu et al 2018 and 3 one involving a logistic formula to derive probabilities koistinen and saltikoff 1998 on which thresholds were also applied the single threshold st approach is the simplest one and classifies precipitation into two types rain and snow for example when considering the air temperature if this temperature is cooler equal or warmer than the threshold the precipitation is labelled as snow rain fig 2 a similar strategy is followed by the dual threshold dt approach but with three precipitation phases classified rain snow and sleet this procedure yields more realistic results than the single threshold approach since a diffuse boundary is expected between rain and snow finally the third methodology considers results from an empirical formulation that takes into account t a and rh indicating the probability that the precipitation is snow p snow defined in eq 1 as follows 1 p snow 1 1 1 e 22 2 7 t a 0 2 rh this equation was originally developed in finland koistinen and saltikoff 1998 dt ks hereafter to determine the probability of rain p rain 1 p snow and was later applied and tested in other regions such as norway gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 the swiss alps froidurot et al 2014 spain bech et al 2014 and china chen et al 2014 for practical reasons it is formulated here as the probability of the precipitation being snow at a given air temperature and relative humidity to account for three different precipitation phases two probability thresholds were set initially 33 and 66 koistinen and saltikoff 1998 the three approaches for precipitation phase discrimination are summarised in table 2 3 2 adjustment and validation strategy the validation was separated into two parts depending on the source of the precipitation phase observations and an additional analysis was performed using two case studies 3 2 1 threshold determination the first part of the validation consisted of using only quality controlled present weather observations which included data from nivobs isd metars and synops and xom obs each observation was compared with the nearest pixel of the estimated precipitation phase field obtained through interpolation section 2 2 1 with a spatial resolution of 250 m since the interpolated fields were built using 30 min averages of the aws observations and as the present weather observations were not averaged but mostly reported either at 00 or 30 min past the hour the mean of the preceding and subsequent interpolated fields including the time of the observation was used the different methodologies presented in section 3 1 were compared in terms of verifying deterministic event forecasts that is defining a contingency table comparing all possible cases of the observation and the forecast table a1 for example the discrimination of snow individually was evaluated by comparing observations of snow vs no snow that is snow against sleet and rain events two skill scores suitable for multi categorical forecasts jolliffe and stephenson 2012 were selected to determine the thresholds that separated the positive and negative events the pierce skill score pss table a2 for the single threshold schemes and the gerrity skill score gss gerrity 1992 for the dual threshold schemes appendix a each precipitation phase considered was evaluated individually and compared against the others threshold determination consisted of evaluating each methodology table 2 by varying the corresponding meteorological variable within a range from 5 c to 5 c in 0 1 c steps for single and dual threshold schemes and from 0 to 100 in 1 steps for the koistinen saltikoff method the thresholds that maximised the pss and gss scores were selected in addition three skill scores were selected to characterise the schemes for precipitation phase discrimination probability of detection pod false alarm rate far and frequency bias index fbi jolliffe and stephenson 2012 table a2 3 2 2 citizen science and crowd sourced data value assessment once the best performing thresholds and schemes were selected the second part of the validation evaluated the reliability and role of the xom spo data and observations on social networks both sources have some issues that must be taken into account first the time of the observation may not exactly coincide with the time the reported event occurred second the location of the observation can be misleading since the spotter may be reporting an event that is occurring at their vicinity and not at the indicated location for instance being at the bottom of a valley but reporting snow at a higher altitude third the precipitation phase reported could be a misclassification therefore the assessment procedure resembled that of the other sources section 3 2 1 but including spatial fuzzy verification ebert 2008 thus different areas around the locations of the observations were considered if a single pixel inside the defined area agreed with the precipitation phase observed this was considered a hit 3 2 3 case studies two low altitude snowfall events were selected to analyse the performance of the schemes at the event scale and to examine how snow rain and rain snow transitions were described by the precipitation phase estimates in addition to comparing the precipitation phase observed with the estimated one the coverage of the present weather observations of the precipitation fields derived from the weather radar xrad was also evaluated as the radar observations have a temporal resolution of 6 min a temporal fuzzy scheme was adopted for a single observation and the time when it was reported the coinciding as well as the two preceding and the subsequent radar images were selected this approach tried to account for different effects such as the time that the precipitation takes to reach the ground from the moment it is observed by the radar especially if it is in the form of snow and possible advection below the radar observation mittermaier et al 2004 lauri et al 2012 saltikoff 2012 4 results 4 1 precipitation phase and air temperature before evaluating the different schemes for precipitation phase discrimination described in section 3 1 the present weather observations were narrowed down based on their t a like in ding et al 2014 and froidurot et al 2014 to establish the t a range of the study each precipitation phase observation was linked to its corresponding t a estimation obtained from the nearest pixel of the interpolated air temperature field fig 3 shows the precipitation phase when the t a is between 10 c and 10 c the range where the precipitation phases overlap falls approximately between 7 5 c and 5 0 c which was adopted as the range of this study this range included 7 702 observations of which 2 952 were snow 415 sleet and 4 335 rain the range selected was consistent with those of previous studies 3 c to 5 c in froidurot et al 2014 4 c to 8 c in liu et al 2018 8 c to 8 c in jennings et al 2018 and 10 c to 10 c in ding et al 2014 4 2 threshold determination 4 2 1 single threshold a pss score of 0 77 was obtained for the st t w scheme using t w 0 7 c t w was the best performing meteorological variable among the single threshold methodologies st in table 3 the pod and far showed high and low values respectively table 3 for both snow and rain the t w threshold obtained was similar to that of sims and liu 2015 over land 1 0 c and of froidurot et al 2014 1 c it also fell within the range of thresholds reported by behrangi et al 2018 0 6 c 1 0 c regarding the t a and t d the latter performed better in terms of the pss and exhibited the highest pod for snow table 3 the best t a threshold obtained in this study 1 3 c was in agreement with the threshold of 1 0 c found for sweden feiccabrino and lundberg 2009 and northern usa feiccabrino et al 2012 and that of 1 1 c reported for the czech republic hynčica and huth 2019 it was also similar to the values reported by sims and liu 2015 1 6 c and liu 2008 2 0 c furthermore it was comparable to those used in different hydrological models such as the threshold of 1 0 c reported in quéno et al 2018 and azam et al 2019 the t d threshold in this study was similar to those of other studies such as the threshold of 0 0 c used by marks et al 2013 in a mountain basin in the usa and 0 1 c applied by feiccabrino and lundberg 2009 in sweden 4 2 2 dual threshold the results from the dual threshold methodologies dt table 3 showed that the best schemes discriminating rain sleet and snow were dt ks and dt t w with a gss of 0 73 compared to that of 0 68 and 0 70 for dt t a and dt t d respectively the dt t w and dt ks methodologies produced practically the same results for the pss the largest differences between the two methodologies arose in the pod and far scores for the rain and snow categories the dt ks scheme showed a higher pod for rain 0 87 compared to that of dt t w 0 84 table 3 the dt t w scheme exhibited a pod of 0 89 for snow which was four points higher than that of dt ks table 3 the small differences between the methodologies in terms of the gss and pss could be due to the similar boundaries in the t a vs rh plane that can be seen in fig 2 by contrast the dt t d scheme was completely different presenting a lower slope fig 2 and consequently yielding the highest and lowest pod for snow and rain respectively based on the results presented in table 3 the best pss and pod scores were obtained with the single threshold methodologies however they do not account for the mixed phase transition between rain and snow for this purpose sleet observations were valuable to define the boundaries between rain and snow among the seven schemes considered st t w dt t w and dt ks stood above the rest 4 3 value assessment of citizen science and crowd sourced data the interest from the general public for severe weather is increased when weather warnings are issued as found for the united states and the word tornado on twitter ripberger et al 2014 studying human responses to physical stimuli weber and ross 1978 found that the greater the level of change in the stimulus compared to a given background value the greater the human response this principle was applied to a climate change study which found that people s sensitivity to extreme weather events was proportional to the situation they normally experienced i e the larger the change the greater the impact sisco et al 2017 thus this study took advantage of the exceptionality of low altitude snow events in catalonia by gathering precipitation phase observations from twitter together with those from the smc spotter network however there were far fewer rain and sleet observations on twitter and on the spotter network compared to snow observations therefore only the snow observations were considered for this reason only the pod score was calculated when the nearest pixel 250 m was considered the pod obtained was 0 77 for the xom spo observations and 0 70 for twitter when the area was expanded to 3 km2 the pod was 0 90 for xom spo and 0 84 for twitter both of these pod scores are notable highlighting the importance and the value of non conventional real time observations in weather surveillance moreover if the area considered for the fuzzy verification was extended to 30 km2 similar to the mean area of the catalan towns the pod values obtained were 0 94 for xom spo and 0 89 for twitter fig 4 shows an example of citizen science and crowd sourced observations for an event on 28th february 2018 although a few observations did not agree with the estimated form of precipitation the vast majority coincided with the estimates fig 4 including the progressive displacement of the snowfall towards the north of the region therefore both citizen science and crowd sourced observations are reliable and provide important information since they cover a wider area than the fixed isd and xom obs observations in addition they are mostly concentrated in populated areas and close to critical infrastructures such as highways train lines and schools nevertheless care must be taken when using crowd sourced data due to their inherent issues schuster et al 2005 saltikoff et al 2010 reeves et al 2014 4 4 case studies 4 4 1 7th 8th march 2010 in march 2010 one of the most important low altitude snowfall events in recent years in catalonia took place not only from a meteorological point of view aran et al 2010 but also for the damages it caused llasat et al 2014 this event has been widely studied from different points of view the social impact amaro et al 2010 the weather warnings issued vilaclara et al 2010 the meteorological conditions aran et al 2010 and the occurrence of thundersnow bech et al 2013 the event was characterised by the passage of a cold and dry air mass from central europe and a low air pressure centre that formed se of the catalan coast which advected warmer and humid air from the mediterranean sea common in low altitude snowfall events in the region bech et al 2013 the situation is illustrated in fig 5a b based on era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 at the coast sea level snow depths ranged from 4 to 15 cm reaching 60 cm at 500 m a s l on the coastal hills these depths had not been reported since 1992 llasat et al 2014 the event started in the afternoon of 7th march in the sw of catalonia progressively spreading to the whole region during 8th march before finally being restricted to the ne sector the isd and xom obs gathered 277 observations from this event of which 132 corresponded to snow 29 to sleet and 116 to rain these together with their air temperature and relative humidity estimates are shown in fig 6 a fig 6b displays the precipitation phase field on 8th march 2010 at 07 00 utc based on the dt t w scheme with a threshold of 0 7 c for snow and 1 0 c for rain there was general agreement between the precipitation phase observations and the estimated field even for the spatial precipitation phase transition snow sleet and rain observed in the surroundings of reus and barcelona however there were some observations that clearly did not fit with the estimates especially the locations with rain observations that were surrounded extensively by snow areas fig 6b the dt ks and dt t w schemes produced a pss of 0 66 and 0 65 respectively and a relatively high pod for snow vs no snow observations when using the event optimised thresholds the snow threshold shifted from 40 to 32 for the dt ks scheme and from 0 7 c to 0 9 c for the dt t w scheme table 4 these changes increased the pod and pss scores for both schemes table 4 suggesting that despite applying predetermined thresholds different meteorological conditions at the event scale may lead to variability in the thresholds used to discriminate between rain and snow one reason for this could be the limitation of the schemes to capture variations in vertical temperature profiles feiccabrino et al 2015 the weather reports from the four airports of barcelona el prat girona costa brava sabadell and reus fig 6c indicated that at least one rain to snow transition occurred during the event allowing us to test the ability of the diagnostic scheme to deal with changing conditions in sabadell there was a slow transition from rain to snow with several hours of sleet that was only interrupted by some rain the dt ks scheme represented by the black line and the shaded colours in fig 6c sabadell captured the sleet observations together with the transient change to rain even though it managed to identify sleet the dt ks scheme estimated the occurrence of snow too early at the girona costa brava and reus airports fig 6c girona costa brava and reus the precipitation phase estimates were mostly in agreement with the observations including the snow sleet rain snow transition in girona costa brava at around 06 00 utc on 8th march 2010 finally at the barcelona el prat airport the scheme failed to identify the rain to snow transition properly because the ks values were between the thresholds for rain and snow indicated by the yellow shade in fig 6c during the observations of snow nevertheless the misclassification was in general marginal and the ks value was close to the established thresholds compared to the reports the results also indicated that 98 of the present weather observations were covered by the precipitation fields detected by the weather radar when compared to the nearest pixel of the composite reflectivity thus 271 of the 277 quality controlled observations were included in the spp product combining the precipitation phase and mask fields 4 4 2 26th 28th february 2018 between 26th and 28th february 2018 two low altitude snowfall events took place in catalonia on the 26th and 27th february during the first snowfall event the snow was restricted to the ne sector of the region with snow accumulations at 500 m a s l of up to 26 cm this was due to the arrival of a polar continental air mass that did not cover the entire iberian peninsula but led to air temperature values of around 7 c at the 850 hpa level fig 5c d on 28th february the second snowfall event occurred this was a more general and widespread snowfall event associated with the passage of a warm front bullón and fernández 2019 advection of humid air from the south fig 5c d favoured by an atlantic low pressure located west of the iberian peninsula and warmer than the siberian one facilitated substantial precipitation across catalonia especially in the pyrenees the snowfall followed a sw to ne path with snow occurring at around 100 m a s l or even 0 m a s l in the early morning and at 1 000 m a s l during the day snow accumulations were 5 to 10 cm in the coastal and pre coastal ranges more than 40 cm on the peaks of the pyrenees and 20 to 30 cm in the pre pyrenees range and in the central part of catalonia this event was evaluated by considering 431 observations from between 26th and 28th february of which 191 corresponded to snow 17 to sleet and 223 to rain shown in the t a vs rh plane in fig 7 a both the dt ks and dt t w methodologies produced a similar pss of 0 78 for rain and 0 74 for snow table 5 as in section 4 4 1 the event optimised thresholds were adjusted this optimisation increased the far but this was compensated by the increase in the pod and pss scores for snow vs no snow observations table 5 fig 7b presents an example of the dt ks field for this event for 28th february 2018 at 07 00 utc it can be seen that more than half of the region was experiencing snowfall except for the central coastline and the southern sector despite some exceptions there was generally good agreement between the dt ks field and the observations especially in the boundaries between rain and snow transitions from rain to snow and vice versa are shown in fig 7c for example in barcelona there were three of these transitions first on 27th february at 12 00 utc the dt ks and dt t w not shown schemes failed to identify the transition indeed the schemes estimated it three hours too early in this case it snowed at relatively warm temperatures 2 0 c to 3 0 c and relatively high rh 80 to 90 the black line in the barcelona el prat graph is far from the thresholds for rain and snow suggesting that the scheme clearly attributed the precipitation phase to rain however this did not occur in sabadell or reus in sabadell it estimated rain and sleet instead of the snow that was observed however the dt ks value was closer to the thresholds for sabadell than for barcelona by contrast the snow to rain transition was mostly captured by the dt ks scheme in reus fig 7c shows that all the present weather observations reported during 28th february included precipitation phase transitions in lleida girona costa brava and sabadell the dt ks scheme was able to reproduce approximately the observed transitions in talarn despite the dt ks scheme not estimating the time of the transition correctly the snow and rain thresholds worked reasonably well the rain snow rain transition at the barcelona el prat airport on 28th february at 06 00 utc was captured almost perfectly by the dt ks scheme in this case however the dt t d scheme failed to identify the sharp transition in barcelona el prat but performed better for reus and similarly to dt ks in sabadell fig 8 the results indicated that 75 of the present weather observations were covered by the precipitation fields detected by the weather radar when compared to the nearest pixel of the composite reflectivity if an area of 5 x 5 px 1 px is 1 km2 surrounding the location of the observations was taken into account this increased to 82 during the first hours of the event the dt ks and dt t w not shown schemes failed to capture properly the precipitation phase due to a combination of high air temperatures and high rh however the dt t d scheme captured this well since it diagnoses snow at warmer air temperatures figs 2 and 8 however for 28th february the dt ks and dt t w schemes performed better than the dt t d scheme this suggests that there is no unique methodology that fully covers the precise nature of rain to snow transitions indicating that these schemes are unable to capture variations in vertical temperature profiles feiccabrino et al 2015 in this case the dt t d scheme performed well in the first part of the event but failed in the middle and final parts of it 4 5 implementation of a real time spp product the implementation of a real time spp product for monitoring and surveillance must provide sufficient and clear information to decision makers analysis of individual events as described in section 4 4 can lead to different optimal thresholds with differences not only at the event scale but also in the intra event periods therefore the real time spp product must reflect the variability observed allowing decision makers to modify the predetermined thresholds within a restricted range or schemes to discriminate between snow sleet and rain in accordance with the precipitation phase observations furthermore the implementation must take into account the end users thresholds that maximise the validation scores may not meet all the needs of the end users since decision makers may be less concerned about the far if this is compensated by an increase in the pod manzato 2007 the methodologies described have been implemented for real time operations at the meteorological service of catalonia where schemes using the wet bulb temperature and variable thresholds have been used this can be easily adopted elsewhere with the open source software package pypros standing for precipitation type rain or snow scripts tutorials and documentation can be found in casellas et al 2019 5 discussion froidurot et al 2014 suggested the need to analyse schemes for precipitation phase discrimination using estimated instead of measured data allowing applications at a catchment scale in this study only estimated t a t d rh and t w values were used the t a and t d fields were obtained from the spatial interpolation of aws observations while rh and t w were calculated from the aforementioned fields the results showed that including information on humidity clearly increased performance table 3 indicating that schemes that take into account air saturation conditions play an important role in precipitation phase discrimination the obtained results table 3 are comparable with those reported in previous studies for example gjertsen and ødegaard 2005 obtained a pod of 0 85 0 97 and a far of 0 05 0 15 for rain snow schmid and mathis 2004 reported a pod of 0 98 0 89 and a far of 0 19 0 01 for rain snow while froidurot et al 2014 obtained a csi of 0 84 for rain compared to the 0 78 identified in this study one of the limitations of the study was the relatively low number of simultaneous observations of spp t a and t d which were only available in the synop and metar locations these data were gathered from the isd and used to assess the agreement between the thresholds and the performance of the schemes using observed and interpolated data the results demonstrated that the optimised thresholds and the corresponding pss values for the isd locations fig 1c green triangles were similar for the interpolated and observed data for the dt t w and dt ks schemes table 6 the other schemes provided comparable results not shown one of the reasons behind these results could be the interpolation method applied including the residual correction which led to the interpolated field values being equal to those of the observations at their locations therefore this enabled the schemes to be tested with estimated values and provided added value through the use of information on humidity when applying the schemes at a catchment or regional scale despite the reasonably good performance of the spp schemes there were some limitations first the vertical temperature profiles play a key role in determining the precipitation phase at the surface level bourgouin 2000 through the effects of melting evaporation and refreezing these processes are not considered when only surface information is used second some threshold variability was observed not only at the inter event scale but also at the intra event scale suggesting that the parameters of the schemes should be adjusted according to the event this is in agreement with the findings of cortinas et al 2002 and wandishin et al 2005 who noted that no vertical temperature profile based algorithm discriminating the spp outperformed the other algorithms all the time this variability was addressed in the implementation of the real time spp product by using different thresholds despite the simplicity of the schemes used they produced good results that could be improved in further studies by including vertical temperature profiles which would provide key information about possible warm or cold layers above the surface as well as a more extensive database of case studies to check for possible relationships between the scheme thresholds and event characteristics an option to enlarge this precipitation phase observation database could be achieved through citizen science and crowdsourcing whose role experienced in recent years an increasing trend in earth observation topics fritz et al 2017 such as heavy precipitation events spruce et al 2020 natural disasters guan and chen 2014 and catchment modelling starkey et al 2017 mping elmore et al 2014 cocorahs reges et al 2016 and wow wow metoffice gov uk are examples of well established user friendly applications that citizens can use to report weather observations another option to gather observations is the use of social networks such as twitter or facebook in this study precipitation phase observations were retrieved from twitter exhibiting good results still more observations could have been gathered with an active campaign such as snowtweets king et al 2009 or picking up hailstones farnell and rigo 2020 campaigns which encouraged citizens to use specific hashtags to report snow and hail size respectively these are examples of how people can provide valuable information using applications not specifically developed for citizen science purposes therefore active campaigns using a specific communication strategy such as comparing a forecast to a well known past event can engage and motivate citizens to report weather related observations during particular events lambrecht et al 2019 in addition it is also important to assure that the observations reported by citizens are needed appreciated and acknowledged reges et al 2016 the combination of citizen science and the installation of present weather sensors at key locations could improve the management of risks transport infrastructure and road safety 6 summary and conclusions this paper studied the application of different schemes for precipitation phase discrimination to evaluate their performances and suitability for a real time spp product compared to previous studies that developed and analysed schemes based on concurrent meteorological measurements and precipitation phase observations the present study used interpolated air temperature and dew point estimates in addition the role of citizen science and crowd sourced data regarding precipitation classification among rain sleet and snow was assessed finally a proposal on the implementation of a real time spp product was presented the following conclusions arose from the study out of all the schemes considered in this study those incorporating information on air humidity even that estimated through interpolation performed better than those considering air temperature alone the single threshold air temperature scheme st t a widely used in hydrological models resulted in a threshold of 1 3 c the two best schemes from a statistical point of view when three types of precipitation rain sleet and snow are considered were the dual threshold wet bulb temperature dt t w and koistinen saltikoff dt ks schemes with both including information on humidity and temperature citizen science and crowd sourced observations presented a high probability of detection pod indicating their potential in the monitoring of low altitude snow events the analyses of individual events showed that small modifications in the defined thresholds may improve the schemes suggesting that they should be adapted to specific events the implementation of a real time surface precipitation phase product should consider variability in the optimum thresholds observed at the inter and intra event scales credit authorship contribution statement enric casellas methodology software validation writing original draft joan

sleet and snow can be represented by a contingency table table a1 accounting for the correctly classified correctly rejected missed and false alarm events for example for the rain no rain case a corresponds to correctly classified d and i to correctly rejected c and g to missed and b and e to false alarm occurrences from these values skill scores calculated are listed in table a2 for the rain no rain case for the snow no snow and sleet no sleet cases formulas in table a2 must be changed accordingly when only two categories are considered such as rain and snow sleet column and row values are set to null that is collapsing the contingency table from 3 x 3 to 2 x 2 therefore e f g h and i in skill score formulas table a2 are set to 0 for the rain no rain case gerrity skill score gss indicated for multi categorical forecasts jolliffe and stephenson 2012 is used solely for dual threshold schemes to find the best thresholds that properly separate the three precipitation phase considered gss is a modification of a score defined by gandin and murphy gandin and murphy 1992 introduced by gerrity 1992 which uses a scoring matrix based on the sample probabilities making the score truly equitable a characteristic of using gss is that penalizes misclassification differently depending on the distance from the correct category a complete description of gss calculation can be found in jolliffe and stephenson 2012 
5008,the diurnal cycle of precipitation is a fundamental mode of climatic variability based on an hourly 0 1 0 1 gauge satellite merged precipitation dataset which is provided by the china meteorological data service center this study used the k means clustering algorithm to map the diurnal cycles of precipitation in summer over china the obtained maps can objectively delineate irregular regions with similar patterns of diurnal cycles and many of these regions resemble large scale geomorphic units such as the north china plain and the valley of the yarlung zangbo river which verifies the importance of macroterrain for diurnal cycles of precipitation in addition to total precipitation precipitation events with different durations which are often related to different types of precipitation e g convective precipitation and stratiform precipitation were analyzed separately compared with the previous studies using predefined region boundaries the main advantage of this study is that the obtained maps can show more spatial details through which we can get intuitive and in depth understandings of the regional characteristics and spatial patterns of the diurnal cycles of precipitation over china keywords summer precipitation precipitation events with different durations the k means clustering algorithm diurnal cycles of precipitation over china 1 introduction the diurnal cycle is a fundamental mode of climatic variability janowiak et al 2005 affected by the heterogeneities of the underlying surface e g plateau mountain plain river valley sea convective systems and atmospheric circulations e g mountain plains solenoid mps mountain valley and land sea breezes the diurnal cycle of precipitation has considerable regional characteristics zhang et al 2013 sen roy and sen roy 2014 wilson and barros 2015 ryu et al 2016 for example the late afternoon precipitation peaks over southern inland china and northeastern china are caused by surface solar heating which results in low level atmospheric instability and thus moist convection in the afternoon yu et al 2007b the nocturnal precipitation at the eastern foothills of the tibetan plateau is mainly due to the mps circulation zhang and sun 2017 while the eastward delayed precipitation peaks in the yangtze river basin i e from evening to midnight to early morning may be related to the propagation of the precipitation systems caused by the mid latitude westerly flow bao et al 2011 the patterns of these regional characteristics can provide valuable information to study the mechanisms of rain formation and validate numerical forecast models he and zhang 2010 bao and zhang 2013 jin et al 2016 the diurnal cycle of precipitation is also affected by the duration of a precipitation event yu et al 2007a precipitation events can be divided into short duration events i e shorter than or equal to 3 h and long duration events i e longer than 6 h yu et al 2007a the former are usually caused by local convective precipitation while the latter are often related to stratiform precipitation yu et al 2014 these two types of events usually present different patterns of diurnal cycles for example in the central eastern part of china the peaks of short duration precipitation events usually occur in the late afternoon while the peaks of long duration events usually occur in the evening and early morning yu et al 2014 most existing studies on the regional characteristics of diurnal cycles of precipitation used a top down approach in which the areas of interest were predefined by region boundaries such as rectangles yu et al 2007b choi et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 there are no objective rules to define these region boundaries and the regions used in most studies were empirical and more or less subjective in order to avoid this problem wu et al 2018 and our previous study zhu et al 2018 used a bottom up approach to dividing regions in which a clustering algorithm was used to mine the spatial patterns of diurnal cycles from gridded precipitation data the grid cells were divided into different groups according to the diurnal curves of precipitation in this way the grid cells within each group have the similar characteristics of diurnal cycles and their spatial distribution form the region for one type of diurnal cycle compared with the top down approach the obtained maps of diurnal cycles using the bottom up approach are more comprehensive and objective however wu et al 2018 only focused on the regions east to the tibetan plateau and used a small clustering number which may omit some small but important clusters while zhu et al 2018 only studied the diurnal cycles of precipitation frequency over china and did not explore the diurnal cycles of precipitation amount to our knowledge there has been no maps for the diurnal cycles of precipitation amount over china this study aims to fill this gap and generate such maps for summer precipitation over china using detailed precipitation data and a clustering algorithm in an effort to provide valuable clues to further mechanism studies 2 dataset and methodology 2 1 dataset the hourly 0 1 0 1 gridded precipitation dataset version 1 0 published by the china meteorological data service center cmdsc shen et al 2014 was used in this study this precipitation dataset was produced by merging the hourly rain gauge data from more than 30 000 automatic meteorological stations over china and the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph product with an 8 km 30 min resolution joyce et al 2004 the probability density function optimal interpolation pdf oi method was used as the merging algorithm pan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 shen et al 2014 this dataset has been produced since january 1 2008 and updated every hour the overall error level of this dataset is within 10 and the error for heavy precipitation and sparse sites is within 20 cmdsc 2020 this dataset effectively takes advantages of the cmorph precipitation product and the rain gauge data at automatic weather stations shen et al 2013 the time series of this dataset can well capture the major temporally varying features of hourly precipitation in heavy weather events shen et al 2013 2014 wu et al 2018 and consider high frequency features of no rain events shen et al 2013 2014 it has smaller bias and root mean square error compared with the raw cmorph product over china shen et al 2013 2014 wu et al 2018 although the improvement may be smaller in western china where automatic stations are sparse shen et al 2013 this dataset has been applied in several studies jiang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 li et al 2019 2020 considering that the summer june july august precipitation accounts for 50 80 of the total annual precipitation over china turner and annamalai 2012 dong et al 2016 we explored the diurnal cycles of summer precipitation from 2008 to 2016 using this dataset 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 representation of diurnal cycle of precipitation multi year average hourly precipitation amount in summer was used to present the diurnal cycle of precipitation which was represented as a 24 dimensional vector corresponding to 24 h in a day zhou et al 2008 then the 24 dimensional vector of precipitation amount was normalized by using the following formula yu et al 2007a 1 d a h r a h 1 24 i 1 24 r a i 1 where da h represents the normalized precipitation amount at time h and ra h represents the original precipitation amount at time h local solar time lst was used to calculate the hourly precipitation at each grid cell which was obtained from coordinated universal time utc using the following formula 2 lst utc lon 15 here lst represents the local solar time for a grid cell lon represents the longitude of the grid cell and the number 15 means each time zone is corresponding to 15 degrees of longitude 2 2 2 classification of precipitation events by durations precipitation events with different durations may be caused by different types of precipitation short duration events are usually caused by local convection while long duration events are often related to stratiform precipitation we extracted precipitation events from the hourly precipitation data and classified them according to the duration before analyzing the diurnal cycle of precipitation a precipitation event is assumed to have no intermittence or at most one hour intermittence in this study precipitation events are classified into 3 types by durations short duration events lasting shorter than or equal to 3 h medium duration events lasting between 4 and 6 h and long duration events lasting up to 6 h 2 2 3 mining spatial patterns of diurnal cycles of precipitation the k means clustering algorithm was adopted to mine the spatial patterns of diurnal cycles of precipitation based on the 24 dimensional vectors of the normalized hourly precipitation amount at each grid cell in order to choose an optimal number for clustering various cluster numbers ranging from 2 to 40 were tried for each point in the attribute space the distance to its corresponding cluster center was calculated the average distance can be used to measure the compactness of a clustering result when the reduction of the average distance is relatively small i e the average distance is beginning to level off as the cluster number increases the corresponding cluster number is deemed as the optimal number which can identify the main patterns in the data rajaraman and ullman 2011 the numbers of the clusters used in this study are 30 20 20 and 20 for the analysis of total precipitation short medium and long duration events respectively there are often some similar clusters in the clustering result to make the result concise the clusters with similar peak times were further merged the peak times were deemed to be similar if their local solar time fell into the any of the following periods early morning from 03 00 to 06 00 morning from 07 00 to 10 00 midday from 11 00 to 14 00 afternoon from 15 00 to 18 00 evening from 19 00 to 22 00 and midnight from 23 00 to 02 00 yuan et al 2012 zhu et al 2018 for diurnal cycles with multiple peaks two clusters are merged only when all their peak times are similar the spatial distribution of grid cells in the merged clusters makes up a map to characterize diurnal cycles of precipitation in this study there are 13 types of diurnal cycles in summer over china table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 diurnal cycles of total precipitation over china fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the diurnal cycles of the total precipitation in summer over china there are 11 types of regions with distinct peak times the regions with an afternoon precipitation peak from 14 00 to 18 00 type i 3 in fig 1 cover the largest area accounting for 40 9 of china s total land area this type is mainly distributed in the southeast and northeast of china the inner mongolia plateau and the loess plateau the regions with a midday peak from 10 00 to 14 00 type i 2 take up 5 7 of china s total land area mainly distributed in the deserts of northwestern china convection caused by solar heating is probably the main driving factor in these two types of regions yu et al 2007b yuan et al 2012 the regions with a morning peak from 06 00 to 10 00 type i 1 account for only 3 0 of china s total land area and scatter in some mountainous areas such as the east of the tianshan mountains and the central region of the daba mountains the regions with nocturnal precipitation type i 4 i 5 i 6 in fig 1 account for 32 9 of china s total land area the proportion of regions with an evening peak from 18 00 to 22 00 type i 4 is about 15 8 these regions are mainly distributed in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau the hengduan mountains and the valley of the yarlung zangbo river to the south of 30 n and located in the vicinity of some large mountains e g to the north of the tianshan mountains to the south of the yanshan mountains and to the east of the taihang mountains to the north of 30 n the regions with a midnight precipitation peak from 22 00 to 02 00 type i 5 make up only 2 1 of china s total land area and are mainly distributed in the southwest of the sichuan basin and on the south of the hengduan mountains the proportion of regions with an early morning peak from 02 00 to 06 00 type i 6 is comparable to that with an evening peak accounting for 15 0 of china s total land area these regions are mainly distributed to the east of the regions peaked in the evening or at midnight such as the east of the hengduan and yanshan taihang mountains the peak time of these regions with nocturnal precipitation often has a time delay pattern i e from evening to midnight to early morning from mountains to plains along the slope of macroterrain zhu et al 2018 the causes of the delayed pattern have been broadly discussed which may be related to the propagation of the precipitation systems caused by the mid latitude westerly flow bao et al 2011 the regional mountain plains solenoid mps circulation he and zhang 2010 jin et al 2013 or the diurnal clockwise rotation of the low tropospheric circulation chen et al 2010 the coastal regions of south china present morning or early morning precipitation peaks affected by the prevalent monsoon flow type ii 1 has double peaks in the morning and afternoon taking up 5 of china s total land area and is mainly distributed in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river the morning peak is attributed to long duration precipitation and the afternoon peak is attributed to short duration precipitation yu et al 2007a and the maps in figs 2 and 4 show this pattern clearly type ii 2 has double peaks in the morning and evening and only accounts for 0 5 of china s total land area it mainly scatters around the large lakes in northwestern china e g the qinghai lake and the namtso lake and some mountainous regions with permanent snow cover which are wet patches in dry regions zhu et al 2018 this is a very interesting phenomenon and the underlying mechanism still needs further exploration the regions with midday and evening peaks type ii 3 and the regions with early morning and midday peaks type ii 5 account for 2 and 2 2 of china s total land area respectively they are scattered in the northwest desert regions interlaced with the regions with a midday peak type i 2 type ii 6 has double peaks in the afternoon and evening type ii 6 occupying 7 8 of china s total land area and is mainly distributed in the middle of the tibetan plateau the midday afternoon peaks should be related to solar heating and the evening early morning peaks may be attributed to regional mountain valley wind circulations yu et al 2007b singh and nakamura 2009 yin et al 2009 yuan et al 2012 3 2 diurnal cycles of precipitation for events with different durations figs 2 3 and 4 show the spatial distributions of the diurnal cycles of precipitation for the short medium and long duration events respectively as shown in fig 2 for the short duration precipitation most regions of china reach their diurnal peaks during midday to afternoon type i 2 and i 3 because convection caused by solar heating is strongest during these periods these two types account for 70 5 of china s total land area and type i 3 alone i e the regions with an afternoon peak accounts for 54 9 some regions with nocturnal precipitation according to the total precipitation amount e g southwestern china fig 1 also have an afternoon peak for short duration precipitation the regions with a midday precipitation peak make up 15 6 of china s total land area which expand compared with the same type of region for the total precipitation fig 1 the most concentrated expansion is in the coastal areas of the lower reaches of the pearl river the regions with nocturnal precipitation type i 4 i 5 and i 6 in fig 2 account for about 20 5 of china s total land area which is much smaller than that of the corresponding regions for the total precipitation i e 32 9 these regions are mainly distributed in the west of the sichuan basin to the north of the tianshan mountains to the south of the yanshan mountains and the east of the taihang mountains where regional mps circulation prevails the regions with double peaks in the morning and evening type ii 2 exhibit similar spatial distribution to the same type of region for the total precipitation but expand from 0 5 to 1 4 of china s total land area fig 3 shows that the medium duration precipitation has a generally similar spatial pattern to that of the short duration precipitation the regions with an afternoon peak type i 3 take up 48 6 of china s total land area these regions are widely distributed along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in southeastern china and in most of northeastern china the regions with a midday peak type i 2 account for about 17 7 and are mainly distributed in northwestern china northeastern china and the east of the tibetan plateau the regions with a morning peak type i 1 only account for 3 5 and are scattered in the arid areas of northwestern china and the northwest of the sichuan basin the regions with nocturnal precipitation type i 4 i 5 and i 6 account for about 19 3 these regions are mainly distributed in the valleys plains or basins near to mountains such as the valley of the yarlung zangbo river the sichuan basin the junggar basin and the north china plain the regions with double peaks type ii 3 and ii 6 account for about 10 8 and are mainly scattered in the desert areas of northwestern china and the hengduan mountains area in the east of the tibetan plateau fig 4 shows that for the long duration precipitation events i e longer than 6 h the regions with peaks from evening to morning type i 1 i 4 i 5 and i 6 in fig 4 play a leading role taking up 58 5 of china s total land area among them the regions with an evening peak type i 4 account for about 11 9 which is mainly distributed in the hengduan mountains the regions with a midnight peak type i 5 account for about 18 3 which is much larger than the same type of region for the total precipitation i e about 2 1 this type of region expands in southwestern china and emerges in the northwest of the tibetan plateau the yarlung tsangpo canyon and northwestern china the regions with an early morning peak type i 6 make up 13 6 of china s total land area and have similar spatial distribution to the same type of region for the total precipitation they are mainly distributed on the east of the hengduan mountains on the west of the lvliang mountains and on the regions of the circum bohai sea the regions with a morning precipitation peak type i 1 expand a lot compared with the same type of region for the total precipitation fig 1 this type of region is mainly distributed in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river and the coastal areas in the lower reaches of the pearl river in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river the short duration precipitation mainly occurs in the afternoon or at midday the combined result of the long and short duration precipitation is the double peaks of the total precipitation in this region along the yangtze river from the hengduan mountains to the eastern plains the peak time of precipitation shows a clear eastward delay which is consistent with the pattern in the total precipitation but is different from that in the short duration precipitation this indicates that the time delay pattern of diurnal peaks in the total precipitation is mainly caused by the long duration precipitation yu et al 2007a the regions with an afternoon precipitation peak type i 3 account for about 12 8 of china s total land area which is much smaller than the same type of region for the total precipitation i e 40 9 these regions are mainly spread in southeast coastal areas and the great khingan areas in northeastern china the regions with a midday peak type i 2 and double peaks at midday and midnight type ii 4 scatter in the deserts of northwestern china which take up 2 3 and 2 9 of china s total land area respectively the regions with double peaks in the afternoon and evening type ii 6 mainly scattering in the tibetan plateau shrink considerably compared with the same type of region for the total precipitation a significant characteristic in fig 4 is that there are large area regions with no obvious peaks which account for about 19 4 of china s total land area and are mainly distributed in the northeast china plain the north china plain the loess plateau and the southwest of the yunnan guizhou plateau it is found that the coastal regions of south china present morning or early morning precipitation peaks the morning precipitation in the coastal regions of south china may be induced by the coastal convergence and mountain lifting which can be enhanced by the land sea breeze and the monsoon southwesterly winds in the northern part of the south china sea chen et al 2018 the early morning precipitation over the coastal regions of south china was reported to be mainly maintained by the semi diurnal harmonic of water vapor flux transported from the south china sea huang and chan 2011 3 3 advantages of the bottom up approach the maps of the diurnal cycles of precipitation obtained by the bottom up approach in this study are generally consistent with the conclusions of existing studies such as the time delay pattern along the eastern slopes of the tibetan plateau and the prevailing midday afternoon peak for the short duration precipitation yu et al 2007a wu et al 2018 the advantage of this study is that the irregular shapes of homogeneous regions can be delineated objectively and many of the regions determined through clustering resemble large scale geomorphic units e g the valley of the yarlung zangbo river in fig 1 and boundaries e g the boundary between the tibetan plateau and sichuan basin and that between the taihang mountains and the north china plain in fig 1 these consistencies verify the importance of macroterrain for diurnal cycles of precipitation and show the efficacy of data mining methods to unveil the patterns in precipitation data in addition to the total precipitation the precipitation events with different durations were mapped separately in order to explore their diurnal cycle characteristics through the analysis of these maps we can get intuitive and in depth understandings of the diurnal cycles of precipitation taking the north part of the north china plain on the east of the taihang mountains as an example we can read from the maps that the piedmont plain region region 1 in fig 5 a has an evening peak for the total precipitation fig 1 and the short duration precipitation fig 2 and generally shows no peak for the long duration precipitation fig 4 the plain region far away from mountainous areas region 2 in fig 5a has an early morning peak for the total precipitation fig 1 and the long duration precipitation fig 4 but has an evening peak for the short duration precipitation fig 2 thus we can understand in an intuitive way that the diurnal cycle of the total precipitation is controlled by the short duration precipitation in region 1 fig 5b and the long duration precipitation in region 2 fig 5c these intuitive and detailed results generated by this methodology can provide valuable clues for further mechanism studies of diurnal cycles of precipitation 4 conclusions and future work this study complements the existing studies and deepens the understandings on the diurnal cycles of precipitation amount over china during summer in this study a gauge satellite merged precipitation product was used which is spatially more detailed than those based on rain gauge data e g yu et al 2007a 2007b and more reliable than those based on pure satellite data e g he and zhang 2010 pan and chen 2019 moreover the k means clustering algorithm was used to map the spatial patterns of the diurnal cycles which can delineate regions with irregular shapes and obtain more spatial details than previous studies e g yu et al 2007b choi et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 our methodology is comparable to wu et al 2018 and our previous study zhu et al 2018 however wu et al 2018 focused on the regions east to the tibetan plateau while our study was conducted over the whole china and zhu et al 2018 focused on the diurnal variation of precipitation frequency over china while our study focused on that of precipitation amount in addition to the total precipitation the short medium and long duration precipitation were analyzed separately the obtained results are generally consistent with existing researches e g yu et al 2007a bao and zhang 2013 wu et al 2018 pan and chen 2019 and the main advantage of this study is that the spatially

precipitation the future studies should focus on the following three aspects firstly the diurnal cycles of precipitation in other seasons besides summer should be explored since there are evident seasonal variations in the diurnal cycles of precipitation over china secondly the relationship between the diurnal cycle of precipitation amount frequency and intensity should be studied to improve

5008,the diurnal cycle of precipitation is a fundamental mode of climatic variability based on an hourly 0 1 0 1 gauge satellite merged precipitation dataset which is provided by the china meteorological data service center this study used the k means clustering algorithm to map the diurnal cycles of precipitation in summer over china the obtained maps can objectively delineate irregular regions with similar patterns of diurnal cycles and many of these regions resemble large scale geomorphic units such as the north china plain and the valley of the yarlung zangbo river which verifies the importance of macroterrain for diurnal cycles of precipitation in addition to total precipitation precipitation events with different durations which are often related to different types of precipitation e g convective precipitation and stratiform precipitation were analyzed separately compared with the previous studies using predefined region boundaries the main advantage of this study is that the obtained maps can show more spatial details through which we can get intuitive and in depth understandings of the regional characteristics and spatial patterns of the diurnal cycles of precipitation over china keywords summer precipitation precipitation events with different durations the k means clustering algorithm diurnal cycles of precipitation over china 1 introduction the diurnal cycle is a fundamental mode of climatic variability janowiak et al 2005 affected by the heterogeneities of the underlying surface e g plateau mountain plain river valley sea convective systems and atmospheric circulations e g mountain plains solenoid mps mountain valley and land sea breezes the diurnal cycle of precipitation has considerable regional characteristics zhang et al 2013 sen roy and sen roy 2014 wilson and barros 2015 ryu et al 2016 for example the late afternoon precipitation peaks over southern inland china and northeastern china are caused by surface solar heating which results in low level atmospheric instability and thus moist convection in the afternoon yu et al 2007b the nocturnal precipitation at the eastern foothills of the tibetan plateau is mainly due to the mps circulation zhang and sun 2017 while the eastward delayed precipitation peaks in the yangtze river basin i e from evening to midnight to early morning may be related to the propagation of the precipitation systems caused by the mid latitude westerly flow bao et al 2011 the patterns of these regional characteristics can provide valuable information to study the mechanisms of rain formation and validate numerical forecast models he and zhang 2010 bao and zhang 2013 jin et al 2016 the diurnal cycle of precipitation is also affected by the duration of a precipitation event yu et al 2007a precipitation events can be divided into short duration events i e shorter than or equal to 3 h and long duration events i e longer than 6 h yu et al 2007a the former are usually caused by local convective precipitation while the latter are often related to stratiform precipitation yu et al 2014 these two types of events usually present different patterns of diurnal cycles for example in the central eastern part of china the peaks of short duration precipitation events usually occur in the late afternoon while the peaks of long duration events usually occur in the evening and early morning yu et al 2014 most existing studies on the regional characteristics of diurnal cycles of precipitation used a top down approach in which the areas of interest were predefined by region boundaries such as rectangles yu et al 2007b choi et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 there are no objective rules to define these region boundaries and the regions used in most studies were empirical and more or less subjective in order to avoid this problem wu et al 2018 and our previous study zhu et al 2018 used a bottom up approach to dividing regions in which a clustering algorithm was used to mine the spatial patterns of diurnal cycles from gridded precipitation data the grid cells were divided into different groups according to the diurnal curves of precipitation in this way the grid cells within each group have the similar characteristics of diurnal cycles and their spatial distribution form the region for one type of diurnal cycle compared with the top down approach the obtained maps of diurnal cycles using the bottom up approach are more comprehensive and objective however wu et al 2018 only focused on the regions east to the tibetan plateau and used a small clustering number which may omit some small but important clusters while zhu et al 2018 only studied the diurnal cycles of precipitation frequency over china and did not explore the diurnal cycles of precipitation amount to our knowledge there has been no maps for the diurnal cycles of precipitation amount over china this study aims to fill this gap and generate such maps for summer precipitation over china using detailed precipitation data and a clustering algorithm in an effort to provide valuable clues to further mechanism studies 2 dataset and methodology 2 1 dataset the hourly 0 1 0 1 gridded precipitation dataset version 1 0 published by the china meteorological data service center cmdsc shen et al 2014 was used in this study this precipitation dataset was produced by merging the hourly rain gauge data from more than 30 000 automatic meteorological stations over china and the climate prediction center morphing technique cmorph product with an 8 km 30 min resolution joyce et al 2004 the probability density function optimal interpolation pdf oi method was used as the merging algorithm pan et al 2012 yu et al 2013 shen et al 2014 this dataset has been produced since january 1 2008 and updated every hour the overall error level of this dataset is within 10 and the error for heavy precipitation and sparse sites is within 20 cmdsc 2020 this dataset effectively takes advantages of the cmorph precipitation product and the rain gauge data at automatic weather stations shen et al 2013 the time series of this dataset can well capture the major temporally varying features of hourly precipitation in heavy weather events shen et al 2013 2014 wu et al 2018 and consider high frequency features of no rain events shen et al 2013 2014 it has smaller bias and root mean square error compared with the raw cmorph product over china shen et al 2013 2014 wu et al 2018 although the improvement may be smaller in western china where automatic stations are sparse shen et al 2013 this dataset has been applied in several studies jiang et al 2017 wu et al 2018 zhu et al 2018 li et al 2019 2020 considering that the summer june july august precipitation accounts for 50 80 of the total annual precipitation over china turner and annamalai 2012 dong et al 2016 we explored the diurnal cycles of summer precipitation from 2008 to 2016 using this dataset 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 representation of diurnal cycle of precipitation multi year average hourly precipitation amount in summer was used to present the diurnal cycle of precipitation which was represented as a 24 dimensional vector corresponding to 24 h in a day zhou et al 2008 then the 24 dimensional vector of precipitation amount was normalized by using the following formula yu et al 2007a 1 d a h r a h 1 24 i 1 24 r a i 1 where da h represents the normalized precipitation amount at time h and ra h represents the original precipitation amount at time h local solar time lst was used to calculate the hourly precipitation at each grid cell which was obtained from coordinated universal time utc using the following formula 2 lst utc lon 15 here lst represents the local solar time for a grid cell lon represents the longitude of the grid cell and the number 15 means each time zone is corresponding to 15 degrees of longitude 2 2 2 classification of precipitation events by durations precipitation events with different durations may be caused by different types of precipitation short duration events are usually caused by local convection while long duration events are often related to stratiform precipitation we extracted precipitation events from the hourly precipitation data and classified them according to the duration before analyzing the diurnal cycle of precipitation a precipitation event is assumed to have no intermittence or at most one hour intermittence in this study precipitation events are classified into 3 types by durations short duration events lasting shorter than or equal to 3 h medium duration events lasting between 4 and 6 h and long duration events lasting up to 6 h 2 2 3 mining spatial patterns of diurnal cycles of precipitation the k means clustering algorithm was adopted to mine the spatial patterns of diurnal cycles of precipitation based on the 24 dimensional vectors of the normalized hourly precipitation amount at each grid cell in order to choose an optimal number for clustering various cluster numbers ranging from 2 to 40 were tried for each point in the attribute space the distance to its corresponding cluster center was calculated the average distance can be used to measure the compactness of a clustering result when the reduction of the average distance is relatively small i e the average distance is beginning to level off as the cluster number increases the corresponding cluster number is deemed as the optimal number which can identify the main patterns in the data rajaraman and ullman 2011 the numbers of the clusters used in this study are 30 20 20 and 20 for the analysis of total precipitation short medium and long duration events respectively there are often some similar clusters in the clustering result to make the result concise the clusters with similar peak times were further merged the peak times were deemed to be similar if their local solar time fell into the any of the following periods early morning from 03 00 to 06 00 morning from 07 00 to 10 00 midday from 11 00 to 14 00 afternoon from 15 00 to 18 00 evening from 19 00 to 22 00 and midnight from 23 00 to 02 00 yuan et al 2012 zhu et al 2018 for diurnal cycles with multiple peaks two clusters are merged only when all their peak times are similar the spatial distribution of grid cells in the merged clusters makes up a map to characterize diurnal cycles of precipitation in this study there are 13 types of diurnal cycles in summer over china table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 diurnal cycles of total precipitation over china fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the diurnal cycles of the total precipitation in summer over china there are 11 types of regions with distinct peak times the regions with an afternoon precipitation peak from 14 00 to 18 00 type i 3 in fig 1 cover the largest area accounting for 40 9 of china s total land area this type is mainly distributed in the southeast and northeast of china the inner mongolia plateau and the loess plateau the regions with a midday peak from 10 00 to 14 00 type i 2 take up 5 7 of china s total land area mainly distributed in the deserts of northwestern china convection caused by solar heating is probably the main driving factor in these two types of regions yu et al 2007b yuan et al 2012 the regions with a morning peak from 06 00 to 10 00 type i 1 account for only 3 0 of china s total land area and scatter in some mountainous areas such as the east of the tianshan mountains and the central region of the daba mountains the regions with nocturnal precipitation type i 4 i 5 i 6 in fig 1 account for 32 9 of china s total land area the proportion of regions with an evening peak from 18 00 to 22 00 type i 4 is about 15 8 these regions are mainly distributed in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau the hengduan mountains and the valley of the yarlung zangbo river to the south of 30 n and located in the vicinity of some large mountains e g to the north of the tianshan mountains to the south of the yanshan mountains and to the east of the taihang mountains to the north of 30 n the regions with a midnight precipitation peak from 22 00 to 02 00 type i 5 make up only 2 1 of china s total land area and are mainly distributed in the southwest of the sichuan basin and on the south of the hengduan mountains the proportion of regions with an early morning peak from 02 00 to 06 00 type i 6 is comparable to that with an evening peak accounting for 15 0 of china s total land area these regions are mainly distributed to the east of the regions peaked in the evening or at midnight such as the east of the hengduan and yanshan taihang mountains the peak time of these regions with nocturnal precipitation often has a time delay pattern i e from evening to midnight to early morning from mountains to plains along the slope of macroterrain zhu et al 2018 the causes of the delayed pattern have been broadly discussed which may be related to the propagation of the precipitation systems caused by the mid latitude westerly flow bao et al 2011 the regional mountain plains solenoid mps circulation he and zhang 2010 jin et al 2013 or the diurnal clockwise rotation of the low tropospheric circulation chen et al 2010 the coastal regions of south china present morning or early morning precipitation peaks affected by the prevalent monsoon flow type ii 1 has double peaks in the morning and afternoon taking up 5 of china s total land area and is mainly distributed in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river the morning peak is attributed to long duration precipitation and the afternoon peak is attributed to short duration precipitation yu et al 2007a and the maps in figs 2 and 4 show this pattern clearly type ii 2 has double peaks in the morning and evening and only accounts for 0 5 of china s total land area it mainly scatters around the large lakes in northwestern china e g the qinghai lake and the namtso lake and some mountainous regions with permanent snow cover which are wet patches in dry regions zhu et al 2018 this is a very interesting phenomenon and the underlying mechanism still needs further exploration the regions with midday and evening peaks type ii 3 and the regions with early morning and midday peaks type ii 5 account for 2 and 2 2 of china s total land area respectively they are scattered in the northwest desert regions interlaced with the regions with a midday peak type i 2 type ii 6 has double peaks in the afternoon and evening type ii 6 occupying 7 8 of china s total land area and is mainly distributed in the middle of the tibetan plateau the midday afternoon peaks should be related to solar heating and the evening early morning peaks may be attributed to regional mountain valley wind circulations yu et al 2007b singh and nakamura 2009 yin et al 2009 yuan et al 2012 3 2 diurnal cycles of precipitation for events with different durations figs 2 3 and 4 show the spatial distributions of the diurnal cycles of precipitation for the short medium and long duration events respectively as shown in fig 2 for the short duration precipitation most regions of china reach their diurnal peaks during midday to afternoon type i 2 and i 3 because convection caused by solar heating is strongest during these periods these two types account for 70 5 of china s total land area and type i 3 alone i e the regions with an afternoon peak accounts for 54 9 some regions with nocturnal precipitation according to the total precipitation amount e g southwestern china fig 1 also have an afternoon peak for short duration precipitation the regions with a midday precipitation peak make up 15 6 of china s total land area which expand compared with the same type of region for the total precipitation fig 1 the most concentrated expansion is in the coastal areas of the lower reaches of the pearl river the regions with nocturnal precipitation type i 4 i 5 and i 6 in fig 2 account for about 20 5 of china s total land area which is much smaller than that of the corresponding regions for the total precipitation i e 32 9 these regions are mainly distributed in the west of the sichuan basin to the north of the tianshan mountains to the south of the yanshan mountains and the east of the taihang mountains where regional mps circulation prevails the regions with double peaks in the morning and evening type ii 2 exhibit similar spatial distribution to the same type of region for the total precipitation but expand from 0 5 to 1 4 of china s total land area fig 3 shows that the medium duration precipitation has a generally similar spatial pattern to that of the short duration precipitation the regions with an afternoon peak type i 3 take up 48 6 of china s total land area these regions are widely distributed along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in southeastern china and in most of northeastern china the regions with a midday peak type i 2 account for about 17 7 and are mainly distributed in northwestern china northeastern china and the east of the tibetan plateau the regions with a morning peak type i 1 only account for 3 5 and are scattered in the arid areas of northwestern china and the northwest of the sichuan basin the regions with nocturnal precipitation type i 4 i 5 and i 6 account for about 19 3 these regions are mainly distributed in the valleys plains or basins near to mountains such as the valley of the yarlung zangbo river the sichuan basin the junggar basin and the north china plain the regions with double peaks type ii 3 and ii 6 account for about 10 8 and are mainly scattered in the desert areas of northwestern china and the hengduan mountains area in the east of the tibetan plateau fig 4 shows that for the long duration precipitation events i e longer than 6 h the regions with peaks from evening to morning type i 1 i 4 i 5 and i 6 in fig 4 play a leading role taking up 58 5 of china s total land area among them the regions with an evening peak type i 4 account for about 11 9 which is mainly distributed in the hengduan mountains the regions with a midnight peak type i 5 account for about 18 3 which is much larger than the same type of region for the total precipitation i e about 2 1 this type of region expands in southwestern china and emerges in the northwest of the tibetan plateau the yarlung tsangpo canyon and northwestern china the regions with an early morning peak type i 6 make up 13 6 of china s total land area and have similar spatial distribution to the same type of region for the total precipitation they are mainly distributed on the east of the hengduan mountains on the west of the lvliang mountains and on the regions of the circum bohai sea the regions with a morning precipitation peak type i 1 expand a lot compared with the same type of region for the total precipitation fig 1 this type of region is mainly distributed in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river and the coastal areas in the lower reaches of the pearl river in the middle lower reaches of the yangtze river the short duration precipitation mainly occurs in the afternoon or at midday the combined result of the long and short duration precipitation is the double peaks of the total precipitation in this region along the yangtze river from the hengduan mountains to the eastern plains the peak time of precipitation shows a clear eastward delay which is consistent with the pattern in the total precipitation but is different from that in the short duration precipitation this indicates that the time delay pattern of diurnal peaks in the total precipitation is mainly caused by the long duration precipitation yu et al 2007a the regions with an afternoon precipitation peak type i 3 account for about 12 8 of china s total land area which is much smaller than the same type of region for the total precipitation i e 40 9 these regions are mainly spread in southeast coastal areas and the great khingan areas in northeastern china the regions with a midday peak type i 2 and double peaks at midday and midnight type ii 4 scatter in the deserts of northwestern china which take up 2 3 and 2 9 of china s total land area respectively the regions with double peaks in the afternoon and evening type ii 6 mainly scattering in the tibetan plateau shrink considerably compared with the same type of region for the total precipitation a significant characteristic in fig 4 is that there are large area regions with no obvious peaks which account for about 19 4 of china s total land area and are mainly distributed in the northeast china plain the north china plain the loess plateau and the southwest of the yunnan guizhou plateau it is found that the coastal regions of south china present morning or early morning precipitation peaks the morning precipitation in the coastal regions of south china may be induced by the coastal convergence and mountain lifting which can be enhanced by the land sea breeze and the monsoon southwesterly winds in the northern part of the south china sea chen et al 2018 the early morning precipitation over the coastal regions of south china was reported to be mainly maintained by the semi diurnal harmonic of water vapor flux transported from the south china sea huang and chan 2011 3 3 advantages of the bottom up approach the maps of the diurnal cycles of precipitation obtained by the bottom up approach in this study are generally consistent with the conclusions of existing studies such as the time delay pattern along the eastern slopes of the tibetan plateau and the prevailing midday afternoon peak for the short duration precipitation yu et al 2007a wu et al 2018 the advantage of this study is that the irregular shapes of homogeneous regions can be delineated objectively and many of the regions determined through clustering resemble large scale geomorphic units e g the valley of the yarlung zangbo river in fig 1 and boundaries e g the boundary between the tibetan plateau and sichuan basin and that between the taihang mountains and the north china plain in fig 1 these consistencies verify the importance of macroterrain for diurnal cycles of precipitation and show the efficacy of data mining methods to unveil the patterns in precipitation data in addition to the total precipitation the precipitation events with different durations were mapped separately in order to explore their diurnal cycle characteristics through the analysis of these maps we can get intuitive and in depth understandings of the diurnal cycles of precipitation taking the north part of the north china plain on the east of the taihang mountains as an example we can read from the maps that the piedmont plain region region 1 in fig 5 a has an evening peak for the total precipitation fig 1 and the short duration precipitation fig 2 and generally shows no peak for the long duration precipitation fig 4 the plain region far away from mountainous areas region 2 in fig 5a has an early morning peak for the total precipitation fig 1 and the long duration precipitation fig 4 but has an evening peak for the short duration precipitation fig 2 thus we can understand in an intuitive way that the diurnal cycle of the total precipitation is controlled by the short duration precipitation in region 1 fig 5b and the long duration precipitation in region 2 fig 5c these intuitive and detailed results generated by this methodology can provide valuable clues for further mechanism studies of diurnal cycles of precipitation 4 conclusions and future work this study complements the existing studies and deepens the understandings on the diurnal cycles of precipitation amount over china during summer in this study a gauge satellite merged precipitation product was used which is spatially more detailed than those based on rain gauge data e g yu et al 2007a 2007b and more reliable than those based on pure satellite data e g he and zhang 2010 pan and chen 2019 moreover the k means clustering algorithm was used to map the spatial patterns of the diurnal cycles which can delineate regions with irregular shapes and obtain more spatial details than previous studies e g yu et al 2007b choi et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 chen et al 2018 our methodology is comparable to wu et al 2018 and our previous study zhu et al 2018 however wu et al 2018 focused on the regions east to the tibetan plateau while our study was conducted over the whole china and zhu et al 2018 focused on the diurnal variation of precipitation frequency over china while our study focused on that of precipitation amount in addition to the total precipitation the short medium and long duration precipitation were analyzed separately the obtained results are generally consistent with existing researches e g yu et al 2007a bao and zhang 2013 wu et al 2018 pan and chen 2019 and the main advantage of this study is that the spatially detailed maps for the diurnal cycles of precipitation were generated by a synergy of these maps we can gain intuitive and in depth understandings of the spatial patterns of the diurnal cycles of precipitation the future studies should focus on the following three aspects firstly the diurnal cycles of precipitation in other seasons besides summer should be explored since there are evident seasonal variations in the diurnal cycles of precipitation over china secondly the relationship between the diurnal cycle of precipitation amount frequency and intensity should be studied to improve the understanding of the physical processes involved in the regional weather thirdly although the precipitation dataset used in this study takes advantage of both a satellite based precipitation product and rain gauge data there are still large uncertainties in western china where automatic stations are sparse in the future more rain gauge data should be collected and used to further improve

5009,hydrologic models are commonly used to assess climate change impact on water resources several studies have reported that hydrologic models often experience severe performance degradation under climatic conditions different from calibration periods with the advancement of artificial intelligence technology the long short term memory lstm network has recently shown great potentials in rainfall runoff modeling however little is known about the robustness of the lstm network when used in changing climatic conditions in this study we compare the robustness of the lstm network and two conceptual hydrologic models in runoff prediction in changing climatic conditions in 278 model parameter estimation experiment mopex basins for calibration periods the two hydrologic models have better performance in wet periods than in dry periods while the lstm network shows little performance difference under different climatic conditions for validation periods the three models suffer the largest performance loss when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period the performance losses of the lstm network are primarily affected by the climate contrast between calibration and validation periods while the performance losses of the two hydrologic models are mainly dependent on the climatic condition of validation periods we also find that the length of the calibration period is an important factor affecting the relative performance of the models increasing the length of the calibration period has little effect on the validation performance of the two hydrologic models but enhances the lstm network s performance if sufficient calibration data is available the lstm network is a preferred tool for runoff simulation on the other hand the hydrologic models could have more advantages over the lstm network in case of limited calibration data available keywords hydrologic models machine learning runoff simulation lstm 1 introduction the earth s climate system is experiencing dramatic changes characterized by warming which profoundly impacts the terrestrial water cycle and water availability bronstert et al 2002 hydrologic models are typically used to assess the impacts of climate change on water availability such assessments usually follow four key steps i calibrating hydrologic models based on historical observations ii using general circulation models gcms outputs to project future climate under different emission scenarios of greenhouse gas iii downscaling and bias correcting the gcms outputs iv using hydrologic models forced by the gcms outputs to project runoff response coron et al 2012 seiller et al 2012 broderick et al 2016 an underlying assumption is that a well calibrated model can also perform well under future climatic conditions goderniaux et al 2009 fowler et al 2016 however this assumption has been increasingly questioned in a changing climate vaze et al 2010 saft et al 2016 increasing evidence indicated that the robustness of hydrologic models decreases under climatic conditions different from calibration periods coron et al 2012 thirel et al 2015 fowler et al 2016 one of the reasons is that model parameters are dependent on the climatic condition during the calibration period merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 it raises the concern that models calibrated using historical data may become unreliable in projecting future runoff regimes due to climate difference between history and future however this potential uncertainty was often neglected in assessing climate change impacts on water resources leading to the uncertainty in future runoff projections being underestimated wilby and harris 2006 barron et al 2012 verzano et al 2012 hydrologists have recognized that the model robustness is relevant to climate difference between calibration and validation periods klemeš 1986 gan and burges 1990 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 several studies have called for rigorous testing of the model robustness before applying hydrologic models to assess climate change impacts milly et al 2008 saft et al 2016 dakhlaoui et al 2017 guo et al 2018 however it is not feasible to test the model robustness under projected climatic conditions directly as future observations are not available researchers used another solution to this issue testing the model robustness in historical periods thirel et al 2015 broderick et al 2016 fowler et al 2016 if a model is robust under contrasting climatic conditions in historical periods the model is expected to provide reasonable runoff projections in the future this model evaluation scheme was first proposed by klemeš 1986 and called the differential split sample testing dsst the dsst provides a simple and effective method to screen robust models for assessing climate change impacts there are some potential strategies to improve model robustness in a changing climate the first approach is to use sufficiently long data to calibrate the model however the data length used for calibration is not the longer the better lidén and harlin 2000 boughton 2007 luo et al 2012 the minimum data required for calibration depends on multiple factors including catchment characteristics model types and research purposes anctil et al 2004 van der spek and bakker 2017 the second approach is to use the multi model ensemble averaging to reduce the prediction uncertainty of a single model the core step of this method is assigning a weight to the output of each model according to their relative performance broderick et al 2016 this method takes advantage of individual parameter sets which was reported to outperform most single parameter sets in runoff prediction broderick et al 2016 huang et al 2016 although the multi model ensemble average may be superior to most individual models it is usually worse than the best individual model broderick et al 2016 the third approach is to improve the objective function used for calibration for example commonly used objective functions such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 are sensitive to high flows pushpalatha et al 2012 fowler et al 2018 tian et al 2018 giving more weight to mid low flows in the objective function can improve low flow prediction fowler et al 2018 however each objective function has its focus either the overall water balance or a specific flow range low intermediate or high flows there is no consensus on the choice of the objective function for projecting runoff in a changing climate the choice of the objective function depends primarily on the research purpose overall the above three methods are not universal strategies to improve model robustness under contrasting climatic conditions with the advances in artificial intelligence machine learning ml models have attracted increasing attention in the hydrologic community and have been widely used for predicting runoff on the basin scale shortridge et al 2016 kratzert et al 2018 huntingford et al 2019 one advantage of ml models over traditional hydrologic models is that they can quickly and accurately capture complicated relationships between inputs and outputs from a large amount of training data without requiring knowledge of internal physical processes that control rainfall runoff transformation additionally ml models are more flexible in model inputs and generally take less time in model calibration training hereafter collectively called calibration than traditional hydrologic models however no evidence indicates that ml models always perform better than hydrologic models in runoff prediction anctil et al 2004 shortridge et al 2016 kratzert et al 2018 the relative performance of the two types of models depends on multiple factors including the model selected shortridge et al 2016 the length of the calibration period anctil et al 2004 toth and brath 2007 and runoff characteristics e g high flow and low flow daliakopoulos and tsanis 2016 ml models have multiple variants such as the support vector machine networks the convolutional neural networks and the recurrent neural networks rnns among them rnns maintain past information with feedback on both time delayed inputs and outputs and have been widely used for rainfall runoff modeling yang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 the long short term memory lstm network is one of the state of the art architecture types of rnns which overcomes the limited memory capacity of traditional rnns and can learn long term dependencies between input and output variables hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 this feature of the lstm network is desirable for modeling hydrologic processes that often exhibit long term lag responses such as the snowmelt runoff baseflow and groundwater recharge fang et al 2017 showed that the lstm could efficiently reproduce the satellite retrieved soil moisture dynamics with superior performance than the statistical models zhang et al 2018 found that the lstm performs better than a traditional neural network without explicit cell memory in predicting groundwater dynamics in agricultural areas kratzert et al 2018 confirmed that the lstm outperforms the conceptual hydrological model in daily streamflow simulations in 241 us catchments although the lstm network has shown great potentials in rainfall runoff modeling few studies have focused on the model robustness in climatic conditions beyond the calibration period three questions urgently need to be addressed 1 what are the similarities and differences in the robustness between the lstm and traditional hydrologic models in response to climate change 2 which climate change scenario causes greater performance degradation to the lstm network than other scenarios 3 does the lstm network outperform conceptual hydrologic models under contrasting climatic conditions to answer these questions we applied the dsst to test the robustness of the lstm network and two conceptual hydrologic models under different climatic conditions in 278 model parameter estimation experiment mopex basins to the best of our knowledge this work is the first attempt to compare the lstm network and conceptual hydrologic models in terms of their robustness under different climatic conditions the findings of this work can provide useful guidance for model selection and evaluation in a changing climate 2 data and research methodology 2 1 test catchments and data the us mopex data set is used to compare the robustness of the three models under different climatic conditions the data set provides basin averaged hydro meteorological records for about 400 basins with limited anthropogenic perturbation duan et al 2006 schaake et al 2006 here we exclude the basins with data gaps of more than five years a total of 278 basins are selected for this study fig 1 a covering diverse climate and landscape conditions according to the budyko framework 79 5 of basins are classified as energy limited basins and the remaining basins as water limited basins fig 1b the catchment area ranges from 135 to 10 329 km2 with a median size of 2358 km2 each basin contains at least 50 years of data including daily precipitation runoff maximum and minimum temperature as well as pet estimates based on long term pan evaporation observations schaake et al 2006 the restriction of data length is to ensure that the data can be split into multiple independent subperiods with contrasting or similar climatic conditions see section 2 4 2 2 the long short term memory lstm network one deficiency of traditional rnns in simulating runoff is the limited memory capacity the memory capacity of traditional rnns is usually less than ten time steps bengio et al 1994 this means that we can only use forcing data from the past ten days to simulate runoff for the next day ten days may be too short for runoff simulation given that the lag time of runoff in response to precipitation may last for several months millares et al 2009 to overcome the issue of the vanishing gradients in traditional rnns the lstm was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which can learn long term dependencies between inputs and outputs the lstm network is comprised of a set of recurrently connected memory blocks and each memory block contains a cell state input gate output gate forget gate as well as the hidden state fig 2 the cell state is served as the memory of the system the three gates allow the network to selectively retain important information from the past while ignoring irrelevant information specifically the input gate controls the extent to which a new input flows into the cell the forget gate determines how much the former state is retained in the cell and the output gate determines how much of the memory is used to compute the output kratzert et al 2018 the specific mathematical expressions of the lstm network can refer to hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and kratzert et al 2019a the lstm network includes two types of parameters the first type is the trainable parameters which are the weights of a neural network and optimized by the algorithm during training the number of trainable parameters in the lstm network is not constant and depends on the sizes of inputs and outputs reimers and gurevych 2017 the number of trainable parameters of the lstm network is often much greater than that of the traditional hydrological models which can be huge even for small size training data the second type is the hyperparameters which are essentially a network configuration scheme and need to be set before training the network it is widely accepted that hyperparameters are essential for model predictive accuracy but there is no general theory on how to configure them reimers and gurevych 2017 kratzert et al 2018 here we employ the deep learning toolbox in matlab to build the lstm network therefore most hyperparameters directly use the default values in the toolbox the remaining hyperparameters refer to published literature to reduce the risk of overfitting which are as follows the dropout rate 0 40 kratzert et al 2019b maxepochs 250 ravindra 2018 numhiddenunits 128 fan et al 2020 and minibatchsize 32 choi et al 2018 the lstm network runs at a daily step and the forcing data include precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet maximum temperature and minimum temperature 2 3 two conceptual hydrologic models most studies tend to use conceptual hydrologic models to assess the impact of climate change on water resources because they require less input data and computing time than physically based models seiller et al 2012 bai et al 2015 2018 fowler et al 2016 saft et al 2016 here two conceptual hydrologic models were used fig 3 namely the simhyd model and the gr4j model the two models have been successfully used to simulate daily runoff under a wide range of climatic conditions post et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 li et al 2014 guo et al 2016 the simhyd model describes the rainfall runoff transformation in detail with conceptual equations and balances the model complexity and performance well chiew et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 the model contains four stores for interception loss soil moisture groundwater and routing process fig 3a evapotranspiration excluding the interception evaporation is estimated as a function of pet and the relative soil moisture store soil moisture store divided by soil moisture store capacity the total runoff is generated from three sources surface runoff interflow and baseflow which is routed to the catchment outlet with the muskingum cunge method cunge 1969 more details about the simhyd model can be found in chiew et al 2002 unlike the simhyd model the gr4j model focuses only on the representation of key hydrologic processes perrin et al 2003 so it has a parsimonious model structure and contains only four parameters fig 3b the structure of the gr4j model is primarily composed of three parts a runoff generation module a groundwater exchange module and a linear routing module the runoff generation module determines the water quantity reaching the routing part of the model this part of water is then partitioned into two components using a fixed split 90 of the water slowly supplements the routing store and is eventually released to catchment outlet and the remaining 10 of the water is directly routed to catchment outlet more information on the gr4j model can be found in perrin et al 2003 considering the importance of snow in the water balance at high altitude and high elevation areas a simple snow module based on a degree day approach is coupled into the simhyd model and the gr4j model fig 3 the snow module contains two free parameters and requires daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature as inputs the snow module first determines the fraction of precipitation partitioning into rainfall and snow based on daily maximum and minimum temperature valéry et al 2014 see appendix the daily snowmelt amount is then estimated by a simple degree day method in which snowmelt occurs only when the average daily temperature exceeds a certain threshold see appendix the snowmelt leaving the snow store infiltrates into the soil layer and participates in the subsequent hydrologic processes the two hydrologic models coupled with the snow module are hereafter called the simhyd snow model and the gr4j snow model respectively and they have the same model inputs as the lstm network the number of parameters for simhyd snow and gr4j snow models are 11 and 6 respectively a global optimization algorithm namely the genetic algorithm wang 1991 is used to calibrate the parameters for the two models root mean square error rmse is used as the objective function to keep consistent with the calibration objective of the lstm network the two evaluation criteria used to quantify the accuracy of runoff simulations are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and bias respectively see appendix 2 4 the differential split sample testing dsst we apply the dsst to generate different climatic conditions for calibration and validation and then evaluate the robustness of the models under different climatic conditions specifically the dsst consists of a series of calibration validation tests on subperiods with similar or contrasting climatic conditions first the available climate time series of each catchment is split into four subperiods with similar or contrasting climatic conditions two wet periods and two dry periods based on a five year moving average of aridity index fig 4 a then the three models are calibrated in a specific subperiod and validated in the other two subperiods fig 4b a one year warmup is used for each calibration each model has eight calibration validation tests on a catchment the eight tests can be classified as dry dry dry wet wet dry and wet wet according to the change in climatic condition from calibration to validation hereafter the groups of dry wet and wet dry are called the climate contrasted tests and the other two are called the climate similar tests the difference in model efficiency between calibration and validation periods under climate similar tests primarily reflects the influence of model related uncertainties e g inputs structure and calibration on validation results the difference between climate similar and climate contrasted tests mainly represents the effect of climate change on validation results we identify the four climatically similar or contrasting subperiods based on a five year moving average of aridity index the lowest and highest values of the five year moving average time series of aridity index are selected as the driest dry1 and wettest wet1 subperiods respectively the second driest wettest subperiods dry2 and wet2 are identified following the same approach there is no overlap between the four subperiods we acknowledge that the dry periods identified by this method may contain some relatively wet years and vice versa however it is not easy to find five consecutive dry or wet years from historical climate records the aridity index used here is defined as the ratio of annual pet to annual precipitation this index is selected because it takes into account two key factors affecting the climatic condition of a catchment water availability precipitation and energy availability pet the choice of five years as calibration period is because this data length considers a trade off between i the difference in climatic conditions represented by subsets and ii the rationality of the calibrated parameters anctil et al 2004 coron et al 2012 a five year calibration period is usually sufficient for hydrologic models to obtain reliable parameter estimates lidén and harlin 2000 li et al 2010 luo et al 2012 a longer calibration period in turn would reduce the contrast in climatic conditions between subsets 2 5 using different sizes of calibration data to test model performance under changing climatic conditions for conceptual hydrologic models extending the calibration period does not guarantee better predictions when the length of the calibration period exceeds a certain threshold harlin 1991 li et al 2010 luo et al 2012 however a longer calibration period may be beneficial for ml models to achieve a better simulation huntingford et al 2019 here a model experiment is designed to investigate the effect of the length of calibration period on the performance of the three models see fig 5 in this experiment the three models are calibrated with subsets of 5 10 15 and 20 years but validated on dry1 period i e the driest period and wet1 period i e the wettest period for each basin the four calibration subsets overlap each other and are extracted from the longest data time series other than dry1 and wet1 this model experiment focuses on the influence of the length of the calibration period on model performance while it places less emphasis on the climate contrasting between calibration and validation periods 3 results 3 1 calibration results we first provide an overview of calibration performance under different climatic conditions to assess the quality of the calibrated parameter sets fig 6 shows the model performance nse and bias using a five year calibration period in the 278 basins the results indicate that the three models are well calibrated under both dry and wet conditions the median nse values of the three models range from 0 65 minimum for the gr4j snow in the dry2 period to 0 82 maximum for the lstm in the wet2 period fig 6a and the median bias values of the three models are all in the range of 5 to 10 fig 6b results also indicate that the two hydrologic models are better calibrated in wet periods than in dry periods reflected by a smaller interquartile range the higher values of nse and the lower values of bias in wet periods than in dry periods the lstm network however presents little performance difference under different climatic conditions the median nse values for the lstm network in the four calibration periods dry1 dry2 wet1 and wet2 are 0 81 0 80 0 80 and 0 82 respectively 3 2 the effect of changing climatic conditions from calibration to validation on model robustness compared to the calibration results the validation results can better reflect the actual predictive skill of a model fig 7 presents the validation nse statistics and the change in nse δnse from calibration periods to validation periods under different calibration validation tests in general the performances of the three models in validation periods are poorer than those in calibration periods the magnitude of performance loss depends on the models and the climate contrast between calibration and validation periods the three models suffer the largest performance loss when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period that is the wet dry test and the smallest performance loss when calibrated in a wet and validated in a wet period that is the wet wet test the performance losses of the hydrologic models from calibration to validation are different from those of the lstm network for the two hydrologic models their performance losses are mainly dependent on the validation climate fig 7a more performance losses occur when the two models are validated in a dry period the tests of dry dry and wet dry even under the climate similar test the dry dry test by contrast the performance losses of the lstm network are primarily affected by the climate contrast between calibration and validation periods the performance losses of the lstm network under the climate contrasted tests i e the dry wet test and the wet dry test are greater than those under the climate similar tests i e the dry dry test and the wet wet test 3 3 the effect of changing climatic conditions from calibration to validation on volume errors fig 8 illustrates the bias statistics in the calibration and validation periods for the three models the three models consistently show that the bias during validation depends on the bias in calibration and the type of calibration validation tests under the climate similar tests the calibration bias can be amplified and propagated to validation periods if the mean runoff is overestimated a positive bias in calibration periods a larger bias and interquartile ranges can be expected in validation periods see fig 8a similarly the mean runoff in validation periods would be further underestimated a negative bias when an underestimation occurs in calibration periods see fig 8b the comparison of the bias between climate similar and climate contrasted tests reflects the influence of climate change on validation bias there are two opposite changes in bias from calibration to validation under climate contrasted tests the calibration bias in a dry period would be attenuated when models are validated in a wet period i e the dry wet test the calibration bias in a wet period would be amplified when models are validated in a dry period i e the wet dry test in other words if the calibration bias is assumed to be zero calibration under a wetter drier climate than the validation period would lead to an overestimation underestimation of the mean runoff 3 4 the effect of extending the calibration period on model performance under contrasting climatic conditions here we investigate whether extending the calibration period can improve model performance under different climatic conditions fig 9 summarizes the validation nse values in the dry1 and wet1 periods using the calibration periods of 5 10 15 and 20 years the results show that extending the calibration period enhances the validation performance of the lstm network but has little effect on the overall performance of the two hydrologic models when the calibration period increases from 5 to 20 years the median nse for the lstm network increases by 0 08 from 0 54 to 0 62 during the dry1 period and by 0 12 from 0 60 to 0 72 during the wet1 period in contrast the longer calibration period brings limited improvement for the validation performance of the two hydrologic models no more than 0 02 for median nse overall a calibration period of about 15 years can provide a relatively fair comparison of the lstm network and the two hydrologic models the lstm network is inferior to the simhyd snow model in validation periods when calibrated in a five year period however it achieves comparable in the dry period or even better performance in the wet period than the simhyd snow model when the calibration period increases to 15 or 20 years additionally the model improvement effect produced by each additional five year calibration period gradually decreases for the lstm network this means that the predictive skill of the lstm network also has a ceiling effect similar to the hydrologic models more training data cannot further improve the model s predictive skill when the amount of calibration data exceeds a certain threshold 4 discussions 4 1 assessment results and limitations in this study we compared the robustness of the lstm network and two hydrologic models under different climatic conditions the comparison was performed in a large number of test catchments to draw more general conclusions we found that the lstm network s performance is more sensitive to climate change from calibration to validation than that of the two hydrologic models the greatest performance degradation for the three models occurs when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period the wet dry test we also found that the lstm network needs more training data than hydrologic models to obtain better parameter estimates this conclusion corroborates the finding of anctil et al 2004 and toth and brath 2007 who highlighted the importance of the sizes of calibration data on the relative performance of neural network models and hydrologic models if there are sufficient hydro meteorological data available for calibration the lstm network is a good tool for rainfall runoff modeling in a changing climate otherwise we prefer to recommend the use of hydrologic models with a sophisticated structure moreover like hydrologic models the runoff predictive skill of the lstm network also has a ceiling effect see fig 9c a similar conclusion has also been reported by boulmaiz et al 2020 this may be due to the following two reasons first additional data beyond a certain size of training data contains limited useful information for model improvement second the lstm network reaches the limit of learning ability and cannot further utilize useful information from additional training data the conclusions about the robustness of hydrologic models under different climatic conditions are overall in line with previous findings vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 guo et al 2018 stephens et al 2019 we found that the two hydrologic models experience more performance degradation when applied in a drier period similar conclusions have also been drawn by previous studies such as vaze et al 2010 li et al 2012 and stephens et al 2019 there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon 1 the rainfall runoff relationships at the basin scale are prone to change in dry periods saft et al 2016 2 hydrologic models become very sensitive to errors in model inputs in a dry period due to a low runoff coefficient li et al 2012 furthermore if the effect of calibration bias is not considered the hydrologic models would overestimate mean runoff when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period the wet dry test and underestimate mean runoff when calibrated in a dry period and validated in a wet period the dry wet test this conclusion is generally applicable to all regions of the world and not limited to model types merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 fowler et al 2018 this reminds us that it is necessary to consider the potential biases caused by climate change in future water resources projection there are several potential limitations in the evaluation results first the choice of climate classification method may affect the assessment results many climate variables can be used to classify the climate as dry or wet subperiods including precipitation and the combinations of precipitation and other climate variables e g temperature and pet li et al 2011 coron et al 2012 stephens et al 2019 long et al 2020 the rationality of the climate classification method used here needs further verification second the lstm network needs to set several hyperparameters prior to training the network in this work we used the default values of the matlab toolbox or recommended values by previous work to set the hyperparameters the values of hyperparameters are certainly not optimal which may affect the performance of the lstm network to a certain extent third long term climate change usually causes changes in landscape factors e g vegetation coverage however the models used in this study do not include the impact of changes in landscape factors on runoff simulation 4 2 a potential strategy to improve model robustness in a changing climate as mentioned in the introduction researchers have attempted to use different methods to improve the robustness of hydrologic models under contrasting climatic conditions however these methods are not always effective and in some cases they may also lead to negative effects as shown in fig 9 runoff prediction skills of the two hydrologic models exhibit a ceiling effect in response to the extended calibration period this means that increasing the calibration data is effective only when minimum calibration data required by a model is not reached a too long calibration period has little effect on improving the model robustness which in turn reduces the computational efficiency of a model a general method to improve model robustness under contrasting climates is dynamically selecting the optimal parameter set according to the climatic condition of the validation period as suggested by li et al 2012 and lan et al 2020 if a model is intended to predict runoff for a wet dry climate scenario then the parameter set calibrated from a historical wet dry period should be used at the operational level we first need to construct a library of optimum parameter sets representing different climatic conditions via sub period model calibration the optimal parameter set is then selected from the library based on the principle of the highest similarity of climatic conditions between validation and calibration periods this method has been proven to be effective for parameter estimates in a changing climate perrin et al 2008 han and kim 2017 lan et al 2020 the rationality of this method is that it makes full use of the dependence of the optimal parameter set on the climatic condition of the calibration period the library of the optimal parameter sets can reflect the dynamic behavior of parameter sets under changing climatic conditions more importantly this method is a universal method for improving model robustness under contrasting climates and not limited by the type of the model or the catchment climate note that some studies tried to link changes in model parameters with changes in climate characteristics of the catchment li et al 2012 stephens et al 2019 thereby estimating model parameters in a changing climate however the calibrated model parameters generally lose their original physical meaning due to the equifinality beven and freer 2001 they function as a whole a parameter set in hydrologic models to describe the rainfall runoff relationship on the basin scale wagener and kollat 2007 lan et al 2020 as a result there is usually no significant statistical relationship between changes in individual parameters and changes in climate characteristics of the catchment thirel et al 2015 dakhlaoui et al 2017 guo et al 2020 5 conclusions the lstm network is increasingly used in hydrologic research due to its powerful predictive capacity however little is known about its robustness when used under climatic conditions beyond the calibration period in this work we compared the robustness of the lstm network and two hydrologic models under different climatic conditions in 278 mopex catchments the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the three models experience the largest performance loss when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period 2 the lstm network s performance degrades more under contrasting climatic conditions than under similar climatic conditions while the two hydrologic models are more unstable when validated in a dry period 3 the lstm network requires more calibration data than the two hydrologic models to obtain reliable parameter estimates a calibration period of about 15 years can provide a relatively fair comparison of the lstm network and the hydrologic models a large amount of data demand seems to be the major limitation hindering the application of the lstm network in a changing climate regional calibration of the lstm network provides a potential solution to reduce the data demand of the model for an individual basin kratzert et al 2019b in which the lstm network is calibrated simultaneously in many catchments of a region instead of being calibrated separately in each basin this calibration strategy is expected to enhance the robustness of the lstm network when limited runoff observations are

maximum and minimum temperature and tb is the threshold temperature for snowmelt c daily model evaluation criteria the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and bias were used to evaluate the model performance which are expressed as a3 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 a4 bias i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i 1 100 where q sim and q obs are the simulated and observed runoff mm daily respectively n is the days of the runoff time series and q obs is the arithmetic mean of the observed runoff mm daily the model performance is considered perfect when the nse approaches 1 0 and when the bias is close to zero a positive value of bias indicates that simulations are overall overestimated than observations and vice versa 
5009,hydrologic models are commonly used to assess climate change impact on water resources several studies have reported that hydrologic models often experience severe performance degradation under climatic conditions different from calibration periods with the advancement of artificial intelligence technology the long short term memory lstm network has recently shown great potentials in rainfall runoff modeling however little is known about the robustness of the lstm network when used in changing climatic conditions in this study we compare the robustness of the lstm network and two conceptual hydrologic models in runoff prediction in changing climatic conditions in 278 model parameter estimation experiment mopex basins for calibration periods the two hydrologic models have better performance in wet periods than in dry periods while the lstm network shows little performance difference under different climatic conditions for validation periods the three models suffer the largest performance loss when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period the performance losses of the lstm network are primarily affected by the climate contrast between calibration and validation periods while the performance losses of the two hydrologic models are mainly dependent on the climatic condition of validation periods we also find that the length of the calibration period is an important factor affecting the relative performance of the models increasing the length of the calibration period has little effect on the validation performance of the two hydrologic models but enhances the lstm network s performance if sufficient calibration data is available the lstm network is a preferred tool for runoff simulation on the other hand the hydrologic models could have more advantages over the lstm network in case of limited calibration data available keywords hydrologic models machine learning runoff simulation lstm 1 introduction the earth s climate system is experiencing dramatic changes characterized by warming which profoundly impacts the terrestrial water cycle and water availability bronstert et al 2002 hydrologic models are typically used to assess the impacts of climate change on water availability such assessments usually follow four key steps i calibrating hydrologic models based on historical observations ii using general circulation models gcms outputs to project future climate under different emission scenarios of greenhouse gas iii downscaling and bias correcting the gcms outputs iv using hydrologic models forced by the gcms outputs to project runoff response coron et al 2012 seiller et al 2012 broderick et al 2016 an underlying assumption is that a well calibrated model can also perform well under future climatic conditions goderniaux et al 2009 fowler et al 2016 however this assumption has been increasingly questioned in a changing climate vaze et al 2010 saft et al 2016 increasing evidence indicated that the robustness of hydrologic models decreases under climatic conditions different from calibration periods coron et al 2012 thirel et al 2015 fowler et al 2016 one of the reasons is that model parameters are dependent on the climatic condition during the calibration period merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 it raises the concern that models calibrated using historical data may become unreliable in projecting future runoff regimes due to climate difference between history and future however this potential uncertainty was often neglected in assessing climate change impacts on water resources leading to the uncertainty in future runoff projections being underestimated wilby and harris 2006 barron et al 2012 verzano et al 2012 hydrologists have recognized that the model robustness is relevant to climate difference between calibration and validation periods klemeš 1986 gan and burges 1990 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 several studies have called for rigorous testing of the model robustness before applying hydrologic models to assess climate change impacts milly et al 2008 saft et al 2016 dakhlaoui et al 2017 guo et al 2018 however it is not feasible to test the model robustness under projected climatic conditions directly as future observations are not available researchers used another solution to this issue testing the model robustness in historical periods thirel et al 2015 broderick et al 2016 fowler et al 2016 if a model is robust under contrasting climatic conditions in historical periods the model is expected to provide reasonable runoff projections in the future this model evaluation scheme was first proposed by klemeš 1986 and called the differential split sample testing dsst the dsst provides a simple and effective method to screen robust models for assessing climate change impacts there are some potential strategies to improve model robustness in a changing climate the first approach is to use sufficiently long data to calibrate the model however the data length used for calibration is not the longer the better lidén and harlin 2000 boughton 2007 luo et al 2012 the minimum data required for calibration depends on multiple factors including catchment characteristics model types and research purposes anctil et al 2004 van der spek and bakker 2017 the second approach is to use the multi model ensemble averaging to reduce the prediction uncertainty of a single model the core step of this method is assigning a weight to the output of each model according to their relative performance broderick et al 2016 this method takes advantage of individual parameter sets which was reported to outperform most single parameter sets in runoff prediction broderick et al 2016 huang et al 2016 although the multi model ensemble average may be superior to most individual models it is usually worse than the best individual model broderick et al 2016 the third approach is to improve the objective function used for calibration for example commonly used objective functions such as the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 are sensitive to high flows pushpalatha et al 2012 fowler et al 2018 tian et al 2018 giving more weight to mid low flows in the objective function can improve low flow prediction fowler et al 2018 however each objective function has its focus either the overall water balance or a specific flow range low intermediate or high flows there is no consensus on the choice of the objective function for projecting runoff in a changing climate the choice of the objective function depends primarily on the research purpose overall the above three methods are not universal strategies to improve model robustness under contrasting climatic conditions with the advances in artificial intelligence machine learning ml models have attracted increasing attention in the hydrologic community and have been widely used for predicting runoff on the basin scale shortridge et al 2016 kratzert et al 2018 huntingford et al 2019 one advantage of ml models over traditional hydrologic models is that they can quickly and accurately capture complicated relationships between inputs and outputs from a large amount of training data without requiring knowledge of internal physical processes that control rainfall runoff transformation additionally ml models are more flexible in model inputs and generally take less time in model calibration training hereafter collectively called calibration than traditional hydrologic models however no evidence indicates that ml models always perform better than hydrologic models in runoff prediction anctil et al 2004 shortridge et al 2016 kratzert et al 2018 the relative performance of the two types of models depends on multiple factors including the model selected shortridge et al 2016 the length of the calibration period anctil et al 2004 toth and brath 2007 and runoff characteristics e g high flow and low flow daliakopoulos and tsanis 2016 ml models have multiple variants such as the support vector machine networks the convolutional neural networks and the recurrent neural networks rnns among them rnns maintain past information with feedback on both time delayed inputs and outputs and have been widely used for rainfall runoff modeling yang et al 2019 jiang et al 2020 the long short term memory lstm network is one of the state of the art architecture types of rnns which overcomes the limited memory capacity of traditional rnns and can learn long term dependencies between input and output variables hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 this feature of the lstm network is desirable for modeling hydrologic processes that often exhibit long term lag responses such as the snowmelt runoff baseflow and groundwater recharge fang et al 2017 showed that the lstm could efficiently reproduce the satellite retrieved soil moisture dynamics with superior performance than the statistical models zhang et al 2018 found that the lstm performs better than a traditional neural network without explicit cell memory in predicting groundwater dynamics in agricultural areas kratzert et al 2018 confirmed that the lstm outperforms the conceptual hydrological model in daily streamflow simulations in 241 us catchments although the lstm network has shown great potentials in rainfall runoff modeling few studies have focused on the model robustness in climatic conditions beyond the calibration period three questions urgently need to be addressed 1 what are the similarities and differences in the robustness between the lstm and traditional hydrologic models in response to climate change 2 which climate change scenario causes greater performance degradation to the lstm network than other scenarios 3 does the lstm network outperform conceptual hydrologic models under contrasting climatic conditions to answer these questions we applied the dsst to test the robustness of the lstm network and two conceptual hydrologic models under different climatic conditions in 278 model parameter estimation experiment mopex basins to the best of our knowledge this work is the first attempt to compare the lstm network and conceptual hydrologic models in terms of their robustness under different climatic conditions the findings of this work can provide useful guidance for model selection and evaluation in a changing climate 2 data and research methodology 2 1 test catchments and data the us mopex data set is used to compare the robustness of the three models under different climatic conditions the data set provides basin averaged hydro meteorological records for about 400 basins with limited anthropogenic perturbation duan et al 2006 schaake et al 2006 here we exclude the basins with data gaps of more than five years a total of 278 basins are selected for this study fig 1 a covering diverse climate and landscape conditions according to the budyko framework 79 5 of basins are classified as energy limited basins and the remaining basins as water limited basins fig 1b the catchment area ranges from 135 to 10 329 km2 with a median size of 2358 km2 each basin contains at least 50 years of data including daily precipitation runoff maximum and minimum temperature as well as pet estimates based on long term pan evaporation observations schaake et al 2006 the restriction of data length is to ensure that the data can be split into multiple independent subperiods with contrasting or similar climatic conditions see section 2 4 2 2 the long short term memory lstm network one deficiency of traditional rnns in simulating runoff is the limited memory capacity the memory capacity of traditional rnns is usually less than ten time steps bengio et al 1994 this means that we can only use forcing data from the past ten days to simulate runoff for the next day ten days may be too short for runoff simulation given that the lag time of runoff in response to precipitation may last for several months millares et al 2009 to overcome the issue of the vanishing gradients in traditional rnns the lstm was proposed by hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 which can learn long term dependencies between inputs and outputs the lstm network is comprised of a set of recurrently connected memory blocks and each memory block contains a cell state input gate output gate forget gate as well as the hidden state fig 2 the cell state is served as the memory of the system the three gates allow the network to selectively retain important information from the past while ignoring irrelevant information specifically the input gate controls the extent to which a new input flows into the cell the forget gate determines how much the former state is retained in the cell and the output gate determines how much of the memory is used to compute the output kratzert et al 2018 the specific mathematical expressions of the lstm network can refer to hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and kratzert et al 2019a the lstm network includes two types of parameters the first type is the trainable parameters which are the weights of a neural network and optimized by the algorithm during training the number of trainable parameters in the lstm network is not constant and depends on the sizes of inputs and outputs reimers and gurevych 2017 the number of trainable parameters of the lstm network is often much greater than that of the traditional hydrological models which can be huge even for small size training data the second type is the hyperparameters which are essentially a network configuration scheme and need to be set before training the network it is widely accepted that hyperparameters are essential for model predictive accuracy but there is no general theory on how to configure them reimers and gurevych 2017 kratzert et al 2018 here we employ the deep learning toolbox in matlab to build the lstm network therefore most hyperparameters directly use the default values in the toolbox the remaining hyperparameters refer to published literature to reduce the risk of overfitting which are as follows the dropout rate 0 40 kratzert et al 2019b maxepochs 250 ravindra 2018 numhiddenunits 128 fan et al 2020 and minibatchsize 32 choi et al 2018 the lstm network runs at a daily step and the forcing data include precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet maximum temperature and minimum temperature 2 3 two conceptual hydrologic models most studies tend to use conceptual hydrologic models to assess the impact of climate change on water resources because they require less input data and computing time than physically based models seiller et al 2012 bai et al 2015 2018 fowler et al 2016 saft et al 2016 here two conceptual hydrologic models were used fig 3 namely the simhyd model and the gr4j model the two models have been successfully used to simulate daily runoff under a wide range of climatic conditions post et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 li et al 2014 guo et al 2016 the simhyd model describes the rainfall runoff transformation in detail with conceptual equations and balances the model complexity and performance well chiew et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 the model contains four stores for interception loss soil moisture groundwater and routing process fig 3a evapotranspiration excluding the interception evaporation is estimated as a function of pet and the relative soil moisture store soil moisture store divided by soil moisture store capacity the total runoff is generated from three sources surface runoff interflow and baseflow which is routed to the catchment outlet with the muskingum cunge method cunge 1969 more details about the simhyd model can be found in chiew et al 2002 unlike the simhyd model the gr4j model focuses only on the representation of key hydrologic processes perrin et al 2003 so it has a parsimonious model structure and contains only four parameters fig 3b the structure of the gr4j model is primarily composed of three parts a runoff generation module a groundwater exchange module and a linear routing module the runoff generation module determines the water quantity reaching the routing part of the model this part of water is then partitioned into two components using a fixed split 90 of the water slowly supplements the routing store and is eventually released to catchment outlet and the remaining 10 of the water is directly routed to catchment outlet more information on the gr4j model can be found in perrin et al 2003 considering the importance of snow in the water balance at high altitude and high elevation areas a simple snow module based on a degree day approach is coupled into the simhyd model and the gr4j model fig 3 the snow module contains two free parameters and requires daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature as inputs the snow module first determines the fraction of precipitation partitioning into rainfall and snow based on daily maximum and minimum temperature valéry et al 2014 see appendix the daily snowmelt amount is then estimated by a simple degree day method in which snowmelt occurs only when the average daily temperature exceeds a certain threshold see appendix the snowmelt leaving the snow store infiltrates into the soil layer and participates in the subsequent hydrologic processes the two hydrologic models coupled with the snow module are hereafter called the simhyd snow model and the gr4j snow model respectively and they have the same model inputs as the lstm network the number of parameters for simhyd snow and gr4j snow models are 11 and 6 respectively a global optimization algorithm namely the genetic algorithm wang 1991 is used to calibrate the parameters for the two models root mean square error rmse is used as the objective function to keep consistent with the calibration objective of the lstm network the two evaluation criteria used to quantify the accuracy of runoff simulations are nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and bias respectively see appendix 2 4 the differential split sample testing dsst we apply the dsst to generate different climatic conditions for calibration and validation and then evaluate the robustness of the models under different climatic conditions specifically the dsst consists of a series of calibration validation tests on subperiods with similar or contrasting climatic conditions first the available climate time series of each catchment is split into four subperiods with similar or contrasting climatic conditions two wet periods and two dry periods based on a five year moving average of aridity index fig 4 a then the three models are calibrated in a specific subperiod and validated in the other two subperiods fig 4b a one year warmup is used for each calibration each model has eight calibration validation tests on a catchment the eight tests can be classified as dry dry dry wet wet dry and wet wet according to the change in climatic condition from calibration to validation hereafter the groups of dry wet and wet dry are called the climate contrasted tests and the other two are called the climate similar tests the difference in model efficiency between calibration and validation periods under climate similar tests primarily reflects the influence of model related uncertainties e g inputs structure and calibration on validation results the difference between climate similar and climate contrasted tests mainly represents the effect of climate change on validation results we identify the four climatically similar or contrasting subperiods based on a five year moving average of aridity index the lowest and highest values of the five year moving average time series of aridity index are selected as the driest dry1 and wettest wet1 subperiods respectively the second driest wettest subperiods dry2 and wet2 are identified following the same approach there is no overlap between the four subperiods we acknowledge that the dry periods identified by this method may contain some relatively wet years and vice versa however it is not easy to find five consecutive dry or wet years from historical climate records the aridity index used here is defined as the ratio of annual pet to annual precipitation this index is selected because it takes into account two key factors affecting the climatic condition of a catchment water availability precipitation and energy availability pet the choice of five years as calibration period is because this data length considers a trade off between i the difference in climatic conditions represented by subsets and ii the rationality of the calibrated parameters anctil et al 2004 coron et al 2012 a five year calibration period is usually sufficient for hydrologic models to obtain reliable parameter estimates lidén and harlin 2000 li et al 2010 luo et al 2012 a longer calibration period in turn would reduce the contrast in climatic conditions between subsets 2 5 using different sizes of calibration data to test model performance under changing climatic conditions for conceptual hydrologic models extending the calibration period does not guarantee better predictions when the length of the calibration period exceeds a certain threshold harlin 1991 li et al 2010 luo et al 2012 however a longer calibration period may be beneficial for ml models to achieve a better simulation huntingford et al 2019 here a model experiment is designed to investigate the effect of the length of calibration period on the performance of the three models see fig 5 in this experiment the three models are calibrated with subsets of 5 10 15 and 20 years but validated on dry1 period i e the driest period and wet1 period i e the wettest period for each basin the four calibration subsets overlap each other and are extracted from the longest data time series other than dry1 and wet1 this model experiment focuses on the influence of the length of the calibration period on model performance while it places less emphasis on the climate contrasting between calibration and validation periods 3 results 3 1 calibration results we first provide an overview of calibration performance under different climatic conditions to assess the quality of the calibrated parameter sets fig 6 shows the model performance nse and bias using a five year calibration period in the 278 basins the results indicate that the three models are well calibrated under both dry and wet conditions the median nse values of the three models range from 0 65 minimum for the gr4j snow in the dry2 period to 0 82 maximum for the lstm in the wet2 period fig 6a and the median bias values of the three models are all in the range of 5 to 10 fig 6b results also indicate that the two hydrologic models are better calibrated in wet periods than in dry periods reflected by a smaller interquartile range the higher values of nse and the lower values of bias in wet periods than in dry periods the lstm network however presents little performance difference under different climatic conditions the median nse values for the lstm network in the four calibration periods dry1 dry2 wet1 and wet2 are 0 81 0 80 0 80 and 0 82 respectively 3 2 the effect of changing climatic conditions from calibration to validation on model robustness compared to the calibration results the validation results can better reflect the actual predictive skill of a model fig 7 presents the validation nse statistics and the change in nse δnse from calibration periods to validation periods under different calibration validation tests in general the performances of the three models in validation periods are poorer than those in calibration periods the magnitude of performance loss depends on the models and the climate contrast between calibration and validation periods the three models suffer the largest performance loss when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period that is the wet dry test and the smallest performance loss when calibrated in a wet and validated in a wet period that is the wet wet test the performance losses of the hydrologic models from calibration to validation are different from those of the lstm network for the two hydrologic models their performance losses are mainly dependent on the validation climate fig 7a more performance losses occur when the two models are validated in a dry period the tests of dry dry and wet dry even under the climate similar test the dry dry test by contrast the performance losses of the lstm network are primarily affected by the climate contrast between calibration and validation periods the performance losses of the lstm network under the climate contrasted tests i e the dry wet test and the wet dry test are greater than those under the climate similar tests i e the dry dry test and the wet wet test 3 3 the effect of changing climatic conditions from calibration to validation on volume errors fig 8 illustrates the bias statistics in the calibration and validation periods for the three models the three models consistently show that the bias during validation depends on the bias in calibration and the type of calibration validation tests under the climate similar tests the calibration bias can be amplified and propagated to validation periods if the mean runoff is overestimated a positive bias in calibration periods a larger bias and interquartile ranges can be expected in validation periods see fig 8a similarly the mean runoff in validation periods would be further underestimated a negative bias when an underestimation occurs in calibration periods see fig 8b the comparison of the bias between climate similar and climate contrasted tests reflects the influence of climate change on validation bias there are two opposite changes in bias from calibration to validation under climate contrasted tests the calibration bias in a dry period would be attenuated when models are validated in a wet period i e the dry wet test the calibration bias in a wet period would be amplified when models are validated in a dry period i e the wet dry test in other words if the calibration bias is assumed to be zero calibration under a wetter drier climate than the validation period would lead to an overestimation underestimation of the mean runoff 3 4 the effect of extending the calibration period on model performance under contrasting climatic conditions here we investigate whether extending the calibration period can improve model performance under different climatic conditions fig 9 summarizes the validation nse values in the dry1 and wet1 periods using the calibration periods of 5 10 15 and 20 years the results show that extending the calibration period enhances the validation performance of the lstm network but has little effect on the overall performance of the two hydrologic models when the calibration period increases from 5 to 20 years the median nse for the lstm network increases by 0 08 from 0 54 to 0 62 during the dry1 period and by 0 12 from 0 60 to 0 72 during the wet1 period in contrast the longer calibration period brings limited improvement for the validation performance of the two hydrologic models no more than 0 02 for median nse overall a calibration period of about 15 years can provide a relatively fair comparison of the lstm network and the two hydrologic models the lstm network is inferior to the simhyd snow model in validation periods when calibrated in a five year period however it achieves comparable in the dry period or even better performance in the wet period than the simhyd snow model when the calibration period increases to 15 or 20 years additionally the model improvement effect produced by each additional five year calibration period gradually decreases for the lstm network this means that the predictive skill of the lstm network also has a ceiling effect similar to the hydrologic models more training data cannot further improve the model s predictive skill when the amount of calibration data exceeds a certain threshold 4 discussions 4 1 assessment results and limitations in this study we compared the robustness of the lstm network and two hydrologic models under different climatic conditions the comparison was performed in a large number of test catchments to draw more general conclusions we found that the lstm network s performance is more sensitive to climate change from calibration to validation than that of the two hydrologic models the greatest performance degradation for the three models occurs when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period the wet dry test we also found that the lstm network needs more training data than hydrologic models to obtain better parameter estimates this conclusion corroborates the finding of anctil et al 2004 and toth and brath 2007 who highlighted the importance of the sizes of calibration data on the relative performance of neural network models and hydrologic models if there are sufficient hydro meteorological data available for calibration the lstm network is a good tool for rainfall runoff modeling in a changing climate otherwise we prefer to recommend the use of hydrologic models with a sophisticated structure moreover like hydrologic models the runoff predictive skill of the lstm network also has a ceiling effect see fig 9c a similar conclusion has also been reported by boulmaiz et al 2020 this may be due to the following two reasons first additional data beyond a certain size of training data contains limited useful information for model improvement second the lstm network reaches the limit of learning ability and cannot further utilize useful information from additional training data the conclusions about the robustness of hydrologic models under different climatic conditions are overall in line with previous findings vaze et al 2010 coron et al 2012 guo et al 2018 stephens et al 2019 we found that the two hydrologic models experience more performance degradation when applied in a drier period similar conclusions have also been drawn by previous studies such as vaze et al 2010 li et al 2012 and stephens et al 2019 there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon 1 the rainfall runoff relationships at the basin scale are prone to change in dry periods saft et al 2016 2 hydrologic models become very sensitive to errors in model inputs in a dry period due to a low runoff coefficient li et al 2012 furthermore if the effect of calibration bias is not considered the hydrologic models would overestimate mean runoff when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period the wet dry test and underestimate mean runoff when calibrated in a dry period and validated in a wet period the dry wet test this conclusion is generally applicable to all regions of the world and not limited to model types merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 fowler et al 2018 this reminds us that it is necessary to consider the potential biases caused by climate change in future water resources projection there are several potential limitations in the evaluation results first the choice of climate classification method may affect the assessment results many climate variables can be used to classify the climate as dry or wet subperiods including precipitation and the combinations of precipitation and other climate variables e g temperature and pet li et al 2011 coron et al 2012 stephens et al 2019 long et al 2020 the rationality of the climate classification method used here needs further verification second the lstm network needs to set several hyperparameters prior to training the network in this work we used the default values of the matlab toolbox or recommended values by previous work to set the hyperparameters the values of hyperparameters are certainly not optimal which may affect the performance of the lstm network to a certain extent third long term climate change usually causes changes in landscape factors e g vegetation coverage however the models used in this study do not include the impact of changes in landscape factors on runoff simulation 4 2 a potential strategy to improve model robustness in a changing climate as mentioned in the introduction researchers have attempted to use different methods to improve the robustness of hydrologic models under contrasting climatic conditions however these methods are not always effective and in some cases they may also lead to negative effects as shown in fig 9 runoff prediction skills of the two hydrologic models exhibit a ceiling effect in response to the extended calibration period this means that increasing the calibration data is effective only when minimum calibration data required by a model is not reached a too long calibration period has little effect on improving the model robustness which in turn reduces the computational efficiency of a model a general method to improve model robustness under contrasting climates is dynamically selecting the optimal parameter set according to the climatic condition of the validation period as suggested by li et al 2012 and lan et al 2020 if a model is intended to predict runoff for a wet dry climate scenario then the parameter set calibrated from a historical wet dry period should be used at the operational level we first need to construct a library of optimum parameter sets representing different climatic conditions via sub period model calibration the optimal parameter set is then selected from the library based on the principle of the highest similarity of climatic conditions between validation and calibration periods this method has been proven to be effective for parameter estimates in a changing climate perrin et al 2008 han and kim 2017 lan et al 2020 the rationality of this method is that it makes full use of the dependence of the optimal parameter set on the climatic condition of the calibration period the library of the optimal parameter sets can reflect the dynamic behavior of parameter sets under changing climatic conditions more importantly this method is a universal method for improving model robustness under contrasting climates and not limited by the type of the model or the catchment climate note that some studies tried to link changes in model parameters with changes in climate characteristics of the catchment li et al 2012 stephens et al 2019 thereby estimating model parameters in a changing climate however the calibrated model parameters generally lose their original physical meaning due to the equifinality beven and freer 2001 they function as a whole a parameter set in hydrologic models to describe the rainfall runoff relationship on the basin scale wagener and kollat 2007 lan et al 2020 as a result there is usually no significant statistical relationship between changes in individual parameters and changes in climate characteristics of the catchment thirel et al 2015 dakhlaoui et al 2017 guo et al 2020 5 conclusions the lstm network is increasingly used in hydrologic research due to its powerful predictive capacity however little is known about its robustness when used under climatic conditions beyond the calibration period in this work we compared the robustness of the lstm network and two hydrologic models under different climatic conditions in 278 mopex catchments the main conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the three models experience the largest performance loss when calibrated in a wet period and validated in a dry period 2 the lstm network s performance degrades more under contrasting climatic conditions than under similar climatic conditions while the two hydrologic models are more unstable when validated in a dry period 3 the lstm network requires more calibration data than the two hydrologic models to obtain reliable parameter estimates a calibration period of about 15 years can provide a relatively fair comparison of the lstm network and the hydrologic models a large amount of data demand seems to be the major limitation hindering the application of the lstm network in a changing climate regional calibration of the lstm network provides a potential solution to reduce the data demand of the model for an individual basin kratzert et al 2019b in which the lstm network is calibrated simultaneously in many catchments of a region instead of being calibrated separately in each basin this calibration strategy is expected to enhance the robustness of the lstm network when limited runoff observations are

performance which are expressed as a3 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 a4 bias i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i 1 100 where q sim and q obs are the simulated and observed runoff mm daily respectively n is the days of the runoff time series and q obs is the arithmetic mean of the observed runoff mm daily the model performance is considered perfect when the nse approaches 1 0 and when the bias is close to zero a positive value of bias indicates that simulations are overall overestimated than observations and vice versa
