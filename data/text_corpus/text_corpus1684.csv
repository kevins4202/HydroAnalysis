8420,study region madeira island portugal a small island of the north atlantic ocean study focus droughts from january 1937 to december 2016 were studied using monthly rainfall at 41 rain gauges covering most of the island the gaps of the original rainfall data were filled by multiple imputation by chained equations mice the drought conditions were assessed by means of the standardized precipitation index spi specifically the spi6 to study the drought variability some clustering techniques and principal components analysis pca were applied to the spi field new hydrological insights for the region three homogeneous regions northern slope southern slope and central region each of them with different temporal climatic variability may be identified furthermore for each region the droughts were characterized in terms of magnitude and duration and based on a kernel occurrence rate estimator kore as well as on frequency of the drought periods finally two climatic drivers namely the el niño southern oscillation enso and the north atlantic oscillation nao were teleconnected to the drought variability at the identified homogeneous regions for the period under study it was not possible to establish a clear relationship between enso nao and drought occurrence nevertheless the results showed that the spatio temporal drought variability in madeira island has been subjected to noticeable changes in recent years 2001 2016 with a considerable higher number of periods under drought conditions than in the past keywords drought standardized precipitation index spi mice principal components analysis pca occurrence rate el niño southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao 1 introduction droughts as natural phenomena are part of earth s climate and occur virtually in all climatic zones with neither warning nor recognition of administrative borders or of political and economic differences droughts can be perceived as prolonged and regionally extensive occurrences of below average natural water availability tallaksen and van lanen 2004 either in the form of rainfall river runoff or groundwater they are typically classified into meteorological agricultural hydrological ground water stream flow and socio economic drought lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 unlike other natural weather disasters droughts start unnoticeably develop cumulatively produce snowballing impacts and by the time damages are visible it is too late to mitigate their consequences understanding the characteristics and consequences of droughts as well as modelling and forecasting their occurrences are major issues for a successful water policy especially in regions more prone to extreme hydrological events these issues become even more important under the climatic change perspectives indeed despite the low confidence in observed global scale trends in droughts due to the lack of direct observations their magnitude and frequency are likely to increase the same applies to other extreme hydrological events parry et al 2007 barros et al 2014 as stated by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in its periodical assessment reports mccarthy et al 2001 parry et al 2007 barros et al 2014 island environments are specifically more vulnerable and often affected by extreme hydrological events i e floods and droughts and climate change compared to continental areas especially in small islands meaning those islands with areas between 100 km2 and 5000 km2 falkland et al 1991 they have particular physical demographic usually with a high concentration of population and economic features along with hydrological and water resources development and management problems that distinguish them from larger islands or continental areas in recent times prolonged and more severe droughts have increased islands vulnerability mcgree et al 2016 these prolonged periods of suppressed rainfall together with their persistence and intensity have raised the public and the political awareness to the many associated socio economic impacts on water management and the need for drought mitigation measures in fact droughts are very particular problems in small islands e g some of the australian islands in the pacific but also the cook islands the federated states of micronesia the republic of the marshall islands new zealand papua new guinea pitcairn islands samoa solomon islands mcgree et al 2016 the azores and the madeira archipelagos and the canary islands falkland et al 1991 because of their relative fragile freshwater sources that can be depleted when precipitation drops down leading in many cases to groundwater and aquifer overexploitation and often causing serious losses in productivity of agriculture electricity health among other impacts barnett 2011 in spite of their recurrent nature particularly in regions with pronounced hydrological temporal variability droughts are among the most complex and simultaneously the least understood extreme hydrological events tallaksen and van lanen 2004 and have been lagging behind the development of flood related research thus there is an urgent need to address the emerging issues on drought research and management as a first step for water resources management aiming at preventing and mitigating the consequences of the future occurrences rossi 2000 according to stahl et al 2012 this knowledge can be used as a basis for a better understanding of drought vulnerability in different climates for this purpose throughout the 20th century several indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 were developed to evaluate the water deficit in relation to some average amount for a certain period of time heim 2002 the pdsi uses precipitation and temperature data in a water balance model to compare the meteorological and hydrological drought across space and time whereas the spi only considers precipitation as state variable indices based on different climatic and hydrological variables may exhibit different regional and temporal patterns i e results vary depending on the drought index and on the timescale considered there are no generally applicable drought assessment methods for small island environments owing to the diversity of conditions examples are madeira island with notable differences in rainfall between north and south porto santo also belonging to madeira archipelago with some signs of aridity and relatively low rainfall liberato et al 2017 the azores archipelago with very wet high regions and drier coastal areas santos et al 2004 anguilla in the caribbean with a tropical climate ameliorated by marine influences notably the trade winds parr and rogers 2002 the islands of antigua and barbuda with a great variation in mean annual rainfall from year to year mcmillan 1985 the islands of bermuda with precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year and more intense in summer than in winter rowe 1984 mauritius situated in the southwest part of the indian ocean with a rainfall regime subject to large regional variation and two marked seasons ramjeawon 1994 and the canary islands archipelago which are placed in a dry belt so rainfall is very low near the coast and in flat islands falkland et al 1991 due to this great diversity of conditions in small islands characterization methods taken directly from continental territory applications may be only crude or even irrelevant approaches to identify and characterize extreme hydrological events such as droughts for instance indices like the national rainfall index nri defined as the national average of the total annual precipitation weighted by its long term average are more commonly used for agricultural drought recognition gommes and petrassi 1996 in larger areas e g an entire country making them unsuitable to address droughts affecting smaller areas or of a different type meteorological and hydrological droughts therefore specific methods or indices to characterize drought should be applied or adapted for small islands which additionally are often subject to data availability constraints thus consideration of each islands peculiarities must be taken into account when applying them given the large spatial character of droughts different authors have recommended that they should be studied within a regional context tallaksen 2000 because the results of individual case studies may be incomparable demuth et al 2001 consequently the selected index should be standardized for the purpose of making the drought analyses results comparable regardless of the studied region lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 this is the most important characteristic of the spi at a given location the spi measures rainfall anomalies based on a comparison of observed rainfall amounts for an accumulation period of interest usually 1 3 6 12 month with the long term historic rainfall record for that period the historic record is fitted to a probability distribution which is then transformed into a standard normal distribution such that the mean spi value for that location and period is zero svoboda et al 2012 according to lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 the spi is one of the most commonly used multi scalar indices in europe to monitor all types of drought it is also recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 2017 and is likely to be the most frequently used drought indicator worldwide because the spi is applicable in all climate regimes vicente serrano 2005a 2006 santos et al 2010 furthermore by using standardized anomalies a reliable and simple comparison of historical and current droughts among different rainfall regimes and geographic locations is also feasible moreira et al 2012 for many analytical purposes related to climate variability like the analysis of drought patterns it is convenient to divide the spatial continuum e g of spi into a manageable number of homogeneous areas otherwise such analysis may be difficult when data from several monitoring stations are used preisendorfer and mobley 1988 the clustering techniques such as hierarchical and non hierarchical clustering and the principal component analysis pca may help to disclose high level regularities that enable the generalization about areas based on a spatially and temporally varying parameter these techniques have been widely used in climatic regionalization briggs and lemin 1992 corte real et al 1998 unal et al 2003 many authors e g bonaccorso et al 2003 vicente serrano 2006 santos et al 2010 raziei et al 2015 have applied the pca to the spi for analyzing the spatial and temporal variability of droughts moreover in recent years some authors have attributed the drought variability to natural climate variability meze hausken 2004 espinoza et al 2011 gutzler and robbins 2011 specifically the el niño and the la niña phases known as the el niño southern oscillation enso signal across the equatorial pacific ocean are widely recognized as major ocean atmosphere climatic drivers causing in some cases rainfall variability and hydrological variable anomalies on a global scale mainly in the tropics of the pacific coast of america vicente serrano 2005a wikarmpapraharn et al 2010 explored the enso and drought variability relationships using the southern oscillation index soi and the spi time series from four representative rain gauges in the central plain of thailand finding that the spi series for accumulation periods of 1 2 3 and 4 month are strongly correlated with the enso strength and phases this suggests that apparently enso controls rainfall variability in that region nevertheless the possible relationship between enso and drought events analyzed by using different indices like spi pdsi and soi remains uncertain another dominant pattern of interannual climate variability is the north atlantic oscillation nao in the northern hemisphere extratropics hurrell 1995 which is one of the most prominent teleconnection patterns in all seasons barnston and livezey 1987 this climatic driver consists of a north south dipole of anomalies with one of its centers located over greenland and the other one of opposite sign spanning the central latitudes of the north atlantic 35 n to 40 n in general terms the nao influences changes in the temperature and precipitation from eastern north america to western and central noaa 2012 different authors have acknowledged that the nao is largely responsible for the periods of drought in europe e g lópez moreno and vicente serrano 2008 vicente serrano et al 2011 mares et al 2002 in the current study the spi was applied to rainfall records from january 1937 to december 2016 aiming at analyzing droughts from moderate to extreme according to agnew 2000 in madeira island by clustering rain gauges and decomposing their corresponding spi time series into principal components to identify homogeneous regions regarding temporal drought patterns madeira is a small portuguese island of the north atlantic na which belongs to the autonomous region of madeira ram in the european part of macaronesia this work was motivated by the following issues 1 the poor quality of the original rainfall data in madeira island short series and numerous gaps is not compatible with a comprehensive drought characterization despite the fragility of the island to rainfall shortness to address this issue a gap filling procedure was implemented resulting in long daily rainfall series 80 years from january 1937 to december 2016 in 41 rain gauges table 1 which allowed a novel and detailed spatio temporal characterization of the droughts over the whole island 2 furthermore in many mountainous small islands like madeira fig 1 the exact rainfall distribution is strongly dependent on the complex topography and the prevailing winds gouveia reis et al 2016 which still makes the estimation of extreme hydrological events highly uncertain issues in water resources management therefore identifying homogeneous regions may be essential for a more comprehensive assessment of those events regarding their spatial extent magnitude and frequency 3 because of its reduced area madeira island has little visibility at a global scale this may justify the absence of regional studies on droughts as those done for the continental portuguese territory e g santos et al 2010 moreira et al 1993 there are some studies covering relatively short periods or well recognized drought events such as the exceptionally extreme drought that affected madeira during the 2011 2012 hydrological year liberato et al 2017 however none of them provides a comprehensive overview of drought events that occurred in the last decades 4 although enso is commonly linked to climate patterns over the tropical pacific it has been proven that it can also affect other regions such as the northern europe that underwent a severe precipitation deficit during the medieval climate anomaly which was synchronous with droughts in various enso sensitive regions worldwide helama et al 2009 because the effects of enso on the small islands of the north atlantic region are less understood li and lau 2012 a comparison was performed between the phases of soi and drought periods identified based on the spi in addition the dominant periods of the cumulative soi and the mathematical description of the nao i e the nao index naoi were related to some characteristics of the droughts in the island the paper is organized as follows in section 2 there is a brief description of madeira island its climate hydrology and the main freshwater resources section 3 provides information on the available rainfall data and on the models utilized section 4 shows the main results and discussion obtained from the pca applied to the spi on a 6 month timescale and from the relationship between climatic drivers and drought events in section 5 the conclusions are given 2 study area madeira is the largest island of the madeira archipelago it has an area of 741 km2 a length of 57 km and a largest width of 22 km centered at 32 44 34 n and 16 57 91 w madeira has a steep topography and is completely formed by the volcanic materials consisting of an enormous central e w oriented mountainous ridge pico ruivo 1862 m a s l and pico do areeiro 1818 m a s l and paúl da serra region above 1400 m a s l cut by deep valleys fig 1 according to the koppen s classification the climate is predominantly temperate with dry and warm summers and temperate with hot and dry summer in the coastal zones of madeira chazarra et al 2011 except for the higher areas where very low temperatures may occur during winter the differences between winter and summer temperatures are generally small due to its e w oriented mountains the precipitation is strongly orographically generated falling predominantly in the north facing slope because of the prevailing n e trade winds liberato et al 2017 the rainfall regime is not only affected by the local circulation but also by synoptic systems typical of mid latitudes such as fronts and extratropical cyclones and the azores anticyclone in the summer season fragoso et al 2012 the rainfall quantity and its high variability with respect to time and space play an important role on the availability of the madeira s freshwater resources regions with smaller amounts of precipitation are more susceptible to the rainfall temporal variability in terms of water availability this is the case of the southern slope of the island compared to the northern one in addition from an orographical perspective the island is also divided by deep valleys into east and west however based on the rainfall regime and the marked elevation differences e g fig 2 there are two distinct regions in madeira namely the northern slope with large amounts of rainfall and the southern slope with less rainfall in madeira island groundwater resources are the main source of freshwater for the 267 785 inhabitants and about 500 000 tourists per year ine 2012 nearly all its population is concentrated in the southern slope e g in the vicinity of the rain gauges m03 m05 m06 m08 m10 m22 m24 m44 m53 fig 1 the groundwater exploitation for domestic and industrial use as well as for irrigation and electrical production purposes is made by means of water galleries tunnels wells and springs and remarkably by an extensive network of small originally stone canals or levadas with more than 1000 km long the levadas whose origin dates back to the first settlements of madeira island in the first quarter of the 15th century mostly border the mountains at elevations from 600 to 1000 m a s l and are classified as an outstanding universal value due to their uniqueness duarte 1998 the groundwater flows from the central region to the coast where the aquifers discharge to the sea prada et al 2005 the main groundwater natural recharge areas are located in the high central parts where the precipitation values and permeability of rocks are higher e g the rain gauges m01 and m02 3

kore and 6 a comparison between the soi and spi time series 3 1 data the daily and sub daily data from 67 rain gauges fig 1 in the reference period of 80 years from january 1937 to december 2016 were made available by the portuguese met office ipma the portuguese institute for sea and atmosphere https www ipma pt which has high data quality standards and is one of the main sources of portuguese hydrological and hydrometeorological data the rain gauges were selected aiming at establishing the continuous daily rainfall series as long as possible the data set thus assembled was highly variable in terms of length of the recording periods missing values and duration of the gap periods fig 3 most of the rain gauges 45 rain gauges had more than 60 of missing daily rainfalls and only 4 rain gauges had less than 10 of missing values from these last rain gauges only three m01 areeiro m05 funchal observatório and m25 santo da serra table 1 had less than 5 of missing values the available data was sometimes redundant and even ill defined with rain gauges located in the same place but covering different periods it should be noted that the studied period refers to 80 civil years from january 1937 to december 2016 3 2 filling of missing data the multiple imputation by chained equations mice algorithm was used for completing the daily rainfall series of the rain gauges with missing values or gaps in the reference period as it was applied in recent years to estimate the missing rainfall data at a daily scale de carvalho et al 2017 in the mice algorithm each missing value is imputed m multiple times through a specified algorithm that uses the observed data of every cell to find a plausible value for the missing cell these algorithms are implemented in the package mice in r and described in more detail in the article by van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2010 the application of the mice algorithm to the rainfall records at madeira island adopted m 30 imputed plausible completed data sets and 50 maximum iterations the imputations are generated according to the default method which is for numerical data predictive mean matching pmm to deal with the missing rainfall data mice and mice refer to the two completed data sets obtained by applying the algorithm respectively 1 to monthly rainfalls computed by accumulating the existing daily records and 2 directly to daily rainfall records that afterwards were accumulated into monthly data to validate these results a few error measures were applied to assess at each rain gauge the differences between the observed data set and the reconstructed data set mice or mice the measures applied were the correlation coefficient the mean absolute error mae the normalized root mean squared error nrmse and the wilcoxon signed rank test randles 1988 which is a non parametric statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether the time series before gap filling and after gap filling have the same empirical distribution 3 3 standardized precipitation index spi the choice of the drought index depends on several aspects such as the objective of the analysis the specific features of the hydrological regime under consideration or the data availability in the study for madeira island the droughts were assessed via the standardized precipitation index spi specifically spi6 the spi is an index based on the probability of occurrence of a certain deviation from an average amount of precipitation and for a given timescale when computing the spi at a timescale of δ month the variable to be analyzed is the monthly precipitation for δ 1 and the cumulative precipitation in periods of δ consecutive month for δ 1 although different timescales were analyzed only the spi6 is mentioned because besides being the recommended timescale when addressing agriculture droughts hayes et al 1999 it can also be associated with the precipitation shortfalls that in some regions begin to affect the streamflows and levels of reservoirs and lakes svoboda et al 2012 in the management of the water resources in madeira precipitation shortfalls for more than a few months are very important due to the island s dependency on precipitation for groundwater recharge to describe the monthly or the cumulative precipitation series the pearson type iii distribution with parameters given by the l moments were applied santos et al 2010 according to the drought category for spi proposed by agnew 2000 only values smaller than u 0 84 were considered moderate or worse droughts the several consecutive time periods with spi values below this threshold belong to the same drought event with duration dd maximum intensity dmi and magnitude dm as defined in fig 4 it is noteworthy that the magnitude and the duration of the drought events are somehow mutually dependent because the longer the duration is the higher the magnitude should be for pooling mutually dependent droughts and for removing minor droughts which have little hydrological importance and may disturb the analysis the moving average procedure van loon et al 2011 fleig et al 2006 tallaksen et al 1997 is applied to the spi6 time series before selecting the droughts events fig 5 lópez moreno et al 2009 and li et al 2013 also used the same technique with a low pass filter of 5 months although for the spi based on discharges and at a longer time scale 12 months wen et al 2011 applied the moving average for spi from 3 to 12 months with running lengths equal to the spi time scale for the spi at different time scales shin et al 2018 pooled the drought events when they reoccurred for at least 2 months and the spi values of inter drought event time were less than zero in the case study of madeira island a filter of 5 months was adopted assuming that the hydrological processes that condition the freshwater availability are not very sensitive to very short and frequent droughts because groundwater is their prime source 3 4 clustering and principal components analysis for the purpose of characterizing the spatio temporal drought patterns in madeira island and obtaining a clearly defined regionalization of drought homogeneous regions cluster analysis coupled with principal components analysis pca were applied to the smoothed spi6 time series these procedures intend to identify homogeneous regions by forming groups of rain gauges with similar temporal pattern of the spi6 series mcgree et al 2016 the cluster analysis relies on the discriminant analysis to check the statistical significance of the formed groups dillan and goldstein 1984 nevertheless this does not ensure that the groups are actually meaningful the objective of this step is to form clusters of rain gauges to have a regionalization of droughts in madeira in case that there is one it is important to mention that the groups identification is very dependent on the particular metric to cluster therefore different metrics were used to get stable clusters i e the rain gauges of a defined cluster do not change positions regardless of the method used the clustering techniques applied were hierarchical clustering the ward s method as amalgamation rule combined with chebyshev manhattan and euclidean distances and non hierarchical clustering like k means these techniques are the most popular techniques for clustering hair et al 1998 king 2015 pca is a statistical procedure commonly used to transform an original set of variables into a different set of uncorrelated variables through linear combinations of these variables aiming mainly at both data and dimensionality reduction hair et al 1998 to isolate the dominant patterns of co variability of the droughts at the selected rain gauges the pca was applied to the spi6 time series the pca provides a natural smoothing of the spi field in terms of a reduced number of dominant patterns of variability or empirical eigenvectors preisendorfer and mobley 1988 the pca consisted firstly by calculating the covariance matrix of the spi6 data with the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors the principal components or pc score time series are given by the projection of the spi6 fields on the orthonormal eigenfunctions rencher 2002 it is noteworthy that the identification of the spatial patterns of spi6 was based on the principal components loadings which represent the correlation or covariance between the spi6 time series at each rain gauge and the corresponding pc score time series considered as regionalized new spi6 series to more precisely locate spatial patterns of drought variability and to improve their interpretation the principal components were rotated rotated principal components rpc using the varimax technique which is frequently used for performing these rotations abdi 2003 3 5 yearly frequency of the droughts the analysis of the changes in the rate or frequency of occurrence of the periods under drought conditions attempts to answer the question regardless the scarcity of water i e the precipitation deficit how the frequency of the occurrence of droughts has changed over time to tackle this question a kernel occurrence rate estimator kore was used according to the stepwise approach applied by silva et al 2012 portela et al 2015 silva 2017 including the generation of pseudodata outside before and after of the observation interval by the straightforward method of reflection for an amplitude of three times the bandwidth the kernel technique is a nonparametric model developed by diggle 1985 for smoothing point process data in its application to the droughts in madeira island it aimed at analyzing how the annual frequency of the periods under drought conditions λ t change over time for that purpose the kore analysis was applied to the times of occurrence of the periods under drought conditions i e with values of the new regionalized spi6 series given by the rpc scores representing moderate or worse droughts u 0 84 to select the bandwidth a straight forward method the silverman s rule of thumb silverman 1986 was adopted silva 2017 to quantify the uncertainties of the results thus achieved the pointwise confidence bands were constructed around λ t by means of bootstrap simulations cowling et al 1996 mudelsee 2011 the kernel occurrence rate estimation method coupled with the bootstrap confidence band construction was first introduced into the analysis of climate extremes by mudelsee et al 2003 with a detailed description given by mudelsee et al 2004 3 6 soi and naoi data although there are several slight variations in the soi and naoi allan et al 1991 hurrell 1995 in this study the standardized tahiti darwin monthly soi and the standardized iceland azores monthly naoi https crudata uea ac uk cru data pci htm fig 6 were used from january 1952 to december 2016 in order to establish a possible relationship between enso nao and drought occurrence in madeira island the 6 month running length of both the soi and naoi were used denoted in this work as soi 6 and naoi 6 respectively for the same period both climatic signals were compared to the spi6 time series at the identified homogeneous regions by means of the pearson correlation coefficient r and cross correlation hair et al 1998 the previous period refers to the one with complete monthly soi and naoi data although madeira island is located at a latitude lower than azores 32 44 n and 37 46 n respectively md and az in fig 6 it was not possible to find a southern station that could better define a naoi in this work i e a station at a latitude lower than the one of madeira island with long enough surface pressure records 4 results and discussion 4 1 filling of missing rainfall data the reconstruction of the long term rainfall time series at the 67 initial rain gauges fig 1 utilized the mice algorithm because of the relative short distance between the rain gauges the correlations among the observed data series are positively high in most cases the data series with 90 or more missing values for 12 rain gauges were directly discarded for the remaining rain gauges the average p and the standard deviation s of the observed monthly data and of the reconstructed monthly data identified as mice or mice according to the time level at which the mice algorithm was applied monthly and daily respectively were at first compared using mae and nrsme error measures with 0 16 5 of error nevertheless no rain gauges were discarded in this step the wilcoxon signed rank test was also applied to the same long term averages with the following null hypothesis the observed data and the reconstructed data are not significantly different i e p value α 0 05 the 14 rain gauges with p value lower than the significance level α 0 05 were discarded at this stage these procedures resulted in a dense set of 41 rain gauges with long term daily rainfall data for madeira island that were continuous and reliable also identified in fig 1 for rabaçal rain gauge originally with 75 of missing daily data fig 7 exemplifies the long term mean p and s of the monthly rainfall before gap filling observed data with gaps and the reconstructed data set smoothed with a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess cleveland 1979 the figure shows that even in a rain gauge with such a significant number of missing daily rainfalls there is a very good correspondence between the statistical characteristics of the observed rainfalls and the estimated rainfalls given by mice after the application of the adopted data quality criteria the final network of complete daily rainfall series mice in a period of 80 years from january 1937 to december 2016 was set up the network comprising of 41 rain gauges is represented in fig 8 and identified in table 1 the spatial interpolation technique applied to obtain the map of the mean annual rainfall depicted in fig 8 was the inverse distance weighting idw with an exponent of 2 idw is based on a concept of distance weighting and can be used to estimate the unknown spatial rainfall data from the known data of rain gauges that are adjacent to the unknown site burrough and mcdonnell 1998 in most cases the critical influence parameter of idw is the distance chen and liu 2012 which may not be the case of madeira island due to its topography however the elevation was not considered in the interpolation technique because there is a dense set of rain gauges at different elevations especially at the central highlands fig 1 fig 8 clearly shows that the high central parts of the island have the highest long term values of rainfall ranging from 2500 to 2800 mm year 1 the northern slope as well with high values in contrast the southern slope shows very low rainfall values ranging from 300 to 700 mm year 1 the results confirmed that the mice algorithm is an acceptable and potentially useful method able to fill all the missing values simultaneously preserving the original characteristics of the historical series regardless of the timescale and the percentage of missing values the advantage of the mice algorithm is that it incorporates the uncertainty related to the missing data which results in a valid statistical inference in addition to restoring the variability of missing rainfall data kang 2013 similar consistent results were obtained by de carvalho et al 2017 who applied and tested the mice algorithm with the same predictive mean matching method to a sub daily rainfall data set of a brazilian region the authors results are very encouraging because they performed approximately 25 better than two geostatistical methods to estimate the missing values like the kriging and co kriging despite the already mentioned advantages of mice and other advantages recognized by different authors from different scientific fields such as kenward and carpenter 2007 faris et al 2002 it should be acknowledged that the major drawback of the mice algorithm is the lack of a robust theoretical justification as other approaches have in case of filling the missing data as discussed by azur et al 2011 hence care should be taken to generalize the mice algorithm to fill the missing rainfall data but as a good alternative for data sets with large percentages of missing values and its application must be carefully considered in the context of the problem 4 2 clustering of rain gauges based on spi6 at each one of the rain gauges the spi6 series was next computed as described in section 3 3 based on the monthly rainfalls obtained by aggregating the daily rainfalls this series was smoothed by applying a moving average consequently for the reference period of 80 years i e 960 months the length of each smoothed spi6 series is n 960 5 4 951 months where the 5 and 4 result from the 6 month spi and the 5 month moving average calculations respectively the results of other moving average values show that the length of the series and the number of drought events decrease as the running length increases however the major droughts are always recognized and their characteristics are almost the same regardless the running length aiming at grouping the drought index series according to the similarities among their temporal patterns the different clustering methods presented in section 3 4 were applied to the 41 smoothed spi6 series of moderate or worse droughts table 2 summarizes the results achieved for 3 possible representative clusters of drought temporal variability the classifications with higher number of clusters were rejected because the composition of the clusters the rain gauges were not stable i e the elements in each cluster were very variable in most cases the different classifications clearly grouped the rain gauges into three regions northern slope cluster 1 southern slope cluster 2 and central area cluster 3 of madeira island the clusters that differ regarding the clustering method applied are located in the transition between the northern and southern slopes nevertheless these identified regions are not completely clear by applying ward s chebyshev method because the clusters elements are more mixed in comparison to the results from the other three approaches both the ward s euclidean and k means classifications have exactly the same spatial distribution of clusters elements whereas the ones from the ward s manhattan classification have some differences in the eastern part of the island m11 and m27 assigning more elements to the northern slope cluster 1 however this classification seems tenable moreover based on the k means results the plot of means for each cluster not shown here and the distances between the clusters it was found that cluster 1 and cluster 3 are more similar and relatively close to each other euclidean distance 0 35 compared to the distances of the cluster 2 from the clusters 1 and 3 euclidean distance 0 48 it should be noted that the implemented clustering techniques only account for the smoothed spi series regardless of the rain gauge s location although clustering may be somewhat subjective these results were the basis of the drought regionalization based on pca as described in the next section 4 3 homogeneous regions of the rotated principal components the smoothed spi6 series of moderate or worse droughts were organized into a matrix x with n 951 rows length of the spi series and p 41 columns number of rain gauges i e number of variables the principal components analysis pca was applied to the data set x to transform its variables into principal components pc by means of simple linear transformations it is expected that the first few components from the pca account for meaningful amounts of variance the scree plot was used as the criterion to choose the number of pcs to retain hair et al 1998 fig 9 it shows an abrupt change in slope at the second eigenvalue and a smaller change at the third eigenvalue by using the eigenvalues information about the contribution to the data variance of each pc can be extracted individually and cumulatively the percentages of the total variance explained by the principal components are 75 62 pc1 5 61 pc2 and 3 02 pc3 respectively accounting for 84 25 of cumulative variance up from the fourth pc the variance contribution of each new variable or dimension is meaningless based on this analysis and supported by the clustering results only the first three principal components were retained for varimax rotation in order to identify three homogeneous regions of spi6 it is expected that after rotation the variance explained by pc1 decreases and by pc2 and pc3 increase by this way the original 41 dimensional problem was transformed into a 3 dimensional one nevertheless it is acknowledged that there are other standard rules of thumb to detect the number of principal components to retain in a study cangelosi and goriely 2007 as shown in the left panels of fig 10 a c the orthogonal rotation varimax used to the identified spatial patterns provides a more precise delineation of the regions with different drought temporal variability the idw interpolation technique with an exponent of 2 as well was applied specifically to the component loadings after rotation aiming at obtaining smooth and gradual patterns of the spi6 field the variance of the retained rotated principal components rpc1 rpc2 rpc3 account for 23 96 32 08 and 28 21 of the total variance respectively although the cumulative variance 84 25 remains unchanged the component loading of rpc1 has positive and strong correlations with 11 rain gauges located in the northern slope of madeira island the second component loading rpc2 has positive high correlations mainly in the southern slope 14 rain gauges of the study area characterized by low mean annual rainfall e g m05 funchal observatório and m53 lido cais do carvão fig 8 the remaining 16 rain gauges located in the central area of the island have high correlations with the component loading of rpc3 this spatial pattern is mostly influenced by data from the rain gauges located in the mountainous ridge of the island with the highest mean annual rainfalls e g m01 areeiro and m12 caramujo thus the rotated component loadings seem to well delimit three homogeneous regions regarding the temporal pattern of spi6 according to the left panel of fig 10 the three identified homogeneous regions namely the rpc1 rg1 northern slope rpc2 rg2 southern slope and rpc3 rg3 central region are contiguous and do not overlap they are physically reasonable and intuitively in accordance to the topography and climatology of the area figs 1 and 8 the regions are also hydrologically quite different regarding the wind and rainfall regimes as mentioned in section 2 the identification of the rain gauges that belong to each homogeneous region is included in table 1 the regionalization enabled a dimensionality reduction to three relatively manageable regions on the basis of a spatially and temporally varying parameter such as spi6 after applying a 5 month running length the results of pca using alternate lengths 2 3 4 and 6 months not shown here presented less interpretability of the spatial distribution of the component loadings that is of the homogeneous regions in similar studies of regionalization of temporal drought patterns santos et al 2011 considering mainland portugal which is approximately 120 times the size of madeira island identified three homogeneous regions as well with rotated component loading values higher than 0 7 for 144 rain gauges covering the period 1910 2004 this highlights the considerable heterogeneity of drought variability in madeira island in comparison to a continental territory 4 4 duration magnitude and frequency of moderate droughts the characterization of the duration dd and magnitude dm see fig 4 of the moderate or worse droughts i e for spi values less than the threshold of u 0 84 was done based on the smoothed spi6 series at each rain gauge and also on the rpc scores for the three homogeneous regions shown in fig 10 and table 1 rg1 rg2 and rg3 in fact each score is basically a linear combination of the spi6 values at the 41 rain gauges however with contributions mainly from those at the rain gauges located within its respective homogeneous region i e the rain gauges with high correlation coefficients for each rpc and meaningless contributions from those rain gauges with low correlations component loadings aiming at validating the three identified homogeneous regions the characterization of the drought events from the rpc scores was compared to the one derived from the rain gauges located inside the region to which the scores relates to as shown in fig 11 in the figure the spi6 value for each consecutive period of 6 month was assigned to the beginning month of that period e g a spi6 value from march to august of the year 2000 was assigned to march 2000 fig 11 depicts the duration and magnitude of the droughts for each homogeneous region based on the rpc scores smoothed by a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess curve with a span factor f 0 20 alexandridis and zapranis 2013 dashed lines and the dd and dm for the rain gauges located inside the region in the former as discrete values dots and also fitted into lowess curves solid lines in each region the time series to which the lowess model was applied were discontinuous either univariate dd or dm identified based on the rpc with only one value in a given month or multivariate dd or dm derived from the rain gauges included in the region with one or more values in a given month in fig 11a rpc1 rg1 there are two observations that diverge from the overall pattern of the solid line lowess curve both for dd and dm these two observations refer to the rain gauges of m09 santana and m18 ponta do pargo starting respectively in june 2002 dd 25 month dm 35 and march 2003 dd 26 month dm 50 it is noteworthy that m18 is located in the most western part of the island its spi6 series differs from the other rain gauges spi6 series located in the same region in recent years 2001 2016 with more sustained negative values the latter suggests the presence of different drought patterns for shorter recent periods according to fig 11 c rpc3 rg3 a major drought event occurred in february 1980 in m02 bica da cana lasting for 34 months and with a magnitude of dm 52 which is the most severe event among the 41 analyzed rain gauges the end of the event in november 1982 was followed by one of the most widespread and meteorologically catastrophic the el niño event in december 1982 caviedes 1984 in the same figure the lowess curves have a peak for dd and dm between the end of 2010 and the beginning of 2011 in the rpc3 rg3 the droughts of 2010 2011 are by no means exceptional in terms of their dd and dm an inspection of the results of the mean annual rainfall points out that from 2011 onward the annual rainfalls of the 16 rain gauges located in the rpc3 rg3 region such as m01 areeiro m02 bica da cana and m23 ribeiro frio are all bellow their corresponding mean annual values previously shown in fig 8 in contrast the most severe drought events in the rpc2 rg2 occurred in the mid 1940s and since then there has been no presence of sudden disruptive changes or apparent trends changes to the dd and dm of lowess curves fig 11 b despite the dispersion shown by the duration and magnitude among the rain gauges included in a given region there is a general good agreement rpc2 rg2 or even very good agreement rpc1 rg1 and rpc3 rg3 between lowess curves directly supported by those rain gauges and resulting from the rpcs which reinforces the proposed regionalization the right panels of fig 10 a c present the results from the kore applied to the times of occurrence of the moderate or worse droughts as identified for the rpc scores for spi6 at the three homogeneous regions of madeira island it should be stressed that the analysis considered each 6 month s period under the drought conditions as a discrete data point vertical ticks even if that period is a part of a longer one related to the same drought event consequently the kore characterizes the annual frequency of 6 month s periods under the drought conditions rather than the frequency of the drought events fig 10a right panel shows that the frequency of the periods under the drought conditions in the northern region rpc1 which exhibit significant inter annual variability compared to the other two homogeneous regions the northern slope presents clearly two peaks for the studied period 1 in 1965 with λ t 2 5 year 1 and 2 in 2004 with λ t 3 8 year 1 these two peaks are also present in the same years for both duration dd and magnitude dm curves of fig 11 a regarding the southern slope rpc2 fig 10 b right panel a weak long term linear trend towards low λ t values is detectable from the year 1950 with λ t 3 0 year 1 to 2007 with λ t 1 2 year 1 beyond this year it seems to occur in an increasing tendency this tendency apparently is driven by an exceptionally extreme drought event occurred in 2012 liberato et al 2017 with the highest intensity in the analyzed period however this trend occurs only during a relatively short period from 2007 to 2016 in general terms the southern slope s drought occurrence rate curve does not have a considerable development as the other two regions results i e rpc2 has the lowest λ t range among the three identified homogeneous regions in right panel of fig 10c rpc3 there is a peak in 1937 followed by a decrease in λ t until a minimum is reached in 1967 up from this year the occurrence rate curve exhibits a positive trend the same figure shows that the frequency of the periods under the drought conditions in the central region denotes an increase from 2004 onwards with a high concentration of periods under drought conditions from 2011 on by combining these results with those of fig 11 c one can conclude that it indicates not an increase in the frequency of the drought events as it could result from a preliminary analysis but an increase in the duration of the drought meaning longer consecutive periods under drought conditions the results from the kore frequency estimator combined to the characterization of the drought events suggest that in the northern slope and the central regions of madeira island there seem to occur a significant increase in the number of the periods under drought conditions and in the magnitude of drought events while in the southern region those periods had been more frequent in the past an increase of the drought occurrences in region rpc3 rg3 may alter the natural recharge of groundwater for which the high central areas are crucial as mentioned in section 2 resulting in a decreased runoff which is likely to exacerbate the already existing water scarcity problems duarte 1998 jeopardizing the water security in the island 4 5 climatic drivers teleconnected to drought events aiming at ascertaining whether there is or not an influence of the enso and nao phases on the properties of the droughts at the identified homogeneous regions as well as a possible enso nao relationship different periods were considered based on the long term term trends and breaking points of the cumulative soi 6 and naoi 6 by visually comparing the cumulative soi 6 and cumulative naoi 6 series fig 12 it is apparent that from 2001 to 2016 they denote a more pronounced increase and decrease respectively than in the past in the same figure two breakpoints were visually identified in each series and confirmed by applying the sequential mann kendall sqmk test for change point detection rahman et al 2017 with a 95 confidence interval namely in the years 1976 1977 and 1999 2000 these two breakpoints agree with two of the most severe droughts that affected north eastern south america the caribbean mostly the lesser antilles and regions of central america herrera and ault 2017 fig 12 suggests a strong relationship between the climate anomalies accompanying the enso and nao based on the aggregator transformation of soi and naoi data with a distinct seasonal dependence in both observations similar to mueller and roeckner 2006 who predict a strengthened negative correlation between the two climatic drivers indices in the future in general terms according to the figure the negative dominant phases occur during la niña dominance and the positive nao phases in el niño dominance the model output exhibits a 3 month delay in the emergence of the naoi signals i e the identified breakpoints occurred first on the cumulative soi 6 signal and later on the cumulative naoi 6 this long term comparison was performed because some earlier studies stated that the association between enso and nao is weak and difficult to detect in short observational records fraedrich 1994 according to mayuening et al 2015 la niña dominance period shows extreme upward slopes positive soi with dry conditions and its counterpart el niño dominance period negative soi with extreme downward slopes generally linked to wet conditions in contrast the strong positive phases of the naoi tend to be associated with dry conditions across northern europe and wet conditions in southern europe fig 6 opposite patterns i e wet conditions in the north and dry conditions in the south are typically observed during downward slopes of the naoi metoffice 2018 thus three subperiods of the entire span of data 1952 2016 were analyzed based on the detected change points in the cumulative series namely a 25 years from 1952 to 1976 with upward slopes of the cumulative soi 6 and downward slopes of the cumulative naoi 6 b 24 years from 1977 to 2000 with downward slopes of the cumulative soi 6 and upward slopes of the cumulative naoi 6 and c 16 years from 2001 to 2016 with extreme upward slopes of the cumulative soi 6 and extreme downward slopes of the cumulative naoi 6 the question to address is how these dominant periods affect the droughts it is expected that the drought characteristics during the positive and negative dominance phases of both cumulative naoi 6 and soi 6 would differ the duration magnitude and maximum intensity of the droughts at each identified homogeneous region and subperiods are shown based on combined violin plots hintze and nelson 1998 aiming at recognizing changes in the corresponding density functions fig 13 shows that in all cases the distributions are right skewed with absolute values of the sample means always higher than those of the medians in the first subperiod fig 13 a the interquartile ranges iqr of the properties in any of the three regions are relatively small and with similar density traces presenting just a few values outside the 95 intervals from the first subperiod to the second one 25 year and 24 year long respectively the number of drought events and of periods under drought conditions increased although the sample means do not significantly differ among regions the shapes of the distributions are quite different fig 13 b the distribution for the southern slope rg2 in the second subperiod changed to a multimodal distribution with two peaks fig 13b while for the other two regions there is a considerable increase in the confidence interval boundaries length of the whiskers despite the subperiods 1977 2000 and 2001 2016 have almost the same iqr figs 13b and 13 c the sample means were pulled up by a considerable high number of large values of dm and dmi in the more recent period although these results are in accordance with the ones from the kore frequency estimator obviously with some differences because the kore is applied only to the periods under drought conditions it was not possible to establish a clear relationship between enso nao and drought occurrence in fact although the violin plots of the first and third subperiods differ from those of the second subperiod they are not as similar as the same dominance phase would indicate nevertheless the results from both methods the kore and violin plots confirmed an increase of drought occurrence it is expected that these increases will be sustained in the island because the dominance of the climatic drivers phases over the most recent period 2001 2016 apparently has not ended yet the climatic signals soi 6 and naoi 6 were compared to the three regionalized spi6 series derived from the pca considering the entire span of data and the same three subperiods mentioned at the beginning of this section for the northern slope the correlations between the soi 6 and the spi6 of rpc1 rg1 are very low as shown in fig 14 a about 64 years from january 1952 to march 2016 and fig 14 b 24 years from january 1977 to december 2000 the results for the period with 25 years from january 1952 to december 1976 are not included in the figure because no significant correlations were found in contrast the correlation considering the shortest and most recent 16 year period from january 2001 to december 2016 is significant with a correlation coefficient of r 0 47 and a p value of 9 22e 10 fig 14 c as shown in fig 14d the shorter subperiod included the strongest la niña event positive soi in december 2010 followed by the worst drought intensity dmi 2 2 in august 2011 a similar behavior was observed at a larger scale in the cumulative soi 6 signal previously described in which the strongest la niña dominant periods were followed by very intense droughts the correlations between the soi 6 and the spi6 time series at the southern slope rpc2 rg2 and at the central region rpc3 rg3 are very low correlation coefficients r ranging from 0 15 to 0 47 regardless the considered periods the same procedures were repeated for the naoi 6 signal with surprisingly very poor correlations e g correlation coefficients r ranging from 0 15 to 0 21 at the northern slope these results may be improved if the definition of naoi was based not in azores but instead in a station located at latitude lower than the one of madeira fig 6 which however was not possible as mentioned before according to the results obtained there is not a clear evidence for a teleconnection between enso nao phenomena and the identified droughts in madeira island in the long term based on the adopted methodology nevertheless there are subperiods when such correspondence is achieved between la niña phases and the negative spi6 phases but only for the rpc1 rg1 and rpc3 rg3 which was an unexpected result this suggests that in the most recent period 2001 2016 the short term la niña phases could have somewhat an influence over the drought occurrences in these two regions this influence is more consistent than that in the case of el niño phases with meaningless correlation for instance the positive soi 6 phases and the negative spi6 phases of the rpc3 rg3 from january 2010 to december 2011 have a significant correlation of r 0 56 for 5 month lag not shown here which could be interpreted as the number of months that it takes for this regionalized spi6 to react to any changes in the soi 6 signal furthermore this teleconnection result is in agreement with the analysis of droughts tendency for the same 2 year period of fig 11c described in the previous section given that these findings are based on an index merely using precipitation data the spi and a limited number of time windows the total period with 65 years and three shorter sub periods the results here described should therefore be treated with caution a few remarks must be added namely related to the soi capacity to address the droughts in this sense the association between la niña el niño phases and droughts identified in the present work appears to be consistent with previous results despite the different methodologies applied and the studied areas vicente serrano et al 2017 by utilizing a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei concludes that la niña phases in the eastern pacific causes droughts in the western plains of ecuador by analyzing a timescale of 12 month spi spi12 from 56 meteorological stations in southern south america through the 1961 2008 period penalba and rivera 2016 found that there is an evident response on the spi12 to la niña phases for 12 month lag whereas there is no evidence of el niño influence on spi12 time series in contrast nguyen et al 2014 applied spi with a 3 month timescale at a vietnamese river basin which is three times the area of madeira island the author argues that when el niño occurs meteorological drought occurrence in the studied river basin is very likely therefore la niña could be associated to droughts in longer timescales of spi spi6 spi12 etc whereas el niño might be related to droughts in shorter timescales e g spi3 of the same index finally the results shown in this study mostly represent averages over several episodes of shorter duration it is hence of interest to further explore individual drought events teleconnected with enso nao dynamical processes the early stage teleconnection assessment presented in this paper aimed at understating possible impacts of climate change on the droughts evolution in madeira island 5 conclusions the paper presents the first long term and high resolution spatio temporal characterization of the droughts in madeira island by using rainfall data from a dense network comprising of 41 rain gauges considering a time span of 80 years from january 1937 to december 2016 to fill the data a specific procedure which is often applied to other scientific fields as previously discussed the mice algorithm was used with very encouraging results in fact mice proved to be able to preserve the long term observed rainfall data structure after filling even though some rain gauges had a relatively high percentage of missing data this is quite relevant for small islands which have constraints in data availability moderate drought conditions were assessed based on the spi computed on 6 month timescale spi6 related to agricultural droughts to analyze the variability of the moderate drought conditions as identified by the spi6 clustering techniques and pca were used by applying the varimax rotation to the first three component loadings three non overlapping homogeneous regions denoting different temporal variability were identified namely the rpc1 rg1 northern slope rpc2 rg2 southern slope and rpc3 rg3 central region these results support the idea that there are three representative drought variability regions based on spi6 it should be stressed that because of the location shape and relief of madeira island these regions also present quite different climate constraints the comparison between the regionalization obtained by using the pca and clusters derived from different clustering techniques would seem to suggest a satisfactory agreement regarding the rain gauges located in each homogeneous region these three regions have also different drought time dependent occurrence rates in recent years as described by the kore thus they should be considered separately for an improved water resources management under drought conditions in madeira island for a better understanding prevention and mitigation of the consequences of future drought events finally a comparison between the spi6 time series at the identified homogeneous regions and the el niño southern oscillation and north atlantic oscillation signals for the period 1952 2016 was made aiming at identifying possible dependencies between the drought events and extreme phases of the cumulative soi 6 and naoi 6 the analysis showed that the long term spi6 series and the naoi 6 had no correspondence whatsoever although the correlations r between the positive phases of soi 6 la niña phases and negative values of spi6 are relatively strong for some short recent periods in the northern slope and central regions it is not possible to establish a cause and effect relationship because such association sometimes fails thus further work needs to be performed with more recent data and from different stations not just the reykjavik azores stations to establish whether the periods under drought conditions are influenced by climatic signals such as enso and nao in general this study has gone some way towards enhancing the understanding about regional drought monitoring in madeira island in a changing environment moreover it showed that in recent years specifically the central region is suffering a considerable increase in the number of drought events and in their duration magnitude and maximum intensity due to the importance of this region in terms of groundwater recharge such information is of utmost importance regarding the planning of actions aiming at improving the water security in the island

8420,study region madeira island portugal a small island of the north atlantic ocean study focus droughts from january 1937 to december 2016 were studied using monthly rainfall at 41 rain gauges covering most of the island the gaps of the original rainfall data were filled by multiple imputation by chained equations mice the drought conditions were assessed by means of the standardized precipitation index spi specifically the spi6 to study the drought variability some clustering techniques and principal components analysis pca were applied to the spi field new hydrological insights for the region three homogeneous regions northern slope southern slope and central region each of them with different temporal climatic variability may be identified furthermore for each region the droughts were characterized in terms of magnitude and duration and based on a kernel occurrence rate estimator kore as well as on frequency of the drought periods finally two climatic drivers namely the el niño southern oscillation enso and the north atlantic oscillation nao were teleconnected to the drought variability at the identified homogeneous regions for the period under study it was not possible to establish a clear relationship between enso nao and drought occurrence nevertheless the results showed that the spatio temporal drought variability in madeira island has been subjected to noticeable changes in recent years 2001 2016 with a considerable higher number of periods under drought conditions than in the past keywords drought standardized precipitation index spi mice principal components analysis pca occurrence rate el niño southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao 1 introduction droughts as natural phenomena are part of earth s climate and occur virtually in all climatic zones with neither warning nor recognition of administrative borders or of political and economic differences droughts can be perceived as prolonged and regionally extensive occurrences of below average natural water availability tallaksen and van lanen 2004 either in the form of rainfall river runoff or groundwater they are typically classified into meteorological agricultural hydrological ground water stream flow and socio economic drought lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 unlike other natural weather disasters droughts start unnoticeably develop cumulatively produce snowballing impacts and by the time damages are visible it is too late to mitigate their consequences understanding the characteristics and consequences of droughts as well as modelling and forecasting their occurrences are major issues for a successful water policy especially in regions more prone to extreme hydrological events these issues become even more important under the climatic change perspectives indeed despite the low confidence in observed global scale trends in droughts due to the lack of direct observations their magnitude and frequency are likely to increase the same applies to other extreme hydrological events parry et al 2007 barros et al 2014 as stated by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in its periodical assessment reports mccarthy et al 2001 parry et al 2007 barros et al 2014 island environments are specifically more vulnerable and often affected by extreme hydrological events i e floods and droughts and climate change compared to continental areas especially in small islands meaning those islands with areas between 100 km2 and 5000 km2 falkland et al 1991 they have particular physical demographic usually with a high concentration of population and economic features along with hydrological and water resources development and management problems that distinguish them from larger islands or continental areas in recent times prolonged and more severe droughts have increased islands vulnerability mcgree et al 2016 these prolonged periods of suppressed rainfall together with their persistence and intensity have raised the public and the political awareness to the many associated socio economic impacts on water management and the need for drought mitigation measures in fact droughts are very particular problems in small islands e g some of the australian islands in the pacific but also the cook islands the federated states of micronesia the republic of the marshall islands new zealand papua new guinea pitcairn islands samoa solomon islands mcgree et al 2016 the azores and the madeira archipelagos and the canary islands falkland et al 1991 because of their relative fragile freshwater sources that can be depleted when precipitation drops down leading in many cases to groundwater and aquifer overexploitation and often causing serious losses in productivity of agriculture electricity health among other impacts barnett 2011 in spite of their recurrent nature particularly in regions with pronounced hydrological temporal variability droughts are among the most complex and simultaneously the least understood extreme hydrological events tallaksen and van lanen 2004 and have been lagging behind the development of flood related research thus there is an urgent need to address the emerging issues on drought research and management as a first step for water resources management aiming at preventing and mitigating the consequences of the future occurrences rossi 2000 according to stahl et al 2012 this knowledge can be used as a basis for a better understanding of drought vulnerability in different climates for this purpose throughout the 20th century several indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 and the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 were developed to evaluate the water deficit in relation to some average amount for a certain period of time heim 2002 the pdsi uses precipitation and temperature data in a water balance model to compare the meteorological and hydrological drought across space and time whereas the spi only considers precipitation as state variable indices based on different climatic and hydrological variables may exhibit different regional and temporal patterns i e results vary depending on the drought index and on the timescale considered there are no generally applicable drought assessment methods for small island environments owing to the diversity of conditions examples are madeira island with notable differences in rainfall between north and south porto santo also belonging to madeira archipelago with some signs of aridity and relatively low rainfall liberato et al 2017 the azores archipelago with very wet high regions and drier coastal areas santos et al 2004 anguilla in the caribbean with a tropical climate ameliorated by marine influences notably the trade winds parr and rogers 2002 the islands of antigua and barbuda with a great variation in mean annual rainfall from year to year mcmillan 1985 the islands of bermuda with precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year and more intense in summer than in winter rowe 1984 mauritius situated in the southwest part of the indian ocean with a rainfall regime subject to large regional variation and two marked seasons ramjeawon 1994 and the canary islands archipelago which are placed in a dry belt so rainfall is very low near the coast and in flat islands falkland et al 1991 due to this great diversity of conditions in small islands characterization methods taken directly from continental territory applications may be only crude or even irrelevant approaches to identify and characterize extreme hydrological events such as droughts for instance indices like the national rainfall index nri defined as the national average of the total annual precipitation weighted by its long term average are more commonly used for agricultural drought recognition gommes and petrassi 1996 in larger areas e g an entire country making them unsuitable to address droughts affecting smaller areas or of a different type meteorological and hydrological droughts therefore specific methods or indices to characterize drought should be applied or adapted for small islands which additionally are often subject to data availability constraints thus consideration of each islands peculiarities must be taken into account when applying them given the large spatial character of droughts different authors have recommended that they should be studied within a regional context tallaksen 2000 because the results of individual case studies may be incomparable demuth et al 2001 consequently the selected index should be standardized for the purpose of making the drought analyses results comparable regardless of the studied region lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 this is the most important characteristic of the spi at a given location the spi measures rainfall anomalies based on a comparison of observed rainfall amounts for an accumulation period of interest usually 1 3 6 12 month with the long term historic rainfall record for that period the historic record is fitted to a probability distribution which is then transformed into a standard normal distribution such that the mean spi value for that location and period is zero svoboda et al 2012 according to lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 the spi is one of the most commonly used multi scalar indices in europe to monitor all types of drought it is also recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 2017 and is likely to be the most frequently used drought indicator worldwide because the spi is applicable in all climate regimes vicente serrano 2005a 2006 santos et al 2010 furthermore by using standardized anomalies a reliable and simple comparison of historical and current droughts among different rainfall regimes and geographic locations is also feasible moreira et al 2012 for many analytical purposes related to climate variability like the analysis of drought patterns it is convenient to divide the spatial continuum e g of spi into a manageable number of homogeneous areas otherwise such analysis may be difficult when data from several monitoring stations are used preisendorfer and mobley 1988 the clustering techniques such as hierarchical and non hierarchical clustering and the principal component analysis pca may help to disclose high level regularities that enable the generalization about areas based on a spatially and temporally varying parameter these techniques have been widely used in climatic regionalization briggs and lemin 1992 corte real et al 1998 unal et al 2003 many authors e g bonaccorso et al 2003 vicente serrano 2006 santos et al 2010 raziei et al 2015 have applied the pca to the spi for analyzing the spatial and temporal variability of droughts moreover in recent years some authors have attributed the drought variability to natural climate variability meze hausken 2004 espinoza et al 2011 gutzler and robbins 2011 specifically the el niño and the la niña phases known as the el niño southern oscillation enso signal across the equatorial pacific ocean are widely recognized as major ocean atmosphere climatic drivers causing in some cases rainfall variability and hydrological variable anomalies on a global scale mainly in the tropics of the pacific coast of america vicente serrano 2005a wikarmpapraharn et al 2010 explored the enso and drought variability relationships using the southern oscillation index soi and the spi time series from four representative rain gauges in the central plain of thailand finding that the spi series for accumulation periods of 1 2 3 and 4 month are strongly correlated with the enso strength and phases this suggests that apparently enso controls rainfall variability in that region nevertheless the possible relationship between enso and drought events analyzed by using different indices like spi pdsi and soi remains uncertain another dominant pattern of interannual climate variability is the north atlantic oscillation nao in the northern hemisphere extratropics hurrell 1995 which is one of the most prominent teleconnection patterns in all seasons barnston and livezey 1987 this climatic driver consists of a north south dipole of anomalies with one of its centers located over greenland and the other one of opposite sign spanning the central latitudes of the north atlantic 35 n to 40 n in general terms the nao influences changes in the temperature and precipitation from eastern north america to western and central noaa 2012 different authors have acknowledged that the nao is largely responsible for the periods of drought in europe e g lópez moreno and vicente serrano 2008 vicente serrano et al 2011 mares et al 2002 in the current study the spi was applied to rainfall records from january 1937 to december 2016 aiming at analyzing droughts from moderate to extreme according to agnew 2000 in madeira island by clustering rain gauges and decomposing their corresponding spi time series into principal components to identify homogeneous regions regarding temporal drought patterns madeira is a small portuguese island of the north atlantic na which belongs to the autonomous region of madeira ram in the european part of macaronesia this work was motivated by the following issues 1 the poor quality of the original rainfall data in madeira island short series and numerous gaps is not compatible with a comprehensive drought characterization despite the fragility of the island to rainfall shortness to address this issue a gap filling procedure was implemented resulting in long daily rainfall series 80 years from january 1937 to december 2016 in 41 rain gauges table 1 which allowed a novel and detailed spatio temporal characterization of the droughts over the whole island 2 furthermore in many mountainous small islands like madeira fig 1 the exact rainfall distribution is strongly dependent on the complex topography and the prevailing winds gouveia reis et al 2016 which still makes the estimation of extreme hydrological events highly uncertain issues in water resources management therefore identifying homogeneous regions may be essential for a more comprehensive assessment of those events regarding their spatial extent magnitude and frequency 3 because of its reduced area madeira island has little visibility at a global scale this may justify the absence of regional studies on droughts as those done for the continental portuguese territory e g santos et al 2010 moreira et al 1993 there are some studies covering relatively short periods or well recognized drought events such as the exceptionally extreme drought that affected madeira during the 2011 2012 hydrological year liberato et al 2017 however none of them provides a comprehensive overview of drought events that occurred in the last decades 4 although enso is commonly linked to climate patterns over the tropical pacific it has been proven that it can also affect other regions such as the northern europe that underwent a severe precipitation deficit during the medieval climate anomaly which was synchronous with droughts in various enso sensitive regions worldwide helama et al 2009 because the effects of enso on the small islands of the north atlantic region are less understood li and lau 2012 a comparison was performed between the phases of soi and drought periods identified based on the spi in addition the dominant periods of the cumulative soi and the mathematical description of the nao i e the nao index naoi were related to some characteristics of the droughts in the island the paper is organized as follows in section 2 there is a brief description of madeira island its climate hydrology and the main freshwater resources section 3 provides information on the available rainfall data and on the models utilized section 4 shows the main results and discussion obtained from the pca applied to the spi on a 6 month timescale and from the relationship between climatic drivers and drought events in section 5 the conclusions are given 2 study area madeira is the largest island of the madeira archipelago it has an area of 741 km2 a length of 57 km and a largest width of 22 km centered at 32 44 34 n and 16 57 91 w madeira has a steep topography and is completely formed by the volcanic materials consisting of an enormous central e w oriented mountainous ridge pico ruivo 1862 m a s l and pico do areeiro 1818 m a s l and paúl da serra region above 1400 m a s l cut by deep valleys fig 1 according to the koppen s classification the climate is predominantly temperate with dry and warm summers and temperate with hot and dry summer in the coastal zones of madeira chazarra et al 2011 except for the higher areas where very low temperatures may occur during winter the differences between winter and summer temperatures are generally small due to its e w oriented mountains the precipitation is strongly orographically generated falling predominantly in the north facing slope because of the prevailing n e trade winds liberato et al 2017 the rainfall regime is not only affected by the local circulation but also by synoptic systems typical of mid latitudes such as fronts and extratropical cyclones and the azores anticyclone in the summer season fragoso et al 2012 the rainfall quantity and its high variability with respect to time and space play an important role on the availability of the madeira s freshwater resources regions with smaller amounts of precipitation are more susceptible to the rainfall temporal variability in terms of water availability this is the case of the southern slope of the island compared to the northern one in addition from an orographical perspective the island is also divided by deep valleys into east and west however based on the rainfall regime and the marked elevation differences e g fig 2 there are two distinct regions in madeira namely the northern slope with large amounts of rainfall and the southern slope with less rainfall in madeira island groundwater resources are the main source of freshwater for the 267 785 inhabitants and about 500 000 tourists per year ine 2012 nearly all its population is concentrated in the southern slope e g in the vicinity of the rain gauges m03 m05 m06 m08 m10 m22 m24 m44 m53 fig 1 the groundwater exploitation for domestic and industrial use as well as for irrigation and electrical production purposes is made by means of water galleries tunnels wells and springs and remarkably by an extensive network of small originally stone canals or levadas with more than 1000 km long the levadas whose origin dates back to the first settlements of madeira island in the first quarter of the 15th century mostly border the mountains at elevations from 600 to 1000 m a s l and are classified as an outstanding universal value due to their uniqueness duarte 1998 the groundwater flows from the central region to the coast where the aquifers discharge to the sea prada et al 2005 the main groundwater natural recharge areas are located in the high central parts where the precipitation values and permeability of rocks are higher e g the rain gauges m01 and m02 3

kore and 6 a comparison between the soi and spi time series 3 1 data the daily and sub daily data from 67 rain gauges fig 1 in the reference period of 80 years from january 1937 to december 2016 were made available by the portuguese met office ipma the portuguese institute for sea and atmosphere https www ipma pt which has high data quality standards and is one of the main sources of portuguese hydrological and hydrometeorological data the rain gauges were selected aiming at establishing the continuous daily rainfall series as long as possible the data set thus assembled was highly variable in terms of length of the recording periods missing values and duration of the gap periods fig 3 most of the rain gauges 45 rain gauges had more than 60 of missing daily rainfalls and only 4 rain gauges had less than 10 of missing values from these last rain gauges only three m01 areeiro m05 funchal observatório and m25 santo da serra table 1 had less than 5 of missing values the available data was sometimes redundant and even ill defined with rain gauges located in the same place but covering different periods it should be noted that the studied period refers to 80 civil years from january 1937 to december 2016 3 2 filling of missing data the multiple imputation by chained equations mice algorithm was used for completing the daily rainfall series of the rain gauges with missing values or gaps in the reference period as it was applied in recent years to estimate the missing rainfall data at a daily scale de carvalho et al 2017 in the mice algorithm each missing value is imputed m multiple times through a specified algorithm that uses the observed data of every cell to find a plausible value for the missing cell these algorithms are implemented in the package mice in r and described in more detail in the article by van buuren and groothuis oudshoorn 2010 the application of the mice algorithm to the rainfall records at madeira island adopted m 30 imputed plausible completed data sets and 50 maximum iterations the imputations are generated according to the default method which is for numerical data predictive mean matching pmm to deal with the missing rainfall data mice and mice refer to the two completed data sets obtained by applying the algorithm respectively 1 to monthly rainfalls computed by accumulating the existing daily records and 2 directly to daily rainfall records that afterwards were accumulated into monthly data to validate these results a few error measures were applied to assess at each rain gauge the differences between the observed data set and the reconstructed data set mice or mice the measures applied were the correlation coefficient the mean absolute error mae the normalized root mean squared error nrmse and the wilcoxon signed rank test randles 1988 which is a non parametric statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether the time series before gap filling and after gap filling have the same empirical distribution 3 3 standardized precipitation index spi the choice of the drought index depends on several aspects such as the objective of the analysis the specific features of the hydrological regime under consideration or the data availability in the study for madeira island the droughts were assessed via the standardized precipitation index spi specifically spi6 the spi is an index based on the probability of occurrence of a certain deviation from an average amount of precipitation and for a given timescale when computing the spi at a timescale of δ month the variable to be analyzed is the monthly precipitation for δ 1 and the cumulative precipitation in periods of δ consecutive month for δ 1 although different timescales were analyzed only the spi6 is mentioned because besides being the recommended timescale when addressing agriculture droughts hayes et al 1999 it can also be associated with the precipitation shortfalls that in some regions begin to affect the streamflows and levels of reservoirs and lakes svoboda et al 2012 in the management of the water resources in madeira precipitation shortfalls for more than a few months are very important due to the island s dependency on precipitation for groundwater recharge to describe the monthly or the cumulative precipitation series the pearson type iii distribution with parameters given by the l moments were applied santos et al 2010 according to the drought category for spi proposed by agnew 2000 only values smaller than u 0 84 were considered moderate or worse droughts the several consecutive time periods with spi values below this threshold belong to the same drought event with duration dd maximum intensity dmi and magnitude dm as defined in fig 4 it is noteworthy that the magnitude and the duration of the drought events are somehow mutually dependent because the longer the duration is the higher the magnitude should be for pooling mutually dependent droughts and for removing minor droughts which have little hydrological importance and may disturb the analysis the moving average procedure van loon et al 2011 fleig et al 2006 tallaksen et al 1997 is applied to the spi6 time series before selecting the droughts events fig 5 lópez moreno et al 2009 and li et al 2013 also used the same technique with a low pass filter of 5 months although for the spi based on discharges and at a longer time scale 12 months wen et al 2011 applied the moving average for spi from 3 to 12 months with running lengths equal to the spi time scale for the spi at different time scales shin et al 2018 pooled the drought events when they reoccurred for at least 2 months and the spi values of inter drought event time were less than zero in the case study of madeira island a filter of 5 months was adopted assuming that the hydrological processes that condition the freshwater availability are not very sensitive to very short and frequent droughts because groundwater is their prime source 3 4 clustering and principal components analysis for the purpose of characterizing the spatio temporal drought patterns in madeira island and obtaining a clearly defined regionalization of drought homogeneous regions cluster analysis coupled with principal components analysis pca were applied to the smoothed spi6 time series these procedures intend to identify homogeneous regions by forming groups of rain gauges with similar temporal pattern of the spi6 series mcgree et al 2016 the cluster analysis relies on the discriminant analysis to check the statistical significance of the formed groups dillan and goldstein 1984 nevertheless this does not ensure that the groups are actually meaningful the objective of this step is to form clusters of rain gauges to have a regionalization of droughts in madeira in case that there is one it is important to mention that the groups identification is very dependent on the particular metric to cluster therefore different metrics were used to get stable clusters i e the rain gauges of a defined cluster do not change positions regardless of the method used the clustering techniques applied were hierarchical clustering the ward s method as amalgamation rule combined with chebyshev manhattan and euclidean distances and non hierarchical clustering like k means these techniques are the most popular techniques for clustering hair et al 1998 king 2015 pca is a statistical procedure commonly used to transform an original set of variables into a different set of uncorrelated variables through linear combinations of these variables aiming mainly at both data and dimensionality reduction hair et al 1998 to isolate the dominant patterns of co variability of the droughts at the selected rain gauges the pca was applied to the spi6 time series the pca provides a natural smoothing of the spi field in terms of a reduced number of dominant patterns of variability or empirical eigenvectors preisendorfer and mobley 1988 the pca consisted firstly by calculating the covariance matrix of the spi6 data with the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors the principal components or pc score time series are given by the projection of the spi6 fields on the orthonormal eigenfunctions rencher 2002 it is noteworthy that the identification of the spatial patterns of spi6 was based on the principal components loadings which represent the correlation or covariance between the spi6 time series at each rain gauge and the corresponding pc score time series considered as regionalized new spi6 series to more precisely locate spatial patterns of drought variability and to improve their interpretation the principal components were rotated rotated principal components rpc using the varimax technique which is frequently used for performing these rotations abdi 2003 3 5 yearly frequency of the droughts the analysis of the changes in the rate or frequency of occurrence of the periods under drought conditions attempts to answer the question regardless the scarcity of water i e the precipitation deficit how the frequency of the occurrence of droughts has changed over time to tackle this question a kernel occurrence rate estimator kore was used according to the stepwise approach applied by silva et al 2012 portela et al 2015 silva 2017 including the generation of pseudodata outside before and after of the observation interval by the straightforward method of reflection for an amplitude of three times the bandwidth the kernel technique is a nonparametric model developed by diggle 1985 for smoothing point process data in its application to the droughts in madeira island it aimed at analyzing how the annual frequency of the periods under drought conditions λ t change over time for that purpose the kore analysis was applied to the times of occurrence of the periods under drought conditions i e with values of the new regionalized spi6 series given by the rpc scores representing moderate or worse droughts u 0 84 to select the bandwidth a straight forward method the silverman s rule of thumb silverman 1986 was adopted silva 2017 to quantify the uncertainties of the results thus achieved the pointwise confidence bands were constructed around λ t by means of bootstrap simulations cowling et al 1996 mudelsee 2011 the kernel occurrence rate estimation method coupled with the bootstrap confidence band construction was first introduced into the analysis of climate extremes by mudelsee et al 2003 with a detailed description given by mudelsee et al 2004 3 6 soi and naoi data although there are several slight variations in the soi and naoi allan et al 1991 hurrell 1995 in this study the standardized tahiti darwin monthly soi and the standardized iceland azores monthly naoi https crudata uea ac uk cru data pci htm fig 6 were used from january 1952 to december 2016 in order to establish a possible relationship between enso nao and drought occurrence in madeira island the 6 month running length of both the soi and naoi were used denoted in this work as soi 6 and naoi 6 respectively for the same period both climatic signals were compared to the spi6 time series at the identified homogeneous regions by means of the pearson correlation coefficient r and cross correlation hair et al 1998 the previous period refers to the one with complete monthly soi and naoi data although madeira island is located at a latitude lower than azores 32 44 n and 37 46 n respectively md and az in fig 6 it was not possible to find a southern station that could better define a naoi in this work i e a station at a latitude lower than the one of madeira island with long enough surface pressure records 4 results and discussion 4 1 filling of missing rainfall data the reconstruction of the long term rainfall time series at the 67 initial rain gauges fig 1 utilized the mice algorithm because of the relative short distance between the rain gauges the correlations among the observed data series are positively high in most cases the data series with 90 or more missing values for 12 rain gauges were directly discarded for the remaining rain gauges the average p and the standard deviation s of the observed monthly data and of the reconstructed monthly data identified as mice or mice according to the time level at which the mice algorithm was applied monthly and daily respectively were at first compared using mae and nrsme error measures with 0 16 5 of error nevertheless no rain gauges were discarded in this step the wilcoxon signed rank test was also applied to the same long term averages with the following null hypothesis the observed data and the reconstructed data are not significantly different i e p value α 0 05 the 14 rain gauges with p value lower than the significance level α 0 05 were discarded at this stage these procedures resulted in a dense set of 41 rain gauges with long term daily rainfall data for madeira island that were continuous and reliable also identified in fig 1 for rabaçal rain gauge originally with 75 of missing daily data fig 7 exemplifies the long term mean p and s of the monthly rainfall before gap filling observed data with gaps and the reconstructed data set smoothed with a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess cleveland 1979 the figure shows that even in a rain gauge with such a significant number of missing daily rainfalls there is a very good correspondence between the statistical characteristics of the observed rainfalls and the estimated rainfalls given by mice after the application of the adopted data quality criteria the final network of complete daily rainfall series mice in a period of 80 years from january 1937 to december 2016 was set up the network comprising of 41 rain gauges is represented in fig 8 and identified in table 1 the spatial interpolation technique applied to obtain the map of the mean annual rainfall depicted in fig 8 was the inverse distance weighting idw with an exponent of 2 idw is based on a concept of distance weighting and can be used to estimate the unknown spatial rainfall data from the known data of rain gauges that are adjacent to the unknown site burrough and mcdonnell 1998 in most cases the critical influence parameter of idw is the distance chen and liu 2012 which may not be the case of madeira island due to its topography however the elevation was not considered in the interpolation technique because there is a dense set of rain gauges at different elevations especially at the central highlands fig 1 fig 8 clearly shows that the high central parts of the island have the highest long term values of rainfall ranging from 2500 to 2800 mm year 1 the northern slope as well with high values in contrast the southern slope shows very low rainfall values ranging from 300 to 700 mm year 1 the results confirmed that the mice algorithm is an acceptable and potentially useful method able to fill all the missing values simultaneously preserving the original characteristics of the historical series regardless of the timescale and the percentage of missing values the advantage of the mice algorithm is that it incorporates the uncertainty related to the missing data which results in a valid statistical inference in addition to restoring the variability of missing rainfall data kang 2013 similar consistent results were obtained by de carvalho et al 2017 who applied and tested the mice algorithm with the same predictive mean matching method to a sub daily rainfall data set of a brazilian region the authors results are very encouraging because they performed approximately 25 better than two geostatistical methods to estimate the missing values like the kriging and co kriging despite the already mentioned advantages of mice and other advantages recognized by different authors from different scientific fields such as kenward and carpenter 2007 faris et al 2002 it should be acknowledged that the major drawback of the mice algorithm is the lack of a robust theoretical justification as other approaches have in case of filling the missing data as discussed by azur et al 2011 hence care should be taken to generalize the mice algorithm to fill the missing rainfall data but as a good alternative for data sets with large percentages of missing values and its application must be carefully considered in the context of the problem 4 2 clustering of rain gauges based on spi6 at each one of the rain gauges the spi6 series was next computed as described in section 3 3 based on the monthly rainfalls obtained by aggregating the daily rainfalls this series was smoothed by applying a moving average consequently for the reference period of 80 years i e 960 months the length of each smoothed spi6 series is n 960 5 4 951 months where the 5 and 4 result from the 6 month spi and the 5 month moving average calculations respectively the results of other moving average values show that the length of the series and the number of drought events decrease as the running length increases however the major droughts are always recognized and their characteristics are almost the same regardless the running length aiming at grouping the drought index series according to the similarities among their temporal patterns the different clustering methods presented in section 3 4 were applied to the 41 smoothed spi6 series of moderate or worse droughts table 2 summarizes the results achieved for 3 possible representative clusters of drought temporal variability the classifications with higher number of clusters were rejected because the composition of the clusters the rain gauges were not stable i e the elements in each cluster were very variable in most cases the different classifications clearly grouped the rain gauges into three regions northern slope cluster 1 southern slope cluster 2 and central area cluster 3 of madeira island the clusters that differ regarding the clustering method applied are located in the transition between the northern and southern slopes nevertheless these identified regions are not completely clear by applying ward s chebyshev method because the clusters elements are more mixed in comparison to the results from the other three approaches both the ward s euclidean and k means classifications have exactly the same spatial distribution of clusters elements whereas the ones from the ward s manhattan classification have some differences in the eastern part of the island m11 and m27 assigning more elements to the northern slope cluster 1 however this classification seems tenable moreover based on the k means results the plot of means for each cluster not shown here and the distances between the clusters it was found that cluster 1 and cluster 3 are more similar and relatively close to each other euclidean distance 0 35 compared to the distances of the cluster 2 from the clusters 1 and 3 euclidean distance 0 48 it should be noted that the implemented clustering techniques only account for the smoothed spi series regardless of the rain gauge s location although clustering may be somewhat subjective these results were the basis of the drought regionalization based on pca as described in the next section 4 3 homogeneous regions of the rotated principal components the smoothed spi6 series of moderate or worse droughts were organized into a matrix x with n 951 rows length of the spi series and p 41 columns number of rain gauges i e number of variables the principal components analysis pca was applied to the data set x to transform its variables into principal components pc by means of simple linear transformations it is expected that the first few components from the pca account for meaningful amounts of variance the scree plot was used as the criterion to choose the number of pcs to retain hair et al 1998 fig 9 it shows an abrupt change in slope at the second eigenvalue and a smaller change at the third eigenvalue by using the eigenvalues information about the contribution to the data variance of each pc can be extracted individually and cumulatively the percentages of the total variance explained by the principal components are 75 62 pc1 5 61 pc2 and 3 02 pc3 respectively accounting for 84 25 of cumulative variance up from the fourth pc the variance contribution of each new variable or dimension is meaningless based on this analysis and supported by the clustering results only the first three principal components were retained for varimax rotation in order to identify three homogeneous regions of spi6 it is expected that after rotation the variance explained by pc1 decreases and by pc2 and pc3 increase by this way the original 41 dimensional problem was transformed into a 3 dimensional one nevertheless it is acknowledged that there are other standard rules of thumb to detect the number of principal components to retain in a study cangelosi and goriely 2007 as shown in the left panels of fig 10 a c the orthogonal rotation varimax used to the identified spatial patterns provides a more precise delineation of the regions with different drought temporal variability the idw interpolation technique with an exponent of 2 as well was applied specifically to the component loadings after rotation aiming at obtaining smooth and gradual patterns of the spi6 field the variance of the retained rotated principal components rpc1 rpc2 rpc3 account for 23 96 32 08 and 28 21 of the total variance respectively although the cumulative variance 84 25 remains unchanged the component loading of rpc1 has positive and strong correlations with 11 rain gauges located in the northern slope of madeira island the second component loading rpc2 has positive high correlations mainly in the southern slope 14 rain gauges of the study area characterized by low mean annual rainfall e g m05 funchal observatório and m53 lido cais do carvão fig 8 the remaining 16 rain gauges located in the central area of the island have high correlations with the component loading of rpc3 this spatial pattern is mostly influenced by data from the rain gauges located in the mountainous ridge of the island with the highest mean annual rainfalls e g m01 areeiro and m12 caramujo thus the rotated component loadings seem to well delimit three homogeneous regions regarding the temporal pattern of spi6 according to the left panel of fig 10 the three identified homogeneous regions namely the rpc1 rg1 northern slope rpc2 rg2 southern slope and rpc3 rg3 central region are contiguous and do not overlap they are physically reasonable and intuitively in accordance to the topography and climatology of the area figs 1 and 8 the regions are also hydrologically quite different regarding the wind and rainfall regimes as mentioned in section 2 the identification of the rain gauges that belong to each homogeneous region is included in table 1 the regionalization enabled a dimensionality reduction to three relatively manageable regions on the basis of a spatially and temporally varying parameter such as spi6 after applying a 5 month running length the results of pca using alternate lengths 2 3 4 and 6 months not shown here presented less interpretability of the spatial distribution of the component loadings that is of the homogeneous regions in similar studies of regionalization of temporal drought patterns santos et al 2011 considering mainland portugal which is approximately 120 times the size of madeira island identified three homogeneous regions as well with rotated component loading values higher than 0 7 for 144 rain gauges covering the period 1910 2004 this highlights the considerable heterogeneity of drought variability in madeira island in comparison to a continental territory 4 4 duration magnitude and frequency of moderate droughts the characterization of the duration dd and magnitude dm see fig 4 of the moderate or worse droughts i e for spi values less than the threshold of u 0 84 was done based on the smoothed spi6 series at each rain gauge and also on the rpc scores for the three homogeneous regions shown in fig 10 and table 1 rg1 rg2 and rg3 in fact each score is basically a linear combination of the spi6 values at the 41 rain gauges however with contributions mainly from those at the rain gauges located within its respective homogeneous region i e the rain gauges with high correlation coefficients for each rpc and meaningless contributions from those rain gauges with low correlations component loadings aiming at validating the three identified homogeneous regions the characterization of the drought events from the rpc scores was compared to the one derived from the rain gauges located inside the region to which the scores relates to as shown in fig 11 in the figure the spi6 value for each consecutive period of 6 month was assigned to the beginning month of that period e g a spi6 value from march to august of the year 2000 was assigned to march 2000 fig 11 depicts the duration and magnitude of the droughts for each homogeneous region based on the rpc scores smoothed by a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing lowess curve with a span factor f 0 20 alexandridis and zapranis 2013 dashed lines and the dd and dm for the rain gauges located inside the region in the former as discrete values dots and also fitted into lowess curves solid lines in each region the time series to which the lowess model was applied were discontinuous either univariate dd or dm identified based on the rpc with only one value in a given month or multivariate dd or dm derived from the rain gauges included in the region with one or more values in a given month in fig 11a rpc1 rg1 there are two observations that diverge from the overall pattern of the solid line lowess curve both for dd and dm these two observations refer to the rain gauges of m09 santana and m18 ponta do pargo starting respectively in june 2002 dd 25 month dm 35 and march 2003 dd 26 month dm 50 it is noteworthy that m18 is located in the most western part of the island its spi6 series differs from the other rain gauges spi6 series located in the same region in recent years 2001 2016 with more sustained negative values the latter suggests the presence of different drought patterns for shorter recent periods according to fig 11 c rpc3 rg3 a major drought event occurred in february 1980 in m02 bica da cana lasting for 34 months and with a magnitude of dm 52 which is the most severe event among the 41 analyzed rain gauges the end of the event in november 1982 was followed by one of the most widespread and meteorologically catastrophic the el niño event in december 1982 caviedes 1984 in the same figure the lowess curves have a peak for dd and dm between the end of 2010 and the beginning of 2011 in the rpc3 rg3 the droughts of 2010 2011 are by no means exceptional in terms of their dd and dm an inspection of the results of the mean annual rainfall points out that from 2011 onward the annual rainfalls of the 16 rain gauges located in the rpc3 rg3 region such as m01 areeiro m02 bica da cana and m23 ribeiro frio are all bellow their corresponding mean annual values previously shown in fig 8 in contrast the most severe drought events in the rpc2 rg2 occurred in the mid 1940s and since then there has been no presence of sudden disruptive changes or apparent trends changes to the dd and dm of lowess curves fig 11 b despite the dispersion shown by the duration and magnitude among the rain gauges included in a given region there is a general good agreement rpc2 rg2 or even very good agreement rpc1 rg1 and rpc3 rg3 between lowess curves directly supported by those rain gauges and resulting from the rpcs which reinforces the proposed regionalization the right panels of fig 10 a c present the results from the kore applied to the times of occurrence of the moderate or worse droughts as identified for the rpc scores for spi6 at the three homogeneous regions of madeira island it should be stressed that the analysis considered each 6 month s period under the drought conditions as a discrete data point vertical ticks even if that period is a part of a longer one related to the same drought event consequently the kore characterizes the annual frequency of 6 month s periods under the drought conditions rather than the frequency of the drought events fig 10a right panel shows that the frequency of the periods under the drought conditions in the northern region rpc1 which exhibit significant inter annual variability compared to the other two homogeneous regions the northern slope presents clearly two peaks for the studied period 1 in 1965 with λ t 2 5 year 1 and 2 in 2004 with λ t 3 8 year 1 these two peaks are also present in the same years for both duration dd and magnitude dm curves of fig 11 a regarding the southern slope rpc2 fig 10 b right panel a weak long term linear trend towards low λ t values is detectable from the year 1950 with λ t 3 0 year 1 to 2007 with λ t 1 2 year 1 beyond this year it seems to occur in an increasing tendency this tendency apparently is driven by an exceptionally extreme drought event occurred in 2012 liberato et al 2017 with the highest intensity in the analyzed period however this trend occurs only during a relatively short period from 2007 to 2016 in general terms the southern slope s drought occurrence rate curve does not have a considerable development as the other two regions results i e rpc2 has the lowest λ t range among the three identified homogeneous regions in right panel of fig 10c rpc3 there is a peak in 1937 followed by a decrease in λ t until a minimum is reached in 1967 up from this year the occurrence rate curve exhibits a positive trend the same figure shows that the frequency of the periods under the drought conditions in the central region denotes an increase from 2004 onwards with a high concentration of periods under drought conditions from 2011 on by combining these results with those of fig 11 c one can conclude that it indicates not an increase in the frequency of the drought events as it could result from a preliminary analysis but an increase in the duration of the drought meaning longer consecutive periods under drought conditions the results from the kore frequency estimator combined to the characterization of the drought events suggest that in the northern slope and the central regions of madeira island there seem to occur a significant increase in the number of the periods under drought conditions and in the magnitude of drought events while in the southern region those periods had been more frequent in the past an increase of the drought occurrences in region rpc3 rg3 may alter the natural recharge of groundwater for which the high central areas are crucial as mentioned in section 2 resulting in a decreased runoff which is likely to exacerbate the already existing water scarcity problems duarte 1998 jeopardizing the water security in the island 4 5 climatic drivers teleconnected to drought events aiming at ascertaining whether there is or not an influence of the enso and nao phases on the properties of the droughts at the identified homogeneous regions as well as a possible enso nao relationship different periods were considered based on the long term term trends and breaking points of the cumulative soi 6 and naoi 6 by visually comparing the cumulative soi 6 and cumulative naoi 6 series fig 12 it is apparent that from 2001 to 2016 they denote a more pronounced increase and decrease respectively than in the past in the same figure two breakpoints were visually identified in each series and confirmed by applying the sequential mann kendall sqmk test for change point detection rahman et al 2017 with a 95 confidence interval namely in the years 1976 1977 and 1999 2000 these two breakpoints agree with two of the most severe droughts that affected north eastern south america the caribbean mostly the lesser antilles and regions of central america herrera and ault 2017 fig 12 suggests a strong relationship between the climate anomalies accompanying the enso and nao based on the aggregator transformation of soi and naoi data with a distinct seasonal dependence in both observations similar to mueller and roeckner 2006 who predict a strengthened negative correlation between the two climatic drivers indices in the future in general terms according to the figure the negative dominant phases occur during la niña dominance and the positive nao phases in el niño dominance the model output exhibits a 3 month delay in the emergence of the naoi signals i e the identified breakpoints occurred first on the cumulative soi 6 signal and later on the cumulative naoi 6 this long term comparison was performed because some earlier studies stated that the association between enso and nao is weak and difficult to detect in short observational records fraedrich 1994 according to mayuening et al 2015 la niña dominance period shows extreme upward slopes positive soi with dry conditions and its counterpart el niño dominance period negative soi with extreme downward slopes generally linked to wet conditions in contrast the strong positive phases of the naoi tend to be associated with dry conditions across northern europe and wet conditions in southern europe fig 6 opposite patterns i e wet conditions in the north and dry conditions in the south are typically observed during downward slopes of the naoi metoffice 2018 thus three subperiods of the entire span of data 1952 2016 were analyzed based on the detected change points in the cumulative series namely a 25 years from 1952 to 1976 with upward slopes of the cumulative soi 6 and downward slopes of the cumulative naoi 6 b 24 years from 1977 to 2000 with downward slopes of the cumulative soi 6 and upward slopes of the cumulative naoi 6 and c 16 years from 2001 to 2016 with extreme upward slopes of the cumulative soi 6 and extreme downward slopes of the cumulative naoi 6 the question to address is how these dominant periods affect the droughts it is expected that the drought characteristics during the positive and negative dominance phases of both cumulative naoi 6 and soi 6 would differ the duration magnitude and maximum intensity of the droughts at each identified homogeneous region and subperiods are shown based on combined violin plots hintze and nelson 1998 aiming at recognizing changes in the corresponding density functions fig 13 shows that in all cases the distributions are right skewed with absolute values of the sample means always higher than those of the medians in the first subperiod fig 13 a the interquartile ranges iqr of the properties in any of the three regions are relatively small and with similar density traces presenting just a few values outside the 95 intervals from the first subperiod to the second one 25 year and 24 year long respectively the number of drought events and of periods under drought conditions increased although the sample means do not significantly differ among regions the shapes of the distributions are quite different fig 13 b the distribution for the southern slope rg2 in the second subperiod changed to a multimodal distribution with two peaks fig 13b while for the other two regions there is a considerable increase in the confidence interval boundaries length of the whiskers despite the subperiods 1977 2000 and 2001 2016 have almost the same iqr figs 13b and 13 c the sample means were pulled up by a considerable high number of large values of dm and dmi in the more recent period although these results are in accordance with the ones from the kore frequency estimator obviously with some differences because the kore is applied only to the periods under drought conditions it was not possible to establish a clear relationship between enso nao and drought occurrence in fact although the violin plots of the first and third subperiods differ from those of the second subperiod they are not as similar as the same dominance phase would indicate nevertheless the results from both methods the kore and violin plots confirmed an increase of drought occurrence it is expected that these increases will be sustained in the island because the dominance of the climatic drivers phases over the most recent period 2001 2016 apparently has not ended yet the climatic signals soi 6 and naoi 6 were compared to the three regionalized spi6 series derived from the pca considering the entire span of data and the same three subperiods mentioned at the beginning of this section for the northern slope the correlations between the soi 6 and the spi6 of rpc1 rg1 are very low as shown in fig 14 a about 64 years from january 1952 to march 2016 and fig 14 b 24 years from january 1977 to december 2000 the results for the period with 25 years from january 1952 to december 1976 are not included in the figure because no significant correlations were found in contrast the correlation considering the shortest and most recent 16 year period from january 2001 to december 2016 is significant with a correlation coefficient of r 0 47 and a p value of 9 22e 10 fig 14 c as shown in fig 14d the shorter subperiod included the strongest la niña event positive soi in december 2010 followed by the worst drought intensity dmi 2 2 in august 2011 a similar behavior was observed at a larger scale in the cumulative soi 6 signal previously described in which the strongest la niña dominant periods were followed by very intense droughts the correlations between the soi 6 and the spi6 time series at the southern slope rpc2 rg2 and at the central region rpc3 rg3 are very low correlation coefficients r ranging from 0 15 to 0 47 regardless the considered periods the same procedures were repeated for the naoi 6 signal with surprisingly very poor correlations e g correlation coefficients r ranging from 0 15 to 0 21 at the northern slope these results may be improved if the definition of naoi was based not in azores but instead in a station located at latitude lower than the one of madeira fig 6 which however was not possible as mentioned before according to the results obtained there is not a clear evidence for a teleconnection between enso nao phenomena and the identified droughts in madeira island in the long term based on the adopted methodology nevertheless there are subperiods when such correspondence is achieved between la niña phases and the negative spi6 phases but only for the rpc1 rg1 and rpc3 rg3 which was an unexpected result this suggests that in the most recent period 2001 2016 the short term la niña phases could have somewhat an influence over the drought occurrences in these two regions this influence is more consistent than that in the case of el niño phases with meaningless correlation for instance the positive soi 6 phases and the negative spi6 phases of the rpc3 rg3 from january 2010 to december 2011 have a significant correlation of r 0 56 for 5 month lag not shown here which could be interpreted as the number of months that it takes for this regionalized spi6 to react to any changes in the soi 6 signal furthermore this teleconnection result is in agreement with the analysis of droughts tendency for the same 2 year period of fig 11c described in the previous section given that these findings are based on an index merely using precipitation data the spi and a limited number of time windows the total period with 65 years and three shorter sub periods the results here described should therefore be treated with caution a few remarks must be added namely related to the soi capacity to address the droughts in this sense the association between la niña el niño phases and droughts identified in the present work appears to be consistent with previous results despite the different methodologies applied and the studied areas vicente serrano et al 2017 by utilizing a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei concludes that la niña phases in the eastern pacific causes droughts in the western plains of ecuador by analyzing a timescale of 12 month spi spi12 from 56 meteorological stations in southern south america through the 1961 2008 period penalba and rivera 2016 found that there is an evident response on the spi12 to la niña phases for 12 month lag whereas there is no evidence of el niño influence on spi12 time series in contrast nguyen et al 2014 applied spi with a 3 month timescale at a vietnamese river basin which is three times the area of madeira island the author argues that when el niño occurs meteorological drought occurrence in the studied river basin is very likely therefore la niña could be associated to droughts in longer timescales of spi spi6 spi12 etc whereas el niño might be related to droughts in shorter timescales e g spi3 of the same index finally the results shown in this study mostly represent averages over several episodes of shorter duration it is hence of interest to further explore individual drought events teleconnected with enso nao dynamical processes the early stage teleconnection assessment presented in this paper aimed at understating possible impacts of climate change on the droughts evolution in madeira island 5 conclusions the paper presents the first long term and high resolution spatio temporal characterization of the droughts in madeira island by using rainfall data from a dense network comprising of 41 rain gauges considering a time span of 80 years from january 1937 to december 2016 to fill the data a specific procedure which is often applied to other scientific fields as previously discussed the mice algorithm was used with very encouraging results in fact mice proved to be able to preserve the long term observed rainfall data structure after filling even though some rain gauges had a relatively high percentage of missing data this is quite relevant for small islands which have constraints in data availability moderate drought conditions were assessed based on the spi computed on 6 month timescale spi6 related to agricultural droughts to analyze the variability of the moderate drought conditions as identified by the spi6 clustering techniques and pca were used by applying the varimax rotation to the first three component loadings three non overlapping homogeneous regions denoting different temporal variability were identified namely the rpc1 rg1 northern slope rpc2 rg2 southern slope and rpc3 rg3 central region these results support the idea that there are three representative drought variability regions based on spi6 it should be stressed that because of the location shape and relief of madeira island these regions also present quite different climate constraints the comparison between the regionalization obtained by using the pca and clusters derived from different clustering techniques would seem to suggest a satisfactory agreement regarding the rain gauges located in each homogeneous region these three regions have also different drought time dependent occurrence rates in recent years as described by the kore thus they should be considered separately for an improved water resources management under drought conditions in madeira island for a better understanding prevention and mitigation of the consequences of future drought events finally a comparison between the spi6 time series at the identified homogeneous regions and the el niño southern oscillation and north atlantic oscillation signals for the period 1952 2016 was made aiming at identifying possible dependencies between the drought events and extreme phases of the cumulative soi 6 and naoi 6 the analysis showed that the long term spi6 series and the naoi 6 had no correspondence whatsoever although the correlations r between the positive phases of soi 6 la niña phases and negative values of spi6 are relatively strong for some short recent periods in the northern slope and central regions it is not possible to establish a cause and effect relationship because such association sometimes fails thus further work needs to be performed with more recent data and from different stations not just the reykjavik azores stations to establish whether the periods under drought conditions are influenced by climatic signals such as enso and nao in general this study has gone some way towards enhancing the understanding about regional drought monitoring in madeira island in a changing environment moreover it showed that in recent years specifically the central region is suffering a considerable increase in the number of drought events and in their duration magnitude and maximum intensity due to the importance of this region in terms of groundwater recharge such information is of utmost importance regarding the planning of actions aiming at improving the water security in the island

8421,study region the mahaweli multipurpose water resources system of sri lanka spread across 25 500 km2 incorporates the mahaweli kala oya malwatu oya kantale oya and maduru oya river basins study focus we developed a model that can be used to assess water resources management alternatives of reservoir cascade operation to fulfill diverse and often conflicting water demands the mahaweli project is mainly operated for hydropower generation and irrigated agriculture this study quantifies performances of water management alternatives considering trade offs between hydropower and agricultural yield reliability resilience and vulnerability are other considerations that we explore new hydrological insights for the region in the mahaweli reservoir system water is used primarily for paddy irrigation and hydropower generation increasing water diversions for paddy irrigation leads to decreases in hydropower so in times of limited water availability decisions about trade offs are required in addition to diversions decisions about how much arable land to cultivate during times of water shortage affect measures of risk related to paddy yield our results show that existing infrastructure places a constraint on how much water diverted for irrigation can be used productively and also leads to spatial variability in improvements in risk measures at the expense of reductions in expected yield across the basin keywords mahaweli reservoir cascade hydropower irrigated agriculture reliability resilience vulnerability 1 introduction multipurpose reservoir cascades are managed to fulfill diverse and often conflicting water demands to as great an extent as possible these projects are operated for hydropower generation drinking water supply tourism irrigation flood regulation and navigation the spatial and temporal diversity of water users and the limited availability of water in some seasons require that trade offs be made in response to demands of the multiple water users for example if water managers keep reservoir water levels low during a wet period to meet flood protection goals there may not be enough water to meet agricultural water demands in a subsequent dry period one particularly important trade off for developing countries is between hydropower and irrigation digna et al 2018 räsänen et al 2015 tilmant et al 2009 if water is transferred from upstream reservoirs for irrigation downstream hydropower generation is penalized on the other hand if the water is taken from storage to run turbines to produce electricity during low irrigation water demand water may not be available later to be used for irrigation choices about how to operate a reservoir system will depend on how different aspects of performance are valued the economic value of products such as hydropower generation and agricultural goods is a measure of system performance sakthivadivel and molden 1999 evaluating trade offs between hydropower and agriculture can involve non economic preferences as well for example if agriculture is set as a priority elevating the fraction of water delivered to agricultural fields may be a goal maximizing system performance measures is the main operational goal for cascades but minimizing risks of failure is also a management goal evaluation of water allocation options in a cascade system requires an assessment of the reliability resilience and vulnerability to variable and uncertain basin inflows huizar et al 2018 jain and bhunya 2008 mateus and tullos 2016 saha et al 2017 srdjevic and srdjevic 2017 zhang et al 2017 since hashimoto et

et al 2013 conceptual simulation models based on water balance relationship have been used for reservoir operation evaluation of multiple river basins kling et al 2014 tinoco et al 2016 the mahaweli multipurpose water resources system of sri lanka furnishes water for irrigated agriculture and hydropower generation supplying about 20 of the annual irrigation water demand and 20 of the electrical energy demand of the country water managers need to balance diversion of mahaweli water to irrigation districts at the upstream end of the basin with downstream releases for hydropower generation and smaller irrigated agricultural systems specifically mahaweli water managers must consider spatial and temporal variability of hydrology across the cascade system limitations of installed infrastructure and trade offs among competing demands of hydropower and agriculture the objective of this study is to develop a relatively simple model to evaluate the performance of various water resources allocations in meeting the hydropower and irrigation water demands for the mahaweli multipurpose water resources system of sri lanka we develop a modular simulation model based on water balance principles for the mahaweli reservoir cascade which can be used to screen water allocation alternatives through overall system performance judged by hydropower generated paddy yield the fraction of water delivered to agriculture and a set of indices that describe the reliability resilience and vulnerability of the system 2 description of reservoir cascade the mahaweli multipurpose project of sri lanka fig 1 is spread across 25 500 km2 and is operated mainly for hydropower generation and irrigated agriculture seven major reservoirs of the mahaweli project are associated with hydropower plants with 815 mw capacity fig 2 downstream of these major hydropower reservoirs water is delivered to four irrigation systems a b c and e there are seven water distribution points where water allocations are managed the main diversion at polgolla currently is limited by rule to 875mm3 annually although the diversion tunnel has the capacity to transfer 1400 mm3 per year the diversion at polgolla supports hydropower plants with 78 mw and paddy farming with a capacity of 95 000 ha distribution points send water to ten agricultural systems the agricultural systems are named using capital letters fig 1 our overall system model includes the full complement of reservoirs diversions and distribution points fig 2 to provide clarity we selected five representative irrigation systems to illustrate the results from our model for the mahaweli complex two of the systems b and c are fed from the undiverted water used by upstream power plants of the mahaweli fig 3 the other three systems d1 d2 and h represent areas fed by water diverted first at polgolla and then at a set of distribution points system d1 and h are served by a number of small local irrigation reservoirs tanks whereas system d2 is fed by one irrigation tank fig 2 mahaweli system irrigation water for agriculture systems in paddy production is planned considering the monsoon rainfall pattern fig 4 the crop water requirement for each system is varied throughout the two agricultural seasons yala april september and maha october march which are based on the northeast monsoon nem and the southwest monsoon swm that bring rain to the country crop water requirements of mahaweli agricultural systems vary spatially according to the soil type and soil moisture content mahaweli authority of sri lanka 2017 all the agricultural systems of the dry zone of the country benefit from the second intermonsoon october november and the northeast monsoon december february during the maha season and irrigation water requirements are less for the maha season than for the yala season we use data on power production for each dam information about water requirements for agriculture systems fig 4 and 63 years of data on the system hydrology i e inflows to the reservoirs to calculate the hydropower and paddy production there are two growing seasons in each year so there are 126 seasons in the historical record to explore how the hydropower and irrigation systems perform for various water allocation options 3 methods we develop a simulation model for the mahaweli multipurpose project of sri lanka to evaluate water resource management alternatives to supply irrigation and hydropower demands the simulation model represents the major components of the system reservoirs agricultural systems and hydropower plants operational rules for reservoir water releases and water diversions are incorporated 3 1 simulation model the reservoir simulation model is developed in the matlab simulink platform 3 1 1

the minimum reservoir operating level smin using eqs 2 5 division by six in eq 3 is to reflect the need to supply water for the entire agricultural season which lasts for six months managing the reservoir cascade according to the composite storage volumes in all reservoirs to develop rule curves for individual reservoir releases is a way to achieve an overall optimal policy however due to calculation complexities and spatial differences in hydrometeorology and irrigation demands mahaweli system reservoir cascade rule curves have been developed individually the reservoir rule curves are based on the rainfall pattern of the catchment temporal variation of irrigation water demands and individual reservoir parameters 2 s i t s min q i t 0 3 s min s i t r c i t q i t s i t s min 6 4 s i

the water requirement for agricultural crops dti t fig 7 crop water requirement or water duty di t varies during the cycle from land preparation to harvesting in addition the crop water requirement varies spatially according to the soil type and soil moisture content rivera et al 2018 the total water requirement dti t is a product of water duty di t water requirement per unit area mm3 ha fig 4 and harvested land ai t from the total land available in the system we calculate the fraction ui t where total water demand dti t is met from available irrigation water iri t a water demand threshold mti t x of total arable land is specified and used to decide the success or failure of the agricultural season if ui t mti t the season is taken to be successful water managers can specify the water demand threshold taking into account water thresholds of irrigation systems in essence defining success by cutting back on the area irrigated when water is scarce for this study we specify the threshold as 90 for each time period 3 1 4 water distribution decision irrigation water from upstream reservoirs is distributed in two steps to the smaller irrigation tanks fig 8 first maximum

resilience and vulnerability indices and 3 the fraction of water delivered to irrigated fields 3 2 1 products of water users crop yield for agriculture and electricity produced from hydropower are taken as measures of production although the monetary value of electricity typically is higher than the monetary value of crops agricultural systems are associated with high employment opportunities and the social value is very high 3 2 2 reliability resilience and vulnerability reliability resilience and vulnerability indices are used to evaluate the performances of hydropower plants and agricultural systems ajami et al 2008 hashimoto et al 1982 loucks and van beek 2017 reliability is a measure of success of meeting water demands and resilience is a measure of recovering from a failure vulnerability measures the severity of failure jain and bhunya 2008 sandoval solis et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 the indices are calculated for each agricultural season in recognition of the way decisions for water allocation are made for this study the system is simulated using a monthly time step success or failure is identified by setting a threshold for the partial fulfillment of the demands for hydropower and agricultural systems for the seasons table 1 in section 3 1 3 fig 7 we estimate the success or failure of agricultural systems for each month and convert this data into the success of the six month season using the threshold we use satisfaction of a minimum of four months water requirement as a season success s t since we haven t taken into account all the local inflows to the agricultural systems and studying past seasonal data for 2002 2017 mahaweli authority of sri lanka 2017 we assume partial fulfillment as a success of season rather than requiring fulfillment of all six months water demands from irrigation water we use the 2002 2017 average as our threshold measure for hydropower table 1 since data for hydropower production are not available for all 63 years of the record to be consistent we use only energy data for hydropower plants operated throughout the 15 years for calculating the average value although there is no absolute reason for selecting the average as a threshold we consider it useful for comparison of hydropower reliability resilience and vulnerability values for different water allocation options the success or failure of a season v t is measured as x t where the state is set as one for success and zero for failure eq 9 hashimoto et al 1982 mondal and wasimi 2007 zhang et al 2017 9 x t 1 i f v t s u c c e s s 0 i f v t f a i l

total system is estimated from total water inflows to the reservoirs water releases for irrigation and losses total water inflow i to the system is consumed by agricultural systems i r is evaporated from the reservoir or tank e or is spilled s p eq 15 hydropower plants do not consume water so all water used for hydropower is available for irrigation in downstream areas water losses in waterways by evaporation and seepage and water losses in the reservoirs by seepage are not considered for the water balance model the share of water to the agricultural systems from the total is considered as the cascade s fractional agricultural utilization e f in our study we use cascade s fractional agricultural utilization as an indicator to measure the different water allocation options at the main water diversions of the water resources management in our study polgolla is the main water diversion location and fractional utilization is considered only as a metric to compare options for this diversion 15 t 1 t i 1 n i t i t 1 t i 1 m i r t i t 1 t i 1 n e t i s p t i e f t 1 t i 1 m i r t i t 1 t i 1 n i t i 3 3 evaluation of water allocation alternatives of mahaweli project several water allocation scenarios of mahaweli reservoir cascade are analyzed using the simulation model we examine two objectives associated with the agricultural systems 1 risk indices for each system according to water management decisions and 2 fraction of land from the total arable lands that have 100 reliability according to the given water management decisions because one agricultural adaptation mechanism for seasons with very limited irrigation water available is to cultivate only a fraction of the arable land available we also explore how performance varies considering planting decisions between 50 and 100 of the available land we explore performance relative to management options of maintaining the current maximum diversion at polgolla and of increasing the maximum diversion in steps up to 140 of the current value performance is measured in terms of 1 reliability resilience and vulnerability 2 fraction of water used by irrigation systems and 3 total agricultural crop yield and hydropower generation 4 results for the present polgolla water diversion policy the irrigation systems show variable performance measures system d2 shows the best reliability resilience and vulnerability values systems b c have higher reliability values than does system h while system h shows higher resilience and lower vulnerability table 2 the 15 year average hydropower production is met in 89 of the 126 seasons in the historical record the relative performance of the agricultural systems changes as the fraction of land cultivated decreases from 100 to 50 fig 9 in particular system h achieves the best performance indicators as the fraction of land irrigated decreases because water used for hydropower is available for irrigation downstream hydropower does not affect results for irrigation in systems below the diversion at polgolla there is no influence for hydropower generation with variation of land fraction reducing yields by decreasing the fraction of arable land cultivated from 100 to 50 results in improvements in risk performance measures fig 10 in systems b c reducing yield from 400 kt to 300 kt increases reliability from 0 6 to 0 74 and increases resilience from 0 66 to 0 76 patterns are similar for other systems although in system h resilience improvements are minimal after yield is reduced by one third note that the large yield values of system h and b c compared to system d1 simply reflect a difference in total land area in each changing the water diversion policy at polgolla has both positive and negative impacts fig 11 fig 12 performance of the system of hydropower plants and of irrigation systems b and c which are on the main stem of the mahaweli river below the diversion at polgolla become weaker with diversion of additional water to the northern area of the country and the performance of the irrigation systems supplied from the polgolla diversion d1 and h become stronger fig 11 as diversions at polgolla increase spills from the reservoirs off the main stem of the mahaweli river increase evaporation losses decrease and the fraction of water supplied to irrigate lands first increases and then decreases fig 12 a diverting water from upstream to the north reduces the natural mahaweli river flow diversion has an essentially non measurable impact on evaporation losses of downstream main reservoirs fig 12 b water diversion at polgolla involves a trade off between irrigated agriculture and hydropower generation beyond a 16 increase of the present water diversion at polgolla there is no enhancement of either the paddy yield or energy production fig 13 in fact beyond a 16 increase paddy yield actually decreases because systems on the main stem of the mahaweli e g b and c receive less water and thus are less productive while at the same time systems to the north that receive water diverted at polgolla e g d1 and h do not have the capacity to store the additional water and so agricultural production remains flat and spill losses increase a trade off frontier curve between hydropower and paddy yield for different increases in diversion shows that the feasible region for decisions about the tradeoff is between an average annual range of 1012 1034 mtonnes of paddy and 2186 2229 gw h of hydropower generation fig 13 b 5 discussion under the present policy for water diversion at polgolla the reliability resilience and vulnerability values show how different issues can affect different systems table 2 hydropower exceeds the recent 15 year average more than 70 of time using hydropower generation of the recent past years 2002 2017 for comparison however the low resilience 0 57 and comparatively high vulnerability 8 126 values demonstrate the uncertainty of hydropower generation limitations of infrastructure and spatial variability of available water constrain agricultural system performance for example system h has a poor reliability value because about 42 000 ha of arable land is supported by only 224 mm3 of local water storage capacity however a large local storage capacity does not improve risk measures if water is not available to supply the reservoirs and tanks for example systems b c about 48 000 ha show relatively weak performance despite being supported by a large water storage capacity of 742 mm3 figs 9 and 11 system d2 which has the best performance measures is a good example for high local storage capacity and an abundant supply of water although d1 is adjacent to d2 its risk measures are much worse due to a lack of infrastructure to distribute water one drought adaptation measure is to reduce the amount of cultivated land improvement of performances of agriculture systems under this adaptation measure varies across systems for example system h shows large improvements in resilience at 80 of land cultivated whereas systems d1 b and c show much more modest improvement fig 9 b due to advantageous climate and soil properties system h has a lower crop water requirement compared to other systems fig 4 and improves at a high rate in terms of resilience as the extent of arable land cultivated decreases this also is the reason for the marked improvement shown in system h as increased diversion at polgolla provides additional irrigation water fig 11 reducing the extent of irrigated lands involves trade offs between improving risk performance measures and reducing the yield and hence economic return of agricultural systems fig 10 the trade offs are not the same for different agricultural systems due to water availability and infrastructure for water storage notably the resilience improvement in system h is approximately double that in system b c fig 11 hence individual system performance can inform water management decisions performance measures downstream of the diversion at polgolla are sensitive to the water allocation policy fig 11 as expected performance of irrigation systems to the north is improved for higher diversions at polgolla beyond about a 16 increase in the diversion however water spilling from northern local reservoirs is increased fig 12 a and overall paddy production decreases because water is taken away from systems on the main stem of the mahaweli leading to decreased production there while the additional water diverted north cannot be stored and used efficiently so paddy production there remains flat fig 13 that is the fractional agricultural utilization e f decreases because spilling increases in addition although we have not accounted for environmental impacts in our analysis significant decreases in flow in the main mahaweli river will negatively impact social and natural capital downstream our results indicate that a simulation model based on a system dynamics approach can provide information to assist in analyzing consequences of water allocation decisions a relatively simple model such as we propose can be useful for a screening analysis of the impacts of proposed water allocation policies using a modest amount of data about the water resources project our case study of the mahaweli system shows that it is possible to develop a simulation model for a complex reservoir cascade using basic simulation blocks reservoir hydropower plant agriculture system and water distribution decision the simulink platform mathworks simulink 2018 is easy to understand and can be used by those with modest programming skills components of the reservoir cascade can be visualized and the model can be modified easily according to new infrastructure additions and parameter changes the relatively simple simulation model developed in the matlab simulink platform can be used for studying similar reservoir systems the performance of reservoir cascade systems in terms of economic products as well as in risk measures provide information to inform decisions about the operation and planning for future alternatives analysis of the performance of components of the overall system indicates limitations imposed by existing infrastructure and also changes that would result from proposed new infrastructure overall cascade performance measures in terms of economic products expose the energy yield trade offs of water sharing between hydropower and irrigated agriculture reliability resilience and vulnerability indices of agricultural systems vary according to the spatial variability of land properties water availability and infrastructure facilities knowledge about these variabilities across the systems can be used to fine tune system level decisions about the tradeoffs between increasing yields and increasing rrv metrics reducing the extent of cultivated land or changing of water allocations at one location provide only marginal improvement of rrv measures of most of the systems because changing the operation policy of one major location can marginally increase agricultural production but substantially decrease hydropower

8421,study region the mahaweli multipurpose water resources system of sri lanka spread across 25 500 km2 incorporates the mahaweli kala oya malwatu oya kantale oya and maduru oya river basins study focus we developed a model that can be used to assess water resources management alternatives of reservoir cascade operation to fulfill diverse and often conflicting water demands the mahaweli project is mainly operated for hydropower generation and irrigated agriculture this study quantifies performances of water management alternatives considering trade offs between hydropower and agricultural yield reliability resilience and vulnerability are other considerations that we explore new hydrological insights for the region in the mahaweli reservoir system water is used primarily for paddy irrigation and hydropower generation increasing water diversions for paddy irrigation leads to decreases in hydropower so in times of limited water availability decisions about trade offs are required in addition to diversions decisions about how much arable land to cultivate during times of water shortage affect measures of risk related to paddy yield our results show that existing infrastructure places a constraint on how much water diverted for irrigation can be used productively and also leads to spatial variability in improvements in risk measures at the expense of reductions in expected yield across the basin keywords mahaweli reservoir cascade hydropower irrigated agriculture reliability resilience vulnerability 1 introduction multipurpose reservoir cascades are managed to fulfill diverse and often conflicting water demands to as great an extent as possible these projects are operated for hydropower generation drinking water supply tourism irrigation flood regulation and navigation the spatial and temporal diversity of water users and the limited availability of water in some seasons require that trade offs be made in response to demands of the multiple water users for example if water managers keep reservoir water levels low during a wet period to meet flood protection goals there may not be enough water to meet agricultural water demands in a subsequent dry period one particularly important trade off for developing countries is between hydropower and irrigation digna et al 2018 räsänen et al 2015 tilmant et al 2009 if water is transferred from upstream reservoirs for irrigation downstream hydropower generation is penalized on the other hand if the water is taken from storage to run turbines to produce electricity during low irrigation water demand water may not be available later to be used for irrigation choices about how to operate a reservoir system will depend on how different aspects of performance are valued the economic value of products such as hydropower generation and agricultural goods is a measure of system performance sakthivadivel and molden 1999 evaluating trade offs between hydropower and agriculture can involve non economic preferences as well for example if agriculture is set as a priority elevating the fraction of water delivered to agricultural fields may be a goal maximizing system performance measures is the main operational goal for cascades but minimizing risks of failure is also a management goal evaluation of water allocation options in a cascade system requires an assessment of the reliability resilience and vulnerability to variable and uncertain basin inflows huizar et al 2018 jain and bhunya 2008 mateus and tullos 2016 saha et al 2017 srdjevic and srdjevic 2017 zhang et al 2017 since hashimoto et al 1982 proposed the use of reliability resilience and vulnerability indices as performance measures of water resources systems these indices have been used extensively for informing decisions in reservoir system planning and management ajami et al jain 2010 water resources must be simulated to estimate the evaluation metrics for water management alternatives complex models e g ribasim weap

approaches may not be necessary for initial assessments one powerful approach particularly useful at a screening level is a system dynamics approach jahandideh tehrani et al 2014 a system dynamics simulation of reservoir cascade operation reflects a simplified flow diagram with water balance equations used to calculate the reservoir storages and releases under a set of operating rules sharifi et al 2013 conceptual simulation models based on water balance relationship have been used for reservoir operation evaluation of multiple river basins kling et al 2014 tinoco et al 2016 the mahaweli multipurpose water resources system of sri lanka furnishes water for irrigated agriculture and hydropower generation supplying about 20 of the annual irrigation water demand and 20 of the electrical energy demand of the country water managers need to balance diversion of mahaweli water to irrigation districts at the upstream end of the basin with downstream releases for hydropower generation and smaller irrigated agricultural systems specifically mahaweli water managers must consider spatial and temporal variability of hydrology across the cascade system limitations of installed infrastructure and trade offs among competing demands of hydropower and agriculture the objective of this study is to develop a relatively simple model to evaluate the performance of various water resources allocations in meeting the hydropower and irrigation water demands for the mahaweli multipurpose water resources system of sri lanka we develop a modular simulation model based on water balance principles for the mahaweli reservoir cascade which can be used to screen water allocation alternatives through overall system performance judged by hydropower generated paddy yield the fraction of water delivered to agriculture and a set of indices that describe the reliability resilience and vulnerability of the system 2 description of reservoir cascade the mahaweli multipurpose project of sri lanka fig 1 is spread across 25 500 km2 and is operated mainly for hydropower generation and irrigated agriculture seven major reservoirs of the mahaweli project are associated with hydropower plants with 815 mw capacity fig 2 downstream of these major hydropower reservoirs water is delivered to four irrigation systems a b c and e there are seven water distribution points where water allocations are managed the main diversion at polgolla currently is limited by rule to 875mm3 annually although the diversion tunnel has the capacity to transfer 1400 mm3 per year the diversion at polgolla supports hydropower plants with 78 mw and paddy farming with a capacity of 95 000 ha distribution points send water to ten agricultural systems the agricultural systems are named using capital letters fig 1 our overall system model includes the full complement of reservoirs diversions and distribution points fig 2 to provide clarity we selected five representative irrigation systems to illustrate the results from our model for the mahaweli complex two of the systems b and c are fed from the undiverted water used by upstream power plants of the mahaweli fig 3 the other three systems d1 d2 and h represent areas fed by water diverted first at polgolla and then at a set of distribution points system d1 and h are served by a number of small local irrigation reservoirs tanks whereas system d2 is fed by one irrigation tank fig 2 mahaweli system irrigation water for agriculture systems in paddy production is planned considering the monsoon rainfall pattern fig 4 the crop water requirement for each system is varied throughout the two agricultural seasons yala april september and maha october march which are based on the northeast monsoon nem and the southwest monsoon swm that bring rain to the country crop water requirements of mahaweli agricultural systems vary spatially according to the soil type and soil moisture content mahaweli authority of sri lanka 2017 all the agricultural systems of the dry zone of the country benefit from the second intermonsoon october november and the northeast monsoon december february during the maha season and irrigation water requirements are less for the maha season than for the yala season we use data on power production for each dam information about water requirements for agriculture systems fig 4 and 63 years of data on the system hydrology i e inflows to the reservoirs to calculate the hydropower and paddy production there are two growing seasons in each year so there are 126 seasons in the historical record to explore how the hydropower and irrigation systems perform for various water allocation options 3 methods we develop a simulation model for the mahaweli multipurpose project of sri lanka to evaluate water resource management alternatives to supply irrigation and hydropower demands the simulation model represents the major components of the system reservoirs agricultural systems and hydropower plants operational rules for reservoir water releases and water diversions are incorporated 3 1 simulation model the reservoir simulation model is developed in the matlab simulink platform 3 1 1

reservoir spill spi t is a positive value when the total water ti t in a reservoir is greater than the reservoir capacity smax and otherwise is zero fig 5 reservoir area ai t and elevation hi t are calculated from the reservoir characteristics curves reservoir discharge qi t at each time step is determined according to the reservoir operation rules reservoir discharge qi t is determined from 1 a

the minimum reservoir operating level smin using eqs 2 5 division by six in eq 3 is to reflect the need to supply water for the entire agricultural season which lasts for six months managing the reservoir cascade according to the composite storage volumes in all reservoirs to develop rule curves for individual reservoir releases is a way to achieve an overall optimal policy however due to calculation complexities and spatial differences in hydrometeorology and irrigation demands mahaweli system reservoir cascade rule curves have been developed individually the reservoir rule curves are based on the rainfall pattern of the catchment temporal variation of irrigation water demands and individual reservoir parameters 2 s i t s min q i t 0 3 s min s i t r c i t q i t s i t s min 6 4 s i

is distributed to a number n of agricultural systems the success of meeting agricultural water demands in the ith agricultural system is measured by comparing irrigation water availability iri t and the water requirement for agricultural crops dti t fig 7 crop water requirement or water duty di t varies during the cycle from land preparation to harvesting in addition the crop water requirement varies spatially according to the soil type and soil moisture content rivera et al 2018 the total water requirement dti t is a product of water duty di t water requirement per unit area mm3 ha fig 4 and harvested land ai t from the total land available in the system we calculate the fraction ui t where total water demand dti t is met from available irrigation water iri t a water demand threshold mti t x of total arable land is specified and used to decide the success or failure of the agricultural season if ui t mti t the season is taken to be successful water managers can specify the water demand threshold taking into account water thresholds of irrigation systems in essence defining success by cutting back on the area irrigated when water is scarce for this study we specify the threshold as 90 for each time period 3 1 4 water distribution decision irrigation water from upstream reservoirs is distributed in two steps to the smaller irrigation tanks fig 8 first maximum

remaining water in upstream reservoirs is higher than the upstream reservoir capacity s m a x additional water i r 2 i t is distributed among the downstream irrigation tanks according to the availability of space in each tank c i t eq 8 if there is no space in the downstream irrigation tanks additional water is spilled eq 1 some agricultural systems have a dedicated irrigation tank to serve the local system while some others do not for these systems irrigation water requirement d t i t from upstream reservoirs is the deficit not served by local tanks for other systems it is the total water requirement for cultivation in eqs 7 and 8 n is the number of agricultural systems served by the upstream reservoirs 7 i r 1 i t i t d t i t i 1 n d t i t i t i 1 n d t i t d t i t i t i 1

resilience and vulnerability indices and 3 the fraction of water delivered to irrigated fields 3 2 1 products of water users crop yield for agriculture and electricity produced from hydropower are taken as measures of production although the monetary value of electricity typically is higher than the monetary value of crops agricultural systems are associated with high employment opportunities and the social value is very high 3 2 2 reliability resilience and vulnerability reliability resilience and vulnerability indices are used to evaluate the performances of hydropower plants and agricultural systems ajami et al 2008 hashimoto et al 1982 loucks and van beek 2017 reliability is a measure of success of meeting water demands and resilience is a measure of recovering from a failure vulnerability measures the severity of failure jain and bhunya 2008 sandoval solis et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 the indices are calculated for each agricultural season in recognition of the way decisions for water allocation are made for this study the system is simulated using a monthly time step success or failure is identified by setting a threshold for the partial fulfillment of the demands for hydropower and agricultural systems for the seasons table 1 in section 3 1 3 fig 7 we estimate the success or failure of agricultural systems for each month and convert this data into the success of the six month season using the threshold we use satisfaction of a minimum of four months water requirement as a season success s t since we haven t taken into account all the local inflows to the agricultural systems and studying past seasonal data for 2002 2017 mahaweli authority of sri lanka 2017 we assume partial fulfillment as a success of season rather than requiring fulfillment of all six months water demands from irrigation water we use the 2002 2017 average as our threshold measure for hydropower table 1 since data for hydropower production are not available for all 63 years of the record to be consistent we use only energy data for hydropower plants operated throughout the 15 years for calculating the average value although there is no absolute reason for selecting the average as a threshold we consider it useful for comparison of hydropower reliability resilience and vulnerability values for different water allocation options the success or failure of a season v t is measured as x t where the state is set as one for success and zero for failure eq 9 hashimoto et al 1982 mondal and wasimi 2007 zhang et al 2017 9 x t 1 i f v t s u c c e s s 0 i f v t f a i l

total system is estimated from total water inflows to the reservoirs water releases for irrigation and losses total water inflow i to the system is consumed by agricultural systems i r is evaporated from the reservoir or tank e or is spilled s p eq 15 hydropower plants do not consume water so all water used for hydropower is available for irrigation in downstream areas water losses in waterways by evaporation and seepage and water losses in the reservoirs by seepage are not considered for the water balance model the share of water to the agricultural systems from the total is considered as the cascade s fractional agricultural utilization e f in our study we use cascade s fractional agricultural utilization as an indicator to measure the different water allocation options at the main water diversions of the water resources management in our study polgolla is the main water diversion location and fractional utilization is considered only as a metric to compare options for this diversion 15 t 1 t i 1 n i t i t 1 t i 1 m i r t i t 1 t i 1 n e t i s p t i e f t 1 t i 1 m i r t i t 1 t i 1 n i t i 3 3 evaluation of water allocation alternatives of mahaweli project several water allocation scenarios of mahaweli reservoir cascade are analyzed using the simulation model we examine two objectives associated with the agricultural systems 1 risk indices for each system according to water management decisions and 2 fraction of land from the total arable lands that have 100 reliability according to the given water management decisions because one agricultural adaptation mechanism for seasons with very limited irrigation water available is to cultivate only a fraction of the arable land available we also explore how performance varies considering planting decisions between 50 and 100 of the available land we explore performance relative to management options of maintaining the current maximum diversion at polgolla and of increasing the maximum diversion in steps up to 140 of the current value performance is measured in terms of 1 reliability resilience and vulnerability 2 fraction of water used by irrigation systems and 3 total agricultural crop yield and hydropower generation 4 results for the present polgolla water diversion policy the irrigation systems show variable performance measures system d2 shows the best reliability resilience and vulnerability values systems b c have higher reliability values than does system h while system h shows higher resilience and lower vulnerability table 2 the 15 year average hydropower production is met in 89 of the 126 seasons in the historical record the relative performance of the agricultural systems changes as the fraction of land cultivated decreases from 100 to 50 fig 9 in particular system h achieves the best performance indicators as the fraction of land irrigated decreases because water used for hydropower is available for irrigation downstream hydropower does not affect results for irrigation in systems below the diversion at polgolla there is no influence for hydropower generation with variation of land fraction reducing yields by decreasing the fraction of arable land cultivated from 100 to 50 results in improvements in risk performance measures fig 10 in systems b c reducing yield from 400 kt to 300 kt increases reliability from 0 6 to 0 74 and increases resilience from 0 66 to 0 76 patterns are similar for other systems although in system h resilience improvements are minimal after yield is reduced by one third note that the large yield values of system h and b c compared to system d1 simply reflect a difference in total land area in each changing the water diversion policy at polgolla has both positive and negative impacts fig 11 fig 12 performance of the system of hydropower plants and of irrigation systems b and c which are on the main stem of the mahaweli river below the diversion at polgolla become weaker with diversion of additional water to the northern area of the country and the performance of the irrigation systems supplied from the polgolla diversion d1 and h become stronger fig 11 as diversions at polgolla increase spills from the reservoirs off the main stem of the mahaweli river increase evaporation losses decrease and the fraction of water supplied to irrigate lands first increases and then decreases fig 12 a diverting water from upstream to the north reduces the natural mahaweli river flow diversion has an essentially non measurable impact on evaporation losses of downstream main reservoirs fig 12 b water diversion at polgolla involves a trade off between irrigated agriculture and hydropower generation beyond a 16 increase of the present water diversion at polgolla there is no enhancement of either the paddy yield or energy production fig 13 in fact beyond a 16 increase paddy yield actually decreases because systems on the main stem of the mahaweli e g b and c receive less water and thus are less productive while at the same time systems to the north that receive water diverted at polgolla e g d1 and h do not have the capacity to store the additional water and so agricultural production remains flat and spill losses increase a trade off frontier curve between hydropower and paddy yield for different increases in diversion shows that the feasible region for decisions about the tradeoff is between an average annual range of 1012 1034 mtonnes of paddy and 2186 2229 gw h of hydropower generation fig 13 b 5 discussion under the present policy for water diversion at polgolla the reliability resilience and vulnerability values show how different issues can affect different systems table 2 hydropower exceeds the recent 15 year average more than 70 of time using hydropower generation of the recent past years 2002 2017 for comparison however the low resilience 0 57 and comparatively high vulnerability 8 126 values demonstrate the uncertainty of hydropower generation limitations of infrastructure and spatial variability of available water constrain agricultural system performance for example system h has a poor reliability value because about 42 000 ha of arable land is supported by only 224 mm3 of local water storage capacity however a large local storage capacity does not improve risk measures if water is not available to supply the reservoirs and tanks for example systems b c about 48 000 ha show relatively weak performance despite being supported by a large water storage capacity of 742 mm3 figs 9 and 11 system d2 which has the best performance measures is a good example for high local storage capacity and an abundant supply of water although d1 is adjacent to d2 its risk measures are much worse due to a lack of infrastructure to distribute water one drought adaptation measure is to reduce the amount of cultivated land improvement of performances of agriculture systems under this adaptation measure varies across systems for example system h shows large improvements in resilience at 80 of land cultivated whereas systems d1 b and c show much more modest improvement fig 9 b due to advantageous climate and soil properties system h has a lower crop water requirement compared to other systems fig 4 and improves at a high rate in terms of resilience as the extent of arable land cultivated decreases this also is the reason for the marked improvement shown in system h as increased diversion at polgolla provides additional irrigation water fig 11 reducing the extent of irrigated lands involves trade offs between improving risk performance measures and reducing the yield and hence economic return of agricultural systems fig 10 the trade offs are not the same for different agricultural systems due to water availability and infrastructure for water storage notably the resilience improvement in system h is approximately double that in system b c fig 11 hence individual system performance can inform water management decisions performance measures downstream of the diversion at polgolla are sensitive to the water allocation policy fig 11 as expected performance of irrigation systems to the north is improved for higher diversions at polgolla beyond about a 16 increase in the diversion however water spilling from northern local reservoirs is increased fig 12 a and overall paddy production decreases because water is taken away from systems on the main stem of the mahaweli leading to decreased production there while the additional water diverted north cannot be stored and used efficiently so paddy production there remains flat fig 13 that is the fractional agricultural utilization e f decreases because spilling increases in addition although we have not accounted for environmental impacts in our analysis significant decreases in flow in the main mahaweli river will negatively impact social and natural capital downstream our results indicate that a simulation model based on a system dynamics approach can provide information to assist in analyzing consequences of water allocation decisions a relatively simple model such as we propose can be useful for a screening analysis of the impacts of proposed water allocation policies using a modest amount of data about the water resources project our case study of the mahaweli system shows that it is possible to develop a simulation

components of the overall system indicates limitations imposed by existing infrastructure and also changes that would result from proposed new infrastructure overall cascade performance measures in terms of economic products expose the energy yield trade offs of water sharing between hydropower and irrigated agriculture reliability resilience and vulnerability indices of agricultural systems

8422,study region the 69 km2 owabi catchment in ghana study focus the soil water assessment tool swat was used to assess the hydro climatic variability resulting from anthropogenic activities from 1986 to 2015 specifically the model simulated historic and projected stream flow and water balance future stream flow projections were modelled for three climate ensembles under three different representative concentration pathways rcps for two land use categories new hydrological insights for the region initial results revealed that forest and topography played major role in water loss whereas evapotranspiration and surface runoff were the dominant modulating processes monthly calibration validation of the model yielded acceptable results with nse r2 pbias and rsr values of 0 66 0 67 0 67 0 67 8 2 8 0 and 0 59 0 58 respectively uncertainty was fairly low and the model enveloped about 50 of the observed stream flow the rcp projections for all land use categories showed decreasing rainfall and streamflow trends the model proved efficient in determining the catchment hydrology parameters and has potential to be used for further modelling of water quality and pollution to aid in effective water management keywords hydro climate stream flow water resource management climate change swat model 1 introduction rainfall plays a significant role in the hydrology cycle and is an essential resource for global socio economic activities major stakeholders depend on various aspects of the cycle on different time scales for instance rain fed agriculture which is dominant in africa has been found to operate well if soil moisture is replenished at least every 15 days lofgren and gronewold 2014 stream flow which is also important for flood control hydro power navigation and ecological factors has its high and low extremes being controlled by rainfall and groundwater base flow respectively lofgren and gronewold 2014 water planners and managers rely on assumptions that past and future climatic trends will be the same and hence water supply systems such as dams are built with these assumptions in mind mukheibir 2007 however current climate change and variability is offsetting precipitation globally posing a dire threat to water resource management wrm according to studies by kankam yeboah et al 2012 and see references therein without climate change considerations ghana is likely to be water deficient by 2025 this situation is projected to exacerbate with increased anthropogenic activities which will negatively impact future water resources by restricting their use to meet growing demand kankam yeboah et al 2012 the most anticipated anthropogenic activity which will affect water availability is land use and land cover changes studies in ghana have shown that land degradation arising from improper agricultural practices and illegal mining have a high negative impact factor on river systems ayivor and gordon 2012 urbanisation has also posed serious threat on agricultural land and water bodies resulting in 38 and 3 decline between 1985 and 2010 in accra yeboah et al 2017 adjei et al 2014 observed that changes in land use from 1986 to 2008 has gradually reduced the area of water coverage at the lake bosomtwe basin at a pace of 0 03 per annum this lake is amongst the few youngest and best preserved meteorite craters found globally adjei et al 2014 and references therein wrm problems are best tackled through the integrated water resource management iwrm approach by providing a stronger coordination between stakeholders in planning and managing of water resources in river basins zhang et al 2014 ghana s implementation of iwrm at the river basin level begun with the most water stressed basins in the country water resource commission 2012a one of such basins is the pra of which the owabi catchment serves as a sub tributary a dam on this catchment provides 20 of total potable water to the kumasi metropolis and its environs however increasing human activities including deforestation sand winning illegal logging indiscriminate dumping of waste has reduced the quality and quantity of water production at the dam consequently this has imposed severe threat on water resource and ecosystem management various studies have been undertaken to quantify this damage on the owabi catchment for instance forkuo and frimpong 2012 mapped the owabi catchment using gis and observed a 38 9 decrease in forest cover from 1986 to 2007 which is attributable to increase in human activities and population explosion within the catchment area agyen brefo 2012 explored the effects of encroachment on sustainable public land management at owabi and found a resulting negative effect on land use planning and building regulations high cost of water production and reduction of government revenue in addition water quality at the catchment using factor analysis has shown a degradation of the catchment water when compared to world health organisation standards for safe drinking water akoto and abankwa 2014 although these studies are extremely useful for water management their impacts on the hydrology is yet to be assessed hence the present study performed a hydro climatic modelling to observe the impact of the landuse changes on the catchment a well documented and tested hydrological model which has been widely used for these assessments is the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012a b shope et al 2014 the swat model incorporates a geographical information system gis interface to give meaningful insights into the water balance sediments and pollutant transfer in a drainage network uzeika et al 2011 the swat model is prominent for its continuous long term simulations of hydro climatic variables sudjarit et al 2015 as well as satisfying its developmental aim of testing and predicting water and sediment routing in ungauged basins gayathri et al 2015 it is capable of evaluating the effects of best management practices on water resources in both large and small river basins see uzeika et al 2011 srinivasan et al 2010 shope et al 2014 me et al 2015 and has returned favourable performance rate when calibrated for instance abraham et al 2007 calibrated and validated the swat model for an ethiopian catchment and found slight under and over estimation of peak flows for some years nonetheless the overall performance of the model was good for catchment simulations govender and everson 2005 used the manual calibration technique to model stream flow for two catchments in south africa where the increasing demand for timber has drastically changed land use cover and hydrological processes although there was a good response between simulated and observed stream flows the model was unable to account for evapotranspiration losses schuol and abbaspour 2006 deduced that the model has a huge potential for freshwater quantification after application to the niger volta and senegal river basins in west africa a study by begou et al 2016 on the bani catchment revealed that calibration at the subbasin scale resulted in better performance than using global parameter set the swat model has also been a promising tool in studying the effects of landuse and landcover evolution on hydrology ongoing studies such as guzha et al 2018 in east africa and demeke and andualem 2018 and welde and gebremariam 2017 in ethiopia observed increases in streamflow surface runoff and peak flows when forest land is degraded puno et al 2019 also observed that urbanisation has resulted in increases in evapotranspiration baseflow and surface runoff meanwhile an increase in forest cover showed minimal decrease in surface runoff and baseflow some other studies include ghaffari et al 2010 pokhrel 2018 nie et al 2011 and li et al 2019 over ghana only a handful of studies have been undertaken using the swat model kankam yeboah et al 2013 investigated the impact of climate change on stream flow in two selected river basins white volta and pra in ghana after model calibration their results revealed a decline between 22 and 50 of stream flow in both the white volta and pra basins for the periods of 2006 2035 and 2036 2075 sood et al 2013 found a decrease of about 40 in river flows resulting from decreases in rainfall and increases in temperature bair 2014 applied the swat model in a cocoa growing region within the pra basin to aid in future studies of land management practices the results showed that the swat model was not yet accurate enough to be used in predicting changes in land management practices based on a negative nash sutcliffe efficiency score of 0 43 the model was also found to be a promising tool when used as part of an integrated decision support system to monitor the effects of small scale irrigation methods on agriculture and socio economic activities worqlul et al 2018 based on swat model simulations akpoti et al 2015 found that wet and dry season discharges have increased by 1 and 6 due to changes in landuse and land cover between 2000 and 2013 at the black volta river basin at the white volta basin awotwi and kumi 2015 observed changes in the water balance with a decrease in land cover correlating with decline in surface water and baseflow and increase in evapotranspiration rates the aim of this study is to model the impact of climate and land use changes on the hydrological processes of owabi catchment using swat specifically the swat model was used to simulate stream flow and establish the water balance and project stream flow amounts under different climatic and land use scenarios for the catchment the study is the first of its kind to be performed on a smaller ungauged catchment in ghana the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows the study site is described in section 2 the methodology is given in section 3 results and discussions in section 4 and finally the conclusions in section 5 2 study site description the owabi catchment fig 1 has been designated since 1988 as the only inland ramsar site in ghana it comprises of the forest reserve sanctuary and the owabi waterworks and covers about 69 km2 akoto and abankwa 2014 of land area its location is between latitudes 6 7292 n and 6 7519 n and longitudes 1 7139 w and 1 6704 w within the catchment is a 13 km2 forest reserve enclosing a water reservoir forestry commission 2014 this forest reserve is one of the smallest conservation sites in ghana and its protection responsibility lies solely with the department of game and wildlife forkuo and frimpong 2012 nonetheless protection of the site has not deterred high human encroachment and other illegal activities the hydrological unit is situated in the inner perimeter of the sanctuary fig 1 the river was dammed in 1928 with the primary aim of supplying 20 of potable drinking water to the kumasi metropolis the catchment rests in the forest belt of ghana where rainfall is strongly modulated by the west african monsoon wam and convective activities resulting from movements of the inter tropical discontinuity itd the wam is primarily driven by temperature and energy gradients between the gulf of guinea and the sahara amekudzi et al 2015 movement of the itd results in bimodal rainfall regimes in this region with the presence of the river and dense vegetation inducing a micro climate which influences the rainfall patterns temperature and humidity in the catchment the mean rainfall is about 1450 mm per annum aryee et al 2018 and average monthly temperatures between 24 6 and 27 8 c geologically the area falls within the birimian meta sediment of the kumasi basin which consists of phyllites granodiorites schists greywackes tuffs and the associated granitoid forkuo and frimpong 2012 forestry commission 2014 and orthic acrisols as the dominant soil type 3 methodology 3 1 swat model description swat is a river basin scale semi distributed and physically based model that operates on a daily timescale but also capable of simulating outputs on monthly and annual timescales it was initially developed by the united states department of agriculture to model land management practices on sediment water and agro chemical yields in ungauged catchments the model is highly rated for its computational efficiency and long term continuous simulations the important inputs of the model include rainfall and temperature digital elevation model soil and land use maps as well as output simulations of water balance nutrient and sediment loadings arnold et al 2012b the computational hydrology framework of the model is based on the land and water routing sections of the hydrological cycle the land division regulates the amount of water nutrient sediment and pest loadings into the main channel in every subbasin the latter division defines the path of water and sediments through the basin channels to the outlet sudjarit et al 2015 the initial step for catchment simulation is the catchment delineation where subbasins and hydrological response units hrus are defined arnold et al 2012a swat utilises eq 1 to simulate the hydrological cycle ghoraba 2015 the hydrological cycle is climate dependent and supplies energy and moisture inputs such as daily rainfall maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation the data can be read directly from files by swat to produce simulated data at runtime 1 sw t sw o i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw i where t is time days sw o and sw t

version 2 6 1 and qswat version 1 4 swat v2012 downloaded from http swat tamu edu software were employed for the study spatial input dataset were obtained from open source websites shown in table 1 the catchment elevation fig 2 was within 220 m and 394 m with mean of 265 m above mean sea level all these data excluding hydro meteorological parameters were in a raster format and geo processed for model input as described in dile et al 2016 after model run a total area of 69 km2 basin boundary was delineated with 16 subbasins and 80 hrus six dominant land use categories and one soil type were observed within the owabi catchment as shown in fig 2 the observed soil orthic acrisols are deeply weathered and consist of thin dark greyish brown humus stained sandy loam and silt loam topsoils with moderate fine granular structure adjei gyapong and asiamah 2002 it also has a high water holding capacity at the first horizon top or surface soil fao 1977 wrb 2014 however the density of the second horizon is high which limits internal drainage by obstructing the infiltration of water into much deeper layers fao 1977 wrb 2014 3 2 2 hydro meteorological input daily rainfall and temperature minimum and maximum were obtained from ghana meteorological agency gmet from 1980 to 2015 table 1 missing rainfall and temperature gaps were filled using the arithmetic averaging method from the closest meteorological stations these stations see fig 3 included barekese 6 8481 n 1 7198 w offinso 7 3049 n 1 7928 w and kumasi airport 6 7125 n 1 5911 w based on the climatic data available the hargreaves method was used for the estimation of evapotranspiration rates on the catchment the lack of stream flow data was a major limitation of this paper for model calibration and validation this limitation can be offset through the application of regionalisation or artificial neural networks for stream flow determination hrachowitz et al 2013 the regionalisation scheme uses multiple donor catchments to extract detailed information to increase the predictive performance of the hydrological model at the ungauged basin arsenault and brissette 2016 stream flow records were transferred from the offinso gauging station whose main channel the offin river drains into the barekese catchment this station is the closest and located about 30 km away from the owabi catchment similar attributes of the barekese catchment with the owabi catchment are a mean elevation of 277 m orthic acrisol as soil type semi deciduous forests voltain birimian and granite geology bi modal rainfall regime and rapid urbanisation in the last decade ghana statistical service 2014 annual rainfall at is about 1400 mm domfeh et al 2015 while based on studies such as forkuo and frimpong 2012 and aryee et al 2018 the annual mean rainfall for owabi ranges between 1450 and 1488 mm this imply a rainfall difference of about 50 90 mm at the two catchments based on their similarity index the physical similarity regionalisation method as used in oudin et al 2008 swain and patra 2017 arsenault and brissette 2016 and references therein was used the raw stream flow data at offinso is transferred to the owabi catchment and used for model analysis prior to this a drainage area ratio was implemented to downscale the discharge data to catchment size of owabi however this method failed with extremely low and unrealistic discharge estimates for owabi thorough review of the regionalisation methods can be found in hrachowitz et al 2013 the stream flow data time series was monthly and spanned the period of 2001 2010 as seen in table 1 3 2 3 projection dataset land use a 30 year 2021 2050 stream flow for the owabi catchment was predicted under two land uses and three climate change scenarios for the landuse agrl comprises of a mosaic greater than 50 natural vegetation of trees shrubs and herbaceous cover with cropland covering less than 50 while agrr is rainfed cropland ucl geomatics 2017 the agrl footprint at the owabi catchment is observed as part of the 13 km2 forest reserve frse which is under strict protection of the ghana forestry commission forest guards are known to patrol the forest at least twice a day with severe penalties awarded on any defaulters the cropland component of agrl are usually subsistence farming undertaken by residents who reside close to the forest boundaries and hence makes for the lower 50 in cropland the total area of the landuse watr is similar to the protected forest cover has remained intact over the years probably due to the existence of the forest currently these landuses rnge and agrr are under an ongoing severe threat of conversion to settlement due to rapid urbanisation and the proximity of the catchment area to the central business district of the kumasi metropolis since forestry rules are unlikely to be relaxed for the benefits of residents it is likely that current settlement areas can either remain the same or grasslands rnge and rain fed croplands agrr would be urbanised to support growing population these assumptions formed the criteria for developing the two land use scenarios for land use scenario 1 lu1 an unchanging land use category as observed in the baseline trend was considered in land use scenario 2 lu2 fig 2 the conversion of all land uses except forest frse natural vegetation agrl and water watr categories into settlement urbanisation areas was assumed 3 2 4 projection dataset climatic future daily rainfall and temperature minimum and maximum from the fourth generation canadian regional climate model canrcm4 were used as climate forcing for the swat model these were projected under three representative concentration pathways rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and contained three different ensembles r1i1p1 r2i1p1 and r3i1p1 the three ensembles differed only in their initial conditions r1 r2 r3 but have the same initialisation methods i1 and underlying perturbation physics p1 taylor et al 2010 the rcps have been called according to the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases and other agents by the year of 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 the rcp2 6 suggests a low level forcing with emissions reaching a peak of 3 0 w m2 rcp4 5 is a stable pathway which peaks at 4 5 w m2 whiles rcp8 5 is the worst scenario with rising radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 van vuuren et al 2011 the cmhyd software rathjens et al 2016 was used for bias correction of the projection climate data and has about seven bias correction options available for precipitation and temperature these comprised of distribution mapping of precipitation and temperature linear scaling delta change correction precipitation local intensity scaling power transformation of precipitation all these options were used to correct for biases in the historic rainfall and temperature datasets which included the observed data and that of the rcm from 1980 to 2015 after correction the best algorithm option was the distribution mapping and hence was chosen for the climate change analysis due to the high variability of rainfall the distribution mapping module assumes a gamma distribution of the dataset with shape and scale parameters α and β respectively the distribution profile is controlled by α and for α 1 the distribution is exponentially shaped α 1 gives a special exponential distribution case whiles α 1 gives a skewed uni modal distribution teutschbein and seibert 2012 alternatively β determines the dispersion of the gamma distribution with smaller larger values leading to a compressed stretched distribution with lower higher probabilities of extreme events teutschbein and seibert 2012 for the temperature data the module assumes a gaussian distribution due to less variations especially in the tropics with location and scale parameters μ and σ the location of the distribution is controlled by μ whiles σ determines the standard deviation with smaller larger indicating lower higher probabilities of extreme events for further review see teutschbein and seibert 2012 the bias corrected rainfall and temperature for the historical climate model spanning overlapping years of 1979 2005 revealed a satisfactory correlation with the measured datasets under all rcp ensembles for instance for the rcp2 6 ensemble r1i1p1 the observed historical rainfall was found to be exponentially skewed α 0 96 whiles the bias corrected model historic was uni modally skewed α 4 09 with higher tendencies of extreme events especially in the wet seasons β 9 89 observed historic and β 2 62 model historic standard deviations for minimum and maximum temperatures were also quite low for extremities observed historic 1 40 2 59 and corrected model historic 1 58 2 34 3 3 calibration validation and uncertainty assessment the auto calibration tool swat cup with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour 2015 was used for calibration techniques sufi 2 is known to estimate both parameter and model uncertainties in hydrological models abbaspour 2015 table 2 shows the objective functions used in assessing the overall model performance as well as their required satisfactory thresholds as described in moriasi et al 2007 and abbaspour 2015 the global sensitivity test for sensitivity analysis was evaluated using the t stat and the p value whiles p and r factors were used for uncertainty analysis at a 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu the p factor is the percentage of the measured data that is captured by the 95ppu and an ideal value of 1 indicates that all correct processes have been accurately captured by the model arnold et al 2012b however for stream flow a p factor 0 70 is the better choice of model fit although it is also acceptable for the model to cover more than half of the observed data abbaspour 2015 the r factor shows the calibration quality and an ideal value of 0 implies a direct fit of the simulated stream flow with the observed arnold et al 2012b other model performance indices used included nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percentage bias pbias and rmse standard deviation ratio rsr arnold et al 2012b 4 results and discussions 4 1 sensitivity analysis for calibration analysis 14 parameters arnold et al 2012b see table 3 that affect surface runoff and baseflow have been selected from literature the selected parameters were also chosen to reflect as much as possible all hydrological processes that might be occurring within the owabi catchment the results of the global sensitivity analysis showed that three 3 of these parameters regulated the outlet stream flow in the basin these included surface cn2 surlag and groundwater alpha bf processes the curve number for average soil moisture cn2 was the most sensitive among these three with other catchment studies reporting likewise see arnold et al 2012b and references therein 4 2 performance of swat calibration validation using the physical similarity method the performance of the physical similarity method was based on the statistical indices obtained during the model calibration and validation and this was hypothesised to have a direct relationship such that a satisfactory model performance corresponded with a satisfactory performance of the physical similarity approach the swat model was run for 36 years with the first 6 years used as model initialisation warm up the model was calibrated from 2001 to 2006 6 years and validated from 2007 to 2010 4 years the results of the calibrated and validated model is shown in fig 4 for calibration validation there was consistency in the model s simulation of the seasonal stream flow dynamics and concurrently followed the rainfall pattern the swat model performance was satisfactory as evident in the nse 0 66 and r2 0 67 considering that the observed data was obtained from a catchment which is about 12 times the size of the study area the performance was enhanced especially during the dry seasons with occasionally slight overestimations in some few cases the only sensitive groundwater parameter is the baseflow which serves as a secondary contributor of stream flow in the form of lateral flow during the dry season to support water production by the owabi water processing plant it was also observed that for rainy months see fig 4 in which the mean monthly rainfall amounts were lower hence low stream flow amounts the model treated such periods as dry and always over estimated the stream flow amounts this is observable in march to july 2004 and september to october 2006 where stream flow observed for the rainy period were lower than other calibration years the low rains experienced in the former months resulted in short intense rainfall in september to december 2004 which was poorly captured by the model overall the prediction error for stream flow calibration was within an acceptable range as reflected in the pbias 8 2 and rsr 0 59 the monthly validation fig 4 also showed a good output between the simulated and the observed stream flow datasets the overall model performance conforms with a hydrological review undertaken by gassman et al 2007 the highest observed stream flow peak during calibration was obtained in may 2005 8 12 cms however this was poorly simulated by the model 4 30 cms alternatively the highest best simulated peak stream flow by the model was in october 2002 7 12 cms likewise for validation the peak was seen in september 2007 for observed 12 11 cms and june 2010 for simulated 8 44 cms table 4 shows a summary of the statistics obtained for model calibration and validation overall the acceptable values obtained from the statistical metrics gives a first hand indication that the physical similarity method is an efficient means of generating stream flow at the owabi catchment 4 3 uncertainty analysis the parameter uncertainty that results from non uniqueness of effective model parameters conceptual model and input uncertainties schuol and abbaspour 2006 were satisfactory as observed from 95ppu table 4 the model bracketed about 0 51 0 52 of the observed data at the expense of a quite low enveloping width of 0 55 0 45 the model uncertainties would be the inability to incorporate some important processes occurring within the catchment in the swat model setup most of these processes especially from human activities which are likely to go unnoticed are bound to occur upstream of the owabi dam which is highly populated however although previous sand winning activities on the catchment could affect the hydrology its extent was not incorporated due to inadequate quantification data the inability of the model to capture the accepted 70 of observational data might be associated with uncertainties in the input dataset both rainfall temperature and stream flow data are influenced by systematic errors of measuring instruments however the spatial distribution of temperature is homogeneous within the tropics and specifically around the owabi catchment and hence has minimal errors on model calibration rain gauges on the other hand are known to have uncertainties with average systematic error magnitudes of about 5 6 and random error magnitude of about 5 mcmillan et al 2012 it has been ascertained that the owabi meteorological station has not been relocated since the beginning of the study period and therefore any erroneous measurements may arise from faulty instruments or the inability of the rain gauges to measure intense short and long duration of storm events furthermore the neighbouring station gauges used for gap in filling are likely to propagate their individual errors also into the owabi climatic dataset the stage discharge measurement of stream flow at the offin river is also prone to errors during discharge computations in both instrumentation and quality control which results in potential outliers in dataset although the uncertainty is acceptable the transfer of raw stream flow data from the donor to receiver catchment could also force errors to be transferred directly into the calibration process especially in inaccurate simulation of high peak flows 4 4 water balance the most important components of the water balance of any hydrological basin are the rainfall surface runoff baseflow lateral flow and evapotranspiration however unlike rainfall that is easily measured the other variables need prediction for their quantification ghoraba 2015 the best parameter values were used to rerun the calibrated model to obtain an estimate of the water balance for the catchment the swat check tool white et al 2014 was also employed to obtain the percentage distribution of rainfall for the water balance components the 30 year seasonal water balance is visualised in fig 5 which shows that the most dominant pathways for water loss on the catchment was observed to be actual evapotranspiration aet and surface runoff due to the quick response to rain and a hydrological soil group of type d within the entire basin surface runoff hortonian contributes to about 68 of total flow at the catchment with baseflow obtaining the remaining 32 the total flow represents the total amount of water that is converted into stream flow furthermore the evapotranspiration has the highest percentage of rain water loss at 55 while the stream flow variance in rainfall was found to be 42 percolation and deep recharge had the least amounts of 16 and 1 respectively the 30 year potential evapotranspiration pet average as calculated from the hargreaves method the owabi catchment is located within the equatorial region and hence much higher insolation and temperatures that favours the potential evapotranspiration sanderson et al 2010 the seasonal trend of pet fig 5 observed higher tendencies before the onset of rains in march but experiences reduction when penetrating into the major and minor wet seasons resulting from rigorous convective activities that occur due to the northward movement of the itd in early march during the wet season pets are constantly low from june to september with slight increases for the dry season the former condition might arise from high humidity and thick monsoonal clouds that negatively affect pet rates by backscattering insolation to space the dynamics of the pet can also be observed in fig 6 with respect to changing land use prior to increasing settlement especially from 2001 pet is found to be higher than rainfall which stems from the higher coverage of closed and open forest canopies at the catchment forkuo and frimpong 2012 found that the forest cover at the owabi catchment has witnessed a 38 decline since 1986 with closed and open forests decreasing and increasing at a rate of 3 and 5 respectively gyawu 2017 the decreasing amount of forest cover imply a lower potential for evapo transpiration rates the owabi catchment falls under a wet climatic regime which is known to support higher evapotranspiration with the presence of dense forested vegetation sanderson et al 2010 kumagai et al 2005 bonal et al 2016 these forests enhance evaporation by assisting in the aerodynamic transport of intercepted water into the atmosphere legesse et al 2003 the aet rates fig 5 were highest during the northern hemisphere summer monsoon especially july also in response to convective activities the contrary effect can be observed for the dry months where high temperatures and quick evapotranspiration are likely to leave the surface soil depleted of moisture sharma 1988 any potential evaporation would occur from groundwater storage through the root stem leaf of trees and most plants especially grasslands and natural vegetation could reach their wilting point circumstances like these are likely to give rise to hydrological drought within the catchment on the other hand the roots of forested trees could reach more depths for soil water in order to maintain transpiration for the dry period and subsequently result in a higher net average annual evapo transpiration fig 6 the eight month of august is termed the little dry spell wind directions are still southwesterly however the itd is displaced northward and this does not favour rains in the south of the country parker 2017 the processes are observed to decline but with higher magnitude relative to the major dry season water yield surq latq gwq transmission loss pond abstractions is an essential component of the hydrological cycle and determines how much water leaves the outlet at a given time ghoraba 2015 the rate of water yield was quite high on the catchment which favours the owabi water treatment plant and other agricultural activities its seasonal fluctuation is controlled mainly by surface runoff and base flow fig 5 subsurface contribution to the water yield is small with low lateral flow due to the high demand of evapotranspiration of the forested vegetation for the annual variations see fig 6 the parameters depicted trends as that of the rainfall with the exception of lateral flow which remained fairly constant the soil moisture exhibited less variability on the annual time scale although the land is undergoing intensive land use changes however the impact of increasing rainfall has resulted in positive impacts on the percolation groundwater surface runoff and water yield the positive feedback of the effects of the rains is more pronounced in the surface runoff this is observable from 2001 to 2014 and can be implied as the breakpoint year in which anthropogenic invasion resulting from deforestation and destruction of natural vegetation covers to accommodate settlement from population explosion increased on the other hand if the natural vegetation cover still existed this would have reduced the rate of surface runoff from increasing rains the work of forkuo and frimpong 2012 and gyawu 2017 showcases this drastic land cover evolution 4 5 hydro climatic projection trends trends in mean ensemble projection rainfall fig 8 shows a decrease as compared to the baseline rainfall fig 7 the 30 year averages of each ensemble mean of rainfall table 5 showed percentage decrease of approximately 29 28 and 30 for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as against the baseline average 1293 1 mm rain intensity and rainy days are expected to decrease as projected by the ipcc pachauri et al 2014 for most regions in africa the rcp4 5 scenario with the ensemble r2i1p1 not shown is likely to produce most rains as compared to the other scenarios and ensembles the years of extreme rainfall under rcp4 5 mean exhibited a near decadal trend with increments observed from 2023 2032 and 2043 the inter annual variability in rainfall amounts is expected to peak in 2035 for rcp2 6 in ensemble r3i1p1 2037 for rcp4 5 in ensemble r2i1p1 and 2027 for rcp8 5 in ensemble r3i1p1 with respect to the mean these peaks will be realised in 2025 rcp2 6 2046 rcp4 5 and 2037 rcp8 5 the erratic dynamics of the rainfall patterns for the catchment must be a first step warning signal to bring together water planning stakeholders for the implementation of appropriate measures to meet future water demands fig 9 shows the annual trends of future stream flow generation at the owabi catchment from table 5 it was observed that insignificant differences existed between stream flow amounts for lu1 and lu2 scenarios and hence most references would be in line with the former scenario this negligible difference may arise from an already high cn2 at the catchment which ranges from medium to high with and undulating topography runoff coefficient is also high especially in urbanised areas due to the impervious pavement structures these factors coupled with the soil type orthic acrisols results in high runoff hence the negligible differences in stream flow amounts regardless of the landuse it has been found that acrisols under a protective forest cover have a porous surface soils which improves the infiltration capacity of the soil fao 1977 wrb 2014 and this is a characteristic of the owabi forest reserve however at areas where the forest has been cleared used for urbanisation or bare the surface soil degrades and slakes to forms a hard surface crust which allows insufficient penetration of water leading to inevitable devastating surface erosion fao 1977 wrb 2014 the slightly negligible disparities in the stream flow amounts for lu1 and lu2 also imply that the catchment would likely be more susceptible to changes in climate than land use dynamics and this might result from the regulation of catchment water loss by the existing forest cover the stream flow amounts will decline directly with the rainfall except for years of extremities the mean ensemble stream flow peaks are expected to occur for the same years as the rainfall however for rcp8 5 stream flow has the highest peak is observed in 2047 climate change will also result in decreases in water yield with its seasonal variations still controlled by surface runoff which ultimately influences stream flow according to the water resource commission of ghana water resource commission 2012b water demand within the kumasi metropolis has an increasing trend of about 26 million cumecs in 2013 to about 47 million cumecs in 2025 these demands are likely to be met if there is proper harnessing of water storage and processing during years of extremities at the owabi water processing plant on the other hand these adequate measures could also boost water availability for other socio economic and agro irrigational demands however a pit fall during wet years would be the transport of sediments during surface runoff into the owabi river an increase in sediment load without adequate sedimentation measures is likely to decrease water quality which would make processing very expensive hence creating a deficit in water demands and supply the overall deficit in future stream flow amounts should be a wake up call for the ghana water company limited and the water resources commission to implement adequate adaptation and mitigation measures for the preservation of the owabi river and the entire catchment 5 conclusions management of water resources at the owabi catchment has become a challenge due to increasing human activities this has posed a serious threat on the lifespan of the owabi dam which supplies about 20 of potable water for the kumasi metropolis a hydro climatic study was carried out using the swat model to assess the catchment hydrological response to the anthropogenic invasion the model was specifically employed to simulate both historic and projected stream flow as well as water balance whiles the sufi 2 algorithm embedded in the swat cup software was used for model calibration and validation for the catchment qgisv2 6 interface was used to launch swatv2012 for qswat v1 4 initial results revealed the forest and topography played major role in water loss at the catchment as evapotranspiration and surface runoff were the most dominant modulating processes the monthly sensitivity analyses showed three 3 parameters of which the curve number cn2 ranked first as the most sensitive in controlling runoff amounts into the river the uncertainty was observed to be quite low as the model enveloped about 50 of the observed stream flow within a width of 0 45 0 55 which suggests a satisfactory model performance future stream flow predictions were modelled for three climate ensembles each for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climatic scenarios and two land use scenarios lu1 and lu2 the downscaled rainfall trends showed decreases in rainfall totals between 2021 and 2050 for ensembles in the rcps as compared to the base line the rainfall decreases will be translated directly into catchment stream flow generation for lu1 and lu2 there is therefore the need to formulate and implement appropriate procedures for the protection of the water resources at the owabi catchment on the other hand it would be a commendable effort to construct localised dams for present and future rain water harvesting and storage to meet agro irrigational and de stress water demands at the owabi dam the use of the swat model for hydrological assessment of the owabi catchment has also been successful and further studies on the assessment of water quality and pollution is currently being undertaken to provide a holistic view of water resource management at the catchment this would in the long term aid effective decision making and boost water production for the kumasi metropolis

8422,study region the 69 km2 owabi catchment in ghana study focus the soil water assessment tool swat was used to assess the hydro climatic variability resulting from anthropogenic activities from 1986 to 2015 specifically the model simulated historic and projected stream flow and water balance future stream flow projections were modelled for three climate ensembles under three different representative concentration pathways rcps for two land use categories new hydrological insights for the region initial results revealed that forest and topography played major role in water loss whereas evapotranspiration and surface runoff were the dominant modulating processes monthly calibration validation of the model yielded acceptable results with nse r2 pbias and rsr values of 0 66 0 67 0 67 0 67 8 2 8 0 and 0 59 0 58 respectively uncertainty was fairly low and the model enveloped about 50 of the observed stream flow the rcp projections for all land use categories showed decreasing rainfall and streamflow trends the model proved efficient in determining the catchment hydrology parameters and has potential to be used for further modelling of water quality and pollution to aid in effective water management keywords hydro climate stream flow water resource management climate change swat model 1 introduction rainfall plays a significant role in the hydrology cycle and is an essential resource for global socio economic activities major stakeholders depend on various aspects of the cycle on different time scales for instance rain fed agriculture which is dominant in africa has been found to operate well if soil moisture is replenished at least every 15 days lofgren and gronewold 2014 stream flow which is also important for flood control hydro power navigation and ecological factors has its high and low extremes being controlled by rainfall and groundwater base flow respectively lofgren and gronewold 2014 water planners and managers rely on assumptions that past and future climatic trends will be the same and hence water supply systems such as dams are built with these assumptions in mind mukheibir 2007 however current climate change and variability is offsetting precipitation globally posing a dire threat to water resource management wrm according to studies by kankam yeboah et al 2012 and see references therein without climate change considerations ghana is likely to be water deficient by 2025 this situation is projected to exacerbate with increased anthropogenic activities which will negatively impact future water resources by restricting their use to meet growing demand kankam yeboah et al 2012 the most anticipated anthropogenic activity which will affect water availability is land use and land cover changes studies in ghana have shown that land degradation arising from improper agricultural practices and illegal mining have a high negative impact factor on river systems ayivor and gordon 2012 urbanisation has also posed serious threat on agricultural land and water bodies resulting in 38 and 3 decline between 1985 and 2010 in accra yeboah et al 2017 adjei et al 2014 observed that changes in land use from 1986 to 2008 has gradually reduced the area of water coverage at the lake bosomtwe basin at a pace of 0 03 per annum this lake is amongst the few youngest and best preserved meteorite craters found globally adjei et al 2014 and references therein wrm problems are best tackled through the integrated water resource management iwrm approach by providing a stronger coordination between stakeholders in planning and managing of water resources in river basins zhang et al 2014 ghana s implementation of iwrm at the river basin level begun with the most water stressed basins in the country water resource commission 2012a one of such basins is the pra of which the owabi catchment serves as a sub tributary a dam on this catchment provides 20 of total potable water to the kumasi metropolis and its environs however increasing human activities including deforestation sand winning illegal logging indiscriminate dumping of waste has reduced the quality and quantity of water production at the dam consequently this has imposed severe threat on water resource and ecosystem management various studies have been undertaken to quantify this damage on the owabi catchment for instance forkuo and frimpong 2012 mapped the owabi catchment using gis and observed a 38 9 decrease in forest cover from 1986 to 2007 which is attributable to increase in human activities and population explosion within the catchment area agyen brefo 2012 explored the effects of encroachment on sustainable public land management at owabi and found a resulting negative effect on land use planning and building regulations high cost of water production and reduction of government revenue in addition water quality at the catchment using factor analysis has shown a degradation of the catchment water when compared to world health organisation standards for safe drinking water akoto and abankwa 2014 although these studies are extremely useful for water management their impacts on the hydrology is yet to be assessed hence the present study performed a hydro climatic modelling to observe the impact of the landuse changes on the catchment a well documented and tested hydrological model which has been widely used for these assessments is the soil water assessment tool swat arnold et al 2012a b shope et al 2014 the swat model incorporates a geographical information system gis interface to give meaningful insights into the water balance sediments and pollutant transfer in a drainage network uzeika et al 2011 the swat model is prominent for its continuous long term simulations of hydro climatic variables sudjarit et al 2015 as well as satisfying its developmental aim of testing and predicting water and sediment routing in ungauged basins gayathri et al 2015 it is capable of evaluating the effects of best management practices on water resources in both large and small river basins see uzeika et al 2011 srinivasan et al 2010 shope et al 2014 me et al 2015 and has returned favourable performance rate when calibrated for instance abraham et al 2007 calibrated and validated the swat model for an ethiopian catchment and found slight under and over estimation of peak flows for some years nonetheless the overall performance of the model was good for catchment simulations govender and everson 2005 used the manual calibration technique to model stream flow for two catchments in south africa where the increasing demand for timber has drastically changed land use cover and hydrological processes although there was a good response between simulated and observed stream flows the model was unable to account for evapotranspiration losses schuol and abbaspour 2006 deduced that the model has a huge potential for freshwater quantification after application to the niger volta and senegal river basins in west africa a study by begou et al 2016 on the bani catchment revealed that calibration at the subbasin scale resulted in better performance than using global parameter set the swat model has also been a promising tool in studying the effects of landuse and landcover evolution on hydrology ongoing studies such as guzha et al 2018 in east africa and demeke and andualem 2018 and welde and gebremariam 2017 in ethiopia observed increases in streamflow surface runoff and peak flows when forest land is degraded puno et al 2019 also observed that urbanisation has resulted in increases in evapotranspiration baseflow and surface runoff meanwhile an increase in forest cover showed minimal decrease in surface runoff and baseflow some other studies include ghaffari et al 2010 pokhrel 2018 nie et al 2011 and li et al 2019 over ghana only a handful of studies have been undertaken using the swat model kankam yeboah et al 2013 investigated the impact of climate change on stream flow in two selected river basins white volta and pra in ghana after model calibration their results revealed a decline between 22 and 50 of stream flow in both the white volta and pra basins for the periods of 2006 2035 and 2036 2075 sood et al 2013 found a decrease of about 40 in river flows resulting from decreases in rainfall and increases in temperature bair 2014 applied the swat model in a cocoa growing region within the pra basin to aid in future studies of land management practices the results showed that the swat model was not yet accurate enough to be used in predicting changes in land management practices based on a negative nash sutcliffe efficiency score of 0 43 the model was also found to be a promising tool when used as part of an integrated decision support system to monitor the effects of small scale irrigation methods on agriculture and socio economic activities worqlul et al 2018 based on swat model simulations akpoti et al 2015 found that wet and dry season discharges have increased by 1 and 6 due to changes in landuse and land cover between 2000 and 2013 at the black volta river basin at the white volta basin awotwi and kumi 2015 observed changes in the water balance with a decrease in land cover correlating with decline in surface water and baseflow and increase in evapotranspiration rates the aim of this study is to model the impact of climate and land use changes on the hydrological processes of owabi catchment using swat specifically the swat model was used to simulate stream flow and establish the water balance and project stream flow amounts under different climatic and land use scenarios for the catchment the study is the first of its kind to be performed on a smaller ungauged catchment in ghana the remaining part of the paper is structured as follows the study site is described in section 2 the methodology is given in section 3 results and discussions in section 4 and finally the conclusions in section 5 2 study site description the owabi catchment fig 1 has been designated since 1988 as the only inland ramsar site in ghana it comprises of the forest reserve sanctuary and the owabi waterworks and covers about 69 km2 akoto and abankwa 2014 of land area its location is between latitudes 6 7292 n and 6 7519 n and longitudes 1 7139 w and 1 6704 w within the catchment is a 13 km2 forest reserve enclosing a water reservoir forestry commission 2014 this forest reserve is one of the smallest conservation sites in ghana and its protection responsibility lies solely with the department of game and wildlife forkuo and frimpong 2012 nonetheless protection of the site has not deterred high human encroachment and other illegal activities the hydrological unit is situated in the inner perimeter of the sanctuary fig 1 the river was dammed in 1928 with the primary aim of supplying 20 of potable drinking water to the kumasi metropolis the catchment rests in the forest belt of ghana where rainfall is strongly modulated by the west african monsoon wam and convective activities resulting from movements of the inter tropical discontinuity itd the wam is primarily driven by temperature and energy gradients between the gulf of guinea and the sahara amekudzi et al 2015 movement of the itd results in bimodal rainfall regimes in this region with the presence of the river and dense vegetation inducing a micro climate which influences the rainfall patterns temperature and humidity in the catchment the mean rainfall is about 1450 mm per annum aryee et al 2018 and average monthly temperatures between 24 6 and 27 8 c geologically the area falls within the birimian meta sediment of the kumasi basin which consists of phyllites granodiorites schists greywackes tuffs and the associated granitoid forkuo and frimpong 2012 forestry commission 2014 and orthic acrisols as the dominant soil type 3 methodology 3 1 swat model description swat is a river basin scale semi distributed and physically based model that operates on a daily timescale but also capable of simulating outputs on monthly and annual timescales it was initially developed by the united states department of agriculture to model land management practices on sediment water and agro chemical yields in ungauged catchments the model is highly rated for its computational efficiency and long term continuous simulations the important inputs of the model include rainfall and temperature digital elevation model soil and land use maps as well as output simulations of water balance nutrient and sediment loadings arnold et al 2012b the computational hydrology framework of the model is based on the land and water routing sections of the hydrological cycle the land division regulates the amount of water nutrient sediment and pest loadings into the main channel in every subbasin the latter division defines the path of water and sediments through the basin channels to the outlet sudjarit et al 2015 the initial step for catchment simulation is the catchment delineation where subbasins and hydrological response units hrus are defined arnold et al 2012a swat utilises eq 1 to simulate the hydrological cycle ghoraba 2015 the hydrological cycle is climate dependent and supplies energy and moisture inputs such as daily rainfall maximum and minimum air temperatures wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation the data can be read directly from files by swat to produce simulated data at runtime 1 sw t sw o i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw i where t is time days sw o and sw t

version 2 6 1 and qswat version 1 4 swat v2012 downloaded from http swat tamu edu software were employed for the study spatial input dataset were obtained from open source websites shown in table 1 the catchment elevation fig 2 was within 220 m and 394 m with mean of 265 m above mean sea level all these data excluding hydro meteorological parameters were in a raster format and geo processed for model input as described in dile et al 2016 after model run a total area of 69 km2 basin boundary was delineated with 16 subbasins and 80 hrus six dominant land use categories and one soil type were observed within the owabi catchment as shown in fig 2 the observed soil orthic acrisols are deeply weathered and consist of thin dark greyish brown humus stained sandy loam and silt loam topsoils with moderate fine granular structure adjei gyapong and asiamah 2002 it also has a high water holding capacity at the first horizon top or surface soil fao 1977 wrb 2014 however the density of the second horizon is high which limits internal drainage by obstructing the infiltration of water into much deeper layers fao 1977 wrb 2014 3 2 2 hydro meteorological input daily rainfall and temperature minimum and maximum were obtained from ghana meteorological agency gmet from 1980 to 2015 table 1 missing rainfall and temperature gaps were filled using the arithmetic averaging method from the closest meteorological stations these stations see fig 3 included barekese 6 8481 n 1 7198 w offinso 7 3049 n 1 7928 w and kumasi airport 6 7125 n 1 5911 w based on the climatic data available the hargreaves method was used for the estimation of evapotranspiration rates on the catchment the lack of stream flow data was a major limitation of this paper for model calibration and validation this limitation can be offset through the application of regionalisation or artificial neural networks for stream flow determination hrachowitz et al 2013 the regionalisation scheme uses multiple donor catchments to extract detailed information to increase the predictive performance of the hydrological model at the ungauged basin arsenault and brissette 2016 stream flow records were transferred from the offinso gauging station whose main channel the offin river drains into the barekese catchment this station is the closest and located about 30 km away from the owabi catchment similar attributes of the barekese catchment with the owabi catchment are a mean elevation of 277 m orthic acrisol as soil type semi deciduous forests voltain birimian and granite geology bi modal rainfall regime and rapid urbanisation in the last decade ghana statistical service 2014 annual rainfall at is about 1400 mm domfeh et al 2015 while based on studies such as forkuo and frimpong 2012 and aryee et al 2018 the annual mean rainfall for owabi ranges between 1450 and 1488 mm this imply a rainfall difference of about 50 90 mm at the two catchments based on their similarity index the physical similarity regionalisation method as used in oudin et al 2008 swain and patra 2017 arsenault and brissette 2016 and references therein was used the raw stream flow data at offinso is transferred to the owabi catchment and used for model analysis prior to this a drainage area ratio was implemented to downscale the discharge data to catchment size of owabi however this method failed with extremely low and unrealistic discharge estimates for owabi thorough review of the regionalisation methods can be found in hrachowitz et al 2013 the stream flow data time series was monthly and spanned the period of 2001 2010 as seen in table 1 3 2 3 projection dataset land use a 30 year 2021 2050 stream flow for the owabi catchment was predicted under two land uses and three climate change scenarios for the landuse agrl comprises of a mosaic greater than 50 natural vegetation of trees shrubs and herbaceous cover with cropland covering less than 50 while agrr is rainfed cropland ucl geomatics 2017 the agrl footprint at the owabi catchment is observed as part of the 13 km2 forest reserve frse which is under strict protection of the ghana forestry commission forest guards are known to patrol the forest at least twice a day with severe penalties awarded on any defaulters the cropland component of agrl are usually subsistence farming undertaken by residents who reside close to the forest boundaries and hence makes for the lower 50 in cropland the total area of the landuse watr is similar to the protected forest cover has remained intact over the years probably due to the existence of the forest currently these landuses rnge and agrr are under an ongoing severe threat of conversion to settlement due to rapid urbanisation and the proximity of the catchment area to the central business district of the kumasi metropolis since forestry rules are unlikely to be relaxed for the benefits of residents it is likely that current settlement areas can either remain the same or grasslands rnge and rain fed croplands agrr would be urbanised to support growing population these assumptions formed the criteria for developing the two land use scenarios for land use scenario 1 lu1 an unchanging land use category as observed in the baseline trend was considered in land use scenario 2 lu2 fig 2 the conversion of all land uses except forest frse natural vegetation agrl and water watr categories into settlement urbanisation areas was assumed 3 2 4 projection dataset climatic future daily rainfall and temperature minimum and maximum from the fourth generation canadian regional climate model canrcm4 were used as climate forcing for the swat model these were projected under three representative concentration pathways rcp2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and contained three different ensembles r1i1p1 r2i1p1 and r3i1p1 the three ensembles differed only in their initial conditions r1 r2 r3 but have the same initialisation methods i1 and underlying perturbation physics p1 taylor et al 2010 the rcps have been called according to the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases and other agents by the year of 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 the rcp2 6 suggests a low level forcing with emissions reaching a peak of 3 0 w m2 rcp4 5 is a stable pathway which peaks at 4 5 w m2 whiles rcp8 5 is the worst scenario with rising radiative forcing of 8 5 w m2 van vuuren et al 2011 the cmhyd software rathjens et al 2016 was used for bias correction of the projection climate data and has about seven bias correction options available for precipitation and temperature these comprised of distribution mapping of precipitation and temperature linear scaling delta change correction precipitation local intensity scaling power transformation of precipitation all these options were used to correct for biases in the historic rainfall and temperature datasets which included the observed data and that of the rcm from 1980 to 2015 after correction the best algorithm option was the distribution mapping and hence was chosen for the climate change analysis due to the high variability of rainfall the distribution mapping module assumes a gamma distribution of the dataset with shape and scale parameters α and β respectively the distribution profile is controlled by α and for α 1 the distribution is exponentially shaped α 1 gives a special exponential distribution case whiles α 1 gives a skewed uni modal distribution teutschbein and seibert 2012 alternatively β determines the dispersion of the gamma distribution with smaller larger values leading to a compressed stretched distribution with lower higher probabilities of extreme events teutschbein and seibert 2012 for the temperature data the module assumes a gaussian distribution due to less variations especially in the tropics with location and scale parameters μ and σ the location of the distribution is controlled by μ whiles σ determines the standard deviation with smaller larger indicating lower higher probabilities of extreme events for further review see teutschbein and seibert 2012 the bias corrected rainfall and temperature for the historical climate model spanning overlapping years of 1979 2005 revealed a satisfactory correlation with the measured datasets under all rcp ensembles for instance for the rcp2 6 ensemble r1i1p1 the observed historical rainfall was found to be exponentially skewed α 0 96 whiles the bias corrected model historic was uni modally skewed α 4 09 with higher tendencies of extreme events especially in the wet seasons β 9 89 observed historic and β 2 62 model historic standard deviations for minimum and maximum temperatures were also quite low for extremities observed historic 1 40 2 59 and corrected model historic 1 58 2 34 3 3 calibration validation and uncertainty assessment the auto calibration tool swat cup with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm abbaspour 2015 was used for calibration techniques sufi 2 is known to estimate both parameter and model uncertainties in hydrological models abbaspour 2015 table 2 shows the objective functions used in assessing the overall model performance as well as their required satisfactory thresholds as described in moriasi et al 2007 and abbaspour 2015 the global sensitivity test for sensitivity analysis was evaluated using the t stat and the p value whiles p and r factors were used for uncertainty analysis at a 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu the p factor is the percentage of the measured data that is captured by the 95ppu and an ideal value of 1 indicates that all correct processes have been accurately captured by the model arnold et al 2012b however for stream flow a p factor 0 70 is the better choice of model fit although it is also acceptable for the model to cover more than half of the observed data abbaspour 2015 the r factor shows the calibration quality and an ideal value of 0 implies a direct fit of the simulated stream flow with the observed arnold et al 2012b other model performance indices used included nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percentage bias pbias and rmse standard deviation ratio rsr arnold et al 2012b 4 results and discussions 4 1 sensitivity analysis for calibration analysis 14 parameters arnold et al 2012b see table 3 that affect surface runoff and baseflow have been selected from literature the selected parameters were also chosen to reflect as much as possible all hydrological processes that might be occurring within the owabi catchment the results of the global sensitivity analysis showed that three 3 of these parameters regulated the outlet stream flow in the basin these included surface cn2 surlag and groundwater alpha bf processes the curve number for average soil moisture cn2 was the most sensitive among these three with other catchment studies reporting likewise see arnold et al 2012b and references therein 4 2 performance of swat calibration validation using the physical similarity method the performance of the physical similarity method was based on the statistical indices obtained during the model calibration and validation and this was hypothesised to have a direct relationship such that a satisfactory model performance corresponded with a satisfactory performance of the physical similarity approach the swat model was run for 36 years with the first 6 years used as model initialisation warm up the model was calibrated from 2001 to 2006 6 years and validated from 2007 to 2010 4 years the results of the calibrated and validated model is shown in fig 4 for calibration validation there was consistency in the model s simulation of the seasonal stream flow dynamics and concurrently followed the rainfall pattern the swat model performance was satisfactory as evident in the nse 0 66 and r2 0 67 considering that the observed data was obtained from a catchment which is about 12 times the size of the study area the performance was enhanced especially during the dry seasons with occasionally slight overestimations in some few cases the only sensitive groundwater parameter is the baseflow which serves as a secondary contributor of stream flow in the form of lateral flow during the dry season to support water production by the owabi water processing plant it was also observed that for rainy months see fig 4 in which the mean monthly rainfall amounts were lower hence low stream flow amounts the model treated such periods as dry and always over estimated the stream flow amounts this is observable in march to july 2004 and september to october 2006 where stream flow observed for the rainy period were lower than other calibration years the low rains experienced in the former months resulted in short intense rainfall in september to december 2004 which was poorly captured by the model overall the prediction error for stream flow calibration was within an acceptable range as reflected in the pbias 8 2 and rsr 0 59 the monthly validation fig 4 also showed a good output between the simulated and the observed stream flow datasets the overall model performance conforms with a hydrological review undertaken by gassman et al 2007 the highest observed stream flow peak during calibration was obtained in may 2005 8 12 cms however this was poorly simulated by the model 4 30 cms alternatively the highest best simulated peak stream flow by the model was in october 2002 7 12 cms likewise for validation the peak was seen in september 2007 for observed 12 11 cms and june 2010 for simulated 8 44 cms table 4 shows a summary of the statistics obtained for model calibration and validation overall the acceptable values obtained from the statistical metrics gives a first hand indication that the physical similarity method is an efficient means of generating stream flow at the owabi catchment 4 3 uncertainty analysis the parameter uncertainty that results from non uniqueness of effective model parameters conceptual model and input uncertainties schuol and abbaspour 2006 were satisfactory as observed from 95ppu table 4 the model bracketed about 0 51 0 52 of the observed data at the expense of a quite low enveloping width of 0 55 0 45 the model uncertainties would be the inability to incorporate some important processes occurring within the catchment in the swat model setup most of these processes especially from human activities which are likely to go unnoticed are bound to occur upstream of the owabi dam which is highly populated however although previous sand winning activities on the catchment could affect the hydrology its extent was not incorporated due to inadequate quantification data the inability of the model to capture the accepted 70 of observational data might be associated with uncertainties in the input dataset both rainfall temperature and stream flow data are influenced by systematic errors of measuring instruments however the spatial distribution of temperature is homogeneous within the tropics and specifically around the owabi catchment and hence has minimal errors on model calibration rain gauges on the other hand are known to have uncertainties with average systematic error magnitudes of about 5 6 and random error magnitude of about 5 mcmillan et al 2012 it has been ascertained that the owabi meteorological station has not been relocated since the beginning of the study period and therefore any erroneous measurements may arise from faulty instruments or the inability of the rain gauges to measure intense short and long duration of storm events furthermore the neighbouring station gauges used for gap in filling are likely to propagate their individual errors also into the owabi climatic dataset the stage discharge measurement of stream flow at the offin river is also prone to errors during discharge computations in both instrumentation and quality control which results in potential outliers in dataset although the uncertainty is acceptable the transfer of raw stream flow data from the donor to receiver catchment could also force errors to be transferred directly into the calibration process especially in inaccurate simulation of high peak flows 4 4 water balance the most important components of the water balance of any hydrological basin are the rainfall surface runoff baseflow lateral flow and evapotranspiration however unlike rainfall that is easily measured the other variables need prediction for their quantification ghoraba 2015 the best parameter values were used to rerun the calibrated model to obtain an estimate of the water balance for the catchment the swat check tool white et al 2014 was also employed to obtain the percentage distribution of rainfall for the water balance components the 30 year seasonal water balance is visualised in fig 5 which shows that the most dominant pathways for water loss on the catchment was observed to be actual evapotranspiration aet and surface runoff due to the quick response to rain and a hydrological soil group of type d within the entire basin surface runoff hortonian contributes to about 68 of total flow at the catchment with baseflow obtaining the remaining 32 the total flow represents the total amount of water that is converted into stream flow furthermore the evapotranspiration has the highest percentage of rain water loss at 55 while the stream flow variance in rainfall was found to be 42 percolation and deep recharge had the least amounts of 16 and 1 respectively the 30 year potential evapotranspiration pet average as calculated from the hargreaves method the owabi catchment is located within the equatorial region and hence much higher insolation and temperatures that favours the potential evapotranspiration sanderson et al 2010 the seasonal trend of pet fig 5 observed higher tendencies before the onset of rains in march but experiences reduction when penetrating into the major and minor wet seasons resulting from rigorous convective activities that occur due to the northward movement of the itd in early march during the wet season pets are constantly low from june to september with slight increases for the dry season the former condition might arise from high humidity and thick monsoonal clouds that negatively affect pet rates by backscattering insolation to space the dynamics of the pet can also be observed in fig 6 with respect to changing land use prior to increasing settlement especially from 2001 pet is found to be higher than rainfall which stems from the higher coverage of closed and open forest canopies at the catchment forkuo and frimpong 2012 found that the forest cover at the owabi catchment has witnessed a 38 decline since 1986 with closed and open forests decreasing and increasing at a rate of 3 and 5 respectively gyawu 2017 the decreasing amount of forest cover imply a lower potential for evapo transpiration rates the owabi catchment falls under a wet climatic regime which is known to support higher evapotranspiration with the presence of dense forested vegetation sanderson et al 2010 kumagai et al 2005 bonal et al 2016 these forests enhance evaporation by assisting in the aerodynamic transport of intercepted water into the atmosphere legesse et al 2003 the aet rates fig 5 were highest during the northern hemisphere summer monsoon especially july also in response to convective activities the contrary effect can be observed for the dry months where high temperatures and quick evapotranspiration are likely to leave the surface soil depleted of moisture sharma 1988 any potential evaporation would occur from groundwater storage through the root stem leaf of trees and most plants especially grasslands and natural vegetation could reach their wilting point circumstances like these are likely to give rise to hydrological drought within the catchment on the other hand the roots of forested trees could reach more depths for soil water in order to maintain transpiration for the dry period and subsequently result in a higher net average annual evapo transpiration fig 6 the eight month of august is termed the little dry spell wind directions are still southwesterly however the itd is displaced northward and this does not favour rains in the south of the country parker 2017 the processes are observed to decline but with higher magnitude relative to the major dry season water yield surq latq gwq transmission loss pond abstractions is an essential component of the hydrological cycle and determines how much water leaves the outlet at a given time ghoraba 2015 the rate of water yield was quite high on the catchment which favours the owabi water treatment plant and other agricultural activities its seasonal fluctuation is controlled mainly by surface runoff and base flow fig 5 subsurface contribution to the water yield is small with low lateral flow due to the high demand of evapotranspiration of the forested vegetation for the annual variations see fig 6 the parameters depicted trends as that of the rainfall with the exception of lateral flow which remained fairly constant the soil moisture exhibited less variability on the annual time scale although the land is undergoing intensive land use changes however the impact of increasing rainfall has resulted in positive impacts on the percolation groundwater surface runoff and water yield the positive feedback of the effects of the rains is more pronounced in the surface runoff this is observable from 2001 to 2014 and can be implied as the breakpoint year in which anthropogenic invasion resulting from deforestation and destruction of natural vegetation covers to accommodate settlement from population explosion increased on the other hand if the natural vegetation cover still existed this would have reduced the rate of surface runoff from increasing rains the work of forkuo and frimpong 2012 and gyawu 2017 showcases this drastic land cover evolution 4 5 hydro climatic projection trends trends in mean ensemble projection rainfall fig 8 shows a decrease as compared to the baseline rainfall fig 7 the 30 year averages of each ensemble mean of rainfall table 5 showed percentage decrease of approximately 29 28 and 30 for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as against the baseline average 1293 1 mm rain intensity and rainy days are expected to decrease as projected by the ipcc pachauri et al 2014 for most regions in africa the rcp4 5 scenario with the ensemble r2i1p1 not shown is likely to produce most rains as compared to the other scenarios and ensembles the years of extreme rainfall under rcp4 5 mean exhibited a near decadal trend with increments observed from 2023 2032 and 2043 the inter annual variability in rainfall amounts is expected to peak in 2035 for rcp2 6 in ensemble r3i1p1 2037 for rcp4 5 in ensemble r2i1p1 and 2027 for rcp8 5 in ensemble r3i1p1 with respect to the mean these peaks will be realised in 2025 rcp2 6 2046 rcp4 5 and 2037 rcp8 5 the erratic dynamics of the rainfall patterns for the catchment must be a first step warning signal to bring together water planning stakeholders for the implementation of appropriate measures to meet future water demands fig 9 shows the annual trends of future stream flow generation at the owabi catchment from table 5 it was observed that insignificant differences existed between stream flow amounts for lu1 and lu2 scenarios and hence most references would be in line with the former scenario this negligible difference may arise from an already high cn2 at the catchment which ranges from medium to high with and undulating topography runoff coefficient is also high especially in urbanised areas due to the impervious pavement structures these factors coupled with the soil type orthic acrisols results in high runoff hence the negligible differences in stream flow amounts regardless of the landuse it has been found that acrisols under a protective forest cover have a porous surface soils which improves the infiltration capacity of the soil fao 1977 wrb 2014 and this is a characteristic of the owabi forest reserve however at areas where the forest has been cleared used for urbanisation or bare the surface soil degrades and slakes to forms a hard surface crust which allows insufficient penetration of water leading to inevitable devastating surface erosion fao 1977 wrb 2014 the slightly negligible disparities in the stream flow amounts for lu1 and lu2 also imply that the catchment would likely be more susceptible to changes in climate than land use dynamics and this might result from the regulation of catchment water loss by the existing forest cover the stream flow amounts will decline directly with the rainfall except for years of extremities the mean ensemble stream flow peaks are expected to occur for the same years as the rainfall however for rcp8 5 stream flow has the highest peak is observed in 2047 climate change will also result in decreases in water yield with its seasonal variations still controlled by surface runoff which ultimately influences stream flow according to the water resource commission of ghana water resource commission 2012b water demand within the kumasi metropolis has an increasing trend of about 26 million cumecs in 2013 to about 47 million cumecs in 2025 these demands are likely to be met if there is proper harnessing of water storage and processing during years of extremities at the owabi water processing plant on the other hand these adequate measures could also boost water availability for other socio economic and agro irrigational demands however a pit fall during wet years would be the transport of sediments during surface runoff into the owabi river an increase in sediment load without adequate sedimentation measures is likely to decrease water quality which would make processing very expensive hence creating a deficit in water demands and supply the overall deficit in future stream flow amounts should be a wake up call for the ghana water company limited and the water resources commission to implement adequate adaptation and mitigation measures for the preservation of the owabi river and the entire catchment 5 conclusions management of water resources at the owabi catchment has become a challenge due to increasing human activities this has posed a serious threat on the lifespan of the owabi dam which supplies about 20 of potable water for the kumasi metropolis a hydro climatic study was carried out using the swat model to assess the catchment hydrological response to the anthropogenic invasion the model was specifically employed to simulate both historic and projected stream flow as well as water balance whiles the sufi 2 algorithm embedded in the swat cup software was used for model calibration and validation for the catchment qgisv2 6 interface was used to launch swatv2012 for qswat v1 4 initial results revealed the forest and topography played major role in water loss at the catchment as evapotranspiration and surface runoff were the most dominant modulating processes the monthly sensitivity analyses showed three 3 parameters of which the curve number cn2 ranked first as the most sensitive in controlling runoff amounts into the river the uncertainty was observed to be quite low as the model enveloped about 50 of the observed stream flow within a width of 0 45 0 55 which suggests a satisfactory model performance future stream flow predictions were modelled for three climate ensembles each for rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 climatic scenarios and two land use scenarios lu1 and lu2 the downscaled rainfall trends showed decreases in rainfall totals between 2021 and 2050 for ensembles in the rcps as compared to the base line the rainfall decreases will be translated directly into catchment stream flow generation for lu1 and lu2 there is therefore the need to formulate and implement appropriate procedures for the protection of the water resources at the owabi catchment on the other hand it would be a commendable effort to construct localised dams for present and future rain water harvesting and storage to meet agro irrigational and de stress water demands at the owabi dam the use of the swat model for hydrological assessment of the owabi catchment has also been successful and further studies on the assessment of water quality and pollution is currently being undertaken to provide a holistic view of water resource management at the catchment this would in the long term aid effective decision making and boost water production for the kumasi metropolis

8423,study region the yarlung tsangpo basin yb on the tibetan plateau study focus characteristics and changes of air temperature precipitation snow cover snow depth glacier streamflow during 1979 2015 land cover use in 1990 and 2015 and the responses of streamflow to the changes are analyzed the objective is to understand the major factors that influence streamflow in the yb at both intra annual and inter annual time scales new hydrological insights the yb experiences significant warming but spatiotemporally varying precipitation changes snow decreases and glaciers retreat in the yb but with heterogeneous spatial patterns streamflow shows strong annual and decadal variability in the cold and dry season streamflow is positively correlated to air temperature in the upper sub basin non significantly whereas in the warm and wet season precipitation influence dominates the streamflow changes in both high and low elevations human activity induced 2 fold residential area and 5 fold tree nursery area expansions come at the expense of cropland dense forest and grassland in the upper sub basin snow depth and streamflow display significant concurrent and lagged correlations for several months streamflow in april may a melting and seedling season is positively affected by snow depth of the previous year warming induced degradation in cryospheric elements low precipitation during the cold and dry season together with land cover use change could result in water resource conflict in april may for the yb keywords yarlung tsangpo basin environmental change and impacts streamflow water resources conflict 1 introduction streamflow is one of the most important fresh water resources that sustain social and economic development and diverse ecosystems worldwide streamflow is an integrated product involving various hydrological processes in a watershed including precipitation evapotranspiration et infiltration soil water movement overland flow channel routing groundwater discharge snow and glacier melting hence any changes in these hydrological processes will affect streamflow each of these processes is in turn impacted by climate topography soil and land cover use thus investigation of streamflow changes needs to be carried out by considering all of the major factors numerous studies have reported the influences of climate change primarily air temperature and precipitation change on streamflow ficklin et al 2018 milly et al 2018 painter et al 2018 knoben et al 2018 and the combined anthropogenic activities primarily land cover use change such as vegetation change urbanization reservoir operation etc and climate change impacts on streamflow cuo et al 2009 2013a munoz et al 2018 lv et al 2018 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 in the alpine region climate change impacts are manifested not only in the responses of streamflow to et and precipitation change and human activities but also in the response of streamflow to snow and glacier change and frozen soil degradation due to warming wang et al 2018 evans et al 2018 krogh and pomeroy 2018 therefore including the effects of snow glacier and frozen soil on streamflow in the alpine region is important an understanding of all these is critical for designing mitigation strategies and for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies as streamflow changes have been documented to directly impact ecosystems and societies through flooding bloschl et al 2017 water quality lee et al 2018 foks et al 2018 and hydropower production majone et al 2016 naz et al 2018 ali et al 2018 the tibetan plateau tp with an average elevation of 4000 m and an area of 2 5 106 km2 is home to the headwaters of major asian rivers the yellow yangtze mekong salween yarlung tsangpo upper brahmaputra indus and tarim rivers these rivers provide essential fresh water resources to the local and downstream societies and ecosystems the tp also contains the largest cryospheric elements including glacier snow and frozen soil outside of the arctic and antarctic according to the second glacier inventory by liu et al 2014a b during the first decade of the 21st century the tp had 39 636 glaciers with a total area of about 43 821 km2 greater than 10 snow cover exists year round along the mountains with more than 50 snow cover persisting in the west kunlun the west himalayas and the hengduan mountains li et al 2018a b chen et al 2018 frozen soil consists of permafrost and seasonally frozen soil studies show that permafrost area covers about 40 46 of the tp zou et al 2017 wang et al 2019 whereas seasonally frozen ground accounts for about 56 of the tp zou et al 2017 studies have shown that the tp is experiencing region wide warming zhu et al 2018 ding et al 2018 xi et al 2018 but spatially heterogeneous precipitation changes cuo et al 2013b also glaciers on the tp are experiencing heterogeneous changes retreating in the southeast plateau but growing or stabilized in the west kunlun and north karakoram yao et al 2012 lin et al 2018 snow cover undergoes mixed changes on the tp increasing along the mountain ranges but decreasing in the interiors of large river basins chen et al 2018 permafrost soil in china of which the majority is distributed on the tp has been consistently degrading its area has been reduced from 2 15 106 km2 in the 1970s to 1 75 106 km2 in 2006 to 1 59 106 km2 in 2012 cheng and jin 2013 and to 1 06 106 km2 in 2017 zou et al 2017 although different studies use different mapping methods and the comparison in the degradation rates of permafrost should be regarded with caution the persistent decreasing trend over the period is nevertheless consistent amongst the studies ran et al 2018 used mean annual air temperature to examine permafrost in 1960 s 2000 s and reported a 23 84 reduction of the permafrost area over the period the implications of the degradation have been documented and illustrated from the hydrological and ecological perspectives cuo et al 2015 qin et al 2018 gao et al 2018 however studies that cover the impacts of all important environmental factors such as air temperature precipitation land cover use snow glacier and frozen soil on streamflow on the tp are lacking currently relevant studies that examine historical streamflow changes on the tp are mostly focused on streamflow regime change and streamflow response to changes in two or three environmental factors cuo et al 2014 for example in the yarlung tsangpo basin yb the upper stream of the trans boundary brahmaputra river chen 2012 assessed flow regime change during 1961 2000 liu et al 2014b analyzed the spatiotemporal distributions of air temperature precipitation and land cover use and examined their impacts on streamflow nie et al 2016 used gis techniques meteorological data analyses and mann kendall nonparametric test to study the impacts of climate change snow cover and depth on streamflow and found that due to warming and wetting streamflow increased during 1979 2006 zhang et al 2013 used modeling to study the contribution of snow and glacier melting to streamflow in a few major basins on the tp including the yb for the other basins on the tp among others cuo et al 2013a used a hydrological model to investigate both climate and land cover use change impacts on streamflow in the upper yellow river gao et al 2018 conducted a modeling study and found that permafrost degradation caused increase in baseflow in the heihe river basin given all the studies and the need for a good understanding of streamflow changes an inclusive representation of all major factors and their impacts on streamflow is necessary this study attempts to fill this gap through examining the changes in climate land cover use cryospheric elements and their relationships with streamflow in the yb this is the first comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the major factors that influence streamflow in the yb the water resource management sectors in the yb have been constantly asking the question of how streamflow has responded to changes in climate land cover use and cryosphere the results from this study should be useful for the sustainable management of water resources in the region the objective of this study is 2 fold 1 examining the up to date key climatic factors glacier and snow streamflow and land cover use changes in the yb and 2 examining streamflow response to the changes in climatic factors glacier snow and land cover use in the yb through this study we aim to understand the major factors that influence streamflow in the yb at both intra annual and inter annual time steps which has not been investigated before 2 study area the yb is situated in the southern tibetan autonomous region tar 82 97 12 e and 28 31 27 n on the tp fig 1 and provides essential water resources to the local and downstream areas of china india and bangladesh using baxika as the basin outlet the yb has an area of about 248 000 km2 and its elevation ranges from 150 m to more than 7200 m the river originates from the jiemayangzong glacier located in the west of the basin the basin is surrounded by the gangdise and nianqing tanggula mountains in the north the himalaya mountains in the south and the hengduan mountains in the east from the west to the east the basin s climate ranges from alpine arid alpine temperate arid mountainous sub tropical and to tropical climate the diverse climate and complex topography in the basin give birth to diverse ecosystems including rainforest coniferous trees broadleaf trees shrub grassland meadow and tundra the yb produces the greatest discharge right after it leaves the tp among all rivers that originate from the tp making the yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra river the world s third largest river by discharge the yb also has a great potential for hydropower production the yb is of tremendous importance for the tibetans as it is where the tibetan culture was nurtured and spread to the entire tp since the early 5th century danzhu 2000 it is also the economic cultural and political center of the tar liu 2015b 3 data and methods multiple data types from multiple data sources are used in this study which include 1 daily air temperature and precipitation at 11 meteorological stations located in the yb for 1979 2017 and obtained from the china meteorological administration fig 1 2 daily and annual streamflow for 10 stream gauges in total and annual precipitation for lazi lhasa gengzhang and nuxia operated by the chinese ministry of water resources fig 1 for various periods depending on the data sources explained below 3 the first and second glacier inventories of china gic cas 1986 liu et al 2014a 4 modis snow cover data in 500 m resolution for 2003 2014 qiu et al 2016 5 snow depth data in 0 25 resolution for 1979 2016 che et al 2008 dai et al 2012 2015 and 6 land cover and land use maps at 1 km resolution representing the 1990 and 2015 conditions from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences it has been difficult to acquire the long term streamflow data from the chinese ministry of water resources directly we have resorted to various sources for obtaining the streamflow data and hence some stations e g lhasa and nuxia have both monthly and annual time series but with different time periods the trends of air temperature precipitation snow cover snow depth and streamflow are examined using the mann kendall test and sen s slope approach sen 1968 the relationship of streamflow with precipitation temperature and snow depth is investigated through linear correlation analysis mutations of time series are detected using the mann kendall mutation analysis land cover use change is examined using the transition matrix defined below 1 b i j a i j 100 j 1 n a i j 2 c j i a j i 100 i 1 n a j i where i and j are the row representing 1990 and column representing 2015 numbers in the transition matrix respectively aij a ji is the total area of the 1990 2015 land cover in row i column j bij unit is the proportion of the area of a land cover in i j to the total area in row i in 1990 cji unit is the proportion of the area of a land cover in j i to the total area in column j in 2015 in other words b ij is the proportion of land cover in 1990 that has been transitioned to another land cover in 2015 and c ji is the proportion of land cover in 2015 that has been transitioned from a land cover type in 1990 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal variations in hydro climate and cryospheric variables 4 1 1 surface air temperature and precipitation mean annual air temperature ranges from 0 3 to 8 9 c across the stations during 1979 2017 generally decreasing with elevation table 1 annual precipitation ranges from 284 to 907 mm and increases from the west to the east corresponding to the arid continental climate in the far west to the mixed arid continental and indian summer monsoon climate in the central and to the indian summer monsoon dominated climate in the east mean monthly air temperature at jiali which has the highest elevation has the lowest temperature throughout the year and has temperatures above zero only during may october fig 2 dangxiong which has the second highest elevation has the second lowest temperature ranging from 8 5 to 11 3 c at bomi and linzhi the two lowest stations in the eastern yb temperatures stays above zero throughout the year all stations display well defined seasonal cycles in temperature the hottest month is june at the central stations and july at the eastern stations monthly precipitation is generally high in the warm season june september at most stations due to wet summer monsoon and low in the cold season november february due to dry westerlies fig 2 bomi displays an extensive raining period of march through october the raining season at linzhi and jiali also spans from april to october likely due to sufficient moisture supply from the bay of bengal luolong an eastern but farther northern station exhibits the lowest july august precipitation but relatively higher october june precipitation than the western stations decadal mean monthly precipitation is shown in fig s1 the maximum monthly precipitation occurs progressively earlier in more recent decades than in past decades at bomi dangxiong jiangzi lhasa linzhi rikaze and zedang double peaks at luolong becomes a single peak with time in the cold and dry season precipitation generally does not change with time these features perhaps indicate some changes in summer circulation patterns table 1 also shows the trends calculated from annual mean air temperature and annual precipitation for 1979 2017 air temperature increases significantly at all stations table 1 fig s2 ranging from 0 03 to 0 06 c year 1 with no significant correlation between the warming rates and elevation fig s3 precipitation trends range from 1 30 to 2 73 mm year 1 and a majority of the stations correspond to positive trends but statistically significant p 0 05 at lhasa only table 1 negative precipitation trends are found at jiangzi bomi and luolong but none of them are statistically significant monthly mean air temperature trends are all positive with lhasa corresponding to the highest and statistically significant p 0 05 warming rates in most months fig 3 zedang displays the lowest warming rates especially in the warm season in general the warming rates in the cold season november february are higher than those in the warm season june september monthly precipitation trends are mixed and most of the trends are statistically insignificant fig 4 generally slightly increasing trends in precipitation are noted in april june in the center with decreasing trends in the east in june july september and in the center in august possibly related to the weakening of the indian summer monsoon in the recent decades ding et al 2019 submitted in the cold season precipitation changes are rather small and a majority of the stations display no trends fig 4 the mutation analysis for precipitation fig s4 shows that due to its high inter annual variability all stations display multiple mutation points and for most stations the first mutation occurs around 1987 4 1 2 glacier a glacier is a solid reservoir able to preserve water for centuries and is sensitive to climate change the yb contains 30 of the tp s glaciers liu et al 2014a we use the first gic 1 cas 1986 and the second gic 2 liu et al 2014a glacier inventories of china for identifying glacier changes in the yb both gic 1 and gic 2 used the gcs krasovsky 1940 map projection it is worth noting here that glacier changes inferred from the gic datasets could be underestimated since nearly 50 of the glaciers included in both gic 2 and gic 1 came from the 1968 1980 survey and satellite images that were taken primarily in the eastern basin along the hengduan mountain ranges glaciers are mostly distributed along the mountain ranges surrounding the basin the hengduan mountains in the east contain the largest area of glaciers fig s5 glacier retreat is noticeable as there were 9743 glaciers with a total area of 11 719 km2 in gic 1 which were reduced to 8453 glaciers with an area of 9725 km2 in gic 2 glaciers to the west of 90 e retreat dramatically and some have even disappeared in gic 2 compared to gic 1 fig s5 fig 5 a compares the areas of glaciers with various slope aspects in the basin between gic 1 and gic 2 slope aspects were calculated by the arcgis 3d analysis package using nasa s srtm shuttle radar topography mission 90 m digital elevation model for both inventories the north facing glaciers take up the largest areas 17 67 in gic 1 and 21 52 in gic 2 while the west facing glaciers occupy the smallest areas 8 88 in gic 1 and 5 94 in gic 2 with other glaciers in between radiation deficiency in the north facing slope and moisture abundance in the east facing slope might contribute to the glacier growth there are other factors that might also play a role for example windward lifting and cooling would favor glacier growth while leeward sinking and warming would cause glacier to retreat compared to gic 1 the proportions of north northeast southeast and east facing glaciers in gic 2 have grown and together account for more than 69 of the total glacier area whereas the proportions of northwest west southwest and south facing glaciers have shrunk fig 5b shows the changes in glacier area at different elevation bands in the basin the glaciers are grouped into 5 bands in a 1000 m elevation interval between 2500 and 7500 m and then the total glacier area for each elevation band is computed most glaciers are located within the 4500 6500 m elevation compared to gic 1 the glacier areas in gic 2 increase slightly for 2500 3500 m 4500 5500 m and 6500 7500 m but decrease for 3500 4500 m and 5500 6500 m elevation ranges given the warming trends in the yb it appears that the heterogeneous precipitation changes combined with aspects and elevation effects might be responsible for glacier retreat or advance 4 1 3 snow annual mean and maximum snow cover decrease slightly from 2003 to 2014 fig 6 a snow cover occurring mostly in october march ranges from 18 2 to 27 0 annually with an average of 18 3 during 2003 2014 annual maximum snow cover often occurs in january march ranging 38 2 62 6 with the smallest on feb 18th 2011 and the largest on jan 25th 2004 monthly the largest smallest snow cover of 29 1 8 9 is noted in february july table 2 except for slight increases in january april august and september all other months show non significant decreases in snow cover table 2 in comparison annual snow depth decreases significantly at a rate of 0 02 cm year 1 during 1979 2016 fig 6b spatially mean annual snow depth is small in the interior but large in the westernmost and the eastern yb and most of the basin experiences significant decrease in snow depth fig s6 average monthly snow depth ranges from 0 01 cm in august to 4 17 cm in january and decreases for all months of cold season statistically significant in october february while no changes in may september table 2 4 1 4 streamflow monthly streamflow averaged from daily time series at the hydrological stations increases with basin area table 3 during the periods with data available mostly before 1982 monthly streamflow decreases but is not statistically significant table 3 annual streamflow available for longer periods exhibits non significant increasing trends at all stations except for lazi table 3 mean monthly streamflow pattern generally follows that of the precipitation pattern high in june october with peaks in august and low in november may figs 2 and 7a from daily streamflow we picked the maximum value from each year as the annual peakflow and its return periods were calculated fig 7b the magnitude of peakflow depends on the total basin area the larger the basin area then the greater the resulting peakflow while additionally increasing the non exceedance probability at nuxia which controls the largest basin area the 12 800 m3 s 1 peakflow that occurred in 1962 has a 97 non exceedance probability whereas all other stations show much lower peakflows for the same probability the 50 non exceedance probability corresponds to 8360 4500 2570 1750 and 1330 m3 s 1 for nuxia yangcun nugesha lhasa and tangjia respectively the greatest peakflows occurred in 1962 in the yb the most extreme events ever recorded prior to 2011 were due to excessive precipitation the time series of annual streamflow at nuxia yangcun gengzhan lhasa and lazi exhibit largely similar interannual decadal variability fig 7c indicating the dominance of same controlling factor s in the basin 4 2 land cover use change land cover use types in the yb include cropland dense forest canopy coverage 30 shrub land plant height 2 m and canopy coverage 40 sparse forest 10 canopy coverage 30 tree nursery grassland water glacier residential area and vacant land fig 8 and table s1 grassland can be further divided into dense grassland coverage 50 medium grassland coverage in 20 50 and sparse grassland coverage in 5 20 the spatial pattern of land cover use types in the yb is diverse major land cover use types are grassland forest and vacant land together occupying 94 of the entire yb fig 8 grassland alone is more than 150 000 km2 and accounts for 61 of the yb table s1 dense grassland is the dominant grassland and distributed mostly in the middle reach whereas medium and sparse grasslands spread in the middle upper reaches forest occupies 14 of the yb and is situated predominantly in the east cropland is mostly distributed in the middle lower reaches and occupies less than 2 of the yb residential area is primarily located in the middle reach along major tributary banks and accounts for less than 0 1 of the yb table 4 shows the transition matrix of land cover use between 1990 and 2015 tree nursery residential area and vacant land have increased in coverage while dense forest and grasslands are reduced the transition rates among the land cover use types are mostly less than 1 and only tree nursery and residential areas correspond to some transition rates larger than 1 cropland is reduced by 59 65 km2 of which 74 is converted into residential area but only 2 76 km2 of medium grassland and 1 38 km2 of sparse grassland are turned into cropland some dense forest becomes tree nursery shrub dense grassland water residential area or vacant land resulting in a net reduction of dense forest in 2015 compared to 1990 overall residential area is enlarged by 95 66 km2 a 2 fold increase between 1990 and 2015 mostly from the conversions of cropland and grassland while tree nursery is increased by 5 times in area from 1990 to 2015 due to the conversions from grassland water and dense forest grassland transition rates are low and about 99 5 of grassland does not change however more grassland converts to other types than the other way around giving rise to a slight reduction of grassland 4 3 responses of streamflow to climate change and human activities 4 3 1 influence of surface air temperature and precipitation on streamflow two stations with different elevations are chosen to examine the differences in the response of streamflow tangjia 3848 m fig 1 is located in the high elevation tributary of the yarlung tsangpo lhasa river basin lrb and controls 64 of the lrb hereafter referred to as lrb t nuxia 2900 m fig 1 is a downstream gauge in the eastern yb and controls 79 of the yb hereafter yb n table s2 shows that the lrb contains larger proportions of snow but slightly lower proportions of glacier than the yb n the relationships between streamflow and air temperature precipitation during overlapping periods in the two basins are examined in lrb t the overlapping period is 1963 1982 and at dangxiong only in the yb n dangxiong lhasa lazi rikaze jiangzi nimu zedang and linzhi during 1956 2000 are chosen the averages of air temperature and precipitation of the 8 stations in the yb n are used to represent the basin climatic condition the scatter plots between monthly air temperature t precipitation and runoff streamflow divided by basin area and multiplied by seconds in a month to convert unit from m3 s 1 to mm to match precipitation unit for lrb t are shown in fig 9 monthly runoff and temperature for all months can be fitted approximately by an exponential curve with r2 0 53 p 0 05 fig 9a the threshold temperature of 5 c was obtained by the mann kendall mutation analysis using monthly temperature at dangxiong when t 5 c mostly in october early may fig 2 a cold and dry season runoff increases with temperature following a weak linear relationship with r2 0 26 fig 9c when t 5 c mostly in late may september fig 2 a warm and wet season a weak linear relationship r2 0 24 is identified between temperature and runoff fig 9e runoff exhibits a statistically significant linear correlation with precipitation for all months r2 0 78 and p 0 01 fig 9b indicating that 78 of runoff variance could be explained by precipitation variance there is a weak linear relationship between precipitation and runoff r2 0 26 fig 9d during the cold and dry season but a much stronger linear relationship r2 0 55 and p 0 05 fig 9f in the warm and wet season during the warm and wet season the influence of precipitation on runoff dominates that of temperature on runoff for yb n the relationship between temperature and runoff for all months also follows an exponential curve r2 0 48 p 0 01 fig 10 a similar to that of lrb t the mann kendall mutation analysis shows that the temperature threshold that separates the warm and wet season from the dry and cold season becomes 7 c for yb n because of its eastern location and lower elevation resulting in the same months for both seasons as for lrb t for all months combined the correlation between precipitation and runoff stays at r2 0 89 and p 0 01 fig 10b indicating that 89 of runoff variance could be explained by precipitation variance much higher than that between temperature and runoff r2 0 48 p 0 01 fig 10a demonstrating the dominant influence of precipitation on runoff in the yb n year round for yb n when t 7 c a cold and dry season runoff displays a weak and positive linear relationship with temperature r2 0 17 fig 10c but a strong linear relationship with precipitation r2 0 77 p 0 01 fig 10d when t 7 c a warm and wet season runoff is essentially not correlated with t r2 0 09 fig 10e but is again strongly correlated with precipitation with r2 0 80 p 0 01 fig 10f indicating that different from lrb t the influence of precipitation on runoff in yb n is significant regardless of the season four hydrological stations with available annual precipitation and streamflow operated by chinese ministry of water resources are selected to examine the precipitation and streamflow mutations except for lhasa precipitation mutations do not result in the corresponding mutations in streamflow fig 11 in 1983 precipitation at lazi displays an abrupt change it starts to increase in 1983 which continues until 2000 whereas streamflow mutation occurs in 1996 when streamflow starts to increase at lhasa both precipitation and streamflow mutate in 1965 and 1993 and both start to increase in 1996 until about 2006 at gengzhang precipitation mutates in 1984 but streamflow mutates in 1989 at nuxia precipitation shows no mutation while streamflow mutates in 1997 we also used eight meteorological stations located above nuxia for the mutation analysis and found no match in the timings of mutations between precipitation and streamflow strong correlation between precipitation and streamflow does not necessarily result in the same mutations 4 3 2 snow change impacts on streamflow longer overlapping periods of streamflow at lhasa 1979 1982 1999 2005 and nuxia 1979 2000 and snow depth 1979 2005 averaged over the lrb and the yb n enable statistical examinations of snow change impacts on streamflow lhasa 3649 m and nuxia 2900 m represent a relatively high and low elevation station respectively the concurrent and lagged snow effects are examined by using linear correlation analysis we focus on the snowfall and melting season i e october june for example starting from the snowfall month of october the linear correlations between snow depth in october and streamflow in october november december and next year s january february march april may and june are examined respectively likewise snow depth in january is correlated with streamflow in january february march april may and june in july september the region is dominated by summer monsoon and rainfall is the major contributor to streamflow and hence the correlation is not analyzed in yb n there are significant p 0 05 correlations between snow depth in april may and streamflow in may june table 5 however the coefficients of determination r2 between snow depth and streamflow are relatively low at 0 17 0 25 there is no significant correlation at annual step thus a 23 of snow melt contribution to annual streamflow reported by zhang et al 2013 table s3 for yb n is perhaps an overestimation in lrb there is also no correlation between snow depth and streamflow at annual time step at monthly time step however there are several significant p 0 05 concurrent and lagged correlations between basin averaged snow depth and streamflow table 5 reflecting a more important role of snow in the high elevation sub basin at an intra annual time scale for example snow depth in october affects streamflow in april and may of next year with r2 being 0 33 and 0 38 respectively similarly snow depth in november and december also have similar effects on streamflow table 5 snow depth in january february negatively affects streamflow in january february and march of the same year due to the fact that snowfall days are mostly associated with very low temperature that causes rivers to freeze it appears that streamflow in april and may is more often positively affected by snow depth in the previous year 4 3 3 potential land cover use change impacts on streamflow although the absolute areas are small the 2 fold and 5 fold increases of residential area and tree nursery coverage as shown earlier would require more fresh water supply and could pose a challenge for water resources in the yb especially in april may april may is a critical period in the yb which will be discussed later according to liu 2015a the irrigation water allocation for crop and tree nurseries was 120 and 80 m3 10000 m2 respectively hence tree nurseries needs a significant amount of fresh water for irrigation compared to natural forest and grassland which are not irrigated at all on the tp during the growing season song et al 2016 found that in the rural area of the central tar water consumption was about 35 l day per capita fu 2015 reported that for a 20 000 population town the minimum household water consumption should be at least130 l day per capita according to the chinese township design standard and that extra daily water consumption in a town should also include water use in public buildings which is typically about 8 25 of everyday household consumption hence expansion of city and by extension residential areas will consume more water resources as well 5 discussion fig 9 indicates that in lrb t precipitation largely controls annual total discharge and that the combined melt contribution and actual et consumption affected by temperature are less important than precipitation contribution at annual time scale also the threshold of 5 c appears to be a pivotal point beyond which precipitation dominates over temperature in lrb in the warm and wet season both snow and glacier melt and actual et increase due to warm temperature but the rather weak positive linear correlation between temperature and runoff indicates that the negative impact of actual et on runoff is overwhelmed by the melt contribution to runoff in the cold and dry season both melt water and precipitation contribute to runoff to some extent as suggested by r2 0 26 but runoff is dominated by baseflow as there is limited precipitation and melt water yb n is different from lrb t fig 10 shows that during the cold and dry season snow and glaciers within the yb n controlled area table s2 could still melt when t is in 0 7 c and contribute to streamflow to some extent as reflected by r2 0 17 in the mean time precipitation is still the major contributor to streamflow in the same season nuxia is located in the eastern yb which is closer to the bay of bengal where sufficient moisture supply could produce precipitation and the area surrounding nuxia indeed receives higher precipitation than the rest of the yb see also fig 2 for example linzhi receives 120 mm of precipitation during october april about 10 times of that of rikaze and lazi and surface air temperature at linzhi is 5 c in the same time period which ensures that precipitation falls mostly as liquid and could replenish streamflow directly on the other hand during the warm and wet season the entire yb especially the eastern part receives high precipitation and temperature is always above 0 c resulting in the strong influence of precipitation on streamflow hence the eastern yb is the major runoff generation area where discharge is due primarily to precipitation contribution the threshold of 7 c also indicates the changes in the trade off between melt water contribution and et in the different seasons in the cold and dry season melt water contribution dominates over et as seen from the weak positive correlation between runoff and temperature i e r2 0 17 whereas in the warm and wet season melt water contribution cancels out et consumption resulting in essentially no correlation between temperature and runoff i e r2 0 09 the above analysis indicates that the yb is a pluvial regime basin the exponential relationship between runoff and air temperature seen in the yb is perhaps common in watersheds where warm wet and cold dry seasons alternate i e both energy and moisture changes are in phase with each other it should be noted that correlation coefficients could change with different time series hence longer time series should produce more robust relationship which is unfortunately not possible in this study as a comparison table s3 summarizes the contribution percentage of precipitation snow glacier and groundwater to the annual streamflow in lrb and yb n reported by previous studies for precipitation the numbers range from 40 to 49 for lrb and 30 to 65 for yb n these numbers will need to be re examined as the current analysis suggests that the contribution of precipitation could be much higher for snow april may is a melting season when air temperature is on average above zero fig 2 april may is also a sowing seedling and tillering season in the yb valley ban and xu 2016 zhuang 1959 li et al 2018b on average runoff is 6 5 13 1 and 373 6 mm in april may and yearly in lrb with runoff in april and may accounting for 1 7 and 3 5 of the annual total in lrb respectively however only 0 6 13 7 of the annual precipitation occurs in april and may at all meteorological stations hence irrigation plays a critical role in april may due to a lack of precipitation which is also supported by ban and xu 2016 zhuang 1959 and li et al 2018b further in the yb valley water used for irrigation comes solely from surface water stored by reservoirs awr tar 2019 continued warming may pose a potential risk for water shortage in this season when we already noted decreasing snow depth snow cover and glacier area which is also likely to continue in the future because of short and limited observations of glacier and frozen soil in the yb a systematic analysis of the relationship between streamflow and glacier frozen soil is not feasible however a speculative investigation is possible based on the distributions and changes of glacier and frozen soil as analyzed or mentioned earlier in the yb changes in glaciers vary depending on the slope aspects and elevation but glaciers as a whole are retreating the net outcome of the retreat would be increases in streamflow in glacier dominated sub basins the degradation of frozen soil would increase liquid soil moisture that could enhance surface hydrological processes and it could also decrease streamflow e g cuo et al 2015 wang et al 2018 given the potentially strong impacts of glaciers and frozen soil on streamflow on the tp it is imperative to systematically monitor and examine the changes in glaciers and frozen soil in the yb to generate continuous measurements as global warming progresses and snow glaciers and frozen soil continue to degrade the region may be blessed with abundant fresh water in the beginning but as time goes on may end up with severe fresh water shortage in april may when precipitation is low and snow melt contribution is dwindling the increasing trends in both residential area and tree nurseries are expected to continue as population grows and the current policies persist which will demand more fresh water supply placing another potential burden on water resources in the region as noted before there will be less snow glacier and soil water accumulation especially during the melting sowing seedling and tillering season april may as global warming progresses on the other hand if precipitation stays low and changes little in the cold and dry and the melting seasons in the yb in the future as historical data suggests see figs 4 and s1 then streamflow in april may will be detrimentally affected and a conflict between water supply shortage and water demand increase will arise for the warm and wet months july september if the current positive trends of precipitation at most meteorological stations persist then water resources in the yb will not be a concern in the near future 6 conclusions the yb is experiencing rapid warming and increased anthropogenic activities both monthly and annual mean air temperatures increase at all meteorological stations and annual mean air temperature exhibits statistically significant increases at all stations annual precipitation also show increases at most stations but statistically significant only at lhasa monthly precipitation displays mainly no trend or decreasing trends in the cold and dry season of october march and increasing but statistically insignificant trends during the melting season of april june with mixed trends in july september in line with the region wide warming snow cover snow depth and glaciers show decreases in the yb but with noticeable spatial variability during the study period streamflow is characterized by large inter annual and decadal variability the yb experiences 2 fold and 5 fold increases in residential and tree nursery area this study also shows that the lhasa river basin and the yarlung tsangpo basin are pluvial basins where precipitation dominates the annual streamflow however precipitation mutation does not necessarily result in the same mutation in the annual streamflow across the stations warming induced degradation in cryospheric elements low precipitation during the cold and dry season together with the expansion of residential and tree nursery areas could result in water resource conflict in april may a melting sowing seedling and tillering season for the yb this work indicates the necessity of implementing a holistic modeling framework in conjunction with observational analyses that considers both natural physical environmental changes and human activity impacts to fully understand the current and future water resources

8423,study region the yarlung tsangpo basin yb on the tibetan plateau study focus characteristics and changes of air temperature precipitation snow cover snow depth glacier streamflow during 1979 2015 land cover use in 1990 and 2015 and the responses of streamflow to the changes are analyzed the objective is to understand the major factors that influence streamflow in the yb at both intra annual and inter annual time scales new hydrological insights the yb experiences significant warming but spatiotemporally varying precipitation changes snow decreases and glaciers retreat in the yb but with heterogeneous spatial patterns streamflow shows strong annual and decadal variability in the cold and dry season streamflow is positively correlated to air temperature in the upper sub basin non significantly whereas in the warm and wet season precipitation influence dominates the streamflow changes in both high and low elevations human activity induced 2 fold residential area and 5 fold tree nursery area expansions come at the expense of cropland dense forest and grassland in the upper sub basin snow depth and streamflow display significant concurrent and lagged correlations for several months streamflow in april may a melting and seedling season is positively affected by snow depth of the previous year warming induced degradation in cryospheric elements low precipitation during the cold and dry season together with land cover use change could result in water resource conflict in april may for the yb keywords yarlung tsangpo basin environmental change and impacts streamflow water resources conflict 1 introduction streamflow is one of the most important fresh water resources that sustain social and economic development and diverse ecosystems worldwide streamflow is an integrated product involving various hydrological processes in a watershed including precipitation evapotranspiration et infiltration soil water movement overland flow channel routing groundwater discharge snow and glacier melting hence any changes in these hydrological processes will affect streamflow each of these processes is in turn impacted by climate topography soil and land cover use thus investigation of streamflow changes needs to be carried out by considering all of the major factors numerous studies have reported the influences of climate change primarily air temperature and precipitation change on streamflow ficklin et al 2018 milly et al 2018 painter et al 2018 knoben et al 2018 and the combined anthropogenic activities primarily land cover use change such as vegetation change urbanization reservoir operation etc and climate change impacts on streamflow cuo et al 2009 2013a munoz et al 2018 lv et al 2018 tsarouchi and buytaert 2018 in the alpine region climate change impacts are manifested not only in the responses of streamflow to et and precipitation change and human activities but also in the response of streamflow to snow and glacier change and frozen soil degradation due to warming wang et al 2018 evans et al 2018 krogh and pomeroy 2018 therefore including the effects of snow glacier and frozen soil on streamflow in the alpine region is important an understanding of all these is critical for designing mitigation strategies and for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies as streamflow changes have been documented to directly impact ecosystems and societies through flooding bloschl et al 2017 water quality lee et al 2018 foks et al 2018 and hydropower production majone et al 2016 naz et al 2018 ali et al 2018 the tibetan plateau tp with an average elevation of 4000 m and an area of 2 5 106 km2 is home to the headwaters of major asian rivers the yellow yangtze mekong salween yarlung tsangpo upper brahmaputra indus and tarim rivers these rivers provide essential fresh water resources to the local and downstream societies and ecosystems the tp also contains the largest cryospheric elements including glacier snow and frozen soil outside of the arctic and antarctic according to the second glacier inventory by liu et al 2014a b during the first decade of the 21st century the tp had 39 636 glaciers with a total area of about 43 821 km2 greater than 10 snow cover exists year round along the mountains with more than 50 snow cover persisting in the west kunlun the west himalayas and the hengduan mountains li et al 2018a b chen et al 2018 frozen soil consists of permafrost and seasonally frozen soil studies show that permafrost area covers about 40 46 of the tp zou et al 2017 wang et al 2019 whereas seasonally frozen ground accounts for about 56 of the tp zou et al 2017 studies have shown that the tp is experiencing region wide warming zhu et al 2018 ding et al 2018 xi et al 2018 but spatially heterogeneous precipitation changes cuo et al 2013b also glaciers on the tp are experiencing heterogeneous changes retreating in the southeast plateau but growing or stabilized in the west kunlun and north karakoram yao et al 2012 lin et al 2018 snow cover undergoes mixed changes on the tp increasing along the mountain ranges but decreasing in the interiors of large river basins chen et al 2018 permafrost soil in china of which the majority is distributed on the tp has been consistently degrading its area has been reduced from 2 15 106 km2 in the 1970s to 1 75 106 km2 in 2006 to 1 59 106 km2 in 2012 cheng and jin 2013 and to 1 06 106 km2 in 2017 zou et al 2017 although different studies use different mapping methods and the comparison in the degradation rates of permafrost should be regarded with caution the persistent decreasing trend over the period is nevertheless consistent amongst the studies ran et al 2018 used mean annual air temperature to examine permafrost in 1960 s 2000 s and reported a 23 84 reduction of the permafrost area over the period the implications of the degradation have been documented and illustrated from the hydrological and ecological perspectives cuo et al 2015 qin et al 2018 gao et al 2018 however studies that cover the impacts of all important environmental factors such as air temperature precipitation land cover use snow glacier and frozen soil on streamflow on the tp are lacking currently relevant studies that examine historical streamflow changes on the tp are mostly focused on streamflow regime change and streamflow response to changes in two or three environmental factors cuo et al 2014 for example in the yarlung tsangpo basin yb the upper stream of the trans boundary brahmaputra river chen 2012 assessed flow regime change during 1961 2000 liu et al 2014b analyzed the spatiotemporal distributions of air temperature precipitation and land cover use and examined their impacts on streamflow nie et al 2016 used gis techniques meteorological data analyses and mann kendall nonparametric test to study the impacts of climate change snow cover and depth on streamflow and found that due to warming and wetting streamflow increased during 1979 2006 zhang et al 2013 used modeling to study the contribution of snow and glacier melting to streamflow in a few major basins on the tp including the yb for the other basins on the tp among others cuo et al 2013a used a hydrological model to investigate both climate and land cover use change impacts on streamflow in the upper yellow river gao et al 2018 conducted a modeling study and found that permafrost degradation caused increase in baseflow in the heihe river basin given all the studies and the need for a good understanding of streamflow changes an inclusive representation of all major factors and their impacts on streamflow is necessary this study attempts to fill this gap through examining the changes in climate land cover use cryospheric elements and their relationships with streamflow in the yb this is the first comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the major factors that influence streamflow in the yb the water resource management sectors in the yb have been constantly asking the question of how streamflow has responded to changes in climate land cover use and cryosphere the results from this study should be useful for the sustainable management of water resources in the region the objective of this study is 2 fold 1 examining the up to date key climatic factors glacier and snow streamflow and land cover use changes in the yb and 2 examining streamflow response to the changes in climatic factors glacier snow and land cover use in the yb through this study we aim to understand the major factors that influence streamflow in the yb at both intra annual and inter annual time steps which has not been investigated before 2 study area the yb is situated in the southern tibetan autonomous region tar 82 97 12 e and 28 31 27 n on the tp fig 1 and provides essential water resources to the local and downstream areas of china india and bangladesh using baxika as the basin outlet the yb has an area of about 248 000 km2 and its elevation ranges from 150 m to more than 7200 m the river originates from the jiemayangzong glacier located in the west of the basin the basin is surrounded by the gangdise and nianqing tanggula mountains in the north the himalaya mountains in the south and the hengduan mountains in the east from the west to the east the basin s climate ranges from alpine arid alpine temperate arid mountainous sub tropical and to tropical climate the diverse climate and complex topography in the basin give birth to diverse ecosystems including rainforest coniferous trees broadleaf trees shrub grassland meadow and tundra the yb produces the greatest discharge right after it leaves the tp among all rivers that originate from the tp making the yarlung tsangpo brahmaputra river the world s third largest river by discharge the yb also has a great potential for hydropower production the yb is of tremendous importance for the tibetans as it is where the tibetan culture was nurtured and spread to the entire tp since the early 5th century danzhu 2000 it is also the economic cultural and political center of the tar liu 2015b 3 data and methods multiple data types from multiple data sources are used in this study which include 1 daily air temperature and precipitation at 11 meteorological stations located in the yb for 1979 2017 and obtained from the china meteorological administration fig 1 2 daily and annual streamflow for 10 stream gauges in total and annual precipitation for lazi lhasa gengzhang and nuxia operated by the chinese ministry of water resources fig 1 for various periods depending on the data sources explained below 3 the first and second glacier inventories of china gic cas 1986 liu et al 2014a 4 modis snow cover data in 500 m resolution for 2003 2014 qiu et al 2016 5 snow depth data in 0 25 resolution for 1979 2016 che et al 2008 dai et al 2012 2015 and 6 land cover and land use maps at 1 km resolution representing the 1990 and 2015 conditions from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences it has been difficult to acquire the long term streamflow data from the chinese ministry of water resources directly we have resorted to various sources for obtaining the streamflow data and hence some stations e g lhasa and nuxia have both monthly and annual time series but with different time periods the trends of air temperature precipitation snow cover snow depth and streamflow are examined using the mann kendall test and sen s slope approach sen 1968 the relationship of streamflow with precipitation temperature and snow depth is investigated through linear correlation analysis mutations of time series are detected using the mann kendall mutation analysis land cover use change is examined using the transition matrix defined below 1 b i j a i j 100 j 1 n a i j 2 c j i a j i 100 i 1 n a j i where i and j are the row representing 1990 and column representing 2015 numbers in the transition matrix respectively aij a ji is the total area of the 1990 2015 land cover in row i column j bij unit is the proportion of the area of a land cover in i j to the total area in row i in 1990 cji unit is the proportion of the area of a land cover in j i to the total area in column j in 2015 in other words b ij is the proportion of land cover in 1990 that has been transitioned to another land cover in 2015 and c ji is the proportion of land cover in 2015 that has been transitioned from a land cover type in 1990 4 results 4 1 spatiotemporal variations in hydro climate and cryospheric variables 4 1 1 surface air temperature and precipitation mean annual air temperature ranges from 0 3 to 8 9 c across the stations during 1979 2017 generally decreasing with elevation table 1 annual precipitation ranges from 284 to 907 mm and increases from the west to the east corresponding to the arid continental climate in the far west to the mixed arid continental and indian summer monsoon climate in the central and to the indian summer monsoon dominated climate in the east mean monthly air temperature at jiali which has the highest elevation has the lowest temperature throughout the year and has temperatures above zero only during may october fig 2 dangxiong which has the second highest elevation has the second lowest temperature ranging from 8 5 to 11 3 c at bomi and linzhi the two lowest stations in the eastern yb temperatures stays above zero throughout the year all stations display well defined seasonal cycles in temperature the hottest month is june at the central stations and july at the eastern stations monthly precipitation is generally high in the warm season june september at most stations due to wet summer monsoon and low in the cold season november february due to dry westerlies fig 2 bomi displays an extensive raining period of march through october the raining season at linzhi and jiali also spans from april to october likely due to sufficient moisture supply from the bay of bengal luolong an eastern but farther northern station exhibits the lowest july august precipitation but relatively higher october june precipitation than the western stations decadal mean monthly precipitation is shown in fig s1 the maximum monthly precipitation occurs progressively earlier in more recent decades than in past decades at bomi dangxiong jiangzi lhasa linzhi rikaze and zedang double peaks at luolong becomes a single peak with time in the cold and dry season precipitation generally does not change with time these features perhaps indicate some changes in summer circulation patterns table 1 also shows the trends calculated from annual mean air temperature and annual precipitation for 1979 2017 air temperature increases significantly at all stations table 1 fig s2 ranging from 0 03 to 0 06 c year 1 with no significant correlation between the warming rates and elevation fig s3 precipitation trends range from 1 30 to 2 73 mm year 1 and a majority of the stations correspond to positive trends but statistically significant p 0 05 at lhasa only table 1 negative precipitation trends are found at jiangzi bomi and luolong but none of them are statistically significant monthly mean air temperature trends are all positive with lhasa corresponding to the highest and statistically significant p 0 05 warming rates in most months fig 3 zedang displays the lowest warming rates especially in the warm season in general the warming rates in the cold season november february are higher than those in the warm season june september monthly precipitation trends are mixed and most of the trends are statistically insignificant fig 4 generally slightly increasing trends in precipitation are noted in april june in the center with decreasing trends in the east in june july september and in the center in august possibly related to the weakening of the indian summer monsoon in the recent decades ding et al 2019 submitted in the cold season precipitation changes are rather small and a majority of the stations display no trends fig 4 the mutation analysis for precipitation fig s4 shows that due to its high inter annual variability all stations display multiple mutation points and for most stations the first mutation occurs around 1987 4 1 2 glacier a glacier is a solid reservoir able to preserve water for centuries and is sensitive to climate change the yb contains 30 of the tp s glaciers liu et al 2014a we use the first gic 1 cas 1986 and the second gic 2 liu et al 2014a glacier inventories of china for identifying glacier changes in the yb both gic 1 and gic 2 used the gcs krasovsky 1940 map projection it is worth noting here that glacier changes inferred from the gic datasets could be underestimated since nearly 50 of the glaciers included in both gic 2 and gic 1 came from the 1968 1980 survey and satellite images that were taken primarily in the eastern basin along the hengduan mountain ranges glaciers are mostly distributed along the mountain ranges surrounding the basin the hengduan mountains in the east contain the largest area of glaciers fig s5 glacier retreat is noticeable as there were 9743 glaciers with a total area of 11 719 km2 in gic 1 which were reduced to 8453 glaciers with an area of 9725 km2 in gic 2 glaciers to the west of 90 e retreat dramatically and some have even disappeared in gic 2 compared to gic 1 fig s5 fig 5 a compares the areas of glaciers with various slope aspects in the basin between gic 1 and gic 2 slope aspects were calculated by the arcgis 3d analysis package using nasa s srtm shuttle radar topography mission 90 m digital elevation model for both inventories the north facing glaciers take up the largest areas 17 67 in gic 1 and 21 52 in gic 2 while the west facing glaciers occupy the smallest areas 8 88 in gic 1 and 5 94 in gic 2 with other glaciers in between radiation deficiency in the north facing slope and moisture abundance in the east facing slope might contribute to the glacier growth there are other factors that might also play a role for example windward lifting and cooling would favor glacier growth while leeward sinking and warming would cause glacier to retreat compared to gic 1 the proportions of north northeast southeast and east facing glaciers in gic 2 have grown and together account for more than 69 of the total glacier area whereas the proportions of northwest west southwest and south facing glaciers have shrunk fig 5b shows the changes in glacier area at different elevation bands in the basin the glaciers are grouped into 5 bands in a 1000 m elevation interval between 2500 and 7500 m and then the total glacier area for each elevation band is computed most glaciers are located within the 4500 6500 m elevation compared to gic 1 the glacier areas in gic 2 increase slightly for 2500 3500 m 4500 5500 m and 6500 7500 m but decrease for 3500 4500 m and 5500 6500 m elevation ranges given the warming trends in the yb it appears that the heterogeneous precipitation changes combined with aspects and elevation effects might be responsible for glacier retreat or advance 4 1 3 snow annual mean and maximum snow cover decrease slightly from 2003 to 2014 fig 6 a snow cover occurring mostly in october march ranges from 18 2 to 27 0 annually with an average of 18 3 during 2003 2014 annual maximum snow cover often occurs in january march ranging 38 2 62 6 with the smallest on feb 18th 2011 and the largest on jan 25th 2004 monthly the largest smallest snow cover of 29 1 8 9 is noted in february july table 2 except for slight increases in january april august and september all other months show non significant decreases in snow cover table 2 in comparison annual snow depth decreases significantly at a rate of 0 02 cm year 1 during 1979 2016 fig 6b spatially mean annual snow depth is small in the interior but large in the westernmost and the eastern yb and most of the basin experiences significant decrease in snow depth fig s6 average monthly snow depth ranges from 0 01 cm in august to 4 17 cm in january and decreases for all months of cold season statistically significant in october february while no changes in may september table 2 4 1 4 streamflow monthly streamflow averaged from daily time series at the hydrological stations increases with basin area table 3 during the periods with data available mostly before 1982 monthly streamflow decreases but is not statistically significant table 3 annual streamflow available for longer periods exhibits non significant increasing trends at all stations except for lazi table 3 mean monthly streamflow pattern generally follows that of the precipitation pattern high in june october with peaks in august and low in november may figs 2 and 7a from daily streamflow we picked the maximum value from each year as the annual peakflow and its return periods were calculated fig 7b the magnitude of peakflow depends on the total basin area the larger the basin area then the greater the resulting peakflow while additionally increasing the non exceedance probability at nuxia which controls the largest basin area the 12 800 m3 s 1 peakflow that occurred in 1962 has a 97 non exceedance probability whereas all other stations show much lower peakflows for the same probability the 50 non exceedance probability corresponds to 8360 4500 2570 1750 and 1330 m3 s 1 for nuxia yangcun nugesha lhasa and tangjia respectively the greatest peakflows occurred in 1962 in the yb the most extreme events ever recorded prior to 2011 were due to excessive precipitation the time series of annual streamflow at nuxia yangcun gengzhan lhasa and lazi exhibit largely similar interannual decadal variability fig 7c indicating the dominance of same controlling factor s in the basin 4 2 land cover use change land cover use types in the yb include cropland dense forest canopy coverage 30 shrub land plant height 2 m and canopy coverage 40 sparse forest 10 canopy coverage 30 tree nursery grassland water glacier residential area and vacant land fig 8 and table s1 grassland can be further divided into dense grassland coverage 50 medium grassland coverage in 20 50 and sparse grassland coverage in 5 20 the spatial pattern of land cover use types in the yb is diverse major land cover use types are grassland forest and vacant land together occupying 94 of the entire yb fig 8 grassland alone is more than 150 000 km2 and accounts for 61 of the yb table s1 dense grassland is the dominant grassland and distributed mostly in the middle reach whereas medium and sparse grasslands spread in the middle upper reaches forest occupies 14 of the yb and is situated predominantly in the east cropland is mostly distributed in the middle lower reaches and occupies less than 2 of the yb residential area is primarily located in the middle reach along major tributary banks and accounts for less than 0 1 of the yb table 4 shows the transition matrix of land cover use between 1990 and 2015 tree nursery residential area and vacant land have increased in coverage while dense forest and grasslands are reduced the transition rates among the land cover use types are mostly less than 1 and only tree nursery and residential areas correspond to some transition rates larger than 1 cropland is reduced by 59 65 km2 of which 74 is converted into residential area but only 2 76 km2 of medium grassland and 1 38 km2 of sparse grassland are turned into cropland some dense forest becomes tree nursery shrub dense grassland water residential area or vacant land resulting in a net reduction of dense forest in 2015 compared to 1990 overall residential area is enlarged by 95 66 km2 a 2 fold increase between 1990 and 2015 mostly from the conversions of cropland and grassland while tree nursery is increased by 5 times in area from 1990 to 2015 due to the conversions from grassland water and dense forest grassland transition rates are low and about 99 5 of grassland does not change however more grassland converts to other types than the other way around giving rise to a slight reduction of grassland 4 3 responses of streamflow to climate change and human activities 4 3 1 influence of surface air temperature and precipitation on streamflow two stations with different elevations are chosen to examine the differences in the response of streamflow tangjia 3848 m fig 1 is located in the high elevation tributary of the yarlung tsangpo lhasa river basin lrb and controls 64 of the lrb hereafter referred to as lrb t nuxia 2900 m fig 1 is a downstream gauge in the eastern yb and controls 79 of the yb hereafter yb n table s2 shows that the lrb contains larger proportions of snow but slightly lower proportions of glacier than the yb n the relationships between streamflow and air temperature precipitation during overlapping periods in the two basins are examined in lrb t the overlapping period is 1963 1982 and at dangxiong only in the yb n dangxiong lhasa lazi rikaze jiangzi nimu zedang and linzhi during 1956 2000 are chosen the averages of air temperature and precipitation of the 8 stations in the yb n are used to represent the basin climatic condition the scatter plots between monthly air temperature t precipitation and runoff streamflow divided by basin area and multiplied by seconds in a month to convert unit from m3 s 1 to mm to match precipitation unit for lrb t are shown in fig 9 monthly runoff and temperature for all months can be fitted approximately by an exponential curve with r2 0 53 p 0 05 fig 9a the threshold temperature of 5 c was obtained by the mann kendall mutation analysis using monthly temperature at dangxiong when t 5 c mostly in october early may fig 2 a cold and dry season runoff increases with temperature following a weak linear relationship with r2 0 26 fig 9c when t 5 c mostly in late may september fig 2 a warm and wet season a weak linear relationship r2 0 24 is identified between temperature and runoff fig 9e runoff exhibits a statistically significant linear correlation with precipitation for all months r2 0 78 and p 0 01 fig 9b indicating that 78 of runoff variance could be explained by precipitation variance there is a weak linear relationship between precipitation and runoff r2 0 26 fig 9d during the cold and dry season but a much stronger linear relationship r2 0 55 and p 0 05 fig 9f in the warm and wet season during the warm and wet season the influence of precipitation on runoff dominates that of temperature on runoff for yb n the relationship between temperature and runoff for all months also follows an exponential curve r2 0 48 p 0 01 fig 10 a similar to that of lrb t the mann kendall mutation analysis shows that the temperature threshold that separates the warm and wet season from the dry and cold season becomes 7 c for yb n because of its eastern location and lower elevation resulting in the same months for both seasons as for lrb t for all months combined the correlation between precipitation and runoff stays at r2 0 89 and p 0 01 fig 10b indicating that 89 of runoff variance could be explained by precipitation variance much higher than that between temperature and runoff r2 0 48 p 0 01 fig 10a demonstrating the dominant influence of precipitation on runoff in the yb n year round for yb n when t 7 c a cold and dry season runoff displays a weak and positive linear relationship with temperature r2 0 17 fig 10c but a strong linear relationship with precipitation r2 0 77 p 0 01 fig 10d when t 7 c a warm and wet season runoff is essentially not correlated with t r2 0 09 fig 10e but is again strongly correlated with precipitation with r2 0 80 p 0 01 fig 10f indicating that different from lrb t the influence of precipitation on runoff in yb n is significant regardless of the season four hydrological stations with available annual precipitation and streamflow operated by chinese ministry of water resources are selected to examine the precipitation and streamflow mutations except for lhasa precipitation mutations do not result in the corresponding mutations in streamflow fig 11 in 1983 precipitation at lazi displays an abrupt change it starts to increase in 1983 which continues until 2000 whereas streamflow mutation occurs in 1996 when streamflow starts to increase at lhasa both precipitation and streamflow mutate in 1965 and 1993 and both start to increase in 1996 until about 2006 at gengzhang precipitation mutates in 1984 but streamflow mutates in 1989 at nuxia precipitation shows no mutation while streamflow mutates in 1997 we also used eight meteorological stations located above nuxia for the mutation analysis and found no match in the timings of mutations between precipitation and streamflow strong correlation between precipitation and streamflow does not necessarily result in the same mutations 4 3 2 snow change impacts on streamflow longer overlapping periods of streamflow at lhasa 1979 1982 1999 2005 and nuxia 1979 2000 and snow depth 1979 2005 averaged over the lrb and the yb n enable statistical examinations of snow change impacts on streamflow lhasa 3649 m and nuxia 2900 m represent a relatively high and low elevation station respectively the concurrent and lagged snow effects are examined by using linear correlation analysis we focus on the snowfall and melting season i e october june for example starting from the snowfall month of october the linear correlations between snow depth in october and streamflow in october november december and next year s january february march april may and june are examined respectively likewise snow depth in january is correlated with streamflow in january february march april may and june in july september the region is dominated by summer monsoon and rainfall is the major contributor to streamflow and hence the correlation is not analyzed in yb n there are significant p 0 05 correlations between snow depth in april may and streamflow in may june table 5 however the coefficients of determination r2 between snow depth and streamflow are relatively low at 0 17 0 25 there is no significant correlation at annual step thus a 23 of snow melt contribution to annual streamflow reported by zhang et al 2013 table s3 for yb n is perhaps an overestimation in lrb there is also no correlation between snow depth and streamflow at annual time step at monthly time step however there are several significant p 0 05 concurrent and lagged correlations between basin averaged snow depth and streamflow table 5 reflecting a more important role of snow in the high elevation sub basin at an intra annual time scale for example snow depth in october affects streamflow in april and may of next year with r2 being 0 33 and 0 38 respectively similarly snow depth in november and december also have similar effects on streamflow table 5 snow depth in january february negatively affects streamflow in january february and march of the same year due to the fact that snowfall days are mostly associated with very low temperature that causes rivers to freeze it appears that streamflow in april and may is more often positively affected by snow depth in the previous year 4 3 3 potential land cover use change impacts on streamflow although the absolute areas are small the 2 fold and 5 fold increases of residential area and tree nursery coverage as shown earlier would require more fresh water supply and could pose a challenge for water resources in the yb especially in april may april may is a critical period in the yb which will be discussed later according to liu 2015a the irrigation water allocation for crop and tree nurseries was 120 and 80 m3 10000 m2 respectively hence tree nurseries needs a significant amount of fresh water for irrigation compared to natural forest and grassland which are not irrigated at all on the tp during the growing season song et al 2016 found that in the rural area of the central tar water consumption was about 35 l day per capita fu 2015 reported that for a 20 000 population town the minimum household water consumption should be at least130 l day per capita according to the chinese township design standard and that extra daily water consumption in a town should also include water use in public buildings which is typically about 8 25 of everyday household consumption hence expansion of city and by extension residential areas will consume more water resources as well 5 discussion fig 9 indicates that in lrb t precipitation largely controls annual total discharge and that the combined melt contribution and actual et consumption affected by temperature are less important than precipitation contribution at annual time scale also the threshold of 5 c appears to be a pivotal point beyond which precipitation dominates over temperature in lrb in the warm and wet season both snow and glacier melt and actual et increase due to warm temperature but the rather weak positive linear correlation between temperature and runoff indicates that the negative impact of actual et on runoff is overwhelmed by the melt contribution to runoff in the cold and dry season both melt water and precipitation contribute to runoff to some extent as suggested by r2 0 26 but runoff is dominated by baseflow as there is limited precipitation and melt water yb n is different from lrb t fig 10 shows that during the cold and dry season snow and glaciers within the yb n controlled area table s2 could still melt when t is in 0 7 c and contribute to streamflow to some extent as reflected by r2 0 17 in the mean time precipitation is still the major contributor to streamflow in the same season nuxia is located in the eastern yb which is closer to the bay of bengal where sufficient moisture supply could produce precipitation and the area surrounding nuxia indeed receives higher precipitation than the rest of the yb see also fig 2 for example linzhi receives 120 mm of precipitation during october april about 10 times of that of rikaze and lazi and surface air temperature at linzhi is 5 c in the same time period which ensures that precipitation falls mostly as liquid and could replenish streamflow directly on the other hand during the warm and wet season the entire yb especially the eastern part receives high precipitation and temperature is always above 0 c resulting in the strong influence of precipitation on streamflow hence the eastern yb is the major runoff generation area where discharge is due primarily to precipitation contribution the threshold of 7 c also indicates the changes in the trade off between melt water contribution and et in the different seasons in the cold and dry season melt water contribution dominates over et as seen from the weak positive correlation between runoff and temperature i e r2 0 17 whereas in the warm and wet season melt water contribution cancels out et consumption resulting in essentially no correlation between temperature and runoff i e r2 0 09 the above analysis indicates that the yb is a pluvial regime basin the exponential relationship between runoff and air temperature seen in the yb is perhaps common in watersheds where warm wet and cold dry seasons alternate i e both energy and moisture changes are in phase with each other it should be noted that correlation coefficients could change with different time series hence longer time series should produce more robust relationship which is unfortunately not possible in this study as a comparison table s3 summarizes the contribution percentage of precipitation snow glacier and groundwater to the annual streamflow in lrb and yb n reported by previous studies for precipitation the numbers range from 40 to 49 for lrb and 30 to 65 for yb n these numbers will need to be re examined as the current analysis suggests that the contribution of precipitation could be much higher for snow april may is a melting season when air temperature is on average above zero fig 2 april may is also a sowing seedling and tillering season in the yb valley ban and xu 2016 zhuang 1959 li et al 2018b on average runoff is 6 5 13 1 and 373 6 mm in april may and yearly in lrb with runoff in april and may accounting for 1 7 and 3 5 of the annual total in lrb respectively however only 0 6 13 7 of the annual precipitation occurs in april and may at all meteorological stations hence irrigation plays a critical role in april may due to a lack of precipitation which is also supported by ban and xu 2016 zhuang 1959 and li et al 2018b further in the yb valley water used for irrigation comes solely from surface water stored by reservoirs awr tar 2019 continued warming may pose a potential risk for water shortage in this season when we already noted decreasing snow depth snow cover and glacier area which is also likely to continue in the future because of short and limited observations of glacier and frozen soil in the yb a systematic analysis of the relationship between streamflow and glacier frozen soil is not feasible however a speculative investigation is possible based on the distributions and changes of glacier and frozen soil as analyzed or mentioned earlier in the yb changes in glaciers vary depending on the slope aspects and elevation but glaciers as a whole are retreating the net outcome of the retreat would be increases in streamflow in glacier dominated sub basins the degradation of frozen soil would increase liquid soil moisture that could enhance surface hydrological processes and it could also decrease streamflow e g cuo et al 2015 wang et al 2018 given the potentially strong impacts of glaciers and frozen soil on streamflow on the tp it is imperative to systematically monitor and examine the changes in glaciers and frozen soil in the yb to generate continuous measurements as global warming progresses and snow glaciers and frozen soil continue to degrade the region may be blessed with abundant fresh water in the beginning but as time goes on may end up with severe fresh water shortage in april may when precipitation is low and snow melt contribution is dwindling the increasing trends in both residential area and tree nurseries are expected to continue as population grows and the current policies persist which will demand more fresh water supply placing another potential burden on water resources in the region as noted before there will be less snow glacier and soil water accumulation especially during the melting sowing seedling and tillering season april may as global warming progresses on the other hand if precipitation stays low and changes little in the cold and dry and the melting seasons in the yb in the future as historical data suggests see figs 4 and s1 then streamflow in april may will be detrimentally affected and a conflict between water supply shortage and water demand increase will arise for the warm and wet months july september if the current positive trends of precipitation at most meteorological stations persist then water resources in the yb will not be a concern in the near future 6 conclusions the yb is experiencing rapid warming and increased anthropogenic activities both monthly and annual mean air temperatures increase at all meteorological stations and annual mean air temperature exhibits statistically significant increases at all stations annual precipitation also show increases at most stations but statistically significant only at lhasa monthly precipitation displays mainly no trend or decreasing trends in the cold and dry season of october march and increasing but statistically insignificant trends during the melting season of april june with mixed trends in july september in line with the region wide warming snow cover snow depth and glaciers show decreases in the yb but with noticeable spatial variability during the study period streamflow is characterized by large inter annual and decadal variability the yb experiences 2 fold and 5 fold increases in residential and tree nursery area this study also shows that the lhasa river basin and the yarlung tsangpo basin are pluvial basins where precipitation dominates the annual streamflow however precipitation mutation does not necessarily result in the same mutation in the annual streamflow across the stations warming induced degradation in cryospheric elements low precipitation during the cold and dry season together with the expansion of residential and tree nursery areas could result in water resource conflict in april may a melting sowing seedling and tillering season for the yb this work indicates the necessity of implementing a holistic modeling framework in conjunction with observational analyses that considers both natural physical environmental changes and human activity impacts to fully understand the current and future water resources

8424,study region addis ababa ethiopia study focus addis ababa is undergoing rapid urbanization with unprecedented high rate of road and building constructions resulting in a sudden upsurge of sealed surfaces and generation of significant amounts of stormwater the present study therefore aims to investigate the hydraulic capacity of existing drains and stormwater management challenges using detailed field surveys and stakeholders interview 469 road segments 74 km and 202 drain segments 42 76 km in two representative case sites confined in 564 54 ha boundary areas were physically surveyed new hydrological insights for the region results showed that 14 of the drains in new city parts and 28 in old city parts were in conditions inadequate for removal of stormwater resulting in flash flooding and infrastructure degradation in the associated watersheds further although more than 72 of the surveyed drains were oversized stormwater overtopping reoccur as a season to season problem ascribed to illegal dumping of waste into drains reducing their hydraulic capacity the challenges of stormwater management were related to lack of city wide drainage master plan absence of hydrologic data considerations during designing drains and weak enforcement on solid and liquid waste dumping into drains the present study recommends that building practices that minimize surface sealing and critical hydrologic and hydraulic considerations during designing drains and educating the local community and stakeholders regarding waste management keywords addis ababa ethiopia flash flooding hydraulic capacity of drains integrated land use planning stormwater runoff 1 introduction urbanization is characterized by a marked increase in built structures koehn et al 2011 such as streets walkways parking lots and rooftops creating sealed surfaces compared to the pre urban conditions these sealed surfaces result in increased stormwater runoff and a reduction in infiltration capacity gill et al 2007 miller and hess 2017 this is resulting in stormwater related flash flooding where most global cities are facing price and vojinovic 2008 this phenomenon is manifested by infrastructure and properties damage and the hindering of traffic movement the causes are poorly developed stormwater management system improper waste management and increasing impervious surface cover miller et al 2014 hoang and fenner 2015 to protect the costly built up areas from flooding and degradation and sustain the service life of infrastructure stormwater management is needed barbosa et al 2012 most developing countries like ethiopia have low coverage of urban stormwater management systems abeje 2004 providing neither on site management nor safe removal and discharge to natural receiving environments in ethiopia most municipalities assume that the majority of the road networks usually the arterial and collector roads should have drain fupcob 2008 however this goal is not realized beyond the planning level assumable due to high financial requirements lack of focus of city administrations and its single purpose approach to only collect convey stormwater out of the boundary of the city conversely some developed countries combine the conventional approach with the multiple purpose stormwater management alternatives such as stormwater management using green infrastructure rainwater harvesting retaining and detaining stormwater on site green roofing and porous pavements at streets and parking lots hoyer et al 2011 hamel et al 2013 hoang and fenner 2015 niu et al 2015 addis ababa the capital of ethiopia and the seat of the african union is experiencing a high rate of urbanization mazhindu and gondo 2010 with a population rise from 0 684 million in 1967 to 3 434 million in 2017 csa 2013 increasing more than five folds in fifty years like other developing countries parkinson and mark 2005 stormwater management is given less emphasis when compared with other urban development activities resulting in flash flooding and degradation of urban infrastructure the coverage of the unsystematic traditional piped drains together with their hydraulic capacity in addis ababa is largely unknown apart from few data collected in a small neighborhood in the oldest part of the city belete 2011 consequently the actual state of drainage in addis ababa including the hydraulic capacity and map of the constructed drains are anonymous understanding the contribution of wastes in reducing the hydraulic capacity of drains and causing flash flooding will help engineers urban planners and city decision makers to effectively prioritize responsive strategies taking addis ababa as case the present study was conducted to evaluate the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains by taking two representative case studies and investigate the management challenges of stormwater 2 review of stormwater management practices to control the historical urban grown stormwater problems various stormwater management systems have been developed by various researchers and applied in different countries some of these include low impact development lid water sensitive urban design wsud integrated urban water management iuwm sustainable urban drainage system suds best management practices bmps source control green infrastructure gi and landscape based stormwater management lsm currently these sustainable stormwater management systems are opted to deal with the limitations of traditional stormwater drainage systems the traditional system often focuses on collecting and conveying stormwater runoff burns et al 2012 directly to water bodies resulting in an exacerbating pollutant concentrations and hydrologic disturbance which ultimately degrading ecosystem structure and function roy et al 2008 conversely these sustainable stormwater management systems are with the objective to retain infiltrate and harvest stormwater at or near the source this is enhancing evapo transpiration and groundwater recharge and re use of stormwater may lead to a more sustainable solution to stormwater the practices of stormwater management solutions are reviewed as follows 2 1 lid it has been most commonly used in north america and new zealand since the 1970s fletcher et al 2014 to minimize the cost of stormwater management through integrating design with nature approach lid is characterized by smaller scale stormwater treatment devices such as bio retention systems green roofs and swales located at or near the source of stormwater runoff barlow et al 1977 2 2 wsud this system was started in the 1990s in australia fletcher et al 2014 to manage the water balance maintain and where possible enhance water quality encourage water conservation minimizing import of potable water supply through harvesting stormwater and the recycling of wastewater and reductions in irrigation requirements and maintain water related environmental and recreational opportunities 2 3 iuwm it combines the management of water supply wastewater and stormwater fletcher et al 2007 and considers the roles and interactions of the various institutions involved in urban water cycle management rogers 1993 iuwm considers all parts of the water cycle natural constructed surface and subsurface mitchell 2006 iuwm recognizes the water cycle as an integrated system both for human needs and ecological consider the local context accounting for environmental social cultural and economic perspectives 2 4 suds it was started to habituate in the uk in the late 1980s and in 1992 due to developments changing the approach to stormwater and the change of the scope for control of urban runoff fletcher et al 2014 it consists of a range of technologies and proficiencies used to manage stormwater which is more sustainable than conventional solutions hoang and fenner 2015 suds is based on the rationale of retroflexing the natural pre development drainage from a site 2 5 bmps it was primarily drafted in 1972 as part of the clean water act in the us and canada to prevent pollution using structural approaches it has a historical basis in the management of centralized wastewater treatment systems fletcher et al 2014 until it was matured to pollution prevention activities bmps encompasses both non structural and structural measure including schedules of activities prohibitions of practices maintenance procedures and practices to control plant site runoff leaks and sludge disposal usepa 2011 2 6 source control it was initiated in north america in the 1990s to mitigate increased runoff initially it was used to make a distinction between on site stormwater systems and practices to be used at or near to the source of stormwater generation contrary to larger detention ponds that are constructed at the downstream of a drainage system whipple et al 1983 moreover it focuses on stormwater pollution control with a strong focus on non structural or semi structural techniques ellis 2000 2 7 gi it goes far beyond stormwater management as its concept influences urban planning to maximize the benefits of green spaces center for neighborhood technology 2010 of the many functions the potential usage of gi to assist stormwater management was realized throughout the us usepa 2012 gi is used interchangeably with lid and bmps struck et al 2010 it is a sustainable stormwater management practices e g green roofs rain gardens permeable pavement that can detain and infiltrate rain where it falls resulting in reducing stormwater runoff and improving the quality of water bodies foster et al 2011 in contrast to single purpose piped based grey stormwater infrastructure gi uses vegetation and soil to manage stormwater at or near the source of generation the widespread adoption of gi is likely to take stormwater management towards a more distributed and at source application keeley et al 2013 2 8 lsm it relates the natural system with the hydrological features that encompass the landscape lsm considers the environmental context of a specific site within the matrix of the larger landscape it also recognizes the importance of temporal seasonal and microclimatic factors on ecological function sameer and zimmer 2010 the goal of lsm is to maintain the ecological integrity of healthy sites and watersheds the application of lsm requires a comprehensive understanding of natural and hydrologic features and functions this includes biophysical hydrological and hydro geological features and their interrelated functions modifying factors e g climate and temporal factors e g seasonal changes sameer and zimmer 2010 these nature based stormwater management solutions have substantial contributions to attain sustainable urban development in contrast in addis ababa the introduction and use of such sustainable stormwater management is absent though they are fundamental to efforts to improve the well being of the residents moreover the high density of structures improper open spaces management lack of enforcement complex social and political dynamics and limited available resources pose major challenges to the city s development the study discusses that the implementation of iuwm principles by most urban planners and decision makers is acute with respect to stormwater management which is also a case in addis ababa despite continuous investments by the city of addis ababa traditional stormwater management system is challenged by impervious structures poor waste management and increasing frequency and intensity of rainfall events besides the poor understanding of the stakeholders to meet the urgent challenges of flash flooding for the city s nearly four million dwellers complicates the issue 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area the study was conducted in two case studies locally known as wereda that are the lowest local government administrative units in addis ababa it comprises of the new wereda 3 located in nefas silk lafto sub city with a boundary area of 461 72 ha and the old wereda 4 which is located in arada sub city with a boundary area of 102 82 ha fig 1 3 2 selection of the case studies the case studies were selected to represent the new and older parts of the city which in total covers an area of 530 km2 they were also selected to evaluate whether the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains in the old greater than 100 years old and new less than 30 years old parts of the city have similar trends and to conclude if improvement towards the new case site has been made in addition they were used to identify the key causes of flash flooding through linking with the hydraulic capacity of the drains the coverage of drains per given boundary area of the case studies and integration with the available road surfacing types were also the other reason to consider the two weredas 3 3 field survey digital base maps were obtained from the corresponding local administrations of the two studied weredas in 2017 the maps were engaged as a guide to follow the routes to be measured and to locate roads and drains to be surveyed the maps show all physical infrastructure and natural features e g rivers buildings open spaces prior to data collection ten data collectors fifth year undergraduate architecture internship students were trained about technical issues related to road pavements widths road network geometry and types of drains surveying instruments reading maps and encoding data into data collection sheets developed by the researchers then before the data collectors did the actual survey they practiced with the researchers at a pilot case site moreover as quality control the data collectors were supervised by the researchers and once a week there was a discussion among the data collectors chaired by the lead researcher data collectors transferred the data into a computer on a daily basis all roads and corresponding pavement types in the study sites were physically surveyed or measured including length width pavement type cross sectional profile of roads as illustrated in fig 2 in parallel the length as marked on the base maps type open closed geometry trapezoidal rectangular or circular pipe dimensions and construction materials of drains were physically measured the registrations were supplemented with photos both the road and drains data were analyzed using arcgis 10 3 1 all data in the present study were collected in three dry months from november 2016 to january 2017 3 4 questionnaires to investigate the challenges of stormwater management the extent of integration and understanding among the different stakeholders working directly or indirectly in stormwater management in addis ababa common and customized questionnaires were distributed the interviews were performed with 25 interviewees ranging from experts to head of organizations representing five organizations table 1 the stakeholders were selected purposively based on their competencies in stormwater management and the activities they are performing the questionnaires provided insight on challenges and gave information on the current stormwater management practices all were interviewed about the challenges of stormwater management and to what extent they collaborate each participant was asked three common questions including is your organization involved in stormwater management how do you collaborate with other organizations to manage stormwater what are the major challenges in stormwater management 3 5 evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of drains the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains was evaluated based on the corresponding contributing watershed delineation using pcswmm version 2013 eu 2d and areas and elevation of each drain using arcgis version 10 3 1 based on the length discharge slope and velocity of stormwater and contributing watershed area of each drain the dimension of the hydraulic capacity of each surveyed drain was evaluated tables 4 first the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains was designed and then the designed hydraulic capacity or discharge was compared against the existing drains hydraulic capacity which was actually surveyed from the field 3 6 stormwater runoff quantification stormwater draining from contributing watersheds into each of the surveyed 202 segments of drains 42 76 km in length was computed using the models eqs 1 through 4 adopted by the ethiopian federal urban planning institute fupcob 2008 each of the computation was performed using a design sheet developed by the researchers 3 6 1

side ditches commonly with road construction according to the interview made with the aacra which frequently works on stormwater management and related issues august 2017 and triangulated with field survey september 2017 drains are provided through traditional approaches by installing the largest possible drains size to accommodate worst scenarios the present study also revealed that there was no assigned engineer who only works on stormwater management moreover the respondents reported the nonexistence of drains net work map for the case studies and the entire city 4 2 drains roads and paving materials the paving materials and lengths of roads and the types length and geometry of drains together with their corresponding dimensions are reported in table 2 photos captured during data collection of representative road pavements and drains are presented in fig 3 the results in table 2 revealed that in wereda 3 only 59 of the roads were covered by drains the remaining 41 of them were without drains of the various types of road pavements 58 of asphalt 63 of cobblestone 43 of gravel and 87 of earthen roads were covered by drains from the total drains in wereda 3 nearly 45 of them were found open in parallel the results in table 2 revealed that in wereda 4 only half of the roads were covered by drains the remaining half of the roads were without drains of the total road pavement types 54 of asphalt 66 of cobblestone 51 of gravel and 50 of earthen roads were covered by drains from the total drains in wereda 4 nearly 36 were found open 4 3 hydraulic capacity of existing drains in wereda 3 and wereda 4 the hydraulic capacity of the 130 drain segments equivalent to 30 12 km in length in wereda 3 and 72 drain segments equivalent to 12 64 km in length in wereda 4 are presented in tables 3 and 4 in these tables only the existing capacity of the drains column 2 and 7 and the stormwater draining into these drains column 3 and 8 are presented to evaluate the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains against the potential stormwater draining into each existing drain from contributing watersheds based on table 3 the result of evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of drains in wereda 3 showed that only 14 equivalent to 4 324 km of the total surveyed 30 12 km of the drains were undersized this revealed that the drains are inadequate to convey the stormwater generated from the corresponding contributing watersheds resulting in flash flooding and infrastructure degradation conversely about 86 25 796 km of the drains were found oversized from table 4 the result of evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of drains in wereda 4 showed that about 28 3 522 km of the total surveyed 12 64 km of drains were undersized resulting in flash flooding and infrastructure degradation while more than 72 9 118 km of the drains were oversized 4 4 stakeholders involvement in stormwater management the responses of stakeholders and the existing stormwater management practices in addis ababa are reported in the following sub sections 4 4 1 aacra according to aacra stormwater is managed through traditional systems and drains are commonly provided as road side ditches to accommodate the stormwater from road surfaces addis ababa practices a separate sewer system nevertheless residents illegally dump wastes into drains that commonly reduce the hydraulic capacity of drains drains collect stormwater from various land uses and dump into rivers during designing drains generally the hydrologic and hydraulic features of the contributing watersheds to each drain were not considered aacra also reported that there was no a single professional who appointed to work with stormwater management rather stormwater is one of more activities 4 4 2 aaupi it is the only urban planning institute in the city however it only leaves space on plan for the provision of drains based on the road network map of the city as is done for all other utility lines 4 4 3 aabpcda according to aabpcda the purpose of greening road sides and parks is to increase the aesthetics of the city and for ecosystem functions e g climate regulation carbon sequestration and thus not for stormwater management aabpcda reported that gi is not integrated with stormwater management due to the fact that the stakeholders who directly or indirectly working with stormwater management have no integrated plan to work together each follows its own customary plan 4 4 4 aaepa according to aaepa the primary purpose of soil and water conservation activities at the upstream mountains which are the main sources of stormwater generation in addis ababa is to rehabilitate the mountains and prevent soil erosion and the occurrence of flooding on the city however mountain rehabilitation and soil conservation practices are not well integrated with stormwater management 4 4 5 aawsa according to aawsa rainwater harvesting would be an alternative water supply for the city but the treatment method needs advanced technologies as stormwater in addis ababa is highly polluted there are regulations to prevent the dumping of waste into drains but the absence of enforcement coupled with low level of awareness among the residents and stakeholders causes dumping of waste to continue 4 5 stormwater management challenges the identified challenges can be grouped as planning design and construction monitoring and evaluation collaboration and regulatory challenges as discussed below 4 5 1 planning challenges the process of drains planning is not led by a master plan as addis ababa has no city wide stormwater network master plan consequently drains planning is based on traditional and fragmented approaches the option of integrating other sustainable stormwater management systems e g rainwater harvesting retention and detention based solutions is absent in addition the focus on expanding gi is minimal where most industries institutions and residences prefer to increase impermeable surfaces additionally following longer roads most drains are installed from upstream initial point of a road to downstream final point of a road without distributing into nearby receiving system which would reduce the volume of stormwater travelling downstream moreover addis ababa has no integrated planning approaches from the context of stormwater management for example integrating stormwater management with urban land use planning gi development and other landscape plans is absent at any level the components of urban water water supply waste water stormwater managed separately by separate institutions landscape and urban planning instruments therefore don t offer possibilities to integrate stormwater management concerns and to promote sustainable stormwater management on a range of spatial scales 4 5 2 design and construction challenges based on field survey and questionnaires response the design of drains in addis ababa is carried out through segmental or fragmented approaches resulting in flash flooding it was found that drains are usually designed without hydraulic and hydrologic analysis most of the drains were found older than fifty years the largest parts of the drains especially in the older parts of the city were old and found filled with solid and liquid waste resulting in flash flooding moreover the respondents reported that the designers are less experienced to design drains due to inadequate exposure to such practices 4 5 3 monitoring and evaluation challenges drains are commonly provided by aacra but regarding monitoring and evaluation the city has no responsible institution this shows that the city focuses only on provision than on the management of the provided drains and associated facilities moreover no monitoring and evaluation on the hydraulic performance and need of stormwater management facilities reactive measures are taken mainly based on complaints it was also investigated that the number of studies in addis ababa related to stormwater is few which become a challenge to know the status and operation condition of drains there is no scheduled drains clearing time table 4 5 4 collaboration challenges the present study generally investigated that the five organizations table 1 which are assumed to work with the city s stormwater have no collaboration creating redundancy of activities and resources no clear roles and responsibilities and no defined activity performed by each of the institutions regarding stormwater management subsequently sustainability in stormwater management is unlikely due to the absence of monitoring and evaluation these institutions have no integrated plans 4 5 5 regulatory challenges the present study revealed that demolished construction materials were dumped inside drains and on flood plains reducing the hydraulic capacity of drains river through obstruction and silting up besides small scale auto garages dumping wastes from repairing and washing of cars directly into drains blocking the hydraulic capacity of drains the absence of legal instruments or policies to manage stormwater at household institutions commercial and industrial levels represent additional stormwater management challenge every one collects conveys stormwater from own compound to anywhere else without borders 5 discussion 5 1 existing stormwater management practices the traditional stormwater management practice in addis ababa complicates stormwater management because all the piped drains are planned to remove stormwater out of the boundary of the city this cumulates stormwater while draining from upstream at an elevation of 3100 m to 2100 m downstream joins the city s river water without treatment a study conducted by parkinson and mark 2005 in developing countries reports as stormwater often enters surface drains the unsystematic and fragmented provision of drains by different actors without collaboration further worsens stormwater management such practices failed to update the available stormwater management systems which might help to foresee stormwater related problems arising from rapid urbanization and increasing densification in addis ababa addis ababa doesn t consider the existing drains as assets implying that options are rarely unlock to design new drains or revise existing drains based on hydrologic and hydraulic data moreover addis ababa hasn t attempted to move to sustainable stormwater management systems while substantial cities especially in the global north are promoting sustainable stormwater management because of the unsustainable feature of conventional or piped stormwater management cettner et al 2014 furthermore such uncoordinated activities became a barrier to understand the spatial distribution as well as the coverage of the existing drains the gaps and the needs for future plans according to marsalek et al 1993 for sustainable stormwater planning and management the existing drains network map including the area coverage should be known because it is a basis for planning and identifying the existing gaps however in addis ababa it was unlikely to get such data 5 2 hydraulic capacity of existing drains in the studied case sites the findings of the present study revealed that the key cause of flash flooding in the case studies was not due to undersized drains but dumping of wastes into drains as more than 72 of the existing drains in both case studies were found oversized this is apparent evidence to the unsystematic and fragmented approach and the lack of critical hydraulic and hydrologic related data analysis during designing drains as revealed from the interviewees response moreover in weredas 3 and 4 of all the roads only 59 and 50 of the roads were covered by drains respectively revealing that the corresponding 41 and 50 of the roads were without drains which is still unsatisfactory in both cases this coupled with the noteworthy quantity of the unmanaged 25 of solid and 55 of liquid wastes where only 10 of the residents are connected to existing sewer lines are expected to enter existing drains as significant portion of the drains were found open fig 3 this together with the nonexistence of scheduled drains clearing time might further reduce the hydraulic capacity of the drains resulting in flash fluvial flooding 5 3 comparison of the two case studies when comparing the older and newer part of the city more drains were found on asphalt roads followed by gravel roads conversely the least coverage was found on earthen roads suggesting that the city administration was aware with the most susceptible type of road pavement to degradation as asphalt roads require significant drains concentration unlike wereda 4 more of the drains in wereda 3 were found open table 2 which could result in reduced hydraulic capacity of the drains due its vulnerability to dump wastes inside it murtaza 2001 thus in both weredas scheduled clearing time table is required before the beginning of the rainy season to maintain the designed hydraulic capacity of drains pertaining this the respondents reflected the nonexistence of scheduled clearing time table instead blocked drains are cleared based on complaints this could suggest that it is because of the blocked drains that more stormwater overtops during the rainy season leading to flash flooding in conformity with this studies conducted in mumbai arunachalam 2005 bangladesh murtaza 2001 and nigeria sridhar et al 2001 report that open drains filled with wastes were the major drivers of flooding due to reduced hydraulic capacity in both case studies the issue of sustainable stormwater management was lacked which is pertinent to cities like addis ababa which receives rainfall only for a maximum of 121 days nma 2016 implying that drains remain idle for the extended 245 dry days for example a study conducted by freni et al 2010 discusses that minimizing stormwater at source through nature based solutions can reduce the cumulative impact of stormwater draining downstream proportionally the size of drains which need to be constructed could be minimized consistently this could have significant contributions in promoting at source stormwater management in addis ababa in summary although the majority of the drains are oversized flash flooding is a major problem in addis ababa the findings of the present study revealed that in the new part of the city the undersized drains dropped to 14 when compared with the 28 undersized drains in the older part of the city this indicated that the customary and fragmented drains installation might be the root causes of over sizing the drains moreover due to the nonexistence of the original drains design models or equations from the responsible organization the present study employed the models which often used by the then federal urban planning institute of ethiopia to design drains which might be the other reason therefore understanding of the hydraulic capacity of drains is central to evidentially identifying the causes of flash flooding recurring every rainy season the hydraulic capacity of drains is evaluated whether to collect the stormwater from the contributing watershed and safely conveying to receiving systems or not drains are constructed to collect and safely convey stormwater commonly occupied by wastes leading to the reduction or total blockage of the hydraulic capacity of drains thus to prevent the obstruction of drains from solid and liquid wastes establishing clear waste management measures need to be integrated with stormwater management moreover to append the costly investment on conventional management systems municipalities need to integrate gi development e g road side greening parks development with stormwater management 5 4 stormwater management challenges the interview responses were proved by the field surveyed data and evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of the drains one of the articulated challenges was the flowing of stormwater over road surfaces and sides causing flash flooding and obstructing traffic movement most of the stormwater challenges could be simplified if the city administration gives special emphasis on stormwater management as they can be corrected easily for example timely clearing of the drains and focusing on sustainable stormwater management have imperative hand outs to addis ababa where it receives rainfall for a maximum of 121 days nma 2016 with an average annual rainfall of 1100 mm the absence of legal instruments to manage stormwater near or at the source opened a gap for significant stormwater to be conveyed from sources to receiving systems consistent with the present study goldenfum et al 2007 report that lack of legal instruments in brazil is a major challenge of stormwater management the deficiency of collaboration among stakeholders participating directly or indirectly in stormwater management further worsens stormwater management in the city this results in redundancy of resources and undermines the balance between the green and grey drainage approaches which is assumed to be the primary move toward sustainable stormwater management pauleit et al 2011 hamel et al 2013 than conveying through piped drains into downstream environment therefore besides establishing a single responsible institution which can only engage in stormwater management the city should establish a steering committee that could build collaboration among the five organizations in agreement with this jiusto and kenney 2015 report the significance of stakeholder collaboration to manage stormwater sustainably equally the city should integrate the different greening soil conservation and flood prevention activities with stormwater management promoting rainwater harvesting and retaining stormwater from upstream to downstream at smaller scales will significantly minimize volume of stormwater cumulating downstream the traditional piped stormwater management systems and the absence of existing drains plan reviews further worsen the challenges of stormwater management a study by marsalek et al 1993 reports the significance of contemporary and integrated planning for stormwater management which can be of helpful for addis ababa thus identifying the management challenges of stormwater is key to formulate appropriate management tools which can accommodate the rapid urbanization and increasing densification of cities in developing countries this is a roadmap for urban planners and engineers to consider the significance of stakeholder collaboration and community participation from planning to monitoring and evaluation furthermore integrated land use planning and institutional setup arrangements help to realize the need for minimizing the challenges of stormwater management 6 conclusion stormwater management in addis ababa is purely traditional with no additional purpose than collecting and conveying stormwater from source to rivers in terms of stormwater drains coverage the system is inadequate to manage stormwater within the boundary of the city as revealed from the two case studies the older parts of addis ababa has a stormwater drains coverage of 50 and the newer part a coverage of 59 showing unmanaged stormwater likely to create problems including flash flooding and degradation of other infrastructure of the total surveyed drains it was 63 and 81 of them were found open stone masonry in the older and newer part of the city respectively where piles of waste dumped into drains illegally the elevation of the city drastically decreases from 3100 to 2100 m a s l which complicates the management of stormwater as the volume of stormwater cumulates draining downstream with potentially reduced on site infiltration evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains in the case studies showed that more than 72 of the drains were oversized though flash flooding is a major challenge during the rainy season in addis ababa this could be attributed to the obstructed hydraulic capacity of drains from dumping of portion of the uncollected 25 of solid and 55 of liquid wastes thus it can be concluded that illegal dumping of wastes into drains coupled with undersized drains 14 in wereda 3 and 28 in wereda 4 of the total existing drains reduces the hydraulic capacity of drains this proved that the lack of hydraulic and hydrologic characterization during designing drains by the concerned organization might be the major causes of over sizing and under sizing drains capacity as also triangulated from the stakeholders responses generally stormwater challenges are associated with planning design and construction monitoring and evaluation and regulatory issues the drains were planned and designed unsystematically through segmental approach as the hydrological and hydraulic analyses were not properly considered besides the performance and ill functioning of the drains were not monitored timely furthermore the city does not have legal instruments that promote on site stormwater management and prevent the dumping of wastes into drains the poor collaboration among the different stakeholders is expected to widen the gap which might have rather reduced stormwater challenges equally important addis ababa should focus on stormwater management monitoring and evaluation to signalize the coverage and performance of drains city wide which are key parameters to identify the gaps for decision making and planning the present study highlights that addis ababa should focus on linking nature based solutions e g gi lid lsm wsud with the traditional piped system to promote sustainable stormwater management in practice a first step could be to address the challenge of the dichotomy between nature and structural techniques in engineering culture in parallel participating and considering influential persons including celebrities elders youths and women as frontrunners will assist to strengthen the efforts to move to sustainable stormwater management declaration of competing interest we confirm that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements

8424,study region addis ababa ethiopia study focus addis ababa is undergoing rapid urbanization with unprecedented high rate of road and building constructions resulting in a sudden upsurge of sealed surfaces and generation of significant amounts of stormwater the present study therefore aims to investigate the hydraulic capacity of existing drains and stormwater management challenges using detailed field surveys and stakeholders interview 469 road segments 74 km and 202 drain segments 42 76 km in two representative case sites confined in 564 54 ha boundary areas were physically surveyed new hydrological insights for the region results showed that 14 of the drains in new city parts and 28 in old city parts were in conditions inadequate for removal of stormwater resulting in flash flooding and infrastructure degradation in the associated watersheds further although more than 72 of the surveyed drains were oversized stormwater overtopping reoccur as a season to season problem ascribed to illegal dumping of waste into drains reducing their hydraulic capacity the challenges of stormwater management were related to lack of city wide drainage master plan absence of hydrologic data considerations during designing drains and weak enforcement on solid and liquid waste dumping into drains the present study recommends that building practices that minimize surface sealing and critical hydrologic and hydraulic considerations during designing drains and educating the local community and stakeholders regarding waste management keywords addis ababa ethiopia flash flooding hydraulic capacity of drains integrated land use planning stormwater runoff 1 introduction urbanization is characterized by a marked increase in built structures koehn et al 2011 such as streets walkways parking lots and rooftops creating sealed surfaces compared to the pre urban conditions these sealed surfaces result in increased stormwater runoff and a reduction in infiltration capacity gill et al 2007 miller and hess 2017 this is resulting in stormwater related flash flooding where most global cities are facing price and vojinovic 2008 this phenomenon is manifested by infrastructure and properties damage and the hindering of traffic movement the causes are poorly developed stormwater management system improper waste management and increasing impervious surface cover miller et al 2014 hoang and fenner 2015 to protect the costly built up areas from flooding and degradation and sustain the service life of infrastructure stormwater management is needed barbosa et al 2012 most developing countries like ethiopia have low coverage of urban stormwater management systems abeje 2004 providing neither on site management nor safe removal and discharge to natural receiving environments in ethiopia most municipalities assume that the majority of the road networks usually the arterial and collector roads should have drain fupcob 2008 however this goal is not realized beyond the planning level assumable due to high financial requirements lack of focus of city administrations and its single purpose approach to only collect convey stormwater out of the boundary of the city conversely some developed countries combine the conventional approach with the multiple purpose stormwater management alternatives such as stormwater management using green infrastructure rainwater harvesting retaining and detaining stormwater on site green roofing and porous pavements at streets and parking lots hoyer et al 2011 hamel et al 2013 hoang and fenner 2015 niu et al 2015 addis ababa the capital of ethiopia and the seat of the african union is experiencing a high rate of urbanization mazhindu and gondo 2010 with a population rise from 0 684 million in 1967 to 3 434 million in 2017 csa 2013 increasing more than five folds in fifty years like other developing countries parkinson and mark 2005 stormwater management is given less emphasis when compared with other urban development activities resulting in flash flooding and degradation of urban infrastructure the coverage of the unsystematic traditional piped drains together with their hydraulic capacity in addis ababa is largely unknown apart from few data collected in a small neighborhood in the oldest part of the city belete 2011 consequently the actual state of drainage in addis ababa including the hydraulic capacity and map of the constructed drains are anonymous understanding the contribution of wastes in reducing the hydraulic capacity of drains and causing flash flooding will help engineers urban planners and city decision makers to effectively prioritize responsive strategies taking addis ababa as case the present study was conducted to evaluate the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains by taking two representative case studies and investigate the management challenges of stormwater 2 review of stormwater management practices to control the historical urban grown stormwater problems various stormwater management systems have been developed by various researchers and applied in different countries some of these include low impact development lid water sensitive urban design wsud integrated urban water management iuwm sustainable urban drainage system suds best management practices bmps source control green infrastructure gi and landscape based stormwater management lsm currently these sustainable stormwater management systems are opted to deal with the limitations of traditional stormwater drainage systems the traditional system often focuses on collecting and conveying stormwater runoff burns et al 2012 directly to water bodies resulting in an exacerbating pollutant concentrations and hydrologic disturbance which ultimately degrading ecosystem structure and function roy et al 2008 conversely these sustainable stormwater management systems are with the objective to retain infiltrate and harvest stormwater at or near the source this is enhancing evapo transpiration and groundwater recharge and re use of stormwater may lead to a more sustainable solution to stormwater the practices of stormwater management solutions are reviewed as follows 2 1 lid it has been most commonly used in north america and new zealand since the 1970s fletcher et al 2014 to minimize the cost of stormwater management through integrating design with nature approach lid is characterized by smaller scale stormwater treatment devices such as bio retention systems green roofs and swales located at or near the source of stormwater runoff barlow et al 1977 2 2 wsud this system was started in the 1990s in australia fletcher et al 2014 to manage the water balance maintain and where possible enhance water quality encourage water conservation minimizing import of potable water supply through harvesting stormwater and the recycling of wastewater and reductions in irrigation requirements and maintain water related environmental and recreational opportunities 2 3 iuwm it combines the management of water supply wastewater and stormwater fletcher et al 2007 and considers the roles and interactions of the various institutions involved in urban water cycle management rogers 1993 iuwm considers all parts of the water cycle natural constructed surface and subsurface mitchell 2006 iuwm recognizes the water cycle as an integrated system both for human needs and ecological consider the local context accounting for environmental social cultural and economic perspectives 2 4 suds it was started to habituate in the uk in the late 1980s and in 1992 due to developments changing the approach to stormwater and the change of the scope for control of urban runoff fletcher et al 2014 it consists of a range of technologies and proficiencies used to manage stormwater which is more sustainable than conventional solutions hoang and fenner 2015 suds is based on the rationale of retroflexing the natural pre development drainage from a site 2 5 bmps it was primarily drafted in 1972 as part of the clean water act in the us and canada to prevent pollution using structural approaches it has a historical basis in the management of centralized wastewater treatment systems fletcher et al 2014 until it was matured to pollution prevention activities bmps encompasses both non structural and structural measure including schedules of activities prohibitions of practices maintenance procedures and practices to control plant site runoff leaks and sludge disposal usepa 2011 2 6 source control it was initiated in north america in the 1990s to mitigate increased runoff initially it was used to make a distinction between on site stormwater systems and practices to be used at or near to the source of stormwater generation contrary to larger detention ponds that are constructed at the downstream of a drainage system whipple et al 1983 moreover it focuses on stormwater pollution control with a strong focus on non structural or semi structural techniques ellis 2000 2 7 gi it goes far beyond stormwater management as its concept influences urban planning to maximize the benefits of green spaces center for

struck et al 2010 it is a sustainable stormwater management practices e g green roofs rain gardens permeable pavement that can detain and infiltrate rain where it falls resulting in reducing stormwater runoff and improving the quality of water bodies foster et al 2011 in contrast to single purpose piped based grey stormwater infrastructure gi uses vegetation and soil to manage stormwater at or near the source of generation the widespread adoption of gi is likely to take stormwater management towards a more distributed and at source application keeley et al 2013 2 8 lsm it relates the natural system with the hydrological features that encompass the landscape lsm considers the environmental context of a specific site within the matrix of the larger landscape it also recognizes the importance of temporal seasonal and microclimatic factors on ecological function sameer and zimmer 2010 the goal of lsm is to maintain the ecological integrity of healthy sites and watersheds the application of lsm requires a comprehensive understanding of natural and hydrologic features and functions this includes biophysical hydrological and hydro geological features and their interrelated functions modifying factors e g climate and temporal factors e g seasonal changes sameer and zimmer 2010 these nature based stormwater management solutions have substantial contributions to attain sustainable urban development in contrast in addis ababa the introduction and use of such sustainable stormwater management is absent though they are fundamental to efforts to improve the well being of the residents moreover the high density of structures improper open spaces management lack of enforcement complex social and political dynamics and limited available resources pose major challenges to the city s development the study discusses that the implementation of iuwm principles by most urban planners and decision makers is acute with respect to stormwater management which is also a case in addis ababa despite continuous investments by the city of addis ababa traditional stormwater management system is challenged by impervious structures poor waste management and increasing frequency and intensity of rainfall events besides the poor understanding of the stakeholders to meet the urgent challenges of flash flooding for the city s nearly four million dwellers complicates the issue 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area the study was conducted in two case studies locally known as wereda that are the lowest local government administrative units in addis ababa it comprises of the new wereda 3 located in nefas silk lafto sub city with a boundary area of 461 72 ha and the old wereda 4 which is located in arada sub city with a boundary area of 102 82 ha fig 1 3 2 selection of the case studies the case studies were selected to represent the new and older parts of the city which in total covers an area of 530 km2 they were also selected to evaluate whether the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains in the old greater than 100 years old and new less than 30 years old parts of the city have similar trends and to conclude if improvement towards the new case site has been made in addition they were used to identify the key causes of flash flooding through linking with the hydraulic capacity of the drains the coverage of drains per given boundary area of the case studies and integration with the available road surfacing types were also the other reason to consider the two weredas 3 3 field survey digital base maps were obtained from the corresponding local administrations of the two studied weredas in 2017 the maps were engaged as a guide to follow the routes to be measured and to locate roads and drains to be surveyed the maps show all physical infrastructure and natural features e g rivers buildings open spaces prior to data collection ten data collectors fifth year undergraduate architecture internship students were trained about technical issues related to road pavements widths road network geometry and types of drains surveying instruments reading maps and encoding data into data collection sheets developed by the researchers then before the data collectors did the actual survey they practiced with the researchers at a pilot case site moreover as quality control the data collectors were supervised by the researchers and once a week there was a discussion among the data collectors chaired by the lead researcher data collectors transferred the data into a computer on a daily basis all roads and corresponding pavement types in the study sites were physically surveyed or measured including length width pavement type cross sectional profile of roads as illustrated in fig 2 in parallel the length as marked on the base maps type open closed geometry trapezoidal rectangular or circular pipe dimensions and construction materials of drains were physically measured the registrations were supplemented with photos both the road and drains data were analyzed using arcgis 10 3 1 all data in the present study were collected in three dry months from november 2016 to january 2017 3 4 questionnaires to investigate the challenges of stormwater management the extent of integration and understanding among the different stakeholders working directly or indirectly in stormwater management in addis ababa common and customized questionnaires were distributed the interviews were performed with 25 interviewees ranging from experts to head of organizations representing five organizations table 1 the stakeholders were selected purposively based on their competencies in stormwater management and the activities they are performing the questionnaires provided insight on challenges and gave information on the current stormwater management practices all were interviewed about the challenges of stormwater management and to what extent they collaborate each participant was asked three common questions including is your organization involved in stormwater management how do you collaborate with other organizations to manage stormwater what are the major challenges in stormwater management 3 5 evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of drains the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains was evaluated based on the corresponding contributing watershed delineation using pcswmm version 2013 eu 2d and areas and elevation of each drain using arcgis version 10 3 1 based on the length discharge slope and velocity of stormwater and contributing watershed area of each drain the dimension of the hydraulic capacity of each surveyed drain was evaluated tables 4 first the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains was designed and then the designed hydraulic capacity or discharge was compared against the existing drains hydraulic capacity which was actually surveyed from the field 3 6 stormwater runoff quantification stormwater draining from contributing watersheds into each of the surveyed 202 segments of drains 42 76 km in length was computed using the models eqs 1 through 4 adopted by the ethiopian federal urban planning institute fupcob 2008 each of the computation was performed using a design sheet developed by the researchers 3 6 1

research institute esri after digitalization under the attribute tables of roads layer and drains layer fields containing roads code pavement and length of roads and drains code geometry and type of drains dimensions of each drain type and length of drains were added subsequently to evaluate the hydraulic capacity of drains and coverage of roads by drains the lengths of all roads and drains together with their pavement types were calculated separately using the calculate geometry tool from arcgis 10 3 1 4 results 4 1 current stormwater management practices drains are provided as road side ditches commonly with road construction according to the interview made with the aacra which frequently works on stormwater management and related issues august 2017 and triangulated with field survey september 2017 drains are provided through traditional approaches by installing the largest possible drains size to accommodate worst scenarios the present study also revealed that there was no assigned engineer who only works on stormwater management moreover the respondents reported the nonexistence of drains net work map for the case studies and the entire city 4 2 drains roads and paving materials the paving materials and lengths of roads and the types length and geometry of drains together with their corresponding dimensions are reported in table 2 photos captured during data collection of representative road pavements and drains are presented in fig 3 the results in table 2 revealed that in wereda 3 only 59 of the roads were covered by drains the remaining 41 of them were without drains of the various types of road pavements 58 of asphalt 63 of cobblestone 43 of gravel and 87 of earthen roads were covered by drains from the total drains in wereda 3 nearly 45 of them were found open in parallel the results in table 2 revealed that in wereda 4 only half of the roads were covered by drains the remaining half of the roads were without drains of the total road pavement types 54 of asphalt 66 of cobblestone 51 of gravel and 50 of earthen roads were covered by drains from the total drains in wereda 4 nearly 36 were found open 4 3 hydraulic capacity of existing drains in wereda 3 and wereda 4 the hydraulic capacity of the 130 drain segments equivalent to 30 12 km in length in wereda 3 and 72 drain segments equivalent to 12 64 km in length in wereda 4 are presented in tables 3 and 4 in these tables only the existing capacity of the drains column 2 and 7 and the stormwater draining into these drains column 3 and 8 are presented to evaluate the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains against the potential stormwater draining into each existing drain from contributing watersheds based on table 3 the result of evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of drains in wereda 3 showed that only 14 equivalent to 4 324 km of the total surveyed 30 12 km of the drains were undersized this revealed that the drains are inadequate to convey the stormwater generated from the corresponding contributing watersheds resulting in flash flooding and infrastructure degradation conversely about 86 25 796 km of the drains were found oversized from table 4 the result of evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of drains in wereda 4 showed that about 28 3 522 km of the total surveyed 12 64 km of drains were undersized resulting in flash flooding and infrastructure degradation while more than 72 9 118 km of the drains were oversized 4 4 stakeholders involvement in stormwater management the responses of stakeholders and the existing stormwater management practices in addis ababa are reported in the following sub sections 4 4 1 aacra according to aacra stormwater is managed through traditional systems and drains are commonly provided as road side ditches to accommodate the stormwater from road surfaces addis ababa practices a separate sewer system nevertheless residents illegally dump wastes into drains that commonly reduce the hydraulic capacity of drains drains collect stormwater from various land uses and dump into rivers during designing drains generally the hydrologic and hydraulic features of the contributing watersheds to each drain were not considered aacra also reported that there was no a single professional who appointed to work with stormwater management rather stormwater is one of more activities 4 4 2 aaupi it is the only urban planning institute in the city however it only leaves space on plan for the provision of drains based on the road network map of the city as is done for all other utility lines 4 4 3 aabpcda according to aabpcda the purpose of greening road sides and parks is to increase the aesthetics of the city and for ecosystem functions e g climate regulation carbon sequestration and thus not for stormwater management aabpcda reported that gi is not integrated with stormwater management due to the fact that the stakeholders who directly or indirectly working with stormwater management have no integrated plan to work together each follows its own customary plan 4 4 4 aaepa according to aaepa the primary purpose of soil and water conservation activities at the upstream mountains which are the main sources of stormwater generation in addis ababa is to rehabilitate the mountains and prevent soil erosion and the occurrence of flooding on the city however mountain rehabilitation and soil conservation practices are not well integrated with stormwater management 4 4 5 aawsa according to aawsa rainwater harvesting would be an alternative water supply for the city but the treatment method needs advanced technologies as stormwater in addis ababa is highly polluted there are regulations to prevent the dumping of waste into drains but the absence of enforcement coupled with low level of awareness among the residents and stakeholders causes dumping of waste to continue 4 5 stormwater management challenges the identified challenges can be grouped as planning design and construction monitoring and evaluation collaboration and regulatory challenges as discussed below 4 5 1 planning challenges the process of drains planning is not led by a master plan as addis ababa has no city wide stormwater network master plan consequently drains planning is based on traditional and fragmented approaches the option of integrating other sustainable stormwater management systems e g rainwater harvesting retention and detention based solutions is absent in addition the focus on expanding gi is minimal where most industries institutions and residences prefer to increase impermeable surfaces additionally following longer roads most drains are installed from upstream initial point of a road to downstream final point of a road without distributing into nearby receiving system which would reduce the volume of stormwater travelling downstream moreover addis ababa has no integrated planning approaches from the context of stormwater management for example integrating stormwater management with urban land use planning gi development and other landscape plans is absent at any level the components of urban water water supply waste water stormwater managed separately by separate institutions landscape and urban planning instruments therefore don t offer possibilities to integrate stormwater management concerns and to promote sustainable stormwater management on a range of spatial scales 4 5 2 design and construction challenges based on field survey and questionnaires response the design of drains in addis ababa is carried out through segmental or fragmented approaches resulting in flash flooding it was found that drains are usually designed without hydraulic and hydrologic analysis most of the drains were found older than fifty years the largest parts of the drains especially in the older parts of the city were old and found filled with solid and liquid waste resulting in flash flooding moreover the respondents reported that the designers are less experienced to design drains due to inadequate exposure to such practices 4 5 3 monitoring and evaluation challenges drains are commonly provided by aacra but regarding monitoring and evaluation the city has no responsible institution this shows that the city focuses only on provision than on the management of the provided drains and associated facilities moreover no monitoring and evaluation on the hydraulic performance and need of stormwater management facilities reactive measures are taken mainly based on complaints it was also investigated that the number of studies in addis ababa related to stormwater is few which become a challenge to know the status and operation condition of drains there is no scheduled drains clearing time table 4 5 4 collaboration challenges the present study generally investigated that the five organizations table 1 which are assumed to work with the city s stormwater have no collaboration creating redundancy of activities and resources no clear roles and responsibilities and no defined activity performed by each of the institutions regarding stormwater management subsequently sustainability in stormwater management is unlikely due to the absence of monitoring and evaluation these institutions have no integrated plans 4 5 5 regulatory challenges the present study revealed that demolished construction materials were dumped inside drains and on flood plains reducing the hydraulic capacity of drains river through obstruction and silting up besides small scale auto garages dumping wastes from repairing and washing of cars directly into drains blocking the hydraulic capacity of drains the absence of legal instruments or policies to manage stormwater at household institutions commercial and industrial levels represent additional stormwater management challenge every one collects conveys stormwater from own compound to anywhere else without borders 5 discussion 5 1 existing stormwater management practices the traditional stormwater management practice in addis ababa complicates stormwater management because all the piped drains are planned to remove stormwater out of the boundary of the city this cumulates stormwater while draining from upstream at an elevation of 3100 m to 2100 m downstream joins the city s river water without treatment a study conducted by parkinson and mark 2005 in developing countries reports as stormwater often enters surface drains the unsystematic and fragmented provision of drains by different actors without collaboration further worsens stormwater management such practices failed to update the available stormwater management systems which might help to foresee stormwater related problems arising from rapid urbanization and increasing densification in addis ababa addis ababa doesn t consider the existing drains as assets implying that options are rarely unlock to design new drains or revise existing drains based on hydrologic and hydraulic data moreover addis ababa hasn t attempted to move to sustainable stormwater management systems while substantial cities especially in the global north are promoting sustainable stormwater management because of the unsustainable feature of conventional or piped stormwater management cettner et al 2014 furthermore such uncoordinated activities became a barrier to understand the spatial distribution as well as the coverage of the existing drains the gaps and the needs for future plans according to marsalek et al 1993 for sustainable stormwater planning and management the existing drains network map including the area coverage should be known because it is a basis for planning and identifying the existing gaps however in addis ababa it was unlikely to get such data 5 2 hydraulic capacity of existing drains in the studied case sites the findings of the present study revealed that the key cause of flash flooding in the case studies was not due to undersized drains but dumping of wastes into drains as more than 72 of the existing drains in both case studies were found oversized this is apparent evidence to the unsystematic and fragmented approach and the lack of critical hydraulic and hydrologic related data analysis during designing drains as revealed from the interviewees response moreover in weredas 3 and 4 of all the roads only 59 and 50 of the roads were covered by drains respectively revealing that the corresponding 41 and 50 of the roads were without drains which is still unsatisfactory in both cases this coupled with the noteworthy quantity of the unmanaged 25 of solid and 55 of liquid wastes where only 10 of the residents are connected to existing sewer lines are expected to enter existing drains as significant portion of the drains were found open fig 3 this together with the nonexistence of scheduled drains clearing time might further reduce the hydraulic capacity of the drains resulting in flash fluvial flooding 5 3 comparison of the two case studies when comparing the older and newer part of the city more drains were found on asphalt roads followed by gravel roads conversely the least coverage was found on earthen roads suggesting that the city administration was aware with the most susceptible type of road pavement to degradation as asphalt roads require significant drains concentration unlike wereda 4 more of the drains in wereda 3 were found open table 2 which could result in reduced hydraulic capacity of the drains due its vulnerability to dump wastes inside it murtaza 2001 thus in both weredas scheduled clearing time table is required before the beginning of the rainy season to maintain the designed hydraulic capacity of drains pertaining this the respondents reflected the nonexistence of scheduled clearing time table instead blocked drains are cleared based on complaints this could suggest that it is because of the blocked drains that more stormwater overtops during the rainy season leading to flash flooding in conformity with this studies conducted in mumbai arunachalam 2005 bangladesh murtaza 2001 and nigeria sridhar et al 2001 report that open drains filled with wastes were the major drivers of flooding due to reduced hydraulic capacity in both case studies the issue of sustainable stormwater management was lacked which is pertinent to cities like addis ababa which receives rainfall only for a maximum of 121 days nma 2016 implying that drains remain idle for the extended 245 dry days for example a study conducted by freni et al 2010 discusses that minimizing stormwater at source through nature based solutions can reduce the cumulative impact of stormwater draining downstream proportionally the size of drains which need to be constructed could be minimized consistently this could have significant contributions in promoting at source stormwater management in addis ababa in summary although the majority of the drains are oversized flash flooding is a major problem in addis ababa the findings of the present study revealed that in the new part of the city the undersized drains dropped to 14 when compared with the 28 undersized drains in the older part of the city this indicated that the customary and fragmented drains installation might be the root causes of over sizing the drains moreover due to the nonexistence of the original drains design models or equations from the responsible organization the present study employed the models which often used by the then federal urban planning institute of ethiopia to design drains which might be the other reason therefore understanding of the hydraulic capacity of drains is central to evidentially identifying the causes of flash flooding recurring every rainy season the hydraulic capacity of drains is evaluated whether to collect the stormwater from the contributing watershed and safely conveying to receiving systems or not drains are constructed to collect and safely convey stormwater commonly occupied by wastes leading to the reduction or total blockage of the hydraulic capacity of drains thus to prevent the obstruction of drains from solid and liquid wastes establishing clear waste management measures need to be integrated with stormwater management moreover to append the costly investment on conventional management systems municipalities need to integrate gi development e g road side greening parks development with stormwater management 5 4 stormwater management challenges the interview responses were proved by the field surveyed data and evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of the drains one of the articulated challenges was the flowing of stormwater over road surfaces and sides causing flash flooding and obstructing traffic movement most of the stormwater challenges could be simplified if the city administration gives special emphasis on stormwater management as they can be corrected easily for example timely clearing of the drains and focusing on sustainable stormwater management have imperative hand outs to addis ababa where it receives rainfall for a maximum of 121 days nma 2016 with an average annual rainfall of 1100 mm the absence of legal instruments to manage stormwater near or at the source opened a gap for significant stormwater to be conveyed from sources to receiving systems consistent with the present study goldenfum et al 2007 report that lack of legal instruments in brazil is a major challenge of stormwater management the deficiency of collaboration among stakeholders participating directly or indirectly in stormwater management further worsens stormwater management in the city this results in redundancy of resources and undermines the balance between the green and grey drainage approaches which is assumed to be the primary move toward sustainable stormwater management pauleit et al 2011 hamel et al 2013 than conveying through piped drains into downstream environment therefore besides establishing a single responsible institution which can only engage in stormwater management the city should establish a steering committee that could build collaboration among the five organizations in agreement with this jiusto and kenney 2015 report the significance of stakeholder collaboration to manage stormwater sustainably equally the city should integrate the different greening soil conservation and flood prevention activities with stormwater management promoting rainwater harvesting and retaining stormwater from upstream to downstream at smaller scales will significantly minimize volume of stormwater cumulating downstream the traditional piped stormwater management systems and the absence of existing drains plan reviews further worsen the challenges of stormwater management a study by marsalek et al 1993 reports the significance of contemporary and integrated planning for stormwater management which can be of helpful for addis ababa thus identifying the management challenges of stormwater is key to formulate appropriate management tools which can accommodate the rapid urbanization and increasing densification of cities in developing countries this is a roadmap for urban planners and engineers to consider the significance of stakeholder collaboration and community participation from planning to monitoring and evaluation furthermore integrated land use planning and institutional setup arrangements help to realize the need for minimizing the challenges of stormwater management 6 conclusion stormwater management in addis ababa is purely traditional with no additional purpose than collecting and conveying stormwater from source to rivers in terms of stormwater drains coverage the system is inadequate to manage stormwater within the boundary of the city as revealed from the two case studies the older parts of addis ababa has a stormwater drains coverage of 50 and the newer part a coverage of 59 showing unmanaged stormwater likely to create problems including flash flooding and degradation of other infrastructure of the total surveyed drains it was 63 and 81 of them were found open stone masonry in the older and newer part of the city respectively where piles of waste dumped into drains illegally the elevation of the city drastically decreases from 3100 to 2100 m a s l which complicates the management of stormwater as the volume of stormwater cumulates draining downstream with potentially reduced on site infiltration evaluation of the hydraulic capacity of the existing drains in the case studies showed that more than 72 of the drains were oversized though flash flooding is a major challenge during the rainy season in addis ababa this could be attributed to the obstructed hydraulic capacity of drains from dumping of portion of the uncollected 25 of solid and 55 of liquid wastes thus it can be concluded that illegal dumping of wastes into drains coupled with undersized drains 14 in wereda 3 and 28 in wereda 4 of the total existing drains reduces the hydraulic capacity of drains this proved that the lack of hydraulic and hydrologic characterization during designing drains by the concerned organization might be the major causes of over sizing and under sizing drains capacity as also triangulated from the stakeholders responses generally stormwater challenges are associated with planning design and construction monitoring and evaluation and regulatory issues the drains were planned and designed unsystematically through segmental approach as the hydrological and hydraulic analyses were not properly considered besides the performance and ill functioning of the drains were not monitored timely furthermore the city does not have legal instruments that promote on site stormwater management and prevent the dumping of wastes into drains the poor collaboration among the different stakeholders is expected to widen the gap which might have rather reduced stormwater challenges equally important addis ababa should focus on stormwater management monitoring and evaluation to signalize the coverage and performance of drains city wide which are key parameters to identify the gaps for decision making and planning the present study highlights that addis ababa should focus on linking nature based solutions e g gi lid lsm wsud with the traditional piped system to promote sustainable stormwater management in practice a first step could be to address the challenge of the dichotomy between nature and structural techniques in engineering culture in parallel participating and considering influential persons including celebrities elders youths and women as frontrunners will assist to strengthen the efforts to move to sustainable stormwater management declaration of competing interest we confirm that there are no conflicts of interest acknowledgements
